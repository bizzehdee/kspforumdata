Sorry I\u2019m late.\u201D She poured herself a coffee and took a long drink. \u201CWe\u2019re short handed today - Jeb and Gene send their apologies - the Kerbodyne negotiations took longer than they hoped for and they\u2019re still on the road. Bob and Ribory are out at Foxham but Seelan agreed to stand in for them.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFigured my boys could fill up a swimming pool without me watching over them.\u201D A dour-faced Seelan sat down opposite Bill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m sure we can manage,\u201D Lodan said calmly. \u201CI\u2019ll brief Geneney myself and he can update Jeb.\u201D He gestured at the trophy wall and out of the corner of his eye saw Bill add a third sugar to his coffee. \u201CAs for Ribory and Bob, their immediate tasks are clear.\u201D He bent down and snapped open his briefcase, taking out a legal pad and a pen. \u201CLet\u2019s get started. Bill?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill bowed his head then straightened up. \u201CThe first bridge module passed all its flight-qualification tests and final checkout and preparations for launch are almost complete. If all goes to schedule, the module will be mated to the booster by the end of this week, with the first launch attempt set for the following week. The hub module redesign has been approved and now includes separate mounting points for the inflatables and their supporting trusses. However, diverting resources to the redesign has meant that construction work on the second bridge module is progressing more slowly than anticipated, although Bob\u2019s team and Ribory\u2019s team have both been working around the clock to get things back on track.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan made a note on his pad. \u201CHow far along is the second bridge module?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWelding on the main pressure hull and forward gangway is finished,\u201D said Bill. \u201CWork on the primary structures for airlock, docking adaptors, and observation ring is underway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeelan frowned. \u201CAll hands to the pump just to get the first couple of prototype modules built? We need to speed this up.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe do,\u201D agreed Lodan, \u201Cbut not by having everyone working around the clock, all the days of the week. As Probodyne found out to their cost, that\u2019s a highly efficient way of guaranteeing an accident.\u201D He glanced across the table. \u201CAs I\u2019m sure Bill will recall.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie rubbed her eyes. \u201CHaving Kerbodyne on board should help a lot. Steadler are still being cagey but Gene thinks they\u2019re coming round and Jeb\u2019s asked Shervin to have a quiet word with their CEO.\u201D She saw Lodan\u2019s raised eyebrow. \u201CHe and Gene persuaded Shervin and Halnie to visit Guardian Elton.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAhh.\u201D Lodan made another note. \u201CI imagine we can count on Stratus\u2019s continued support then. And I concur - any assistance that Kerbodyne can lend will be most helpful, not to mention Steadler. He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201CI would speak to them myself but Keller can be stubborn under pressure. Under the circumstances, I think Shervin\u2019s efforts will be more persuasive.\u0022 Lodan put his pen down. \u0022In the meantime, what does the White Cross Company need from me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Better communications,\u0022 Camrie replied instantly. She pointed at a map of Kolus on the wall which was decorated with sunburst arrangements of pins and thread, the centre pin of each sunburst connected to Barkton by thread of a different colour. \u0022Setting up local head offices helped to smooth out and coordinate our efforts across Kolus but now that we\u0027re expanding into Wakira and starting to think about expanding into Veiid...\u0022 Camrie held up her hands. \u0022I\u0027m used to working on a shoestring, Director. Kerm only knows that I\u0027ve been with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E for long enough. But lending aid to a trans-Regionality network of supply chains is stretching that shoestring dangerously close to snapping. If we could just...\u0022 To her surprise, she saw a faint smile cross Lodan\u0027s lips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Access the KSA Spacecraft Tracking Network? I think that is an eminently sensible suggestion.\u0022 Camrie opened her mouth, then closed it as Lodan continued. \u0022We have limited assets in Veiid, as I think you know, but excellent links to Wakira due, in no small part, to both the KSA and Rockomax starting their own tracking networks there.\u0022 A thoughtful look crossed his face, before he shook his head. \u0022Additional kerbosynchronous satellites over Veiid would be helpful but I can\u2019t see an immediately obvious way of commissioning them without drawing undue attention from the Finance Committee.\u201D Lodan regarded Camrie over the rim of his mug. \u201CI\u2019ll see what I can do. In the meantime, I believe that discreet use of the repairs and maintenance budget should be sufficient to cover any minor updates required for you to access the existing network.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie put her mug down. \u201CI\u2019ll need a map of all the Wakiran ground station sites. Bill?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAcross the table, Bill nodded, as Camrie began to tick off points on her fingers. \u201CI\u2019ll have a word with Sigbin and ask her to get in touch with our Wakiran office. I should speak to Doodlie too once we\u2019re up and running - he\u2019s got good friends at the local Groves who might be able to help with food donations.\u201D She looked at Lodan. \u201CYour Gamma tracking site is away from the worst of the fighting but the mountains won\u2019t be any use as a local head office location. Toralba will be close enough though and it was on my list of possible sites anyway. Do you known anyone at Gamma who could find - and run - an office there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot personally,\u201D said Lodan, \u201Cbut I shall make enquiries.\u201D He frowned. \u201CCome to think of it, Fercan might know. She\u2019s got good contacts at Beta and Gamma and as our chief telecoms engineer you\u2019ll be liaising with her for your communication requirements in any case.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRibory knows Fercan better than I do,\u201D said Bill, \u201Cbut we have at least met. I\u2019m happy to be her point of contact at White Cross until the Pool is operational. After that I\u2019m scheduled to be back on full-time flight training with James and Calley.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan\u2019s gaze flicked over the trophy wall. \u201CThat schedule might be somewhat flexible,\u201D he noted, \u201Cbut for now, I think that sounds like a plan. Camrie?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWorks for me, Director,\u201D Camrie replied. \u201CThank you, everyone.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ammonia jet blasts down a hundred metre, aluminium pipe. The pipe and it\u2019s surrounding water jacket are sunk into solid rock and designed to cool the ammonia from nearly two and a half thousand degrees, absolute, to a mere eight hundred or so degrees, absolute. At the bottom of the pipe, the jet is split four ways and diverted into a set of industrial-sized vortex separators where any entrained particulates are flung out for collection and analysis. A \u00A0set of chilled sand filters removes any residual particles before the, now substantially cooler, gas streams are recombined and drawn through a series of cold traps to condense the ammonia. Any remaining gases are removed for analysis and, if necessary, storage. Finally, the recovered liquid is distilled - the baking desert air is especially helpful for this - to save as much as possible for the next test, leaving nothing but a mildly radioactive ammonia brine behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe erosion rates are holding steady and the particle sizes are still consistent with ablation-deposition rather than spallation.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher peered over Hading\u2019s shoulder at the orderly set of graphs taped to his desk. \u201CLooks like the erosion is staying low - \u00A0and relatively even too, which is reassuring.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo obvious hotspots or mass flow outliers,\u201D agreed Hading. He rolled his eyes at Wernher\u2019s muttered reply. \u201CYou grumble about the stand instrumentation after every test, you know?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs you never fail to remind me. Calculations and inferences are all very well but I\u2019ll be a lot happier once we get to take that reactor to bits and have a proper look at it. All the same, that carbonitride coating is looking good.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHading shrugged. \u201CWe\u2019re running with ammonia as a coolant. It was the obvious place to start.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhich is another reason why I\u2019ll be happier once we can do a full inspection. If that coating is self-healing then it\u2019s going to give everyone a lot more confidence in the flight articles.\u201D Wernher gestured at the graphs. \u201CNow that we\u2019ve worked out the control drum synching and upped the propellant flow to something acceptable. I think we\u2019ve got something we could use for Starseed if we absolutely had to. It wouldn\u2019t be ideal - the Mark 2 would a lot better - but we\u2019ve got enough data from the month-by-month burn tests to put in front of Gene.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got the restarts down cold,\u201D Hading agreed. \u201CAnd the temperature cycling results on the spare fuel modules are looking promising enough that you might even persuade me that the data from the ground tests is telling us something about flight conditions.\u201D He leaned back in his chair. \u201C I really want to put the whole thing in a cryochamber though. Take the engine bell off, build a recirculation and cooling loop for the propellant and just put the reactor through it\u2019s paces in a cold-soak environment.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFor that,\u201D Wernher said dryly, \u201Cwe\u2019re going to need a bigger fridge.\u201D He tucked his hands behind his back and stared at the ceiling. \u201CAlthough if we extend the cooling jacket on the test stand\u2026 strip out the spare coolant loop from the air conditioning\u2026\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd risk a riot from every other kerbal in the team?\u201D Hading shook his head. \u201CWe\u2019re not upgrading the stand with the equipment we\u2019ve got on-site or are likely to get in the near future.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo. So we just keep plugging away at the test fires, until the KNSA decides to do something.\u201D Wernher stretched, his back popping loudly in response. \u201CSorry. It all helps though. We\u2019re validating your new neutron transport codes with every test and the more burns we can get out of this thing, the more round trips we can do with a single ship. Speaking of which - we should join the rest of the team. Don\u2019t want to be late for the launch.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey emerged from the air-conditioned gloom of the main test bunker into the blast-furnace heat of the morning sun. The KSA radio broadcast had already started and Wernher cocked his head at the sound of Nelton\u2019s voice requesting an update from one of her controllers. \u201CAhhh - excellent. Just enough time to get a drink before lift-off.\u201D He donned his sunhat and joined the throng of kerbals clustered around an outsized ice bucket. Grabbing a dripping bottle of water Wernher perched on the end of one of the gnarled cactus logs that served them as outdoor benches. He took a long drink before holding the ice-cold bottle against his forehead. Behind him, the steady call-and-response cadence from the Rockomax Space Centre drifted over the desert sands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWatch now as the Rockomax Type 6 booster, complete with its outsized payload fairing, soars into the afternoon sky.

He could watch Mallas talking to Jonelle - that\u2019ll prove she doesn\u2019t spike,\u201D anger flitted over Joenie\u2019s face, \u201Cpeople any more.

We\u2019ve done some pretty ridiculous things over the centuries it seems.\u201D\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CThe Age of Sail fashion for hanging-basket hats is my favourite,\u201D Jonton agreed.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CI don\u2019t think I saw those,\u201D said Mallas. He stared at the expanse of Kerm trunk making up one wall of the sleep room. \u201CDoes Jonelle share her\u2026father?\u201D He saw the other\u2019s reassuring nod. \u201CFather\u2019s sense of humour?\u201D\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJonton grinned. \u201CWhen it comes to that sort of thing, Kerm are more similar to kerbals than they\u2019d like to admit. Most of the time Jonelle is just confused by Elton\u2019s jokes and when she\u2019s not confused I get the very strong sense that she\u2019s just exasperated by them.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMallas chuckled as he got to his feet. \u201CI guess embarrassing parents are universal amongst sentient species.\u201D A thoughtful expression crossed his face. \u201CAnd I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s reassuring or depressing.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CA bit of both I think.\u201D Jonton thumbed a button on his water pedestal and the verandah doors rumbled open. \u201CAnyway - those worm traps we discussed? From Elton or Jonelle\u2019s perspective they ought to work but we\u2019d all welcome your advice before we start the experiments.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMallas sat down on the verandah step and began lacing up his boots. \u201CProvided the soil is reasonably healthy they should be fine. What are you using?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201COne part local clay, two parts clean sand, two parts sterile compost.\u201D Jonton adjusted his poncho and bent down to tie his own laces.

It looks fine - enough microorganisms to support the cultures you wanted but not so many that we won\u2019t be able to pick out them against the background tapestry.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CElton will know what he\u2019s doing,\u201D said Mallas, shooting Jonton an embarrassed look. \u201CBut even so, do you think he\u2019d mind if I ran some plates before we started - just to get an idea of what bacteria you\u2019ve got?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CBe our guest. I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019d mind and Joenie will probably be interested in the plates too.\u201D As Jonton watched Mallas retrieve a handful of stoppered sample tubes from his pocket and set to work, it occurred to him that the scientist probably never left home without them.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CThat should do it.\u201D Mallas tapped the edge of his final tube, dislodging the last crumbs of soil from its rim, before thumbing the stopper into place. \u201CSo what\u2019s the plan now?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CFerry\u2019s joining us for lunch in an hour or so and then he\u2019ll be giving us a lift up to Jonelle\u2019s Grove.\u201D Jonton disappeared inside the lean-to shed abutting the back of his hut and returned with a \u00A0wheelbarrow full of sand, a pair of trowels and a couple of lumpy looking bags resting on top. \u201CI thought we\u2019d put the rest of the morning to good use and dig out another couple of traps.\u201D Jonton gestured at the array of garden canes and string pegged out next to the test trap. \u201CI\u2019ve marked out the plots already.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMallas swung his legs over the edge of the verandah and dropped lightly to the ground. \u201CWorks for me. How deep do you want them?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAbout half a metre should be fine. It\u2019s better if you scrape the soil away in layers rather than digging too far in one go - much easier to spot any Kerm fibres that way.\u201D Jonton saw Mallas\u2019s apprehensive look. \u201CDon\u2019t worry - you can\u2019t miss them this close to his trunk. Any actual roots will be much further down, so anything that looks like a root will be a fibre. We\u2019ll start by digging out a trench around the edges, pack that with sand, then make a start on the middle. More sand at the bottom, soil on top.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMallas nodded, hitched up his poncho and squatted down by the corner of the nearest plot. Then, swallowing hard, he began to scrape gingerly at the soil. Jonton watched him for a moment then, satisfied, knelt down by the opposite corner of the plot and picked up his own trowel.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EKerbol was high in the sky, Elton\u2019s leaves casting dappled sunbeams over the ground, when Ferry walked around the side of Jonton\u2019s hut to find Mallas and Jonton brushing themselves down, satisfied looks on both their faces. A rectangular stripe of sand marked out a plot of earth, one side of which had been dug out into a shallow trench. As Ferry drew closer he saw that the bottom, and one wall of the trench had also been lined with sand. Jonton picked up his trowel and tossed it into his wheelbarrow, Mallas following suit.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CExcellent timing, Ferry, \u201CJonton called out. \u201CWe were just thinking it was time to eat!\u201D He walked up the steps onto the verandah and, with a groan, bent over to take off his boots. He waited for the others to remove their own footwear before padding into his sleep room and through to the kitchen. Crossing over to the fridge, he began pulling out an assortment of plates and bowls. \u201CTake a seat, folks - I\u2019ll be right with you. Lunch is nothing fancy I\u2019m afraid, just cheese and salad.\u201D\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJonton flipped open the bread bin and took out a cloth-wrapped loaf. \u201CBread was fresh baked this morning though. It\u2019s not a patch on Anlie\u2019s but it\u2019s not too bad if I say so myself.\u201D Piling everything onto a tray, he walked over to the kitchen table and began setting out lunch. Presently, the only noises to be heard were the clink of knife against plate and the quiet munching of hungry kerbals.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CIt tastes pretty good to me.\u201D Mallas buttered another slice of bread before crumbling cheese over the top and taking a bite.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CNot \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E as good as Anlie\u2019s,\u201D said Ferry tipping a hand back and forth. \u201CMy wife,\u201D he added, seeing Mallas\u2019 questioning look. \u201CBut you\u2019ve surely been listening to her.\u201D He folded his own laden slice into an impromptu sandwich and chewed on it thoughtfully. \u201CSo what do you do at the Berelgan?\u201D he asked Mallas, swallowing the last mouthful.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CI used to work on Kerm microchemistry,\u201D answered Mallas. \u201CTrying to figure out how Kerm do what they do on a molecular level. These days though - like nearly everyone else at the Berelgan - I\u2019ve been drafted into the xeno-ecology team for Project Starseed. \u00A0He grinned. \u201CWhich sounds pretty fancy but basically, we\u2019re trying to work out how to recreate a functional Kerban soil from scratch on Duna. Ideally without having to ship too much raw material out there to get things started.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAhh,\u201D said Ferry. \u201CWhich is why you came all the way out here to speak to Elton. Reckon he\u2019ll have forgotten more about making proper soil than you\u2019ll be able to figure out in a dozen years.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMallas nodded. \u201CProbably. From what he was kind enough to show me in Communion, I\u2019ve no doubt that, given time, he could show us exactly how he\u2019d solve our little problem in as much detail as we could ever want. The problem though, is that he can\u2019t tell us what we actually need to know. And that\u2019s really why I\u2019m here.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CNames,\u201D interjected Jonton. \u201CElton will find it quite difficult anyway to unpick exactly what he does to keep his soil balanced - most of it is so familiar as to be instinctive.\u201D He saw the sudden comprehension in Ferry\u2019s eyes and smiled. \u201CExactly. Muscle memory, and centuries of it at that. But even when he does unpick it for us, he only knows the soil biota as bundles of scents. We\u2019ll see those scents as different colours of course but that\u2019s not much help either.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CNo,\u201D said Ferry slowly. \u201CI can see that.\u201D He gestured at Mallas. \u201CIf your xeno-ecologists want to know what\u2019s knocking your soil bacteria out of balance, then having Jonton here tell you that it\u2019s all down to the little blue worms, isn\u2019t going to be that helpful.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CExactly,\u201D agreed Mallas. \u201CWe need a concordance. A reference book to cross-reference all the different Kerm colours against species names.\u201D The corners of his eyes crinkled in amusement. \u201CWhich is going to be interesting to compile given that we don\u2019t even know if different kerbals see the same species in the same Kerm colour.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFerry blinked. \u201CThat\u2019s\u2026 not a problem that I\u2019d have thought of,\u201D he said.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CMe neither,\u201D confessed Mallas. \u201CBut fortunately, Professor Erlin did. If Jonelle is willing, then we\u2019ll be able to have her and Elton run the same set of test plots, which\u2019ll give us one comparison.\u201D An unreadable expression flickered over his face. \u201CIn time, Kerm willing, we may have a second\u2026 if Erlin\u2019s Kerm awakens safely.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFerry stared at his plate, a troubled look on his face. \u201CHow is Professor Erlin?\u201D he asked at last.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CVery well,\u201D said Mallas, mopping his plate with a chunk of bread. \u201CBetter than that actually - I haven\u2019t seen him so animated for months.\u201D He blinked, \u201CIn a manner of speaking. Not the best choice of words there. Anyhow, he\u2019s the same as he always is when he has a new problem to work on - a mix of enthusiasm and frustration, although it\u2019s mostly been enthusiasm lately.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJonton leaned forward, an intent look in his eyes. \u201CHow\u2019s he finding his Grove management?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CI think he\u2019s finding it a lot easier than he expected from talking to you. I\u2019ve been speaking to Gusemy and \u2018sleep on it and it\u2019ll be fixed in the morning\u2019 is becoming a bit of a standing joke between them.\u201D Mallas saw the look on Jonton\u2019s face. \u201CIs that a good thing? It sounds like a good thing.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CI think so,\u201D Jonton replied. He leaned back in his chair. \u201CThe same thing happened to me when I was an-Kerm. Things would get fixed and I couldn\u2019t remember fixing them. At the time I assumed I was just getting better at Grove management - that I was starting to get things done without thinking too much about them. A sign that I was becoming a proper Kerm if you like. But it turned out to be a sign that Elton was taking over my duties.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMallas\u2019 eyes widened. \u201CSo Erlin\u2019s Kerm\u2026 already?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CIt sounds like it. Tell Gusemy to look out for any odd changes in Erlin\u2019s behaviour. It was coffee with me - I went right off the stuff until just before Elton awoke, then suddenly had a craving for it.\u201D Jonton paused. \u201CTell him to look out - or listen out - for anything unusual during Communion too. Enely described it as a kind of giant shimmering bubble, with something - or someone as it turned out - behind it, calling out for help.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIf anything Mallas\u2019 eyes grew wider. \u201CI will, Keeper.

He reached into his pocket and handed Joenie a handful of sample tubes. \u201CIt\u2019s about time I taught you to take proper soil samples anyway. You can help me prepare the bacteria cultures later if you like?\u201D\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJoenie nodded enthusiastically.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CBacteria cultures?

Plus lab coats and disposable gloves of course. Jonton was kind enough to lend me Joenie\u2019s old bottle warmer, which\u2019ll make a fine portable incubator. Apart from that, all we\u2019ll need is boiled water and household bleach for disinfecting everything after use and wiping everything down. We won\u2019t be doing anything fancy.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAnd they\u2019ll be doing the experiments in my hut,\u201D Jonton added. \u201CNot in the kitchen here.

In fact, after talking to Jonton over lunch, I think he\u2019s doing better than I imagined.\u201D Mallas glanced at Joenie who was trying to swing from the back door handle. \u201CBut perhaps we should talk about this later.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EEnely smiled as he followed the other\u2019s gaze. \u201CThat might be best,\u201D he agreed. \u201CIf you give me a minute, I\u2019ll come and help finish the trap that we were digging out before you arrived.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAnd I\u2019ll put the coffee on,\u201D said Jonton. \u201CAnd share the good news with Meleny.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELater that afternoon found Enely helping Meleny with the washing up whilst Jonton and Mallas sprawled on sack chairs watching Joenie rearranging her collection of sample tubes yet again. Adbas was curled up in his own chair, buried in a book, with a mug of rapidly cooling hot chocolate on a table next to him.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMallas stirred and reached for his own mug of \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E, a pensive look on his face. \u201Can-Kerm can still see,\u201D he said suddenly. \u201Ceven if they\u2019re effectively in permanent Communion. Or so I understand from talking to Erlin. So I can imagine how he would be able to compare the colours he\u2019s \u2018seeing\u2019 through his Kerm senses with the actual colour chart he\u2019s seeing through his eyes. But how does that work for everyone else?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CWith difficulty,\u201D answered Jonton. \u201CIt took Elton and I quite some time to get the hang of it but after a lot of practice we\u2019re at the point where we can both share my eyes, and see through them, during Communion. What I haven\u2019t quite worked out yet is how to hold both images - the outside world and Elton\u2019s mindscape - in my head at the same time, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get there.\u201D He drained his mug. \u201CI was going to give Joenie her first lesson with Jonelle tonight but that can wait.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMallas sat up. \u201CDon\u2019t feel you have to put them off for me,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019m quite happy to talk cactuses with Enely for as long as Meleny will let us. To tell the truth, I wouldn\u2019t say no to a lesson or two myself but from what you were saying in the car, I think Elton would find it easier to teach a stranger.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJonton looked at him apologetically. \u201CJonelle \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E getting a lot better but she\u2019s still a bit unsure about Communing with anyone apart from Enely, myself or Joenie. Anyway - \u00A0lessons are for the morning. We\u2019ve got a bottle of rather good two-year old prickleberry juice laid down that I\u2019ve been looking for a reason to open, or a jug of prickleberry cider in the fridge, if you prefer something with a little bit more of a kick. I\u2019ve got a Tiles set if you play, or we could challenge your lab assistant,\u201D Jonton waved a hand at Joenie, \u201Cand her friend to a season or two of \u003Cem\u003ERiver Race\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201COnly if you\u2019ve got a spare table to leave the board set up on. Can\u2019t fit a proper game into anything less than five seasons.\u201D Mallas grinned at Jonton\u2019s surprised look. \u201CAt least one of the student huts at the Berelgan has an almost permanent \u003Cem\u003ERiver\u003C/em\u003E board set up in the living room. One team got bored and wrote their own expansion rules after deciding that twenty season games were just too short. I\u2019ve lost track of where they\u2019re up to this term.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CWell then,\u201D said Jonton, rubbing his hands together. \u201COld \u2018uns vs young\u2019uns it is.

Quivering with anticipation, she flung herself onto the spare bed and wedged a pillow under her head, barely noticing the faint tickle of leaves against her scalp as the room around her vanished into the bright whiteness of Communion.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJonton propped a large square of blue cardboard against the foot of Joenie\u2019s bed then knelt by his daughter\u2019s side, checking to make sure it would be visible from where she was lying. Satisfied, he lay down on his own bed, settling into position under Jonelle\u2019s leaf cluster. No sooner had her leaf hairs burrowed beneath his scalp than he sensed Joenie\u2019s excited mental chatter and behind it, a vast confusion. He emerged over Jonelle\u2019s mindscape and immediately felt the confusion shift into relief as the young Kerm focused her attention on him.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u0026lt;it is early Jonton.

The page flipped over to reveal a grid of green squares, then again to display a grid of brown squares. \u003Cem\u003EThen you and Joenie will match the creature\u2019s colour to the right square on this chart.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe mindscape rippled and swirled, lightning flickering in the distance as Jonelle thought things over. \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;I can show Joenie the creature colour but I can\u2019t show her the squares.

Out of her sight, the waters twisted and turned, one moment a mighty river looping across the mindscape in great serpentine coils, the next a foaming brook galloping over a rocky bed, the next a delta of a hundred branching channels winding their way through mud and reeds. Abruptly, they reared up into a fantastical waterfall, an impossible twisted knot between soil and sky. Jonton heard a cry, then, just as abruptly, the waterfall collapsed back into a expanse of gently rippling water, meandering across the mindscape.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJoenie sat up, rubbing the back of her head.

He swung his vehicle round in a wide circle, past the yellow-and-black striped blast deflector behind the Starhawk, before coming to a halt on the taxiway, engine still running, ready to assist in case of an emergency.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CTest is rolling.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EVal scanned her instruments, hands automatically checking the connections between her pressure suit and the cockpit systems. She worked her shoulders, settling her flight helmet into place, it\u2019s built in ear defenders not quite able to muffle the idling J404 turbofans behind her back. A flicker of movement caught her eye and she glanced up to see the Starhawk start down the neighbouring runway, its mirror-polished fuselage reflecting the grey, overcast sky.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CCopy, Test - you\u2019re clear for take-off.

Ahead, the Starhawk began to accelerate, the watery blue hydrogen flame from its MACE air-breathing rocket engine flickering and blurred by its superheated exhaust. The experimental aircraft lumbered down the runway, its canards and short, knife-edged wings barely able to haul it off the ground before it ran out of asphalt.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CTest is airborne.\u201D The pilot\u2019s unruffled voice sounded clearly in her headset.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CChase is rolling.\u201D Val advanced her throttle to take-off power, the shriek from her own aircraft\u2019s engines climbing to a full-throated howl. She released the brakes and the Osprey leapt forward, with a surge of power that pressed her into her seat. The runway whipped past in a blur before falling away effortlessly behind her. \u201CChase is airborne.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EVal pulled the nose of her aircraft up into a climbing turn, feeling the anti-G system in her flight suit kneading her legs. The landing gear retracted with a thump, as she completed her circle and levelled her wings, eyes already scanning for the Starhawk.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CTest, Chase.

On the radio panel, another row of green lights began to stutter. \u201CCamera tracking and I\u2019m receiving telemetry.

Ramjets open - initiating phase two climb-out.\u201D Aboard the Starhawk, valves opened within the MACE, injecting vaporised hydrogen into the rapidly increasing flow of bypass air from the pre-cooler intake. Blue flame erupted from the ring of auxiliary burners around the two main engine bells, hurling the prototype spaceplane skyward.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EA warning tone sounded in Val\u2019s headset, the uppermost tracking light on her instrument panel turning from green to amber. She eased back on her control stick, pulling the Osprey into a steeper climb, and slid the throttle up to full rated thrust. Twin contrails burst across the sky as the two advanced aircraft screamed up through eight thousand metres.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFor a moment, the ranging bars on her tracking display slowed, then they began to spin past again, the Osprey unable to keep up with the rapidly climbing Starhawk.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CControl, Chase. Opening the gate.\u201D Val pressed her throttle lever forward, feeling it catch against its detent before pushing it down and through the gate into afterburner. Raw jet fuel sprayed into the J404s\u2019 exhausts, blazing, hard-edged flames erupting from their nozzles. The surge of acceleration shoved Val back into her ejection seat, an exultant grin lighting up her face. \u201CChase confirms two good cookers!\u201D\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CCopy.

The J404s responded with a will, hurling her aircraft into the darkening sky at over twice the speed of sound, afterburner gulping down fuel at a fearsome rate. Her eyes flicked from altimeter to fuel gauge to tracking display and back again, grin replaced by an intent expression.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CChase is holding.\u201D\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe Osprey broke through twenty kilometres, now beginning to fall behind the speeding Skyhawk. The bright glow of Kerbin\u2019s atmosphere gleamed from the trailing edges of its wings as it tore up through twenty-five kilometres, horizon curving away in all directions beneath its upwardly tilted nose. Then a warning light glowed amber on her instrument panel, accompanied by a two-tone chime in Val\u2019s headset.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CJoker fuel.
