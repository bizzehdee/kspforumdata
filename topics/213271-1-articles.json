The game worked relatively well for me for a while, then at some point recently, it will not let me load into a game. I can get to the title screen, try to load into a game, and the game will freeze on pumping sim once. After 15 minutes or so on this screen, my screen will change into this odd black and white screen, and the only user interaction that works is f12 to bring up or hide the aerodynamics overlays. Nothing else works (including esc.). I\u0027m on windows 10, and my computer has an\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003ENVDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti\u003C/strong\u003E (graphics card), an \u003Cstrong\u003EIntel Core i5-9400F CPU @ 2.90GHz\u003C/strong\u003E (processor), and \u003Cstrong\u003E8 GB of installed RAM\u003C/strong\u003E. No mods, I haven\u0027t found any workarounds that worked for me (though some people had some very creative ones on discord that didn\u0027t do the trick for me, like changing OS language to British English and deleting the AppData folder for the game (serious). I have seen other people have this same issue, and for all of them the screen they reached was identical. I have attached\u00A0an image of it to this post, although it looks slightly brighter than this in person. I believe this is related to the wider issue of people\u00A0being stuck on pumping sim once, but I don\u0027t know for sure how.\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230224223400_1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1078890642941415424/1079141247815528498/20230224223400_1.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T17:53:57Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 05:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by TheLastDefender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eweird formatting (fixed)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
