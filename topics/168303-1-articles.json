For a 30\u00B0 plane change you stay where you are (it\u0027ll cost slightly more than half your orbital velocity since it\u0027s the base of an isosceles triangle therefore 2x sin(15)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for launching into a different plane from the target orbit: first question is why? Second question is what\u0027s the angle difference?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re launching from somewhere other than the equator that is less than 60\u00B0 north or south, and want to reach an equatorial orbit, the best seems to be to launch due east, get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E up to the equator at the target altitude, and circularise there. You\u0027ll therefore do the plane change a quarter orbit after your lift-off point.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo the same goes for any orbit on a different plane: if for some reason you can\u0027t simply wait to launch into that plane, then launch as close as possible to it so that you reach \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E just as you cross the target plane a quarter orbit later.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd if it\u0027s more than 60\u00B0 difference, you definitely want to raise \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E well above the target altitude and just raise \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to the target altitude while changing plane, then burn retrograde to circularise at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you are definitely not wanting to get up to orbital velocity before the plane change, the maths is going to be a lot more complicated, but the principle is relatively simple if you compare to the most efficient way to land at that same point from your target orbit: just try to do the exact reverse manouvre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, to rendezvous with a craft on another plane, that really depends on how much of an angle difference there is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen doing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E rescue contracts, I\u0027ve found that ideally, you want to take off when the target is about 300-350km away. That means the target is near the end of the sea crossing before the land mass where \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is located. Or when looking at Kerbin, it\u0027s about an eighth of the span of the globe.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I\u0027ve found that that sort of relative distance works well on all of the moons and planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo meet a craft in orbit, you \u003Cu\u003Ereally have to rely on the map view\u003C/u\u003E once you\u0027re sure you\u0027ve cleared the terrain. Adjust your ascent so that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E is located where your path will cross your target\u0027s orbit. Use radial in/out to get the target intercept markers to line up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then once you\u0027ve lined up, the absolutely most efficient way to get into the exact same orbit as the target is to fire exactly along the target retrograde marker. No need for nodes or anything. By reducing relative velocity to zero exactly at the time you meet your target craft, you are making the most efficient burn possible by definition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: oh yeah, didn\u0027t really answer the question about predicting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E and time from launch. To be honest I don\u0027t know and I\u0027d be interested to know if anyone has good rules of thumb.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat will obviously change a lot depending on your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. In my experience, the place that I end up doing lots of refuelling, and therefore lots of ascents to orbit with fuel to join the orbiting station, is Moho. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on the way down to the surface is high, so I can consistently get from orbit to my desired spot on the surface for about 1050 m/s (approx 900 m/s actual \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E cost, plus 150 m/s gravity losses and steering to land next to my miner). On the way back up, with much lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, I seem to spend about 1200 m/s. So if I had a rule of thumb, it would be approximately 120% of orbital velocity without a major plane change.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTime to rendezvous is approximately one quarter of the orbital period of whatever you\u0027re meeting.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I\u0027d guesstimate that the cost of matching velocity with the target would be about 80% of whatever it would be if you were already in a circular orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for the Mun, with a 30\u00B0 plane change, I\u0027d guess 120% x 600 m/s to orbit and rendezvous, plus 250 m/s plane change (80% x 0.52 x 600) at the rendezvous, giving a total of 870 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited

However, remember that that 45\u00B0 apparent angle is mapped onto a sphere. In reality, where you lift off it will be a bit more than 45\u00B0 and it will fall as you climb. So I\u0027d aim for about 30\u00B0 compass heading on lift off and expect it to settle down to 45\u00B0 by the time I\u0027d got up to a couple of hundred m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you switch to map view as soon as you\u0027ve cleared terrain, you\u0027ll see \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E on your orbit as it starts lifting out of the ground.
