It won\u0027t be of any benefit.\n\nIf you have more than 4GB, it depends on whether you need mods, what OS you\u0027re running, etc. On Windows, it\u0027s not very stable, so should only be used when you need to exceed the 4GB address space of the 32-bit version. This is true if you use a lot of mods and no Texture Management tools. The 32-bit EXE is far more stable on Windows, so it\u0027s probably best to stick to it.\n\nPerformance wise, there\u0027s not a lot in it."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T16:28:07Z","Content":"No more then the 32bit .exe. But reguardless it is not something you can download. Atleast not anymore. The 64bit .exe is bugged so bad the devs pulled it from the game you download. \n\nThe 64bit .exe is practically exclusive to Linux users because that\u0027s the only platform it works on. ( and it works very well )"},{"CreatedByName":"Chowderpat","CreatedById":140156,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T16:29:59Z","Content":"Oh, okay. Never mind then, but thank you!"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T16:33:23Z","Content":"The data files are exactly the same for the 32bit and the 64bit version (at least on Linux), only the executable file to run the game is different (which has about 20MB on Linux, I don\u0027t know about Win). Expect a download size of about 650 MB, and about 2 GB of disk space after installation. \n\nBeware that the 64 bit Windows version of KSP is said to have quite a lot of bugs that aren\u0027t there with the 32bit version. Also, beware that many mods will not run with the 64bit Windows version, as modders don\u0027t see any reason to code around bugs in 64bit KSP. (The mods do run with the 64bit Linux version though, which is about as stable as the 32bit Linux version.)."}]}
