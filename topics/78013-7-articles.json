As a result, the spooling up won\u0027t be done from outside, it will be an intrinsic part of the engine simulation. As a nice consequence of that, multiple spool engines can be simulated as well. A further consequence of modelling transient effects is that compressor stall / surging is a thing that can happen, which should make for a fun time for users. Probably also going to include a realistic startup sequence as well, so engines that get shut down will either need to draw ElectricCharge to run a starter to get them running or will need a sufficient amount of air being rammed in the front to get it going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan (that I have so far) is that this will allow procedurally generated jet engines rather than requiring purely outside definitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done stuff similar to this for school, at least on the scale of what AJE currently does.

It\u0027s not just about the mass that could be brought in through the inlet, it\u0027s about the pressure rise in the compressor. In order to keep thrust constant with decreasing air pressure the pressure ratio would have to increase as the plane gained altitude; to maintain the same thrust at 15 km as you can get at sea level would require a 20 fold increase in compression ratio. Considering that most realistic high-speed jets already have a compression ratio of 13:1, you\u0027d boost that to 260:1, and the best we have in real life is around 40:1, for commercial turbofans that have very limited operating conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can also have fuel consumption handled properly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
