And without the borders or features that come with LazorCam. \n\nThis is essentially to help create a particular cinematic stylistic dream I have - so I don\u0027t have to work out how to fly particular manoeuvres (or launch) EXACTLY the same several times over using HullcamVDS cameras to capture the manoeuvre from different angles. My fall back would be to scale up a LazorCam window (which is a set and small resolution), or learn kOS or work out how to use MechJeb to repeat the same thing over and over again.\n\nI\u0027d even be happy with something like the Probe Control Room mod, but a black screen that only has three images of external cameras on the craft in question.\n\nHowever, I think it would be quite awesome to play the game mostly in map view with external mounted camera screens.\n\nAny help would be vastly appreciated!\n\nPeace."},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T16:24:48Z","Content":"Bump!\n\nI also really need this for my simpit build... only way I will be able to have side windows."},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T03:49:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I also really need this for my simpit build... only way I will be able to have side windows\n\nThanks for the bump. Thought no one would be interested! AlbertVDS said something like this might come in a future release, that was a few weeks ago. I did try hack LazorCam but my skills in that area are SORELY lacking and I wasnt sure of the legality with it even if it was only for a visual means to an end."},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T06:46:20Z","Content":"Basically the feature you are describing is like the additional windows you can open in microsoft flight simulator, although I think those can also be dragged out of the main window which would be a nice feature!"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T07:49:33Z","Content":"Yes. Having them across multiple screens would be ideal so that I can \u0027film\u0027 a manual flight from multiple angles instead of a scripted repeat. \n\nIn saying that I\u0027ve been getting my head around kOS now. But that is still a bit of a pain."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T17:11:28Z","Content":"Would be a nice addition to HullCam VDS, I can imagine using it to to mock-up an \u0022IVA\u0022 on, for example, a small rover."}]}
