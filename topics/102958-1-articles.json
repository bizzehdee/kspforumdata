And without the borders or features that come with LazorCam. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is essentially to help create a particular cinematic stylistic dream I have - so I don\u0027t have to work out how to fly particular manoeuvres (or launch) EXACTLY the same several times over using HullcamVDS cameras to capture the manoeuvre from different angles. My fall back would be to scale up a LazorCam window (which is a set and small resolution), or learn kOS or work out how to use MechJeb to repeat the same thing over and over again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d even be happy with something like the Probe Control Room mod, but a black screen that only has three images of external cameras on the craft in question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I think it would be quite awesome to play the game mostly in map view with external mounted camera screens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be vastly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeace.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T16:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBump!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also really need this for my simpit build... only way I will be able to have side windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T03:49:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mulbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mulbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI also really need this for my simpit build... only way I will be able to have side windows \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the bump. Thought no one would be interested! AlbertVDS said something like this might come in a future release, that was a few weeks ago.
