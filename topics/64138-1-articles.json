Both would be doozies though and would likely not be any fun. The idea is to get to Minmus and bounce around the biomes getting surface samples and EVA reports in all the biomes, then returning in the first mission. The second mission you\u0027d go back to Minmus and repeat that with all the science you unlocked, hopefully all the way up to gravioli detectors. Then you\u0027d go to Mun and do the same thing (which is more expensive) and then maybe if you\u0027re a Godly-tier player also go to Jool to get all the science there. Without too much extra dV you could probably stop at Gilly on the way home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore reasonable is to do it in 3 missions.

So the first mission uses thermal decoupler party tricks to visit Minmus and explore about 6 biomes (5 might be enough if you\u0027ve picked up science on the way and can charge enough for some crew reports, might even stretch to 4 if you do a bunch of EVA\u0027s in orbit and maybe do a Mun gravity assist with EVA). That gives you 1300 science so that you can unlock a line straight down to the GravMax, plus enough left over to grab the 2HOT and radial decouplers. If you did more then the minimum science you can also grab fuel lines and the little rockomax engine. Now it\u0027s much more straight forward to build a ship that will grab science from the Mun and Minmus. Either one massive ship to get everything in one mission (yet another party trick ship), or 2 more reasonable ones (do Minmus with the first one, use that science to reach docking ports, then build a second one for the Mun)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I also agree (somewhat) that it\u0027s much easier to do it if you avoid the tier-0 mission to Minmus though that pushes it to a minimum of 3 missions instead of 2. The only difference is I don\u0027t think need to limit yourself to just collecting stuff on the pad, you can get into orbit and do EVA\u0027s over a bunch of biomes without any tricks - Mk1 capsule, parachute and antenna then add 12x T200 fuel tanks and the LV-T30 engine. It turns like an oil tanker (just be gentle on the gravity turn) but it will get you into low orbit safely where you can do an EVA over all the biomes on the equator.

If I wanted 193 ships, each could only have 3 parts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E If you want a basic LKO orbiter, that\u0027s 15 parts or so (maybe 20 when you consider needing to \u0022decouple\u0022 it and support that decoupler) which means you can \u0022only\u0022 have 30 of those ships. However, you dont\u0027 need to get to LKO, you need to *land* on Minmus and Mun. I never made a teir-0 mun/minmus lander so have no idea the minimum parts, but I\u0027d guess 40 (just doubling the LKO cost) which means \u0022only\u0022 15 ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15 ships capable of landing in a biome on Mun or Minmus and returning safely to Kerbin for the crew report(s), eva report(s) and surface samples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15 perfect launches with crappy ships and the first few will have horrendous lag for the first 2.5km.
