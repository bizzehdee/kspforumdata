How many intakes do you use per engine and how many do you need compared to normal boosters? I might have to try this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kelmv","CreatedById":90534,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T07:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently testing 3 ramjet intakes and 4 nozzles. I\u0027m just playing with them at the moment to see what I can get them to do. I\u0027m mostly interested in their little ability to swap between air-breathing and rocket modes, but right now I\u0027m having FPS issues for some reason, so testing is slow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T07:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried this the other day after seeing Scott Manley do it as I was looking for a similar solution to what he did... it didn\u0027t work very well.

Might also help if I dumped the air intakes when I swapped over to a closed system to save drag and weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kelmv","CreatedById":90534,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T08:17:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, after ditching the boosters I was just about 700m/s shy of orbit.

Less fuel (2x 1 FL-T800 with three engines and three intakes). With a 4.5 ton load (undrained FL-T800 tank at the tip) it reached orbit with 267 units of fuel left in the center. 4 FL-T800s put 4.5 tons into orbit.

If you compare the mass that the air breathers can lift, the RAPIER (air mode) outperforms the jets simply because it can switch to closed cycle. In vacuum mode (only) it compares with the LVT30 \u0026amp; 45 (but these latter can lift more mass). The aerospike can haul less mass to a much higher altitude. See comparisons links in my sig line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the RAPIER is intended for SSTO use, their use as boosters only seems questionable given that the turbojet and rocket engines will yield better results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
