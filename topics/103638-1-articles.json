(I think it\u0027s the appropriate place).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo has anyone else experienced this? I have put hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game and while I have seen and experienced most of the bugs out there at various stages in my playing time I have up until now rarely encountered many to annoy me to this extent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current save that I\u0027m playing is my role playing Duna colonisation and what not. In the last 3 nights I have lost ships to complete darkness (3 now -.-) 2 ion aircraft and a pair of rovers all in interplanetary space. I have also built, rebuilt and then built AGAIN a habitat for my colony in the VAB and each time it greys out certain parts and becomes stuck with only the option to exit. I built them differently each time going for a different design philosophy just to try and beat this bug. Nope that doesn\u0027t work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then got bored of the bugs and went to start messing in a different save...I then had the urge (for some unknown reason) to try building the habitat again using the same design as I had before...and hey presto IT WORKS! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking that just my one save is cursed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else experience weird stuff like this before? Perfect in one save but try and do it in another and the kraken just gobbles it up and laughs?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I do realise that its just all coincidence or my executing stuff in a certain order to trigger this but seems too unreal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweety\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I was going to show you a pic of the start of the \u0027Great Colonisation\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gqDMBAm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gqDMBAm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T20:49:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found saves just did not migrate from 0.24/25 to 0.90... if it\u0027s a new 0.90 save, then might be salvageable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tweety","CreatedById":115567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T20:53:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh I\u0027m going to salvage it don\u0027t worry they won\u0027t be stranded.

It is starting to ruin my immersion into the whole roleplaying thing (that revert was a simulation to test something in kerbin atmo before sending it to duna).
