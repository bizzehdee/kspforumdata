Do you want the PP tank to attach to a part...or do you want another part to attach to the PP tank...In other words, whatever part you want to attach, THAT is the surface node you need to edit. Ex...if attaching a part to the PP tank...the other part\u0027s node_attach is what needs changed, not the PP tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your reply. First I want the regular PP tank that comes with the pack. Then I want a second version of the same which surface attaches inside other parts. Ex. If you surface a PP tank to another PP tank, they are connected at the surface. I want to make a new PP tank that can surface attach inside the stock PP tank. So it would be a child part I guess, I want the PP tank to attach to a part so to speak. Which is why I should make a copy and just edit the node_attach numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s probably coded in the module like you say. No matter how I change things the part seems to connect at the surface. I can angle it, rotate it and edit position along its lenght axis, but that\u0027s all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jrandom","CreatedById":74522,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T02:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like I\u0027m still seeing the \u0022shield reverts to maximum possible ablative material amount\u0022 bug.
