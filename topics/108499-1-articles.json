Been loving the game so far. I just have a rather simple question: how can I go about measuring temperature above a certain point? I cant seem to get over 10k metres with a plane, is using a rocket and orbiting around that point till I get exactly above it the only option?\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T00:15:48Z","Content":"It\u0027s an option yeah, or fit a rocket to your jet and power your way up from below ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Melkien","CreatedById":143600,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T00:17:38Z","Content":"I actually just thought about that!
