I managed, at long last, to do an orbital rendezvous between two ships, all by hand, and decided that it was the hardest thing ever and it was time for Mechjeb, where I remain to this day. I am currently in Career mode, and have been diligently filling out the tech-tree for some time. My position on it is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NUK83GK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NUK83GK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to luck out, as it were, pretty early on in the tech tree with the invention of the Shenqiang-3X rocket. When packing an unmanned, sensor-jammed drone, this hideous thing has enough delta-v - something like 7,700 - to reach virtually any planet in the solar system. I\u0027ve landed it on Minmus, Eve, Dres, and several times on the Mun, done a close-in flyby of Moho, and cruised around Jool with a high-space stopover at Laythe. This one design has gotten me a lot of mileage. We\u0027ve actually been through a few generations of probes, but the 3X rocket, with its 4 stages, nine solid boosters, and tri-adaptor has served me very well for a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MnTwee1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MnTwee1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat probe at the top, along with the last stage of the rocket, is the solid core of my plan. I want to send one of these - packing every instrument but the Mystery Goo, which I hate because you have to double it - to each of Jool\u0027s moons, and then another one to immerse itself in Jool proper. If I was a comparatively sane man, then I would simply launch them one at a time and target each moon specifically - but I am not a sane man, and have no desire to be. Here\u0027s a closer look at the probe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nvawATG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nvawATG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis probe will be necessary but not sufficient. For one thing, it\u0027s only packing around 1,300 delta-v, which is not enough to go from low Jool orbit all the way to Pol and Bop. Each probe will have to be designed specifically - the anatmospheric probes won\u0027t need as many sensor suites, and the Jool descender will need more on-board juice because it can\u0027t deploy panels. The one you\u0027re looking at was designed for Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ultimate intention is to get all five of these probes, engines in and noses out, attached to a Rockomax HubMax. They\u0027ll have to be taken up one-by-one into orbit. Sadly, these probes are too long to stick them \u003Cem\u003Eatop\u003C/em\u003E my launch vehicle, so I\u0027m thinking I\u0027ll need to graft them onto the sides and pop them off with either a docking bay or a radial decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQUESTIONS TO ANSWER:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E What sort of probes will I need for each planet?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E How can I get them attached to the central delivery body?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScholarBeardpig","CreatedById":88410,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T18:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh - let me put up an addendum to my prologue. I would prefer to do this last part \u0027as I am,\u0027 and make it the capstone by which I finish out the tech-tree. I have no doubt in my mind that I\u0027ll be able to nab the final 1,452 science needed to clear the lot with this mission. But if there\u0027s something I really need - and I don\u0027t feel that there is - then there\u0027s a bit more \u0027free science\u0027 I can lock up without really trying; I haven\u0027t sent all my instruments to either Minmus or Eve, to say nothing of mining a bit more on the Mun or investigating Ike or Gilly. I could even rack up more science on Mun or Minmus without missing my next transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, if at all possible, I would prefer not to do this. In theory, an SSTO spaceplane could be useful in getting stuff into orbit, but I\u0027ve never messed around with spaceplanes and would have to learn everything from scratch. Otherwise, I don\u0027t see the other tech elements as really being useful to me - on a planet without biomes, a rover is no more useful than a stationary probe, and I don\u0027t need those super-sized probe cores.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScholarBeardpig","CreatedById":88410,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T19:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, after much thought, I put together my array of probes. Let\u0027s take a peep!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FyqAlLI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FyqAlLI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my probe for Bop and Pol, by which I mean, \u0027here is the model of probe, one of which I will send to Bop, the other of which I will send to Pol.\u0027 Both moons have similar profiles, so I can use the same type of probe for each. It lacks atmospheric and barometric sensors, and has only 4,051 vacuum dV. The \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECheat Sheet\u003C/a\u003E says that I\u0027ll only need ~3700, so that should do me in a pinch. I\u0027ll go into my initial descent orbit with the nuclear thruster, and then switch to RCS for the final descent. I am, however, thinking that my descent might be a bit rough, so I\u0027m keeping the RCS tank on until the end, for lithobreaking. This probe will probably not stand upright, considering Bop and Pol\u0027s evil topography.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EnRwleQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EnRwleQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext is Tylo. Tylo\u0027s got a much more gravity, so I\u0027m relying on two stages to get me down. Both stages use the largest mid-gauge fuel tanks, which seems like a good idea - the first engine (nuclear) to boost me into an intercept, and the second (909) to get me safely down. Tylo needs 6,200 dV, and this guy\u0027s got 6,500 - we should be fine. However, because of the high gravity, I\u0027m expecting another hard landing, hence not even bothering with solar panels - they\u0027ll just shatter. All I really need to get down safely is the core and the instruments on the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GJrWwmE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GJrWwmE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s Val. Val\u0027s kind of an intermediary step between Bop and Tylo, so the probe (which is essentially the same) just needs less Delta-V to get it down. Because there\u0027s less gravity, we\u0027ll give it solar panels - it might come down in one piece! I took the Vall probe up into orbit to practice non-linear docking, and it worked out pretty well - I now have confidence that I can dock these guys one they get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/32FIwcD.png\u0022 alt=\u002232FIwcD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s Laythe. Notice the parachutes, notice the atmospheric sensors. Because of the chutes, I can just take it into the atmosphere and flick them on. I dropped the probe onto Kerbin from a million meters, and it performed perfectly even without using any brakes. I also learned valuable information about how the Seismic Scanner \u003Cem\u003Ecannot\u003C/em\u003E be used while in water, so I\u0027m going to have to shoot (chute? ha ha) for land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5NTwrdR.png\u0022 alt=\u00225NTwrdR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may be the most ill-made probe of them all. It has no engines, because I\u0027m counting on just using my RCS to boost me into Jool\u0027s upper atmosphere and aerobrake from there. You can\u0027t see it from this angle, but it actually has two docking ports - one at the bottom, and one on the other side of the materials bay. I\u0027m still debating how to attach 6 probes - my best guess is that four of them will be on a Rockomax Hubmax docked from the sides, facing forward, and that one will be docked at the tip. But that leaves me with one left over...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m quite happy with my probes. All of them are correctly action-grouped, and once I get them up and over, they\u0027ll be in good stead to go from low Jool orbit and get to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
