First of all I was sleeping, not avoiding anybody. I apologize for the delayed response. Second of all, looking at my 0.25 installation it appears that the RTG still exists in the part configurations under the same name as it did in 0.24. Lastly, when you say \u0022spam\u0022, how spammy are we talking here? That is an important distinction. Generally, Fine Print only checks for technology when a mission is generated, which doesn\u0027t happen all too often. You shouldn\u0027t see more than a handful of these each time you fire up the game, unless you are forcibly regenerating missions, in which case you should expect to see a log for each generation. It\u0027s trying to alert you that your installation might be busted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy intention was to make the power generator/antennae/etc all configurable things. The first step to that is actually in the ISRU configuration options. You can see the options for research there, separated by delimiters. The log is there with this future change in mind, to alert people when they are misconfigured.
