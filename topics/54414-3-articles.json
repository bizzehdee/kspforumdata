(If a round-trip gets stranded, a rescue becomes top priority.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I don\u0027t run with any life-support mods, but \u0022reasonable\u0022 accommodation should be made; no sending three kerbonauts to another planet in a single Mk 2 capsule.

It also receives supply flights \u0022off-screen.\u0022 Mun Base 1 started with three landers, each holding two pilots and four passengers; these have now been moved into a proper hab complex (with the landers retained as emergency escape craft, along with the shuttles that ferry new base parts down from munar orbit) and supplemented with additional base personnel, with the result that three of the hab\u0027s four wings are full and the fourth is given over to dining, laundry, etc. The base also receives supply shipments from home and is due to get a full science lab and greenhouse with version .23. (As an aside, empty orange fuel tanks from the base\u0027s tank farm have been rolled aside, partly covered with regolith, and converted into a safe if not particularly comfy shelter from solar storms.) Finally, the upcoming mission to Duna has the \u003Cem\u003EBrahma\u003C/em\u003E command and hab module, with four Hitchhikers plus two cupolas for a theoretical capacity of 18, but an actual crew of only 8; when they get to Duna, six will be going down in the lander (where another long-term hab will be waiting for them) while two remain on station. And even though I don\u0027t want the hard constraints of Ioncross, I went to the trouble of making non-functional copies of the oxygen tank module and recycler (themselves retextures of the large monoprop tanks; I could have just gone with that, but versimilitude) so that it \u003Cem\u003Elooks\u003C/em\u003E right.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-28T05:36:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2013 05:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Commander Zoom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T17:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few other things I forgot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Do not over think the craft.
