In this case, about friction and normal forces. Your \u0022frictionless\u0022 setup actually has a lot of friction. To test this, I recommend you stand on that board and have someone pull you with a force sensor. Yeah, the thing glides pretty well with no other force applied, but that\u0027s the whole point about normal forces. Your setup twists all over the place as it tries to move, which can apply a significant amount of normal force, comparable to that of a person standing on the board, easily. Yet, the amount of force it needs to propel itself is minimal. You add these together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you actually want a nearly frictionless setup to test this with, use a long rope to suspend your apparatus.

So a tiny force. To actually make that move, your coefficient of friction of the wheels needs to be lower than the ratio of the device\u0027s size by the Earth\u0027s radius. Good luck with that! You can improve your odds by rigidly clamping your device to the track with wheels coming from all sides, like roller coasters do; that removes the limit on the forward force, but not on the coefficient of friction. That can be gotten rid of by not letting the track follow Earth\u0027s surface, but simply being a regular circular track. Or get rid of the track and mount the device on one end of a long pole, with the other end of the pole on a pivot.

Now, you wrote those forces don\u0027t work without mechanical contact. So, let me try to show where the mechanical contact is (it is often elusive to see that). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat device by Mdrive is actually similar to a gyroscope fixed on a rail. Its axis can\u0027t move in relation to the rail. Now, if the rail orientation was to remain fixed in space, we would have no force exerted by the gyroscope (the force is proportional to the mass, the frequency of the gyroscope squared, and the axial angular tilt in time: so when the axis of the gyroscope is aligned with Earth\u0027s, or is let free to keep its orientation in space, force is 0). The fact is that the rail changes its orientation with the Earth rotation (think orientation in relation to space = fixed stars, not Earth). And because that device is mounted on that rail, and due to gravity must keep standing on it, its axis has to change orientation. Therefore the gyroscope exerts a force. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may not seem that large, and generally we don\u0027t need large forces with such devices (I would like, but it requires a lot of effort, to show how a gyrocompasss aligns itself - and requires only a matter of minutes to do so - only thanks to that minuscule force). But with a very limited attrition, even a minuscule force will make that device accelerate until attrition equals that force (in the hypothetical case of no attrition, that device will actually move until the force nullifies because of alignment of its gyroscope axis with Earth\u0027s). There are actually devices (think e.g. centrifuges to enrich uranium) so massive and fast that would exert a serious force just because of Earth\u0027s rotation coupling (so, need to be aligned to minimize force on the bearings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope the above is of help.

I found that interesting. If I got it correctly, his device moves (by whatever force) when the little gyroscopes on its arms are spinning; doesn\u0027t move when they are not. Of course attrition with the rail is the same in both cases, so the force seems to lie elsewhere. About your points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. What difference is with the device just sitting on the rail? I already wrote it must remain there because of gravity, so its axis will always keep oriented with the rail. Unlike a free gyroscope (free to orient itself) the arms of that devices are constrained to rotate around an axis moving with the rail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The total force of a gyroscope is 0 if the gyro is perfectly balanced. And Mdrive\u0027s device is certainly not. Actually, any rotating mass (like a gyro) has not one, but two pivots (the bearings). And what I believe is happening is, due to the combined spin of the gyroscopes and the arms, the force exerted on one of the bearings is different than the force on the other. To see what happens is rather easy, if you have a spinning gyro and use a force on one of its bearings, it will strongly react (and actually move, if not constrained). So, I have what I need (it is just pretty difficult to show).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe speed with which a gyrocompass aligns is mainly due to the quality of the device. No doubt that a toy hasn\u0027t that quality. The torque exerted is there, but attrition may limit the speed (and introduce other phenomena, like precession, that make for alignment errors; but this is really getting too far). Yes certainly, nowadays gyrocompasses use active controls to detect the torque and accelerate alignment. And, the more time is allowed for alignment, the better the result.
