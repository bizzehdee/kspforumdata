There is a science module in the game for such things, but at present it seems to be just a placeholder. I\u0027d like to make a few suggestions that would probably appeal to a larger audience than just those who admire the physics of the game engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A module that expands on the activities that would take place within the spacecraft. Examples follow:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1)Science missions during freefall/microgravity in the form of simple tasks taking place within the rendered spacecraft backdrop. For instance, Jebediah opens a compartment and removes a piece of gear to manipulate items a\u0027la \u0022Surgeon Simulator\u0022, but with flasks or blocks. Perhaps operating buttons or controls related to the externally-mounted sensory gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2)A Hydroponics lab module (for use on a Mun base) with basic plant-care elements that drive a progress bar, that would load data for transmission to Kerbin. Eventually it might be nice to render Kerbels without the helmets to simulate their being in an acceptable atmosphere for such things. And that would necessitate the need for an airlock mechanism in the game, perhaps for EVA purposes as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seshins","CreatedById":71258,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T07:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei like these ideas - i really want the IVA to be expanded aswell, SO you can almost imerse yourself in the reality of space travel to say... The Mun or Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I fear stock IVA and such may fall by the wayside with gameplay things like Multiplayernow in development\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T08:45:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIVA just needs some updates first. Theres still parts that don\u0027t have an IVA view(lab), and others that have placeholders(spaceplane cockpits).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of your suggestions are pretty extravagant and cool, but will take a lot of effort to implement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of KSP\u0027s weak points is lack of IVA things, currently the most interesting thing is looking out the window and reading gauges Let alone move around. Really though KSP\u0027s two pillars of game play never said anything about IVA, Building rockets and Flying them, so IVA is thrown to the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut hey, this is what mods are for right \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
