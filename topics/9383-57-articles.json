But even the base game itself seems to suffer from a memory leak. For me, MapSat on top of KW Rocketry (and a few smaller mods) uses up a pretty large chunk of that 3.3GB ceiling when you load a craft, but it still runs fine for an hour or two. Typically at that point though, memory usage has slowly climbed up, and then switching craft or exiting back to the KSC results in a crash from being out of memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue could be largely mitigated if the Unity engine could stream models and textures, similar to how other game engines such as Unreal or ARMA, after all, AFAIK these engines don\u0027t require 64-bit PCs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may for the time being, just remove the MapSat plugin and not worry about mapping for now. If I want to map a new body I will just replace the DLL until it\u0027s mapped, and then remove it again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-20T17:48:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2013 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Castun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
