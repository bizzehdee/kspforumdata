As i know by now, you have to prepare for extensive heat when reentering into kerbal. So i equipped my rocket with enough parachutes (Normal and Drogue) to savely land and also, to protect my chutes from heatdistruction, put some radiator panel on them. As i came back down i started my radiator panels seperately and waited for the heat to cool down, but form the moment the heat started my chutes where all red( would have been destroyed upon opening) and never became useable again, even after completely cooling down and reaching speeds below 700m/s. The only way to make them work again, was to turn the radiator panels of again, after cooling down..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see no logical connection there, since the chutes are not obstructed by the panels( on or off) when launching the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone know whats happening there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy would my radiation panel kill my chutes?
