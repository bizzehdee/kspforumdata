By landing on every planet and moon possible at the end of\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe mission and returning home to kerbin on the final mission. And, if possible, intersect and refuel at an asteroid\u003Cbr\u003E\nor two. The first launch in the mission, MMEM I, will land Jebediah, Bill, and the aforementioned kerbals on The Mun\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore going and landing on Minmus, and then hopefully succesfully return back to Kerbin.
