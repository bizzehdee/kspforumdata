This idea is to grab the asteroid with the center klaw, then line up with the center of mass and lock the pivot. Once that\u0027s done, the four outer klaws (which are mounted on extending hydraulic tubes) can be extended to also grab the asteroid and add rigidity. They were added one at a time, without using symmetry, so I should be able to extend them differing distances to accommodate the asteroid surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking the center klaw needs to extend farther ahead of the others; the hydraulics extend farther than I thought, so that wouldn\u0027t be a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other problem I haven\u0027t figured out yet is delta-v; fully fueled, that has about 6600 m/s, which will drop to like 300 when you grab a class D. So many fueling runs. Maybe used Nervs or Cherenkovs (have NFA), but oh so expensive in career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a related question; I don\u0027t see any real way to put any kind of fairing around the whole girder construction for launch; any suggestions for reducing drag?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!! \u003Cspan\u003E:-)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.chud.net/images/screenshot0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-18T03:30:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApologies, but you are about to run into one of the limitations of the game. It\u0027s a clever and cute ship, and if it were possible to grab an asteroid in multiple places at the same time, it would probably work fairly nicely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it doesn\u0027t really work like that. If you design a couple of craft with docking ports perfectly, and then fly them perfectly, you can get multiple docking ports to attach simultaneously. But klaws never do. And you aren\u0027t even trying to get them to attach at the same time.\u00A0The way the additional arms work will depend on your \u0022self interaction\u0022 setting for this craft. Because once the first klaw attaches to the asteroid, then the asteroid becomes just one more part on your craft. And a klaw on a craft will not attach to itself. It\u0027ll either pass through itself (meaning the asteroid in this case), or it will just bounce off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the reality is that if you want to grab an asteroid and not have the joint bend, then you should just use one klaw and then add an autostrut after you lock the joint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chd","CreatedById":78680,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-18T03:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm, ok - thanks!
