Talk about some nice life expectancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, just some thoughts and suggestions I thought I\u0027d toss your way, if you don\u0027t mind Fractal. Uranium Hexafluoride (UF6) is a Uranium compound used primarily during the enrichment process, but is not the form used as fuel. The form \u0022burned\u0022 in reactors is Uranium Dioxide. That is kind of neither here nor there however as the process you have in the game, of reprocessing your fuel for continued use, seems closest to the real world counter-part of Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel, where spent fuel rods are reprocessed and subsequently contain both Uranium and Plutonium isotopes which are re-burnt, reprocessed, and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the first suggestion is that the fuel in the reactors be renamed from UF6 to MOX Fuel. The second suggestion, which may be more trouble that it\u0027s worth as I\u0027m not sure how you have the code for this written at the moment, is in regards to being able to tell the current life-state of the reactor core in a more readable form. Simply put, adding a third fuel measure if you will, for the permanently expended fuel. The readouts thus would be: \u0022MOX Fuel\u0022, \u0022Depleted Fuel\u0022, and \u0022Waste Isotopes\u0022. As the MOX is expended it converts to Depleted, from this the player can immediately infer that 20% of that will be lost during reprocessing to the \u0022Waste\u0022 category.

Talk about some nice life expectancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, just some thoughts and suggestions I thought I\u0027d toss your way, if you don\u0027t mind Fractal. Uranium Hexafluoride (UF6) is a Uranium compound used primarily during the enrichment process, but is not the form used as fuel. The form \u0022burned\u0022 in reactors is Uranium Dioxide. That is kind of neither here nor there however as the process you have in the game, of reprocessing your fuel for continued use, seems closest to the real world counter-part of Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel, where spent fuel rods are reprocessed and subsequently contain both Uranium and Plutonium isotopes which are re-burnt, reprocessed, and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the first suggestion is that the fuel in the reactors be renamed from UF6 to MOX Fuel. The second suggestion, which may be more trouble that it\u0027s worth as I\u0027m not sure how you have the code for this written at the moment, is in regards to being able to tell the current life-state of the reactor core in a more readable form. Simply put, adding a third fuel measure if you will, for the permanently expended fuel. The readouts thus would be: \u0022MOX Fuel\u0022, \u0022Depleted Fuel\u0022, and \u0022Waste Isotopes\u0022. As the MOX is expended it converts to Depleted, from this the player can immediately infer that 20% of that will be lost during reprocessing to the \u0022Waste\u0022 category. The \u0022Waste Isotopes\u0022 (or perhaps \u0022Fuel Waste\u0022?) measure will give an immediate and easily discerned measure of how much of the reactor\u0027s life has been expended. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*shrug* Just something I thought I\u0027d toss out there, hope it can be of use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually wondered if anyone would ask about this. Because the reactors are used for both solid core and gas core designs, I didn\u0027t want to pick out a pick a fuel that would only be useful in the former design, as something like a MOX reactor would. I actually had in mind something more like a molten salt reactor using Uranium Tetraflouride (UF4) fuel, which is easily converted from Uranium Hexaflouride (you wouldn\u0027t want to store UF4 fuel). This design would have the advantage of being able to operate at very high temperature as a solid core reactor as well as having passive safety features. They also have much higher specific power than most traditional solid core designs, which is obviously good if you want to use it in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you then upgrade to the nuclear gas core, you are using the Uranium Hexaflouride directly as fuel inside a casing of solid fused silica, which is transparent to the UV radiation coming out of the ultra-high temperature reactor core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough these are more advanced reactor concepts, there isn\u0027t neccessarily any reason that Kerbals would go down the same path of developing nuclear technology. Our technology has been heavily influenced by the need for production of material for nuclear weapons, whereas Kerbals could easily have decided to focus on reactors better suited to civilian power generation first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought about using some kind of Thorium fuel cycle instead but eventually decided against it. I don\u0027t know if there is any point doing something with options for both fuel cycles but I\u0027ll certainly keep the idea on the table in case I or some else comes up with a good idea for something interesting to do with it. Thorium might be a better refueling option for certain celestial bodies so there may be mileage in that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cy-one\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cy-one\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI browsed the last few pages of the thread...
