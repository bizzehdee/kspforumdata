Add to that you could always start in DOS light if you had to. Pretty much all the games I played back then were DOS games so that explains why that compatibility was important. However, I did get pretty good at reinstalling the entire OS on a weekly basis near the end. So for that, good riddance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was what I loved about Windows 95 and 98. If it threw a fit you could always resort to DOS, circumventing whatever problem you had in the GUI. You could seriously hurt your Windows installation too, but that comes with the territory. The control was lovely. You get to do whatever you want to do, whether you break everything or not. Luckily, Microsoft is reinventing the concept with PowerShell.

Somewhat unstable. Right clicking on file icons will more often than not soft crash the OS back to desktop. Been that way since day 1. Too many auto updates resulting in a crash, roll-back and reboot. It also ticks me off to no end MS decided I should regard my own computer as their property in the sense that it can be a real PITA to give yourself the authorisations one would need. It was also Win 8.1 that on its own initiative changed my passwords to passwords I would use with MS services. That is a huge no-no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour installation sounds to be broken. A system that is constantly crashing and rolling back has severe issues, it is not normal for Windows 8 (or any other version). Regarding the authorisations, Microsoft sadly went down the path of software as a service. I advise you to avoid Windows 10 at all costs, because even though the actual technology is solid, you do give up even more control. You need to be running a dedicated server to gain full control over your updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T21:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a fan of Windows 7, but I\u0027m currently using Windows 10 and I do quite like it.
