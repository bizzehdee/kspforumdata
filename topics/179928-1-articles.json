We\u0027ve had basically no news in like 6 months, and many people have given up on it, seeing it as dead, but we can\u0027t be sure. It\u0027s unlikely that MH will come to console, but there\u0027s still a possibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agarwel","CreatedById":174538,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-21T11:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you consider the game support (after 2,5years sice original release date we are still waiting for the version without gamebreaking bugs), I would not expect the future content to be added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSupposedly they are still working on the update (but there is no info except that we will have a info \u0022soon\u0022).
