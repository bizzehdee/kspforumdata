Actually (can I go on a tangent for a second?), there\u0027s talk of a police group on Steam for devs, and there is more talk that trolls will flag a dev if he/she\u0027s one day off with the release of an update because of a funeral or something.

This just causes more dissapointment. There is no difference. It\u0027s actually worse how it is now... I don\u0027t see why they stick everything into major updates either. Why not quick bug fixes or other things that are heavily needed that can be done early and just release them and announce it when it is literally released... Instead they wait for part of a year for the game to function properly. Instead of just having major releases for game additions and not long awaited and needed bug fixes.

Considering you would never encounter this issue unless you yourself modified the game files to make the clamps available at the Level 1? \u0022I changed game files, now the game doesn\u0027t work as expected\u0022 is not really a reason to push a hotfix. I\u0027m not calling out you or that bug specifically, just using it as an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you load ships, that were created the previous day IRL, and caused the game to crash (1.0.3/1.0.4), that would be a slightly more pressing reason to push a hotfix. 3 new parts vs a game-breaking bug - which would you rather have to redownload the game for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see my point? You\u0027d wait for the parts over a bug that means you can\u0027t play the game because of something you did yesterday. Give me the bugfix now, I\u0027ll wait for the parts. That\u0027s exactly what Squad have done since KSP went into full release and out of alpha. 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 was 7 weeks probably because they had to reproduce and fix the bugs reported, the radiators and whatnot would\u0027ve come with them or without, they were likely ready to go since before 1.0.1 when the Nerv engine was stupidly hot.
