Example- Kerbin periapsis is right on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E but in 5d 2h 17m, you\u2019d need to put your observer (60*2)\u002B(1*17)=137 degrees west of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u2019ll also need to compensate for orbital inclination by changing your latitude to match the periapsis\u2019 position, and remember that once the asteroid hits the atmosphere it\u2019ll slow down due to drag so will almost certainly\u00A0drop short of the projected periapsis if said periapsis is deep in the atmosphere; the Trajectories mod might help with this especially for inclined orbits.\u00A0It\u2019s also possible that your ground observers won\u2019t be within active physics range of the asteroid as it flies into the atmosphere so they might not see anything, or the asteroid might get deleted when it drops below the minimum altitude in atmosphere (I believe it\u2019s 25km on Kerbin) so you might want to use Physics Range Extender to prevent this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maddog59","CreatedById":205063,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-25T13:50:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224036040\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204988\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221632563681\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197939\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AHHans\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, AHHans said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; if you have a vessel that is not connected (e.g. via a Klaw) to the asteroid but following that asteroid (in its \u0022wind shadow\u0022) while it enters the atmosphere: will it actually be shielded from atmospheric effects?
