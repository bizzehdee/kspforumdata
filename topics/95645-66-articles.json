To compensate, a special \u0022airplane\u0022 cockpit is introduced (like the special probe core) with SETIctt. It will use the model and texture of the ksp cockpit from 1.0 to 1.0.2 (not too pretty, but since the stock IVA is useable, it has a low RAM footprint and is easily available for redistribution). In terms of stats, it will have nearly no impact tolerance, low heat tolerance, no reaction wheel or monoprop, but the mass will only be 0.7 tons. I can\u0027t prevent it from going into space though.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Mk1 pod thus weighs 0.1 tons more than the new cockpit, but with much better impact and heat tolerance. Also the shape is better for reentry and it fits better with a monoprop tank on top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: Oh and the procedural monoprop values will change. A procedural tank with SETIrebalance holding 400 monoprop now will hold 500 in the future, with the same dry mass. Thus from being generally less dry mass efficient than stock, they will be a bit more dry mass efficient. All non-procedural tanks from the recommended pack will be balanced to that standard. It will create a \u0022mass symmetry\u0022, which is very useful for fuel switches. Essentially fuel tanks within the recommended mod pack will have the same wet mass per dry mass per volume, regardless whether they contain LFO or monoprop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will also forward this to CCF.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222378763\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002295645\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453745575\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002263614\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022randomone\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, randomone said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the reaction wheel nerf going to coincide with a requirement/highly-recommended promotion for that saturation wheel mod?

I think that there is small area near subsonic flight node where is just enough room for another 1 science node, for people that use PW to reduce part cluttering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock control surfaces, like fins, canrads, winglets are just fine to have, even with PW wings.

Unfortunately mass/temp changes could cause balancing issues in other areas, parts might go boom for no apareant reasons, wing mass/strength is already tweaked for people that use FAR and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, instead of messing with mass/temperature it might be better idea to have increased cost of those parts earlier in career, based on building level. 1.75 x base price for building level 1, 1.5 for level 2 and 1 x for level 3 building. Simulating better and cheaper tenology for part production at higher tech level building. That will make some RPG style choice for player, shoulod he spend so much money on expencive stuff or he will save money to buy better building, so he can have benefit from high money invest in R\u0026amp;D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, just a though, that is more a topic for a CFF than SETI.

The Stayputnik should really be used only for your first satellites; the real life Sputnik 1 probe, on which it is obviously based, was after all designed as a technology test; it\u0027s only real purpose was to be a trackable hunk of metal in orbit. To be honest, this also is the Stayputnik\u0027s only real use. Having it unlock where it currently does renders it useless, as at that point you have the capability anyway to send actual science probes into orbit. In a standard SETI game I end up never using the Stayputnik, which is a shame given it being a tribute to the world\u0027s first artificial satellite. In order to make it more competitive with the new starting probe core, I\u0027d suggest making that one a little bit heavier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovek","CreatedById":57251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T21:16:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYAY!!! I love that you nerfed the pods like they day. They were WAY overpowered and if you wanted to play without the OP pods, you had to manually click \u0022Turn Off Reaction Wheels\u0022 BAH! Now I can use that space for \u0022monoprop\u0022 for things like TACLS or extra hydrazine on long missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
