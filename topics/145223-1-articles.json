The Kerbal system would be based on the supposed \u0022Nemesis\u0022 star, a possible red dwarf in a weak binary system with the Sun (of course, for simplicity, there would be no barycenter in between the two). The rest of the stock system, aside from red-shifting the planets and scaling them up to real life, would be about the same as stock KSP planet-wise. Again, this would allow playing KSP with either a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E or KSS solar system, then being able to explore the other in the same save. And I know about Galactic neighborhood being able to do this, but this mod would just be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and stock system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
