Basically it\u0027ll disconnect in all three attachment points, and not everyone wants to do that. Lots of people still want to use the lower rocket section, and attach/detach the payload via docking ports on the fairing base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current version of the mod works great, but it\u0027s a lot of part clutter, because I have a separate fairing base for every combination of diameter and length. It\u0027s 18 fairing bases (6 different diameters/expansions, each with 3 lengths) and 4 nose cones. So someone suggested consolidating down to just 6 fairing bases (based on width/diameter only), and letting people choose the length by having 3 separate \u0022top\u0022 attachment nodes (which means three decoupler nodes instead of one). Gameplay-wise, this works great, but then I run into the VAB/SPH zooming-icon problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also looked at KW, and part of how they\u0027re doing it, is having more than one node with the same name. I can\u0027t do that, because each node needs to be uniquely named, to support the \u0022moduleJettison\u0022 fairing system (as I\u0027m going with all stock functionality, no actual mod code). Each length\u0027s set of fairing panels need to only appear when the correct top-node is used as the attachment point above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if I can\u0027t get a simple work-around (such as adding a useless/empty resource module or something), I\u0027m left with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Change how the whole mod works, by forcing people to use their own decoupler atop the fairing (and add decoupler functionality to the included nose-cones). It adds an extra step (and an extra part in most cases) for players to contend with. If they forget the decoupler, they\u0027re a bit stuck. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Since using only 2 nodes works fine in the VAB/SPH, but not 3 or more: Consolidate the short/medium lengths, but leave the long ones with their own bases (which technically could create an excuse to have a 4th length, since there will be extra fairing bases anyway). One nice thing about this, is that it would more easily keep the \u0022Lite\u0022 version of the mod in sync with the \u0022Full\u0022 version, since that one only allows 2 lengths of each fairing anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
