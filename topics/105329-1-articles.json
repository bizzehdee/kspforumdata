I can\u0027t even execute a gravity turn. Seriously, I can\u0027t. As I turn over, the rocket just lawn darts into the ground. Add fins? The thing wobbles.

The thing to watch out for is that all of the engines were rebalanced. So make sure you have enough thrust available, but not too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart your gravity turn a lot earlier, around 100m/s or so, and don\u0027t make it too agressive. Stay within about 5 degrees of prograde and try to control your speed on ascent, especially while low. If you get going to fast, or hang out around 270-410 m/s, you\u0027ll get a lot of drag on the front of your rocket which will make it easier to flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merandix","CreatedById":135352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T07:55:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, first up, take a deep breath. 1.0 didn\u0027t ruin the game, it just changed it, and humans happen to dislike change... especially if it means you have to relearn stuff \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took me a little extra effort to get the first rockets up into space.

Also, I see a lot of people still trying to limit their speed in the first 10 km... this is MUCH less of an issue, the atmosphere isn\u0027t nearly as thick. Also, try to keep your rockets smooth, putting stuff on your rocket on the front really means extra drag. And the draggiest parts always want to hangout on the back of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khazar","CreatedById":138578,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your craft is tall and slim, I would suggest to begin your turn at higher alt, where atmosphere is less dense.
