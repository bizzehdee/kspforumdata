Several (maybe 5 or 6) times I have gotten into the flight, used some time acceleration (though not necessarily during or just before the crash itself, but in case it\u0027s relevent), and somewhere along the way I get a CTD. Have yet to be complete the flight.\n\nbuildID.txt: build id = 008422015.05.01 at 21:02:12 CESTBranch: master \n\n[The craft I was flying](http://www./download/h899sj5052w4ccw/Lawn_Dart_A-1.craft) \n\n[The quicksave I was using](http://www./download/cj82tbw35fjva1v/010.sfs)\n\nI have not received any in-game pop-ups about the crash. Only a Windows error and/or a blink to desktop without any message of any sort.\n\n[output_log.txt](http://www./view/snrygf1rnzzdzu2/output_log.txt) - Not sure if this will work for you. I don\u0027t presently have time to re-enact that mission again and wait fo the crash to occur (sometimes took quite a while before the crash), but I did launch KSP one more time after the crash and load my quicksave to make sure everything still looked good. I apologize if I overwrote something useful, but I do still see a crash line at the end of the file, so maybe it retained the relevent information.\n\n[DxDiag.txt](http://www./view/zztdx2gfbbom50g/DxDiag.txt)\n\nThanks for looking into this."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:22:38Z","Content":"It appears to work on my install, it\u0027s possible you have a bad file, I suggest deleting the GameData folder and verifying your game cache in Steam, which will prompt Steam to re-download the removed files.\n\n![orJjo5h.png](http://i.imgur.com/orJjo5h.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rangoon","CreatedById":143028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:31:45Z","Content":"Thanks, I will try that. Did you happen to make it to the second site, and/or land the craft? most of the crashes occurred on the way to the 2nd site, or after the 2nd site before making it back to the space center. My route had been NNE to the one up there along the coast (can\u0027t recall the name), and then over to BHFH, then back to the space center. I think one crash occurred before the first site, maybe three crashes en route to the second site, and at least one crash after the second site.\n\nHopefully I will have time to try this again on Friday (a few days from now), so will try the file refresh and give it another go."},{"CreatedByName":"Khalkion","CreatedById":141657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T09:59:06Z","Content":"Most likely these crashes are from thermal gauges memory leak.

Is that indicative of the bug? I will try again, and if it crashes I will try further after disabling the overheating mechanic."}]}
