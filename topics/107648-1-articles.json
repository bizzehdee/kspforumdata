Several (maybe 5 or 6) times I have gotten into the flight, used some time acceleration (though not necessarily during or just before the crash itself, but in case it\u0027s relevent), and somewhere along the way I get a CTD.

I don\u0027t presently have time to re-enact that mission again and wait fo the crash to occur (sometimes took quite a while before the crash), but I did launch KSP one more time after the crash and load my quicksave to make sure everything still looked good. I apologize if I overwrote something useful, but I do still see a crash line at the end of the file, so maybe it retained the relevent information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/zztdx2gfbbom50g/DxDiag.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDxDiag.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for looking into this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt appears to work on my install, it\u0027s possible you have a bad file, I suggest deleting the GameData folder and verifying your game cache in Steam, which will prompt Steam to re-download the removed files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/orJjo5h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022orJjo5h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rangoon","CreatedById":143028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:31:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I will try that. Did you happen to make it to the second site, and/or land the craft? most of the crashes occurred on the way to the 2nd site, or after the 2nd site before making it back to the space center. My route had been NNE to the one up there along the coast (can\u0027t recall the name), and then over to BHFH, then back to the space center.
