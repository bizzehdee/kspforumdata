Is that intentional?  On the one hand, it makes sense, since the kerbal is getting a chance to stretch his/her legs.  On the other hand, it makes the timer kinda pointless since you can reset it at any time just by clicking the EVA button to go outside and then pressing \u0022B\u0022 to get back in.  Or am I missing something?\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ve observed something similar. My Jool-III ship, on a mission to Duna, had enough hab space for 4 kerbals for 6 years. When I first launched it, they had 6 years of hab time and 8 years of home time. That was a little weird but it was okay. It got weird when I undocked the 3-person lander to descend to Duna and visit Ike. Jeb, Bill, and Bob had 15 days of hab time and 7 years of home time as I expected after a year-long voyage, but Valentina, who now had command of a much larger ship, jumped up to 42 years of hab time and 43 years of home time. When the lander came back, Jeb, Bill, and Bob reset to the same amount of time they had at the beginning: 6 years of hab and 8 years of home. Valentina was really weird, with 5 years of hab time and 43 years of home time. I\u0027m not sure if this is even fixable or should be changed, but the point is that really weird things happen with hab time sometimes and that seems to be normal."},{"CreatedByName":"Wyzard","CreatedById":162363,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T05:55:38Z","Content":"Here\u0027s another quirk.  I have two kerbals in a Mk2 lander can, and each initially have \u0022hab\u0022 and \u0022home\u0022 times of 45 hours (the baseline 0.25 kerbal-months per seat).  I send one out on EVA to stretch his legs, and the *other* kerbal, still in the cabin, now has the whole place to himself.  That\u0027s a nicer accomodation \u2014 one kerbal in a space meant for two \u2014 so his \u0022home\u0022 time jumps to 90 hours.  Bring the one kerbal back inside and send the other out, and the same thing happens.  Now both kerbals are willing to spend 90 hours away from home instead of their initial 45.\n\nAs far as I can see, this should generalize: no matter how big the ship or how many kerbals in it, with a bit of airlock juggling you can give each kerbal the brief experience of being the *only* kerbal in the ship, and stave off homesickness significantly for all of them.\n\nThis seems kinda broken, but it\u0027s not clear how it could be fixed.  Maybe something related to loneliness, where kerbals actually *don\u0027t* like being alone in a big ship."},{"CreatedByName":"bounty123","CreatedById":142602,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T08:50:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, ruiluth said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E When the lander came back, Jeb, Bill, and Bob reset to the same amount of time they had at the beginning: 6 years of hab and 8 years of home.

Notably, I *didn\u0027t* get any messages about kerbals going on strike or returning to work when I switched to a craft whose EC meter was \u0022expired\u0022 before the switch, even though it was in the green last time I had focus on it, and was back in the green after switching to it.

Since you can EVA as often as you want, hab time can be extended indefinitely, and home time is the only real limit.\n\nSince I think all my posts in this thread have been about issues with habitation, I hope I don\u0027t come across as bashing \u2014 the hab stuff is interesting, and it\u0027s a big part of why I switched from Snacks to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS.  I understand the purpose of the separate hab/home timers and I think it\u0027s a good idea.  But it\u0027s a bit rough around the edges (understandably, since the mod is version 0.5), so I\u0027m trying to provide constructive criticism.\n\nOn a somewhat-related note, I\u0027ve noticed that some of the numbers in hab modules\u0027 right-click descriptions (in the editor\u0027s parts list) don\u0027t seem to match what\u0027s shown in the life-support status window, and I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s a bug or if I\u0027m just misunderstanding something.  In particular:\n\n- The PPD-12 cupola says \u0022Kerbal-Months: 1\u0022 in its right-click description, but its \u0022extra time\u0022 (BaseKerbalMonths) is zero, so it actually just gets the 0.25 kerbal-months per seat that all crewed parts get.  The status window in the editor shows its total hab time as just under 20 days, which matches what I get when I calculate it by hand.\n- Likewise, the Hitchhiker says \u0022Kerbal-Months: 25\u0022, but its BaseKerbalMonths is actually 21.  Together with 0.25 from each of four seats, its time is actually 22 months, or 660 days.  (That should be 1 year and 234 days, since a Kerbin year is 426 days, but the status window shows it as 1 year and 23**5** days.)  It seems like the \u0022Kerbal-Months:\u0022 number is calculated as if BaseTime is 1.0, when it\u0027s really 0.25.\n- The PPD-12 cupola also shows \u0022Crew Affected: 2\u0022 for the hab module even though its crew capacity is 1.  I can\u0027t tell how it\u0027s supposed to affect a second kerbal differently from a third and beyond; my best guess is that only two kerbals should get the 1.65 added to the multiplier, but when I add another crewed part (like a Hitchhiker or mk1 crew cabin), the status window seems to show all the seats getting the multiplier.  (However, a PPD-12 plus Hitchhiker shows just under 4 years and 69 days for a single kerbal, but calculating it myself I get 58.9625 months, which is just under 4 years and 6**5** days.  The hab time shown for 5 kerbals matches my own calculation.)\n\nBTW, \u0022multiplier\u0022 is misspelled \u0022multipler\u0022 in the right-click part description."},{"CreatedByName":"Jaxx","CreatedById":95312,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-15T03:36:03Z","Content":"\\*prays that a 1.25m stack recycler is added because the radial one man recycler offsets thrust torque\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"ruiluth","CreatedById":60427,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-15T03:52:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 50 minutes ago, Wyzard said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u2026except by clicking the EVA button.  ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)  Going out and back in seems to count as a vessel transfer, which resets the hab timer.

Are those meant to appear there?  I assume the parts still need to exist for backward compatibility, but i\u0027ve read that mods often assign deprecated parts to a nonexistent tech node (such as \u0022unresearchable\u0022) so they don\u0027t appear in the tech tree if they haven\u0027t already been unlocked.  So this is either a bug report or a suggestion, depending on whether the legacy \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E parts were intended to be hidden in the same way.\n\n(For the time being, I\u0027ll just suppress them with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E, so that they don\u0027t clutter my parts list in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.)"},{"CreatedByName":"jd284","CreatedById":139444,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-17T19:23:10Z","Content":"If you see these parts, then you\u0027ve started your savegame with an older version of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS that had them as \u0022official\u0022 parts.
