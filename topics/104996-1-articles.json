He is also planning on doing stock-like textures which isn\u0027t really my preference. I started the modeling for a duna direct part set a year ago, but in order to get the same shape for the hab and ascent vehicles (considering a 6 kerbal crew) while taking into consideration space requirements for life support, habitable pressurized living/working spaces,etc. you\u0027d be looking at 5M-7.5M parts (especially since the hab module has a rover bay at the bottom level).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Nice textures - looking forward to seeing the IVAs ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThanks! still need to play around a bit with the external coloring. Used the FusTek base color as a starting point since I like the clean neutral look of it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Please PMA \u003C3\n\nI\u0027ll consider it, though I wouldn\u0027t be doing stock-like. And it wouldn\u0027t be until after I complete 3 of the small sized station parts and IVAs.\n\nI have the bed prop model mostly finalized and started playing with the base colors. These are based on the space shuttle sleeping bunks. There all have personal lights, fresh air ventilation inlet (modeled similar to the ones on commercial airliners), ventilation outlet at foot of beds, and sliding privacy panels (not animated). Panel at foot of bed is fixed, and there are 2 intermediate sliding panel segments to close off the remaining open space (660mm). I plan on adding more personal effects inside the bunks later on as well.\n\n![Zkc3AZl.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/Zkc3AZl.png?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hellbrand","CreatedById":65742,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T04:56:58Z","Content":"hey maybe you and sumghai can worktogether to brin Iva\u0027s to The Fustek expansion !![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:45:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E hey maybe you and sumghai can worktogether to brin Iva\u0027s to The Fustek expansion !![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)\n\nHis IVAs already have the basic framework taken care of an now he is just populating them with props. I think he already has things planned and under control.\n\nI\u0027ve updated the list of planned parts to prevent overlap w/ the FusTek station parts pack. Began making IVA handle bars, and will have a few varying lengths. I\u0027m considering having the interior lighting dimmer for the sleeping module, and might just have small accent lighting turned on in each bunk (off in the occupied bunk), by the lockers, and by the hatch.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Just added AO and coloring for the handles, so they might might end up looking ok after I add final touches.\n\nFor the lockers I was thinking rounded rectangular handles, with a thumb push button to disengage the latch. otherwise I\u0027ll just draw the handles into the texture as some recessed type.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
