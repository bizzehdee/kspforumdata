All of this also applies to the small materials lab, you reset it the same way as goos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw if you have experiments stored into the MSL and you right click on it, you can boost the transmission science you recieve from the experiments a 25% (this also costs energy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope i helped u out \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Nedal ninjaed me, and yes the option is \u0022clean experiments\u0022 not reset stations \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-17T08:20:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2014 08:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tuku473\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T08:18:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClicking \u0022Collect data\u0022 I get a promt: \u0022the container will be inoperable\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nedal","CreatedById":104926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T08:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah.
