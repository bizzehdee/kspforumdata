However, (Also with Apollo) it is more beneficial to get into a parking orbit first as instead of a transfer window once a month (or so) you would have a transfer window every 30 minutes or so (Or rather once every orbit) So while you may not actually save any dV from circularizing first it does give you time to plan your transfer and perform any plane adjustments you need.
