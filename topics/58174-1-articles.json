For my experience so far, a small SSTO with RAPIER engines typically needs at least two of them due to the reduced thrust. What do you guys think of it in terms of SSTO design changes and such?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tada","CreatedById":57283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T23:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ve tested Sparrow by Zombiphylax in both RAPIER and classical version with turbojet and 2 LV-909 and performance is pretty similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain advantage of RAPIER engine is, that it doesn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t need as much intake air as a turbojet, so you can get much higher much more speed without spaming intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T02:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo add to what Tada said, the RAPIER if run in FAR, also runs a lot faster than the turbojet, you can push it to Mach 6 with ease, but the stock turbojet is struggling at mach 6... trust me I managed to get one to mach 6.4 and it was only making 5kn of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpenSpaceCorp","CreatedById":98977,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T03:12:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if the RAPIER engine indeed requires less intake air, it would be better suited for say, Laythe?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T03:15:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpenSpaceCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpenSpaceCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo if the RAPIER engine indeed requires less intake air, it would be better suited for say, Laythe?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt flames out the same as the turbojet, at 10% air required.

The Rapier has the same Isp-vs-pressure curve as the turbojet, and requires the same ratio of intake air per unit liquid fuel. So for a given amount of thrust, the Rapier uses the exact same amount of intake air as a turbojet. The intake mechanics did change between 0.22 and 0.23, so turbojet aircraft don\u0027t need as many intakes as they used to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T02:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn real simulation terms, I\u0027ve found that its easier for me to design and successfully orbit SSTO planes with RAPIER engines than is my use of a combination of jet and rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those interested, I\u0027ve updated my engine comparison chart by adding the two RAPIER modes (see the sig line).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: some people might be wanting their air engines to provide an electric charge.
