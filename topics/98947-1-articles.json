What kind of aero are you using: stock, NEAR or FAR? The answer you seek may be different depending on what you use. Also, which mods do you use. All relevant mods here - any plane parts mods, whether or not you use RCS Build Aid, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe, I use stock aero. And I use RCS Build Aid and Nav Utilities; those are the only relevant mods I use. And I successfully land on the runway quite often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the problem you\u0027re having - the craft tumbles out of control upon re-entry - is one I used to have. From the look of your craft, I can see two issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Your CoM is shifting aft of your CoL late in the flight due to burning fuel. Had a RAPIER-powered cargo plane with that exact same problem; once the oxidizer was gone, the plane was unstable. RCS Build Aid would help you out tremendously here (it\u0027ll show you where the CoM will wind up once the plane is out of fuel, and let you know EXACTLY where the CoM will be at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E You haven\u0027t got nearly enough lift for the mass of your craft. Ideally, you want the sum of the lift coefficients of all lift-generating parts to be roughly equal to the take-off-mass of your craft. From the parts I\u0027m seeing, you\u0027ve got enough lift for about a five tonne plane - and it weighs quite a good deal more than that, I\u0027d wager. You\u0027ve got more thrust than you need, which is why it makes orbit in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also might want to not fire up the engines until you\u0027re subsonic (below 400 m/s), and then don\u0027t fire them up past 2/3 throttle. That does help you maintain some control as you get further down into the soup. Of course, if the CoM has shifted that much, you\u0027re going to be in trouble no matter what.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to point you out to my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100334-SSTO-Why-u-no-fly?p=1546536\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1546536\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egeneral advice\u003C/a\u003E for new spaceplane users.

In many configurations, and it looks like maybe in yours, the farthest tank is in front and will thus drain mass out of the nose first. This means when you re-enter with a small amount of fuel left over, that fuel is usually toward the back of the spaceplane where it may be pulling your center of mass farther aft than you want. Sometimes you can solve this problem by simply transferring the leftover fuel toward the front-most tank before re-entering the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW you can also use this trick deliberately, by reserving some fuel to use as ballast during re-entry and pumping it around to wherever balances out the spacecraft.

One is intakes in front. All of your high-drag junk such as intakes should be well behind ur CoG. The other primary issue ive had is fuel draining asymmetrically. Many of my designs even to this day (due to aesthetic reasons) have fuel flow in such a way that they become unstable if the fuel isnt manually moved to the front tanks as im trying to reenter. They are stable fully dry, and fully fueled, but there is a problem i have where the front tank drains 1st, and needs tyo be refilled when reentering to keep the tanks behind CoG from sending you flipping all over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf these 2 arent an issue, there may be 1 more problem: lack of RCS/SAS control authority. I generally have a rule, of roughly 2 medium sized reaction wheels for every 10 tons. That and plenty of control surfaces. In general, while this one hasnt been too big of an issue for me due to my requirement for plenty of torque on any vessel, some of my \u0022more conventional\u0022 craft have had problems with this, when i tried to cut everything for pure dV, guess sacrificing too many reaction wheels and removing all RCS systems, wasnt exactly very good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
