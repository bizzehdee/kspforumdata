However, I then have to go over the surface of the planet, clicking on every leftover fuel tank, every rcs thruster that survived a rough landing, to get the surface cleared off. So, I\u0027d like to see a button in the tracking station that automatically recovers all of the debris on Kerbin\u0027s surface."}]}
