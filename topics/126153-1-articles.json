As a result they should have roughly the same amount of body lift and the cyan marker confirms this. Both markers are roughly the same size.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever the cyan bodylift marker on the first stage originates from the centre of the tank where it should be. The marker on the fairing originates from some imaginary point well in front of it, in the middle of nowhere. As a result the torque from this vector is way stronger as it should be making this rocket nearly impossible to fly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSQUAD: [B][SIZE=4]FIX THIS!!![/SIZE][/B] as it makes no sense whatsoever.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T11:56:29Z","Content":"\nThis issue is known and it will be fixed in the next update, but demanding a fix in large bold capital letters is not helpful, not appreciated and will not get this fixed any faster.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThread closed.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T08:58:10Z","Content":"\nAs a side note of help for those who stumble upon this...there is a fix available in my StockBugFix add-on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCheers,\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Claw\n"}]}
