But where it got interesting was how I reacted. I had no thrusters on the lander so, in the absence of any other options, I EVA\u0027d the pilot, dived off the lander, and started thrusting upwards with the EVA pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI survived. Bounced, but survived. Moments later my lander nearly crashed on top of me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmittedly being stranded on Eve in your EVA suit isn\u0027t a particularly noble ending to the mission, but what I\u0027m wondering is... how did I survive? Was it just a bug? Or is the air-pressure on Eve so high that it reduces a Kerbals terminal velocity \u003Cem\u003Ejust enough\u003C/em\u003E for the EVA packs thrusters to make a fall from orbit survivable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone up to skydiving from Even orbit to find out?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T01:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it is the increased air resistance, and is the gravity different?

I had something similar to that happen once, I had this big ol\u0027 rocket making its way through the atmosphere when it decided to go crazy and start spinning. It got closer and closer to the ground and I was expecting it to just completely blow up upon impact but it ricochet and ended up thrusters-down and began making its way upwards again. A few moments later it crashed again and blew up for good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BurningSky93","CreatedById":2316,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T13:19:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Markus Reese\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Markus Reese\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELess gravity will mean the better pack effectiveness.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve has 1.7x Kerbin\u0027s surface gravity (1.7 G). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETerminal velocity is determined by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV(t) = ((2mg)/(rho A C))^0.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere V(t) is terminal velocity, m is mass of the object, g is acceleration due to gravity, rho is density of the fluid through which the object is falling (in this case the atmosphere), A is the objects projected area and C is the object\u0027s drag coefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, m, rho, A and C can be assumed to be equal on Eve and Kerbin (the Kerbinaut\u0027s mass, falling area and coefficient of drag won\u0027t change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if Eve has an acceleration due to free fall of 1.7x Kerbin and an atmospheric density 5x greater than Kerbin, and terminal velocity is directly proportional to the root of acceleration due to gravity and inversely proportional to the root of the atmospheric density, then terminal velocity on Eve is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1.7/5)^0.5 = 0.58 times that on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully my math is correct, do please correct me if I have made a mistake though\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dikkjo","CreatedById":32555,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T18:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAtmosphere density on Eve is much bigger than Kerbin, so rho change indeed and so do the drag.
