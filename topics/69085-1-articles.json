This drive is able to translate the spacecraft at 3 times the speed of light, but needs to be charged slowly over a day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spacecraft was to depart to Jool orbit at exactly 1.00 AM the next day. At that moment, the distance between Jool and Kerbin is around 1 light-hour(light takes an hour to go from Kerbin to Jool). Since the Alcubierre drive enabled the spacecraft to travel at 3c, the journey time is expected to be 20 minutes, from the spacecraft\u0027s perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 1.00 AM, the spacecraft launched itself to Jool, and arrived there at 1.20 AM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy questions are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If the moment the spacecraft deactivates the warp drive, it deployed a telescope and aimed it at Kerbin, would it literally see an image of itself, still charging the Alcubierre drive, which disappears after 40 minutes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If the KSC happened to be in view of both the spacecraft and Jool at the time of launch, would it see the spacecraft disappears completely at 1.00 AM, and suddenly appearing at Jool at 2.20 AM?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If a space station orbiting Jool happened to be in view of both the spacecraft and Kerbin at the time of launch, would it see 2 spacecrafts, one suddenly appearing at 1.20 AM, and the other still orbiting Kerbin, which disappears at 2.00 AM?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. If another spacecraft orbiting Kerbol was close enough to the mid-point of the FTL trajectory of the travelling spacecraft, what would it see?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"R0cketC0der","CreatedById":106748,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T07:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
