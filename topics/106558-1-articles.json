(The Hatches were to the side of the Lab, not towards the bottom).\n\nSo i guess there\u0027s still the Bug in there that made Kerbals explode when dropping small heights out of an unusual position.\n\nAnd to add to the party, Kerbals EVAing sometimes start their EVA floating (ungrabbed) in low gravity, sometimes leading to very hillarious situations like being cannon-shot from the vehicle into open space or simply encountering funny unexpected situations.\n\nCould you check the code? I guess this isn\u0027t intended at all. IMO, EVAing Kerbals should spawn grappled to their craft no matter what, and Kerbals dropping to the ground should not explode at such small heights."},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T05:30:15Z","Content":"This has already killed 2 kerbals for me.\n\nIt seems that landing a pod with the flat side down causes this."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T07:29:23Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had it happen to the pilot disembarking an Aeris 3A or Ravenspear Mk1 parked on grass at random spots on Kerbin, doing survey contracts, when they have needed to get out and poke the ground. Not a particularly frequent, or repeatable on demand event, but more than isolated incidents, frequent enough to be quite annoying and make me paranoid about quick save."}]}
