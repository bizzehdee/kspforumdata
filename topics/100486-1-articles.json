It would also be incredibly neat to be able to interact with switches and buttons on control panels. Furthermore, IVAs would be incredible if you could do so on EVA (an IVA-EVA. LOL ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)), and especially on the surface. \n\nWhat would you guys think to be good things to speculate on with regards to IVA?"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T02:37:07Z","Content":"Since frizzank is doing IVA, I demand a cornbeef sandwich in each IVA he makes."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T03:23:41Z","Content":"Nothing will change in regards to interacting with IVA, IMO.

A little bit ago I suggested a cut-away view that would let you easily see and move resources about a vessel and also let you move kerbals from one module to another without EVA. It would also be cool if as part of an experiments overhaul you could do more things from inside the science module, like loading materials into the materials bay, processing experiment results, managing data more clearly, etc.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T15:43:02Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T20:20:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I hope it\u0027s possible to take a vessel to orbit only sitting in the pod which means more info display and more interactive buttons\n\nIt is now, it\u0027s just difficult to judge ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nIt\u0027ll be interesting to see the inside of the Mobile Processing Lab.
