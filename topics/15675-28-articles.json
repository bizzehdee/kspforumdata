It certainly must be possible in the game code, as all orbiting bodies go on rails, and you can put your ships, however large, in orbit of a moon, and it goes on rails.

The region of space around a satellite there a sub-satellite can exist is called the Hill sphere. Outside the Hill sphere, a sub-satellite would be lost from its orbit about the satellite.\u0022 (exerpt)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, the Moon could have a sub-satellite. If we look at a system of the Earth, Moon, and a sub-satellite, the same idea as above applies. The Moon has its own Hill sphere with a radius of 60,000 km (1/6th of the distance between the Earth and Moon) where a sub-satellite could exist.\u0022 [EDITED]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...tidal effects require thousands or millions or more years, depending on the system, to cause the loss of a sub-satellite.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in a sense you are right, however the same rules apply to any orbiting body (given enough time, Kerbin should should de-orbit). Even then, a moon orbiting a large moon within the program would not de-orbit for months or even several years of continuous running at 100000x (which I believe is rails, and hence would not de-orbit anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems realistic to me to allow at least large moons that are sufficiently far from their parent bodies to have their own \u0022natural\u0022 satellites in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Shadownailshot \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI talked about this very subject extensively back when I first got on the forums, and basically even the best ways to allow for ships to have their own SOI would not be practical, in the opinions of most people who know more than I do about these subjects with relation to the game. Even if your largest, most massive, rockets had SOI, the attractive force would be so low that a single burst of rcs from a single thruster would de-orbit any satellite of the rocket. Even a 500 meter asteroid would be extremely difficult to orbit (though not impossible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a part \u0022gravity\u0022 plugin that was working in .14.4.
