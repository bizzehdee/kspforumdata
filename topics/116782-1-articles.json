Here\u0027s the WIP thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129666-WIP-Mk3-Hypersonic-cockpit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129666-WIP-Mk3-Hypersonic-cockpit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I still have to do some work on the texturing, but the basic shape and scaling is fine. However everything else is all messed up, the attachment nodes are just floating around and the collision mesh is just a box at the moment. It also does some pretty weird things with physics, as soon as I launch a plane using that cockpit, the rest of the plane breaks up from the cockpit and just goes floating upwards like a balloon. I\u0027m guessing the physics issues have to do with the config file (for now I just copied the stock Mk3 cockpit config and edited it a bit), and the issue with the nodes not being in place has to do in part with the config, but also with the actual placement of the mesh inside blender and/or Unity. So some questions: 1) Is there any good documentation around for writing cfg files? The documentation on the KSP wiki is for version 0.25, and the examples don\u0027t look very similar to how actual stock cfgs look like in 1.0.4. 2) Does the position of a mesh inside unity matter? (I know rotarion matters, I\u0027m guessing yes, but I\u0027m not sure exactly how). 3) How do I import a mesh into Unity to act as a collision mesh, so I can use something similar to the shape of the model and not just a box or a capsule?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T01:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) the stock configs are about the best documentation you\u0027re going to get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The position of items in relation to the root object that has part tools applied matters.

I also managed to set up the collision mesh, so that\u0027s finally ok as well. Physics are still giving me a hard time, but I figure you\u0027re probably right and it has nothing to do with the cfg. I\u0027m thinking the issue is probably coming from the fact that I have Kerbal Joint Reinforcement installed, which changes physics a little bit. I\u0027ll un install it and also post a pre-release fore some people to try it to ser if the issue persists. Thanks for all your responses, they\u0027ve been really helpful!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
