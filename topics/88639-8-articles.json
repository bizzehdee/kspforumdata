Its just not researchable from the tree it\u0027s defined on. It will show up, but will only show its children after its tech has been researched via some other tree. In this example, the idea would be to play with both \u0027KSP Stock\u0027 and \u0027mytree\u0027 enabled.

These sub-trees would almost never conflict with each other except for when they overlap each other. If this happens, then the mods authors could just inform each other and one of them will move their sub-tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe type 4 tree is not compatible with any others. Some type 1 tree might just happen to work only because some stock node names were used.
