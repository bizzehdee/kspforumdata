For instance, if you attach something to the doors of a cargo bay. Whatever you attach will remain in place regardless of where the doors are. Landing gear, solar arrays and cargo bay doors use the same animation module. But in order to move something you need a new module, like the one made for IR. That module takes into account where a part is attached and will move it accordingly. But Scoundrel wants to avoid dependencies on other mods, hence his dilemma.

Hopefully it won\u0027t impact me much since I\u0027m mostly going to be focussing on expanding parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat aside, if people don\u0027t mind, as I have been convalescing these last few days, I\u0027d like to share my current thoughts on RvB:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I tested new weapons and the stealth bays for RvB, I have started to seriously reconsider how to set up RvB - not in terms of what goes on what side, but whether or not to make it an extension or a dependency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, there are three serous issues that have become apparent as I use realistic values for cannon and missiles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Kerbal parts are, generally speaking, just under 2/3rds scale compared to R/L parts... for the most part. Cockpits and engines are something of an exception here. This makes making aircraft using RvB 1:1 scaled parts quite large. Perhaps it is a non-issue, but looking at all the replicas in the forums, there are very few 1:1 scale SU-27s and F-15s being posted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The ranges for air battles are, generally speaking, limited to 1/4 the range of an actual neutral BVR A2A setup. Kinematically speaking, the way most people start, virtually all of the craft start off within the no-escape zone of most A2A ordnance, which makes the merge almost moot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Kerbin is 1/10th scale and 1200 m/s on Kerbin isn\u0027t 1200 m/s on Earth. Thus full scale missile performance means that at 10km altitude, one can loft an AMRAAM into a suborbital trajectory. Which I have done. Admittedly it used realistic AMRAAM stats with heating turned off as I was curious as to how it would perform, but this indicates to me that there are issues we are kind of ignoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing these facts, why then am I using full sized, authentic missile and cannon stats? Because BDA uses 1:1 scale and attempts to have accurate numbers; thus for RvB to be an extension, I have to conform to BDA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe then we just need to rescale parts? Surely tweakscale is the answer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually no. It\u0027s more than just rescaling the model: the stats have to change as well to reflect the smaller world and the smaller combat zone the craft have to engage each other in, as well as the fact that at a 0.625:1 scale, everything is about 24% mass compared to its realworld counterpart. .50 cal machineguns are the equivalent to .303s (okay slightly bigger .303s, but not by much); 30mm cannon become less than 20mm; 500lb Mk. 82 bombs become 125lb bombs. Missiles would seem either more or less realistic (depending on point of view) due to the close confines KSP limits us to and the reduction in scale of the missile, especially with regards to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as scary as making things kerbal-sized sounds, converting RvB as it exists to a 2/3rds scale world would be trivial. The problem is that it would no longer be compatible with BDA parts without a serious modulemanager config that basically completely rewrites BDA to be compatible with the scaled down version of RvB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree complications regarding this idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I\u0027m redoing Baha\u0027s work. Not very considerate of me, IMHO. That said, he probably wouldn\u0027t mind if I asked permission first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I\u0027m requiring people to download mods other than BDA, and I\u0027m quite insistent that RvB should not require anything other than BDA to work. Might be moot if I can bundle MM with RvB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If I want to rescale everything \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E using MM, I would have to make my own version of BDA\u0027s weapons... meaning way more effort on my part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves me with this conundrum: do I leave RvB as is and just keep it as an expansion to BDA? or do I redo everything to Kerbal scale to make things work within the limitations of KSP, and simply ignore/make my own version of/reconfigure BDA parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly don\u0027t see an easy answer one way or the other.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thatdude253","CreatedById":140179,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T19:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a thought, and forgive me if I overstep myself at all here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see a couple solutions, none of which are particularly clean or perfect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
