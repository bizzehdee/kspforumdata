For instance, if you attach something to the doors of a cargo bay. Whatever you attach will remain in place regardless of where the doors are. Landing gear, solar arrays and cargo bay doors use the same animation module. But in order to move something you need a new module, like the one made for IR. That module takes into account where a part is attached and will move it accordingly. But Scoundrel wants to avoid dependencies on other mods, hence his dilemma.

Great job! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nSeeing videos like that helps me stay motivated to continue plugging away at RvB... though I confess I\u0027m slightly disheartened that I may have delay things since Baha has been talking about major changes to BDA, but not until after Unity 5.x version of KSP has been released. Hopefully it won\u0027t impact me much since I\u0027m mostly going to be focussing on expanding parts.\n\nThat aside, if people don\u0027t mind, as I have been convalescing these last few days, I\u0027d like to share my current thoughts on RvB:\n\nAs I tested new weapons and the stealth bays for RvB, I have started to seriously reconsider how to set up RvB - not in terms of what goes on what side, but whether or not to make it an extension or a dependency.\n\nSee, there are three serous issues that have become apparent as I use realistic values for cannon and missiles:\n\n1. Kerbal parts are, generally speaking, just under 2/3rds scale compared to R/L parts... for the most part. Cockpits and engines are something of an exception here. This makes making aircraft using RvB 1:1 scaled parts quite large. Perhaps it is a non-issue, but looking at all the replicas in the forums, there are very few 1:1 scale SU-27s and F-15s being posted.\n\n2. The ranges for air battles are, generally speaking, limited to 1/4 the range of an actual neutral BVR A2A setup. Kinematically speaking, the way most people start, virtually all of the craft start off within the no-escape zone of most A2A ordnance, which makes the merge almost moot.\n\n3. Kerbin is 1/10th scale and 1200 m/s on Kerbin isn\u0027t 1200 m/s on Earth. Thus full scale missile performance means that at 10km altitude, one can loft an AMRAAM into a suborbital trajectory. Which I have done. Admittedly it used realistic AMRAAM stats with heating turned off as I was curious as to how it would perform, but this indicates to me that there are issues we are kind of ignoring.\n\nKnowing these facts, why then am I using full sized, authentic missile and cannon stats? Because BDA uses 1:1 scale and attempts to have accurate numbers; thus for RvB to be an extension, I have to conform to BDA.\n\nMaybe then we just need to rescale parts? Surely tweakscale is the answer?\n\nActually no. It\u0027s more than just rescaling the model: the stats have to change as well to reflect the smaller world and the smaller combat zone the craft have to engage each other in, as well as the fact that at a 0.625:1 scale, everything is about 24% mass compared to its realworld counterpart. .50 cal machineguns are the equivalent to .303s (okay slightly bigger .303s, but not by much); 30mm cannon become less than 20mm; 500lb Mk. 82 bombs become 125lb bombs. Missiles would seem either more or less realistic (depending on point of view) due to the close confines KSP limits us to and the reduction in scale of the missile, especially with regards to Kerbin.\n\nNow, as scary as making things kerbal-sized sounds, converting RvB as it exists to a 2/3rds scale world would be trivial. The problem is that it would no longer be compatible with BDA parts without a serious modulemanager config that basically completely rewrites BDA to be compatible with the scaled down version of RvB.\n\nThree complications regarding this idea:\n\n1. I\u0027m redoing Baha\u0027s work. Not very considerate of me, IMHO. That said, he probably wouldn\u0027t mind if I asked permission first.\n\n2. I\u0027m requiring people to download mods other than BDA, and I\u0027m quite insistent that RvB should not require anything other than BDA to work. Might be moot if I can bundle MM with RvB.\n\n3. If I want to rescale everything *without* using MM, I would have to make my own version of BDA\u0027s weapons... meaning way more effort on my part. \n\nThis leaves me with this conundrum: do I leave RvB as is and just keep it as an expansion to BDA? or do I redo everything to Kerbal scale to make things work within the limitations of KSP, and simply ignore/make my own version of/reconfigure BDA parts?\n\nI honestly don\u0027t see an easy answer one way or the other.![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Thatdude253","CreatedById":140179,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T19:23:53Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a thought, and forgive me if I overstep myself at all here. \n\nI see a couple solutions, none of which are particularly clean or perfect. \n\n1. The mounts, bays, radar cones, etc... are just fine with BDA and KSP at the moment and won\u0027t need tweaking. RvB could simply be a truly extensive addon of rails, bays, cockpits, etc...\n\n2. Most players aren\u0027t going to give two craps if they are in the no escape zone or not (especially with missiles like the meteor), so you could simply not worry about it, and if someone brings it up, then figure it out (procrastination essentially)\n\n3. Focus on IR A2A missiles. What most KSP players, myself included, are looking for is fun, and annihilating an enemy you can barely see is kind of cool, but chasing his ass down and rippling AIM-9s IS pretty fun. Plus, there\u0027s such an interesting variety of IR missiles out there, where most radar guided munitions look more or less similar. \n\n4. Tone down the thrust values to KSP levels. You can keep the missiles their appropriate size, but lower the thrust values so the zone of no escape is a little more manageable. \n\n5. Focus on A2G weapons. There\u0027s still a huge range of options here that haven\u0027t been fully explore. Small Diameter Bombs, JSOWs, Tomahawks, Storm Shadows, Sub-munitions dispensers, mine layers, etc...\n\nObviously none of these are perfect, most of them aren\u0027t even that great.

Instead of trying to warp modern BVR/WVR engagement ranges to fit KSP\u0027s limitations, I should be focussing specifically on WVR systems since it requires the least amount of distortion to operate accurately within the constraints of KSP. That will likely mean that I\u0027ll have to keep the BVR missiles to the medium range or cool-looking variety, and can just make lots of IR missiles for people to play with. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Tone down the thrust values to KSP levels. You can keep the missiles their appropriate size, but lower the thrust values\n\nBelieve it or not, using my realistic numbers for BVR missiles, the thrust values are still far lower than their real life counterparts because Baha never implemented fuel consumption for missiles. As most missile\u0027s boost phase accounts for about 15-30% of a missile\u0027s mass, and the sustainer phase some 5-15%, missiles act like they\u0027re 30-40% heavier than they actually are, with a corresponding increase in drag and reduction in acceleration and turning. So, yeah, missiles are already suffering from significantly reduced performance.\n\nAnother thing that has turned up in my testing, outside of the physics range issue and the world scale problem, is that aircraft have huge operating envelopes thanks to the ramjet. As an SSTO builder I love that engine, but from a missile design perspective, it noticeably reduces missile effectiveness. The panther engine in 1.1 will hopefully solve this issue; yet I\u0027m beginning to think that I may need to develop engines for RvB specifically to address this issue. Aircraft should not, by their default design, have the same flight envelope as an SR-71 while having F-16-like agility and F-22 (or better) acceleration, IMHO.\n\nI think I\u0027ll have to do more testing to see what is feasible."},{"CreatedByName":"Thatdude253","CreatedById":140179,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T20:29:01Z","Content":"\u003E That right there is probably the best observation that tells me I\u0027m likely overthinking things.
