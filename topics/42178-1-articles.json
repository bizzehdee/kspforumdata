As many of the companies work and live on the home planet that suggests there will very likely be fighting on Kerbin itself. It is felt that our employees, and the men fighting on the fronts, will do a better job if they felt their families and loved ones where protected in such harsh times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore Valley Inc. would like to sub-contact another company or business to design a Fallout/Bomb Shelter Recreational Vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be all shock, be able to hold a family of four, be armored against small weapons fire, be able to relocate when needed, be unarmed, and should be able to tap into the net to check on the sports news for the Father, download cartoons for the kids, and find recipes for the little Wife. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should also be designed to handle fallout if there is an atomic war, the hull should be strong enough to survive an attack by giant mutant crabs who would be the result of such war, and have also have a fool-proof medical unit to deal with radioactive related illnesses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RV should have enough food and power for a week. Kerbin science has shown that after a week fallout becomes harmless, giant mutant crabs go back to the ocean out of loneliness, and rain had cleaned the soil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe special RV should be within the price range of the common man (or at least those who have good paying jobs) and have a cute name (for the female drivers). Also it should come in at least three colors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease submit any designs to this thread for review. And feel proud that by doing so you insure the future of Kerbalkind!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAndrewTaco","CreatedById":51739,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T15:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGentlemen, behold the DOMINATOR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Stock, by the way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DUCqLTa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DUCqLTa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeavily armored, military-grade vehicle.
