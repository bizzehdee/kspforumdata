How can I possibly keep up with such a creative genius?!? And then as I read on, I was inspired by something Cupcake said... \u0022huge behemoths which take the gods very own firecrackers to get into orbit!\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI happened to have a few of those 5m firecrackers laying around... those might do the trick!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAnd so I set out to launch something truly massive. Now, I know others have built some big stuff and one dude even won the Internet for his unique ringed station design, but I\u0027m not setting out to compete with any of those - I just wanted to launch something really big using some of the gods\u0027 very own firecrackers that Cupcake mentioned, maybe have some fun in the process... So without further ado, allow me to present to you The Party Barge!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThe photos are entirely of the Party Barge \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EMk-1, a vessel truly worthy of her name, but with room for improvement (like almost every ship I\u0027ve ever seen). The photographer got so excited that he transmitted his pics , then docked with Party Barge Mk-1 just before she left Kerbin bound for Duna! We currently have an opening for a new photographer if anyone is interested. Party Barge Mk-2 has been fine-tuned a little to provide more fuel, fewer parts, and a bit more streamlining (although no fairings). Both ships are built on SpaceY tanks and use PorkJet\u0027s habitats. Mk-1 uses Procedural Fairings as well. I hope you have as big a party flying them as we have. Both versions have ample fuel and ore storage to take you anywhere you want to go and both launch very cleanly. Both have a generous supply of docking ports and use Rune\u0027s modular drive pods and a variation of his Cupola-based light tug for manipulating small parts that have no remote control module. Mk-1 is everything you would expect a Party Barge to be. Big. Bulky. Handles like a small moon. Even with a dozen of so of SpaceY\u0027s largest reaction wheel pairs, you need to not be in a hurry to get to your intended attitude. Mk-2 pulls everything in a little to decrease the moment of inertia, but also eliminates most of those reaction wheels in favor of vernor engines around the extremities to provide more torque. You\u0027ll use a little fuel doing it, but Mk-2 can turn around quite a bit quicker, allowing you to keep your options open longer.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EBoth models are available with your choice of flags emblazoned all over their tanks and come in your choice of a stylish black and while paint job or the spectacular white and black color scheme. Whichever you choose, you and your friends will have a great time and look good doing it on a Party Barge!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/%5B/color%5DcQy9S\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Did I forget to mention the launch vehicle? This massive grouping of rockets is built almost entirely with SpaceY components beginning with their breathtakingly large F51 tanks, holding 22k units of LF each, topped with conical tanks from Munar Industries, and stacked up on top of two R7 Super-Ratite and six R5 Multi-Ratite engine clusters making a total of 44 R1 Ratite engines giving whichever Party Barge you choose a whopping 144.8MN of thrust. Enough to lift you and your friends to orbit fast. The LV itself carries enough fuel to raise your Party Barge to LKO, but we\u0027ve cross-fed the contents of the Barge\u0027s tanks into the final stage of the LV, so that when you arrive in LKO, you will have 2k \u002B delta-V. Enough to get to Duna where you can launch a mining ship like Big John (or Cupcake\u0027s cute little Pickaxe if you want to be at it a while) and refill your tanks for the next leg in your adventure. If you ever complete drain those two stacks on top of the R7 Super Ratite engines, you can stage them off and use the four nuke drive pods for orbital maneuvering, but I just leave them attached and keep refueling them with my mining and refining operations. That way when we decide to move, we get there.
