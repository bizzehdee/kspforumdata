It\u0027s totally reusable and might be able to send 40-45 tons to LKO with some adjustments. It costs around 45k per launch, which is the fuel cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lNJZScf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lNJZScf.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tk0vurN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tk0vurN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IYm3pnj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IYm3pnj.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c7dPMPJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c7dPMPJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manek22","CreatedById":99501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T04:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice. I\u0027ve been doing some similar work myself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have been working with ssto lifters. I\u0027ve got a refuel station at minmus, so as long as I can get a ship there it keeps going. Most have around 4200d/v at the start. Downside is they need big engines to get off, so the fuel efficiency isn\u0027t that great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is completing a few contracts for orbital stations at once, with a bunch of kerbals to earn XP (need engineers leveled up for gas mining and gas stops)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IwgT7PE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IwgT7PE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeanjvs","CreatedById":147147,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T17:09:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks! I actually made that little Duna shuttle to earn XP for my engineers and scientists after failing miserably to build a Duna SSTO. For some reason, i can\u0027t make an SSTO with enough d/v to go any further than LKO:(. But i did make a plane that could lift a full orange tank to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice ship, BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
