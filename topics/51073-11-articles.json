Then I sent them on their way, as it happened in the order Moho, Jool, Eeloo, Duna, Dres, Eve. So after the Moho probe, I was frequently jumping around between them all either doing their ejection burns, midcourse burns, getting captured, setting up the proper orbit, etc. Each probe had 3 instruments: the high resolution altimetry/slope thingy, the anomaly thingy, and a large Kethane scanner. All orbits were chosen from that post about ISA, using the lowest orbit listed that still allowed a 100x warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the most part, all went OK. However, there were a few times I had probes busily mapping and then jumped to other ships which were some days out from their next maneuver, and warped 10Kx or 100Kx until maneuver time. Then I\u0027d do the maneuver and jump back to whichever probe was mapping at the time. This is when I discovered that at max warp, the background coverage got a bit spotty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what it did to Moho:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7336/10663960166_1234806041_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210663960166_1234806041_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe interruption occurred where you see the vertical line of squares and the whole gap in the pattern surrounding them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s what happened to Ike:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2808/10663959514_aff8e1fbf4_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210663959514_aff8e1fbf4_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the vertical dotted lines of missed areas happened during the high-warp interruption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Moho situation wasn\u0027t very hard to fix because Moho doesn\u0027t rotate enough to notice, so any orbit will eventually mapt the whole thing. With Ike, however, I had to do major fiddling with the orbit to get my track back to where the interruption caused gaps, so it ended up taking an extra week of gametime to finish this place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, on the whole, the mod worked excellently.

It\u0027s a function of your frame rate and your time warp multiplier: One update per frame, for the position it\u0027s currently at. For playable frame rates and time warp up to 1000x, this generally results in a mostly spotless map because ground speed of a satellite in range of these sensors is so low that they move so little that subsequent scans generally overlap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m changing the scanning logic for the next build though, and there will at least be the \u003Cem\u003Eoption\u003C/em\u003E to accurately follow the satellites during time warp. \u0022Option\u0022, because this requires quite a bit of processing at high time warp multipliers, and I\u0027m not sure yet how well I can tune this so that it won\u0027t be frame drop hell on slower computers. I don\u0027t want to tune it so that it doesn\u0027t kill fps on pocket calculators if that means players on faster systems lose accuracy, because even if your computer is slow, you don\u0027t need to have this on for very long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, typical real world mapping satellites retrace their path every few weeks, and have revisit times in the range of days because they can align their sensors. SCANsat satellites can\u0027t align their sensors (I can\u0027t think of a good way to include remote imaging controls that are not boring) but this is compensated by their relatively large footprints. As a real world example, SPOT can angle the sensors resulting in up to around 10 degrees difference in longitude around the equator. That\u0027s exactly the width of SCANsat\u0027s low resolution altimetry footprint (but latitude affects these numbers differently). Either way, if you could 100k time warp the real world, a single typical mapping satellite would cover the entire Earth within 10 to 30 seconds. So that\u0027s kind of the benchmark. Say you decide to send something to Jool. It should not take a signfiicant part of the 100k time warp you\u0027re going to do for that until your existing satellites have completed their maps if they\u0027re in any kind of suitable orbit. My thinking is that because of this, even if it\u0027s slow to follow them accurately, the option to do it will not be useless even on slow systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, of course, this lets me differentiate the sensors more by e.g. making the high res altimetry sensor have a smaller footprint, or making the footprint depend on altitude, and make it more important to choose the right orbit. Again my thinking is that if you do it right it should not take long, but if you don\u0027t do it right then the consequences should be a little worse than they are in build 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: For debugging, I made satellites paint their tracks in pink on the minimap in the build I\u0027m currently working with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o8XSEV1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022o8XSEV1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pink stuff gets cleared by the red scan line, so all the pink in this image is from one second of 100k time warp with four active satellites (#2 is a rover sitting still at the KSC, so I can time warp; and there also are a few other satellites in different SoIs). The only thing is, with this kind of accuracy, and the actual calculation happening once per second, I get a noticeable frame drop once per second at high time warp (10k\u002B). So that\u0027s why there\u0027ll probably be an option to turn it off, or rather, limit it to a resolution that\u0027ll work for 1000x.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T08:34:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 08:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by damny\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded image\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrtwinS","CreatedById":19144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T09:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022damny\u0022 data-cite=\u0022damny\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wrote that in the first post in this thread - it\u0027s stable up to 1000x time warp for me.

Unfortunately, there is a small problem: There is a function in the API that seems to be made for finding the biome at a given location, but I couldn\u0027t figure out how to use it without printing debug messages to the screen. So I implemented my own interpretation of \u0022closest map color\u0022, meaning biome edges can be inaccurate on these maps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the VOID addon that has a display for current biome. There\u0027s a comment on a biome related function in the tools.cs file that seems pertinent:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E// Toadicus edit: Added re-implementation of the CBAttributeMap.GetAtt function that does not fire a debug message to the game screen.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps this may be useful to you in some way?
