I could understand the wedges might add some extra shielding and thus weight/mass, but they actually have the same temperature limit as the originals. In summary, the science wedges should probably have a mass value about half of what they do currently (.04 each) in order to provide a significant alternative to the stock science parts. If you increase that slightly to account for the reduction in the Science Jr. you arrive at something around (.05)-- this would make a US quadcore with 4 of your science wedges have a mass of .25 which seems like a reasonable mass as a group since they are sharing the structural support, housing materials, shielding etc as wedges vs. self-contained/stand alone components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize the temperature rating you are using is in line with the rest of the US wedges, so it is not necessarily your problem, but as a note while I am on the topic, I think the wedges should have a temperature rating of at least double the current value of 1200 degrees to reflect that the wedge structure provides additional protection that the stock naked parts do not have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL:DR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe non-wedge science parts are all different weights which makes them hard to balance and the science wedges are balanced, but too heavy to be worthwhile compared to stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T05:23:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 05:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Smurfalot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bignumbers","CreatedById":98889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T05:27:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the contracts to conduct surveys on asteroids always given a time limit to completion of ~3 years?
