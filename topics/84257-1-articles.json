I asked myself if an astronaut could escape the Sphere Of Influence of a comet just by jumping from its surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as an example. The mass of the comet is approx. 3.14 x 10E12 kg. Its radius is 2000 m long (considering it a spherical object to make things easier).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe acceleration \u003Cem\u003Eg \u003C/em\u003Eon the comet is then equal to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eg = G x (m / rE2) x \u003C/em\u003E= 6.67428 x 10E-11 x 3.14 x 10E12 kg / 4000000 m = 5.24 x 10E-5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom this value we can calculate the escape velocity\u003Cem\u003E Ev\u003C/em\u003E of the comet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEv = \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1 (2Gm / r) = \u003C/em\u003E0,4578 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn average man on Earth jumps 0.2 m high. That means that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1 0.2 x 2 x 9.81 = 1.98 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn average man jumps at an initial velocity of 1.98 m/s. That\u0027s almost 4 times the escape velocity, which means that one could easily escape the comet\u0027s SOI just by jumping. However, I tried to proof-check using other formulas, and something didn\u0027t quite work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I calculated the SOI\u0027s radius:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERsoi =\u003Cem\u003E a x ( m / M ) E2/5\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere \u003Cem\u003EM\u003C/em\u003E is the mass of the Sun (1.99 x 10E30 kg) and \u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E is the semi-major axis (518 120 000 000 m)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat makes a 37 408 m radius. This makes me think that, jumping from the surface, you would get an apoapsis far higher than 37 km, which would mean that you would be on an escape trajectory from the comet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this is were the calculations say something different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI simulated the astronaut\u0027s jump. We know his speed \u003Cem\u003EV\u003C/em\u003E at apoapsis will be 0 m/s, while his initial speed \u003Cem\u003EV0\u003C/em\u003E will be 1.98 m/s. We also know that \u003Cem\u003Eg\u003C/em\u003E on the comet is equal to 5.25 x 10E-5. Using this information, I easily calculated the height \u003Cem\u003EH \u003C/em\u003Ereached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EH = V0 squared / 2 x g = \u003C/em\u003E1.98E2 / 2g = 37 377 m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is just inside the SOI radius, while I was expecting it to be far far beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone please explain me where I made a mistake?

Use energy instead of acceleration. Your centre of mass is accelerated over the same distance on Earth as on the asteroid, which is the distance between where you start crouched and the point where your feet no longer touch the ground. Work is force times distance and the force your legs exert is the same in both cases, so work is the same. By the work-energy theorem, (sub-)orbital energy gained is the same. Increase in E_specific ~= 0.5m * g on Earth, so E_specific = 0.5 * 9.8 = 4.9 J/kg is gained on the asteroid as well. Add that to the potential energy between the surface and the centre of the asteroid to work out how high your new apoapsis is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frida Space","CreatedById":60943,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T18:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022christok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022christok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMore problems with your analysis:\u003Cp\u003E- An average man jumps way higher than 0.2m, which is only 20cm.

However, there are two important caveats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) This is energy relative to the surface and not energy relative to the centre of the planet(esimal), which is what we\u0027ll be using for the orbit calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) g * m * h is an approximation which is only valid if the height is very small relative to the distance to the centre of the planet(esimal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can use g * m * h for the jump on Earth because 0.2m \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 6Mm. Instead of regular kinetic and potential energy, we can use specific energy which is the energy divided by the mass and completely ignore the mass of the astronaut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eepsilon = specific energy = 0.5 * V^2 - mu / r, where mu = G * M.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at the starting point, epsilon = KE - mu / 2km on the comet where KE = g_earth * h_earth is the specific kinetic energy at the start of the jump and equals potential energy relative to the surface for the Earth jump.

I did say energy makes it easy! You don\u0027t need to calculate the height you jump to. If (specific) orbital energy = 0, you have a parabolic trajectory. If it\u0027s \u0026lt; 0, you have an elliptical or circular orbit.
