So I fixed it.. Updated a few of the other little problems I had in original video and made it over.. Just felt that the video should be correct and not have to many Corrections.. Plus a lot of people don\u0027t have Annotations on and Having that kind of error could cause them time.. And thats not what I want.. So Its fixed.. And thanks to everyone that pointed out the issues.. Including the Mod Author.. Thanks a bunch for a great mod.. Love it.. And who ever does your Animations...
