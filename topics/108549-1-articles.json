Then if i click on apply, it apply default settings.\n\nIt\u0027s very annoying to have to re-set everything as soon as I want to change a setting.\n\nSimilarly, the KSP Stats Tracking dialog is displayed each time I launch KSP (This is the dialog where you tell if you want to send IP and anonymous game progress data).\n\nKeys modification are recorded though.\n\nThere\u0027s nothing in the console about file not found or such thing.\n\nIs this a known bug ? I didn\u0027t find anything about it in the forum...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T11:17:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 11:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fopim**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T08:22:01Z","Content":"Hi fopim, no this isn\u0027t a bug in KSP, it\u0027s most likely that you have a permissions problem.\n\nKSP stores the last good graphics settings in a prefs file in \u0022/home/user/.config/unity3d/Squad/Kerbal Space Program/prefs\u0022, the rest goes in settings.cfg, so you should check the permissions on the game folder.\n\nAlso check for a settings.cfg where you run your script from, if it\u0027s being written there instead of the game folder that might be why this is happening.\n\nI have a script as well but mine\u0027s like this.\n\n    #!/bin/bashcd \u0022/home/yourusernamehere/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Kerbal Space Program/\u0022./KSP.x86_64\n\nI don\u0027t have any problem, see if that works better for you."},{"CreatedByName":"fopim","CreatedById":137635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:24:18Z","Content":"Hi sal\\_vager, thanks for the answer.\n\nIt turned out that it was the lack of the LC\\_ALL=C in my script which caused the problem.\n\nI removed it because in 0.90 changelog, it was said that the bugs caused by the local where fixed.\n\nBut as stated by m4v here [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread?p=1722020\u0026viewfull=1#post1722020](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread?p=1722020\u0026viewfull=1#post1722020) , it doesn\u0027t fixed everything (but the most annoying bug though).\n\nAnyway, adding LC\\_ALL=C just before lauching ksp do the trick. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T12:01:36Z","Content":"Heh, of course, LC\\_ALL isn\u0027t applied to KSP.x86\\_64, only to the 32bit version, and it\u0027s only really required for non-English languages, if you run into any weirdness delete your settings.cfg as well."}]}
