You can do both a recycling bin mounted on your orbital construction station or on a space tug. You will need sufficient empty rocket parts storage tank space of course. Just maneuver any part of the spent stage into the mouth of the recycling bin and activate it. I generally try to poke an antenna into the recycle bin, that works well. (I use the RemoteTech 2 mod so all my craft have a bunch of antenna). If you normally use MechJeb for docking operations then you can place a command pod or a docking port directly behind the recycle bin and use that as \u0022docking\u0022 target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"techno65535","CreatedById":160947,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T06:32:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do have Kethane, but you just reminded me of a recent update where he changed the name of the plugin from MMI_Kethane.dll to Kethane.dll.

I would suggest just cutting down the Ec consumption on the smelter by a factor 50 and maybe tweak metal production a bit. In a vacuum your smelter will be pretty well insulated, so the only energy you really need to add is to melt the ore that goes in. You could probably calculate how much you need exactly. But to be honest, this is a game. If realistic values aren\u0027t fun you can always tweak them to something more/less challenging or tedious. You can handwave it by saying you have a very efficient heat exchanger on the ore feed from the molten metal output or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boberts314","CreatedById":69216,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T19:23:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022taniwha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022taniwha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E[*]Yup, sure enough, EL looks for MMI_Kethane... fix will be in the next update (which should be soon).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EWoops.

This will open a window that allows you to select one of your previously saved crafts. If you select the craft you want to build it will show you how much rocketparts, fuel, electricity etc it costs.

(If you don\u0027t have Kethane I think it allows you to build things for free, although I am not sure on that). You first need to scan a planet from orbit using one of the scanners to find ore the same way you would locate Kethane. Land in a ore rich area and use the Augur to gather it. You then need to convert the ore to metal in the smelter part and then the metal to rocket parts with the Rocket Workshop.
