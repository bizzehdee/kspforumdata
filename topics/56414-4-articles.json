No the NTR is not Orion BUT it does stem from the idea that Nuclear power can be used for Space travel. Its a start, its a step in the right direction. If its works and is effecetive maybe we can try something else? Its getting over the Nuclear taboo and ignorance. It beats playing with silly chem rockets.

(That said, just about any competent electrical engineer could build a replacement for the firing circuits with parts only slightly harder to get than going down to Radio Shack.) The second is actually the older method, and probably the more effective at making sure that the weapon can\u0027t be used in any form without permission, but has been abandoned due to certain... issues that come with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s to set off the high explosive trigger in \u0022one-point safe\u0022 mode, where instead of all the explosive lenses firing at once to create an implosion, you have one of them fire, which then sets off the others in a cascade reaction that generates unbalanced forces on the core as it propagates, instead pulverizing the nuclear material and spreading it quite nicely (500 pounds of C4 will spread dust a *long* way). You really can\u0027t collect the resultant plutonium dust to reassemble into a physics package, but there\u0027s the little issue of contaminating the area rather thoroughly. (This is why USAF standard policy for bombers with live nukes on board was, in an emergency, to let the bomber crash with the weapons still on board--it was felt that if the shock or post-crash fire set off the triggers, it\u0027d be in one-point-safe mode, and in that case, the aircraft structure would help reduce contamination by absorbing a significant percentage of the blast energy so the core wouldn\u0027t be spread as widely.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said... it was generally agreed by 1960 that if Orion ever flew, it would be in the form of a launched-from-orbit spacecraft rather than launching from the surface, specifically to make sure that A) fallout on Earth would be all but nonexistent, and 2) if it failed, you wouldn\u0027t have the ship crash someplace where someone might salvage nukes from it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mulkari","CreatedById":85493,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T22:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crazyewok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022crazyewok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStill waiting for someone to tell me why it would not work?

This isn\u0027t Star Trek. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing was envisioned as a Mars lander. It HAD to turn around in order to slow down and enter Martian orbit and then steer itself as it comes in for a landing. (Yes, they wanted to land using the bombs too. And then set up a base and get people out and explore the site they just irradiated as they landed) So it would have had an RCS system of some sort/ That wouldn\u0027t be an issue for ships assembled in orbit, which is the only way a nuclear pulse would ever be used now anyway. A surface launch would rely on aerodynamics for stability, and given the mass of the ship it really would be limited to direct ascent from the surface - no gravity turns, and it would likely end up in a highly eccentric orbit if it used its RCS to orient itself for circularization \u0027pulses\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts really unclear how many of these issues were tackled by the Orion team - it seems that most of the research and testing was entirely related to the propulsion system and the design of a ship that could withstand the nukes. This was before a lot of the \u0027problems\u0027 of space travel had been tackled by NASA and the Russians during the space race. So really, Orion as it existed in the 50s and 60s was a theory (with a lot of math and some small scale demonstrators) on how the nuclear propulsion could be used rather than a fully-designed spacecraft. That particular aspect of Orion could be (and has been) used in further studies and designs. But there is still going to be the issue of nuclear proliferation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I found this BBC documentary on Youtube earlier, its pretty cool if you want to learn a little more behind the thinking of the guys behind the project. The George Dyson who wrote the book we were discussing earlier is actually the son of of the Freeman Dyson, who was one of the leaders of the project along with Ted Everett. Both were physicists, and Everett was a bomb designer at Los Alamos. I think the thing that surprised me the most is that Freeman actually served on the board that wrote the nuclear test ban treaty, and that he knew it would end his project. But he did it anyway. Everett also became a nuclear disarmament supporter as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have an hour, give it a watch, its pretty cool: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCszu4zaqr0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCszu4zaqr0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
