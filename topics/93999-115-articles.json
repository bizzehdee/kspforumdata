Perhaps you may have heard that I am working on custom E.V.E textures and configs for OPM that require nothing but E.V.E which, in turn, needs ModuleManager(like basically every mod). One of the things I am working on is a light white haze in the distance on Thatmo. So far without big results, but I\u0027m making some good progress. Other than that, glow works fine on basically every body but Hale, Ovok, Polta/Priax (the small brown asteroid moon, I\u0027m too lazy to head over to my KSP directory to find out which one, sorry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E), Tal and Nissee since they are irregular, and E.V.E doesn\u0027t work nicely with irregular bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESarnus, Urlum, Neidon, Tekto, Slate, Polta/Priax(the big mint colored one this time), Wal and Thatmo work fine though. As for Tekto, I am working on a dense atmosphere like the real Titan: the clouds \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill\u003C/strong\u003E be at least ten kilometers thick (real Titan has about 4km of smog, but who cares, this is Tekto and not Titan) instead of many layers with clear, cloudless areas in between. Another thing I\u0027ve noticed is that Sarnus and Urlum\u0027s rings do not conflict with the effects of E.V.E, which is a nice bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, due to me being hired (for free in case you\u0027re wondering) by fellow Kopernicus user amarius1 to add E.V.E compatibility to KerbolPlus (or KerbolOrigins, as it will be renamed to in the next version), I don\u0027t have as much time to work on the OPM cloudpack as much as I used to, and therefor it may take longer for me to finish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, the clouds actually work: while adding Tekto\u0027s clouds I accidentally placed one around \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin\u003C/strong\u003E instead of Tekto, so Kerbin had a green cloudlayer in it\u0027s upper atmosphere. So I simply threw a bunch of boosters together and decided to check it out, and it actually works and looks really good! Another thing that will be added to Tekto is a mysterious mist above the lakes for an extra alien effect. Since Tekto\u0027s atmosphere is described as \u0027violent\u0027 and since real-life Neptune actually has some of the fastest winds in the solar system, both Tekto and Neidon will have a few minor cyclones moving around in the upper atmosphere (though I have not yet been able to make them rotate).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T19:24:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat will indeed be a great addition to OPM, whenever you get chance to release it.
