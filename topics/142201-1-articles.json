Amazingly the planner shows that an Eeloo-Kerbin window opens up at the arrival time and a return transfer (with reasonable efficiency) can be set up to leave 13 days after Eeloo arrival. I am tempted to totally go\u00A0for this but have serious doubts I can actually execute the transfer accurately enough to get anywhere close to that 13 day span, we are talking a 2-3 year journey time to the farthest out planet after all.

I often just chart the node and see what happens without even looking for a window.

As long as the position of Duna or Jool is somewhere in the proper position to meet Eelo once you slingshot. You don\u0027t want to go there? Ok then.

The return trip is even easier, just use Jool gravity assist (but you might arriving too fast at Kerbin). But of course it takes more time and you can forget about transfer windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
