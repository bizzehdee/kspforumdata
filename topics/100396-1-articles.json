Hopefully a larger one since the Honeybadgers attachment point side is 3.75 meters.\n\nI know I could just use tweakscale, but I\u0027ve heard that it\u0027s full of bugs and that the author isn\u0027t maintaining it anymore, besides, I\u0027m curious what mods have a part with the same functions and all.\n\nMight be cool if Roverdude made one though."},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T04:23:02Z","Content":"Off the top of my head, there\u0027s a 3.75m science lab in the parts pack with the Taurus HCV. It requires 3 kerbals, but a simple config edit could probably fix that.

TweakScale won\u0027t help either. If you want to use the Honey Badger, your best option is probably to attach FTT\u0027s cargo bay and put the regular science lab inside. It\u0027s what players have been doing with awkward-shaped parts like B9 for quite a while.\n\nFinally, if the FTT pack has an octagonal crew module, you could config edit it to serve as a science lab, but it might not look that good."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T04:30:25Z","Content":"I don\u0027t really care about the Honeybadger part having an octagonal section, was just stating the size of it.\n\nAs for FTT having an octagonal crew module, I THINK I saw something like that, will have to check.\n\nEdit: Nope, it doesn\u0027t.
