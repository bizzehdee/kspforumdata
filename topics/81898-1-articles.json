This base basically consist in stock, kethane, karbonite and kas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, as I approach it with my tanker rover, the game laaaaaags, presumably due part count. And then once I\u0027ve stopped the rover, switched to other vessels within the range of the base and deleted the nearby debris it stopped. But it got me thinking that, as long as I\u0027m not moving the base (everything has wheels), I can really streamline the part count. I don\u0027t need six different small batteries now that the three habitats are docked together (well, almost. I couldn\u0027t dock the third one so I\u0027ve attached it with KAS pipes). So, which KAS I could send a few containers, remove all the small parts I\u0027m not using, store them there and replace them with a small docked rover with a single bigger battery, for instance. And I could do the same with other small parts, either storing them for good (rcs thrusters) or replacing them with a single, larger part. And that way, I will reduce the part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, and here lies the problem, what about larger parts, such as docking ports? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it, I\u0027d need either something like KAS but able to remove and store larger parts or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething that will remove it permanently. I could use hyperedit to send the part back from the launchpad if I need it although I\u0027ll still have the problem of placing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any mods like that?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-18T18:27:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2014 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by juanml82\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T18:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83619\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EChopIt!\u003C/a\u003E, listed on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECommunity Mods and Plugins Library\u003C/a\u003E sticky, will let you remove any parts, though that may only work for ships you haven\u0027t launched yet.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T20:25:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInside your persistence.sfs file is a description of each craft that is in flight or landed.
