There have been countless times that I\u0027ve wanted to attach a part to a certain node, but the editor never seems to select the correct node, and I have often resorted to extreme zooming and partial dissasambly as other methods to finally get a part to attach to the other that I had intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I suggest is a part placement mode that lets you specify which part/node you are attempting to attach another piece to. For example (The one that\u0027s inspiring me to write this post). When you select this mode via UI or hotkey, you select one of the green nodes presented in the editor, and that\u0027s the only node that the part will attach to if a connection is possible. The amount of time and frustration saved by this would be immense. The connection logic has definitely improved over time, but there is no substitution for \u0022this is where I want it\u0022 human interaction in the editor. Most of the time, the logic for part placement is pretty sound, but sometimes you need to just need the ability to specify which node you are trying to attach to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn extra addition to this could be \u0022Node Fit\u0022 where only other attachment nodes would work on the selected part, and then free fit where the part could attempt to attach per it\u0027s current logic, but only to the selected part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis little rant comes after attempting multiple times to create a simple space station part in the cargo bay of an existing spaceplane design and having to reload over and over multiple times before finally quitting for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aleis","CreatedById":62823,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T06:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eooooo not a bad idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor a work around try building the service bay on a new ship then saving it as an assembly and loading that assembly to the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut i know your frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T12:13:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you know that you can hold the alt key down to force a part to only attach to nodes - as opposed to radially?

If that were standard behaviour it would benefit the game greatly especially in map mode with close objects and various other places like trying to select a particular part in flight etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso extending the [] selection method from just selecting ships in physics range to all areas of the game, for example nodes, ships in the map mode, parts on a craft and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO the game could do with having the object selection method looked over and improved on a general level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
