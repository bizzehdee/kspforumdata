Lets see...first off, you could replace the radial engines on your lander with clusters of Rocomax 48-7S\u0027s, each one has about 2.5 times the thrust to weight of the radial engines you\u0027re using. You will also use less fuel as they are more efficient for the same weight. So you will need less fuel reducing your ships weight or increasing the ships range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the staging...hurm...that is allot of SRB\u0027s. You may wish to play with using Liquid Fuel Engines in clusters using \u0022Asparagus Staging\u0022. That way you use less weight each stage to do more lifting. I can not see what engines you have in the center stack, but playing in Career, I have a main lift stage using a skipper with four LV-T30 engines that have been clipped a little into a radial giving some efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as a rule, bigger is not always (except in Whackjobs case) better. Smaller engines are more efficient then larger ones. So if you have an opportunity to use smaller engines, then you should look into it and see how it works.
