All in all this is a fairly realistic system but is lacking in stock due to two factors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELow velocity at reentry interface (this is an old issue that anyone who has been with DRE for awhile is familiar with: Velocities of incoming craft over Kerbin are approx 2-3 km/s which is low hypersonic and deceleration to subsonic occurs quickly and easily)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe concept of thermal mass has been introduced. This is a more realistic concept than what we had before: In order to raise temperature by 1 degree, an amount of incoming heat flux is required equal to the part\u0027s mass * thermal mass modifier * specific heat constant. (this also includes resource mass)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermal mass is a good and necessary addition but there\u0027s one problem with it: In Real Life, you shouldn\u0027t have to overcome the enter thermal mass before the skin is breached. Localized heating occurs swiftly and stays local because heat conduction throughout the entire mass occurs too slowly. If it weren\u0027t for this, I\u0027m not even sure Deadly Reentry would still be necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027ve done is introduce the concept of skin temperature. Radiant and convective heating are now shifted to part\u0027s skin temperature. The amount of thermal mass in the skin is 10% of the part by default. (10% might actually be a little too high but lower than that might have been too deadly). These values are subject to change as the system becomes more robust. (specifically I\u0027d like to introduce heating by location in the future but this requires some thought before implementation. The current system I\u0027ve devised is more in keeping with with stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would have been easier to just do a config based system where part\u0027s thermal mass was reduced across the board or convective heating was increased enough to make stock Kerbin reentries lethal, but that would have affected internal heating out of proportion to what it should be to the point of making things too difficult and the introduction of skin temperature is more natural. This way we can restrict part temperature to being internal heat with different consequences for parts based on function. (i.e. parts with fuel tanks might explode at lower temperatures due to their contents boiling off too quickly, or Kerbals dying or being incapacitated because their quarters overheated, etc etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bulk of what needed to be done is already complete but had to be built from the ground up rather than being integrated with existing code. The old DRE code will require wholesale chunks ripped out of it because they\u0027re now obsolete. What I currently have could be dubbed \u0027Deadly Reentry Lite\u0027 and aside from some config file work and parts editing (for existing DRE parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expect to do a basic release of this tonight with a more complete version later in the week.

Skin is tracked via a PartModule and it will be possible to set things like that independently of part temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means it will be possible to go through and change part maxTemp values to saner values but the skin would have higher values. For instance, shuttle parts could have their maxTemp set to 933.45 (the melting point of aluminum in Kelvin - all temperatures are now Kelvin) while the skin would have something like 1800 to represent something like shuttle tiles. It would have high emission values so it would radiate more heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it\u0027s supposed to be shuttle tiles it will have a low specific heat capacity. (lowered thermal mass) and it will conduct slowly. The way the system is currently set up, if the skinMaxTemp is exceeded it will just destroy the part, which is in keeping with the current system but I\u0027m going to shift that to a damage based system and as the skin becomes more damaged, it will leak more heat through (higher conductance) and/or other dire consequences.

That uses a cone based system instead of the raytraced system that DRE used in earlier versions. It\u0027s probably quite a bit faster than raytracing.
