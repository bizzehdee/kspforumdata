Most game engines are created by relatively big companies (some of which essentially do only the engine and support, no actual games, like Unity). The return on investment is quite low unless you can license it out or get more than one or two games out of it. KSP is a pretty specialized game, so I don\u0027t think they\u0027d be able to get mileage out of the engine unless it was HUGELY successful (more so than\u00A0now). KSP is $30 USD retail (cheaper with discounts). If they had created their own engine, it would\u0027ve taken FAR longer to release and cost a lot more. Recall that SQUAD started from essentially nothing other than a Unity dev kit. The associated costs would be passed on to the players. Imagine if KSP costs as much a typical AAA title from the likes of EA or Activision? Would you have jumped into KSP if it was $50-$60? (And probably not discounted much, if at all.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDedicated engine take a dedicated team to develop and maintain today. The likes of EA, Activision, id Software, Bethesda, and Epic have the resources and incentive to do that (they develop their own in-house engines for their own myriad of projects and for licensing). If the game is buggy and is traced back to the game engine itself being the point of failure, you have to fix the foundation before you can build the house, so to speak. SQUAD doesn\u0027t have that kind of resources. Current engine bugs in KSP today are left to the Unity people to fix while the KSP team works on what they can in the actual game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, it\u0027s possible. Hell, I\u0027d argue that it would be in the better interest of KSP due to its ambitions. But is it practical? Not with the currently available resources. There\u0027s incentive, but not enough to warrant or justify it at this point. If KSP and things like Orbiter kick-started a new genre of space simulator (and by simulator, I mean real space sim, not \u0022flight sim, but in SPACE!\u0022), perhaps there would be true incentive to develop a dedicated engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the flip side, maybe they could con one of the big engine devs to include an orbital physics package. Something like the current Unreal engine is supposedly flexible for development, but more involved as far as I know. (Then again, I only know of big-name studios that use it.) I wouldn\u0027t mind it if someone could port KSP to another engine like Unreal if said engine could support it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T11:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I saw the title, I thought you were talking about merging Space Engine, and KSP together \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T11:36:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSwitching engines to something better/more flexible than Unity?

First they had a 3 week schedule, with a \u003Cu\u003Eplayable\u003C/u\u003E game every 21 days. this was only possible with a pre-built engine and unity was both easy access and free of charge (home version, if you don\u0027t make lots of profits with the results). Squad was no software development company and I guess the starting staff had a hard enough time to wrap their heads around 3D modeling,\u00A0C# scripts and frickin rocket science. when they had a new idea or just wanted to try something out, unity let them do that with relative ease.\u00A0so, nobody should blame them for starting with unity and then sticking with it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut\u00A0KSP has grown, a lot. the players are both ambitious and demanding. constantly bringing KSP, it\u0027s\u00A0framework and their hardware to the limit. Unity has become one of the weak links, as plenty of workarounds integrated by Squad, the way too long 32-bit area\u00A0and the\u00A0post U5\u00A0update\u00A0bugfest proved. so my feeling is, if they\u0027d start building\u00A0KSP as it is now, they would look hard for a better engine than unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I read out of your answers what I agree with:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\ndon\u0027t change the horse mid race\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nbuilding an engine from scratch is really, really hard and takes a lot of time and skilled programmers, duh\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nbuilding an engine for only one game is not worth the effort\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthe API for mods and assets in general should be changed as little as possible\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this is more answering should they do it and if yes, how...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-14T19:29:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2016 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MircoMars\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeNapalm","CreatedById":67032,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T19:44:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m just gonna point out that \u0022How hard could it be?\u0022 has been a question preceding some of the greatest examples of \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eepic failure\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E in the history of ignorance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve come to realize that it is human nature to assume anything people don\u0027t understand is easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Jn-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T22:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222630837\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141780\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465933474\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002267032\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JoeNapalm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, JoeNapalm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m just gonna point out that \u0022How hard could it be?\u0022 has been a question preceding some of the greatest examples of \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eepic failure\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E in the history of ignorance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve come to realize that it is human nature to assume anything people don\u0027t understand is easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Jn-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJudging from the various abandoned projects lying around: building a game engine isn\u0027t all that hard. \u00A0Building a game engine worth using is a *lot* harder. \u00A0And being able to tell them apart takes a rather long time, so game designers don\u0027t want to be the first ones to build a game on the engine. \u00A0Consequence: game engine designers need to build games on their own engines (and then *still* have trouble selling them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: the engine from crytek was on absolute fire sale a few months ago. \u00A0Presumably it has outrageous performance, outrageous graphical beauty, and outrageous amounts of bugs. \u00A0I doubt it was easy to make, but I would think that just the games the parent company made proves it had value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t to say it isn\u0027t that hard. \u00A0To build something that KSP can move to you need to clone Unity 4/5, a system that has grown to meet the needs of a *ton* of games and game designers. \u00A0You won\u0027t pull it off for just one game. \u00A0If you still feel the need, find out what orbiter does (presumably something custom, non-made-for-reuse\u00A0code) and build your \u0022engine\u0022 around that. \u00A0Orbiter seems like a reasonable target, KSP does not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
