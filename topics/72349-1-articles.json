However, 500 sounded like a big number, so I wanted it. Unfortunately, I soon found out that physics could not handle 50 poorly built Landers with 500 dim-witted Kerbals derping around. I did not try this myself, but after watching physics fail to handle a less ambitious Mun base by HOCgaming, I decided to cut down the crew to one hundred, a sizeable but significantly lower number. After that, I got right to design and mathematics on paper, getting right to the more important designs first. The first thing I did was to lay out plans for a mobile portable toilet. I even added missiles and rocket engines for good measure. Next, I designed a minimalistic ion probe capable of defying, although barely, Mun or even Duna gravity. Finally, in one of the later designs, I designed a science laboratory with a single habitation module. As well as that, there were even more important concepts which I speculated about. Sending a restaurant to the Mun, and bowling. It also crossed my mind that it would be useful to have the base as a source of fuel, so Kethane might be an option. Eventually, I downloaded several more mods: B9 Aerospace, Skillful, VNG ejection systems, Deep Space Mission pack, LazTek SpaceX, and some random mod with greenhouses. I also, for no good reason, decided to build it on career mode.

A science laboratory with a habitation module and Lander-Can. I wanted to put the big three (Jeb, Bill, and Bob) on it, but they were on my first multi-module space station, with no way down due to my horrible rendezvous skills. (When I docked the second module to the first, it was only my third ever rendezvous.) Also on station was Corzon Kerman, one of the survivors of my first misguided attempt at a permanent presence in space, SpaceLab. He and Jeb survived a rough landing by bailing out of the science lab at the last second, which exploded. No one was killed. Anyway, our Intrepid five, which did not fill every space in the rocket but I didn\u0027t want them to feel crowded, were previously unknown. Barlas Kerman, who had tested one of my Oogabooga all-SRB rockets, was to be the mission commander. Also commissioned was Derbin Kerman, a newly promoted and somewhat sluggish recruit,\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
