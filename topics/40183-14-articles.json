It is first deducted when the Kerbals are loaded (before launch already), and returned upon vehicle recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking more about my problems, I realised that I may have been unfair in my disappointment with the mod, since it exponentially increased the difficulty for me. I later realised that this applies to my install more since I have Deadly Re-entry and RemoteTech mods installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The deadly re-entry gives slight additional difficulty, since I have a slightly higher starting cost for my vehicles (heat shields) and I have to plan re-entry and aero-braking manoeuvres far more carefully to avoid burning up in the atmosphere. This gives my rockets generally a higher \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv requirement for atmospheric insertion manoeuvres. This can be anything from 30 to 600 m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- RemoteTechy makes the mission pack unsuitable. Any unmanned mission going outside the line-of-sight of, or more than 10 Mm away from, the KSC will become non-functional. To be able to do most missions unmanned, I first must place a few satellites that can cover any angle, and greater distances from the KSC. Since the standard mission pack doesn\u0027t give me enough of a budget to do extra launches for this purpose, the latter missions must be manned. This however makes the missions harder since landing back on Kerbin becomes mandatory. I managed to figure out several ways\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B9 to do most of them, but it definitely increases costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll look at the other mission packs I have, to see whether there\u0027s a mission pack that has missions that allow me to place a relay of satellites in KEO as part of a mission. I\u0027ll probably blow quite a chunk in my budget by adding communication antennae from the RemoteTech parts. The basic antennae are ridiculously expensive compared to the stock Commutron 16s, but the Commutron 16s break away from the craft when deployed in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I think this mod makes a valuable addition to the game, and stresses the importance of a good career mode, since a limited budget adds another dimension to the rocket building process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing: Since the Mission Controller Extended state doesn\u0027t synchronise with the game saves, it is possible to gain a lot of money by saving before landing, recovering the craft, reloading and repeating the cycle. Every repetition you\u0027ll not only recover the craft, but you will receive the Kerbal Insurance as well. If you don\u0027t realise this, and you do this accidentally with a 3 Kerbal craft it\u0027s a strangely huge increase in budget since you\u0027ll get 85% of the landing vehicle cost \u002B 165k\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EK\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. There are two options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Move a three Kerbal crewed craft with Remote Command module and antennae close to the target and launch an unmanned probe (with antennae) from it. The three crew members and Remote Command module will allow it to remotely control a probe that has radio contact. You don\u0027t need to relay it back to the KSC for contact. Requires a far larger launch vehicle. Return home to Kerbin with the crewed craft after the mission goals have been achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Place a single Kerbal crewed craft on course with the target (for example the Kerbolo and Minmus I missions) and detach a small probe from it. Return to Kerbin with the crewed craft while the probe is flown (albeit uncontrollably) to complete the mission. This method is cheaper than the above-mentioned method, but requires more timing, and cannot be used on missions where the probe has to be controlled after being detached.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T21:16:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting an error with docking missions.
