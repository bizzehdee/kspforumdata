With this mod I find I reuse my craft much more than I would do previously. An upgraded ship, a veteran unit, actually means something.

I\u0027m not sure how I feel about that, I think I would not feel the accomplishment...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an idea though. What if the science lab produces science depending on where it is, much like it does now, only much faster, like 100 science in a week or a few days, the amount might vary per destination, easier destinations give less science, the difficult targets give you the most science. But it produces that science only once! So once your science lab is spent you must send another one. The idea is that sending a mission to duna will get you a certain amount of science, leaving the thing in orbit won\u0027t give you additional science after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnti matter suffers the same problem. Perhaps a game mechanic could be found where the strategy of just putting up many orbital stations with many collectors stops being the best strategy? Like taking an atmospheric dive into jool, which is dangerous, or something similar with kerbol. But the anti matter thus collected will get you around the kerbol system. Lots of return for making an effort, not for time acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with Chase that effort should be equated to return, not taking a nap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T23:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil after 0.22 comes out I cant see any point in Fractal_UK spending time to change the way science works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso guys a single AM Collector at 900K around Kerbin will get just almost 4 AM per day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd engines that use MJ/MW don\u0027t need to be directly attached to the reactor/gen.

Each generator has a rating when you build it and when you upgrade it that tells you the \u0022percentage of Carnot efficiency\u0022 that the generator provides, this Carnot efficiency refers to the percentage of Carnot cycle efficiency it achieves. The Carnot cycle is the type of cycle used by an ideal heat engine, i.e. the most efficient a theoretical heat engine can be. The Carnot efficiency is given by 1-T\u003Csub\u003EC\u003C/sub\u003E/T\u003Csub\u003EH\u003C/sub\u003E where T\u003Csub\u003EC\u003C/sub\u003E is the temperature of a \u0022cold bath\u0022 and T\u003Csub\u003EH\u003C/sub\u003E is the temperature of a \u0022hot bath\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractical heat engines don\u0027t use Carnot cycles. They use (ideally) Eriksen cycles, Rankin cycles, Stirling cycles, Brayton cycles, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the total efficiency of the generator (which is what you see on the part display while it is running) is given by this percentage of carnot efficiency parameter (say 24%) multiplied by 1-T\u003Csub\u003EC\u003C/sub\u003E/T\u003Csub\u003EH\u003C/sub\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hot bath temperature T\u003Csub\u003EH\u003C/sub\u003E is simply equal to the core temperature of the reactors, which you can look up on the table on the first page of the thread, in the wiki or in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present, the cold bath temperature T\u003Csub\u003EC\u003C/sub\u003E is arbitrarily set to 500. In future updates, instead of having an arbitrary value for T\u003Csub\u003EC\u003C/sub\u003E it will instead use the average temperature of your radiators. The key point to take from this if you\u0027re less interested in the actual maths of it is simply: \u003Cem\u003Eby having more radiators to keep your ship cool, the more efficient your electrical generators will be.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce radiators reach the maximum temperature, they will begin to accumulate heat that they can\u0027t dissipate fast enough, so the \u0022WasteHeat\u0022 bar in the resource menu is effectively the danger marker - when that gets full: problems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, as always, there are safety features to prevent things becoming too deadly. Once your WasteHeat bar fills up to 99% of maximum, your reactors will perform emergency shutdowns in order to prevent the accumulation of further dangerous waste heat. This is no big deal for antimatter reactors, you can simply restart them once the heat level drops to safe limits. The fission reactors, however, are not designed to be shut down completely but rather operate continuously at, at least, a low power level. They are capable of shutting down but doing so is an emergency procedure and they will then require maintenance to get them working again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould you somehow keep generating heat (actually rather difficult with all the safety features) and reach the 100% mark, death and explosions will result.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairan","CreatedById":85361,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T00:53:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll see that the static solar panels and the RTGs don\u0027t produce any waste heat, for now I think these are too small to be worthy of modelling.
