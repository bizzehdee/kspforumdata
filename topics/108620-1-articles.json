I\u0027ve implemented a redo of an old plane but I only got to like 17k before my basic engine(it uses rapier turbo and a basic) gets a message saying air compression failed on the basic engine at 17kish and it starts to go downward instead of up. I haven\u0027t figured the new aerodynamics out yet. I was flying straight up and all three engines were running.\n\nBTW, what is that new message. usually it just says air intake out or something.\n\n[http://www./download/cc4wy2bca4oatfe/AEIOU_Ion_Craft_1_0_V1.craft](http://www./download/cc4wy2bca4oatfe/AEIOU_Ion_Craft_1_0_V1.craft) \u003C- File craft.\n\nDo you have to do apply some special techniques to get it up that high now? Are the older approaches just not applicable anymore?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T17:59:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 05:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:04:55Z","Content":"None of the stock air-breathing engines function above 30 km anymore as far as I know.\n\nSo no air-hogging. No getting 99% to orbit on turbojets and using 30 m/s to circularize from the rockets. No more magical turbojet engines.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:12:59Z","Content":"On a secondary note. Does the intake with 40 fuel that is inline(the cooler) do anything besides add air intake. Does in improve the engines at all or is it just a reskinned version of the old ones?"}]}
