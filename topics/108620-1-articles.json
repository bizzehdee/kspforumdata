I\u0027ve implemented a redo of an old plane but I only got to like 17k before my basic engine(it uses rapier turbo and a basic) gets a message saying air compression failed on the basic engine at 17kish and it starts to go downward instead of up. I haven\u0027t figured the new aerodynamics out yet. I was flying straight up and all three engines were running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, what is that new message. usually it just says air intake out or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/cc4wy2bca4oatfe/AEIOU_Ion_Craft_1_0_V1.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/cc4wy2bca4oatfe/AEIOU_Ion_Craft_1_0_V1.craft\u003C/a\u003E \u0026lt;- File craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have to do apply some special techniques to get it up that high now?
