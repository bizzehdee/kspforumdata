I have run through career mode a couple times so I have information regarding the science gained from the stock seismic sensor and your modification although it seemed to me at first would be significantly more complicated to set up in the end I have to say I found it to be less complicated but still adds a nice new task to the career mode. Comparing the science gained between the stock and new implementation here is what I found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider at the point in career mode you get the sensor you are still mostly in the 300 level of the science tree. The next instrument you get is the graviolli detector and it is really the bread and butter of science as it is the only instrument you can use in three locals within each biome, so you really need all the science you can to get to this critical device. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I wanted to see how close the science gained between the old and new way the seismic sensors work. Here are my findings...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at my past career runs I see that I got 6 science for every kerbin biome (21), 87.93 for every mun biome (15), and 109.92 for every minmus biome (9). So that is a total science, JUST for kerbin, mun, and minmus, of 2434.23. From what I am seeing from your revised seismic sensor you start at 500 science and then get 2/5 for each successive impact (500, 300, 120, 40, 8 - I am just extrapolating tese numbers based on two impacts on mun and minmus so I might be off). So the total science from the new seismic impact sensor network scheme would be about 960 for each of mun and minmus or around 1936. I have not done kerbin impacts but it appears you have set up the science scaling very close to the original stock device. I must say although setting up the original networks is a bit tedious, it was enjoyable creating the satellite and delivery vehicle. So in the end the science seem to be comparable and it adds an interesting new challenge to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComparing the difficulty acquiring the science between the old and new implementation. Although at first thinking that I would have to setup the setup network on each body (in this case kerbin, mun, and minmue) I felt this new system was going to make things more complicated. However, when you consider to get the 2400ish science from the stock implementation you had to setup landing missions to a total of 45 biomes. In the new system you only need to land 6 sensor stations - which if you add a medium range or one medium and one long range dish gives you the added benefit of six ground based geosynchronous comm relays on each body. As I mentioned earlier I enjoyed designing the light weight ground relays / sensors as well as the lifter that carried all six. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my conclusion is that the science gained from the new implementation (for kerbin, mun, and minmus) is comparable to the stock implementation. Although ultimately you do need to land at all the Biomes (and I believe this should not be changed) for this experiment all you need do is land six ground stations which have the advantage of being multi-tasked and is simpler then planning and making 45ish landing missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can say i\u0027d like to see added is a report of the science gained from this new implementation of the seismic sensor is that there is a record added to the science archives.
