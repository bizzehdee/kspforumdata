Last night, Russia had made a mean joke by pretending that Poland could into space. He couldn\u0027t. Poland had tried joining the EU, but they wouldn\u0027t let him\u00A0into space. He had tried everything else, too. Nothing worked. But Poland had a feeling today would be different. He put on a harness and a spacesuit, as well as a parachute. He tied many party balloons to his harness. \u0022UK, Russia, USA! Of come looking! I CAN into space!\u0022 They came. Poland cut his ropes, and up he went. 900 feet\u00A0up, Poland\u0027s harness broke. \u0022Oh no! Is of falling!\u0022 He pulled his parachute, and came down safely.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cu\u003EPoland\u0027s Can Into Space List\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cu\u003EOf Float to Space with the Balloons\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cu\u003ERun Up the Ramp of Big\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-05T23:57:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2017 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Laythe Squid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TotallyNotHuman","CreatedById":157240,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-08T09:01:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLiked because polandball.

STICK, in the beginning, burst into space. By the end of year one, they had established a complex chain of stations and colonies around and on Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus, to mine ore and bring it back to Kerbin. By the end of year two, there was a thousand-kerbal colony on Duna, with Ike being mined. There was also three mining colonies on Gilly and a small outpost in Eve\u0027s upper atmosphere, for research. By the end of year three, Moho, Eve, and Dres had been colonized, and crewed missions were being launched into the Joolian system, which was colonized by year four. By year five, even distant Eeloo had been colonized. That was when things started to go wrong. In year six, Duna began to push for independence. In yera seven, Eve and and Gilly started competing with each other for profit. Kerbin attempted to stop it, but could\u0027nt. By year nine, all the colonies beyond the Kerbin system were independent. As each one began to look for more resources, war broke out.The Forever War had begun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-20T22:30:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2017 10:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Laythe Squid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAL 9000","CreatedById":140704,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-16T13:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPOLAND CAN INTO SPACE!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022maxresdefault.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9eYL_PUAlHY/maxresdefault.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laythe Squid","CreatedById":175666,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-20T22:37:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EPART 3-EU AND COMPANY\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoland needed one thing: money.
