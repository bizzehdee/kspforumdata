Here is my questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSpace stations in the asteroid belt are not constrained to planet rotation and revolution, so the normal concept of day and year doesn\u0027t really exist, hence they can set their own time. Should they follow Earth time, Kepler-442b time, or they can go with their own time? Should they have 24 hour light and working day, or to be friendly to circadian rhythm, have 6 hour day and 6 hour night? Or some other arbitrary day and night hours? How about leap seconds and leap year? Will they still exist?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKepler-442b and Earth have different orbital period and possibly rotation, so they have different year and possibly different time of day. How can they agree on the same day, week and year? Is that even possible?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLets say someone on Kepler-442b want to watch an eSports tournament on Earth through whatever Twitch-like streaming service in that year. How can they convert their local time to another local time on Earth? Currently its just adding or subtracting the time zone offset from UTC, but from question 2 even the length of year and day can change\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow about interstellar spaceliner ticket departure and arrival time?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow about time onboard interstellar spaceliner ticket? If lets say the interstellar spaceliner is transporting tourists from Kepler-442b to Earth should they use Earth time or Kepler-442b time? How about if the interstellar spaceliner have some sort of subspace communicator or any other magic FTL communication device? Should they target Earth as a relay station or Kepler-442b?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCan people in Kepler-442b and Earth celebrate Christmas, birthdays or any other annual event together? How about Steam summer/winter sales? How about movie releases, or same-day TV telecast?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T06:17:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, on the space station there\u00A0are duty\u00A0shifts, you have several each day and there are no night cycle. If there were families on board that would be diiferent but then you have a gravity problem. This is just like a hospital with three shifts per day.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the latency problem spacetime propagates\u00A0in all directions at the\u00A0speed of light if you can coomunicate without latency you effectively can see the future, so this can cause paradoxes, not in the setup you describe but slight modifications thereof.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we say have earths velocity is relative to a comoving, the speed we expect earth to be moving \u00A0if we extrapololated the\u00A0red shifts we observed to average values. 442 b is relative to a comoving, and relative to that one or the other is undergo more accelerations, this particular world has time dilation relative to the other, and the clocks will tick at different speeds. In this case to communicate,\u00A0earth would need to send out a timing pulse to identify. The time shift is quite significant because the futher two stars are form each othe the higher the probability and diiferential that\u00A0the two stars relative motion will be greater than the velocities of close stars.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T22:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPB666 brings up the same point I was going to. What\u0027s going to give us the most grief is the law of Special Relativity. Depending on with what objects we\u0027re trying to communicate and how they\u0027re moving, we may encounter issues of events being in different chronological orders. On a mild scale, imagine being on a spaceship and getting a New Year\u0027s e-card from your grandchildren before getting your Christmas e-card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately this issue is so cerebral and esoteric that we\u0027ll most likely not know what to do about it until we actually have an extended space civilization to manage, and until we\u0027ve invented some form of FTL communication. If we never do, that\u0027ll put a big hamper on any interstellar Steam sales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T11:19:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace station will probably keep some earth time most suitable for them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nPB666 is right about duty time however lots of activity will have normal business schedule.
