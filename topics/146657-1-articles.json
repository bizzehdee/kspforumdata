The animation does not show up in-game and I get errors in Unity telling me to set the animation to Legacy. I don\u0027t know how to set animations created in Unity to Legacy. I always do it for simple animations done in Blender, and it works just fine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main issue I am having is that I am trying to animate a solar array. It consists of a base, an arm and 5 panels. All these meshes needs to move, and the animation plays without issue in Blender. But for some reason when I export the model and drop it into Unity, the animation is all out of whack and I get like 95 different animation clips. So I decided to try animating in Unity instead of Blender.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is really frustrating\u00A0because I have animated multi-mesh parts in Blender and ran them through Unity in the past without this issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully someone can help me out, because out of ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T20:05:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your animations work in Blender, then just drag and drop the .blend file straight into Unity. It will save you a lot of headache. The animation should work just fine without needing to do anything.
