And not just the mouse scrolling between pages, but the shift\u002Bscroll functionality that allows you to scroll through the categories as well. The scrolling feature is my absolute favorite feature for workflow. I can literally build almost twice as fast with the scroll feature. It allows me to very quickly jump categories and pages to find the part I need with almost zero thought. With the 0.90 update I am constantly flicking my scroll wheel expecting to jump to the next page only to be deeply saddened by the lack of page turning. Having to manually click through the pages and categories is so utterly cumbersome after getting accustomed to the beauty that is PartCatalog\u0027s page scrolling feature.
