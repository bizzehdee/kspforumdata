Specifically regarding fuels, weights, etc. The systems and weights used now are useful as simple numbers that interact with each other, but like another thread mentions, they are not equivalent to real-world. If KSP were to include real-world fuels and a more realistic physics curve, I think it could see much more use in the actual scientific/educational community.

In high school, I voluntarily taught 4th-5th graders about astronomy and these kids were hooked. But I can only stimulate interest in a classroom full of kids per week. A game like KSP on the other hand can possibly stimulate a whole generation of excitement for space-travel (if it gets popular enough). I\u0027ve had a decade long interest in astronomy, but only recently have I been interested in space exploration, that I owe to KSP. With that excitement comes frustration as to how NASA has done nothing outside of LEO due to a lack of funding for 40 years now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolitics has failed us for 40 years and I imagine it will continue to. I think that what we need is a grassroots movement to get our space-program going. Politicians have too many issues to deal with as it is. Things like jobs, the economy, healthcare, social security, and other things are far easier to market then playing golf on the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think excessive scientific accuracy is necessary.

On the other hand I feel that my case is the opposite. For example my dad (also an astronomy nerd) wondered why we never put a lander on Mercury, and why we only got an orbiter there recently. After all, it\u0027s a lot closer than Jupiter or Saturn. I may have wondered the same thing until I discovered the pains of doing so with Moho.

I can\u0027t tell if it\u0027s just because I\u0027m more attuned to it, but I see a lot of exciting reports around about space exploration than I used to; the imminent reality of private space travel is possibly a big driver behind this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding KSP\u0027s influence, realism is entirely irrelevent (indeed can be a detriment). The game does a fantastic job at exciting people about the mechanics of space flight, without getting bogged down in the Rocket Science. The fantastic thing is it demonstrates fundamentals without ever doing so explicitly (e.g. the exponential tradeoff between payload and required fuel; the difficulty gulf between getting to space, and getting to orbit; etc). The thing it does excellently is fire up an interest - people need to be excited first before they\u0027ll be interested to learn all the hard bits! When applied to children, this could mean shaping careers in aerospace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally the (first) thing that gave KSP such wonder was how it showed the seamless transition from: On the Ground, to In Space.
