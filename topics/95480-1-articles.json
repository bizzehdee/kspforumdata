Also, many times when you are ready to go somewhere, your explore contract has yet to show up and the game is unclear on how you are to go about getting that contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to first make all explore contracts available from a separate menu, so you can accept them at any time. Second, entering the sphere of influence of a planet or moon should make its explore contract instantly pop into your main available contracts list rather than causing it to never show up at all. Third, I would change the order in which they show up in the list from the current fairly linear fashion to a more branched model:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you successfully launch a ship into the air and beat the 3000 meter record, you get the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus explore contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter entering the SOI of either the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn or Minmus, the Eve and Duna contracts will show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, all planet explore contracts show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you accept a planet\u0027s explore contract, its moon contracts will all show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd all of these explore contracts should exist in a section below or above the randomly-generated contracts, separated by a line to make it easier to sort between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could develop further into a system of projects that you complete only once each per game, and these would be separate from the randomly-generated contracts. Here are some rough ideas for projects:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) build a fueling station in Kerbin orbit with a docking port and at least 720 liquid fuel and 880 oxidizer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) dock two craft in space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) bring a ship to orbit with 40% or more fuel/oxidizer mass, and which has LN-N(s) for propulsion, and a mobile lab -- good for later use to go to another planet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) catch the first Duna Hohmann Transfer window (with a very vague estimate given for leave time, and some basic instructions)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) aerobrake at Duna and enter into an orbit or land (project only verifies that craft entered atmosphere and then either went back to space or landed without being destroyed--the rest is for the player to discover)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) land an air-breathing plane on Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.) various projects to discover various anomalies (with very rough estimations as to their appearance and location--the Kerbals picked up something on scans?)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-03T06:20:54Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2015 06:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T06:13:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe have the explore contracts for Mun and Minmus occur once you\u0027ve obtained orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T09:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how they already happen.
