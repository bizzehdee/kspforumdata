Name\u0027s Luuko. Former US Navy Sailor, current Senior at Radford University, Virginia, USA. (I\u0027ll work on my profile after I post this.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust found and purchased this yesterday after Lord_Stimpy\u0027s Campaign Mode vid series caught my eye on Youtube and made me aware of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured what better way to make an introduction than to say hello and to offer up a video of play (warts and all) of my first successful circular orbit, satellite deployment and landing. (Hopefully no-one will bite me for posting this in the wrong thread!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.livestream.com/luuschannel/video?clipId=pla_4dfc0bda-570f-4052-8f2f-d319e43617ba\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.livestream.com/luuschannel/video?clipId=pla_4dfc0bda-570f-4052-8f2f-d319e43617ba\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 total launches in that video. 2 fun failures, 2 successful launches. No crew losses (very proud there!). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecided to make it interesting and as a hats-off to Stimpy to play on this vid by his posted rules. At least, as close as one can get with just vanilla game mechanics and no mods anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I calculated things right...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchievements: 30km sub-orbit, 60km sub-orbit, 80km sub-orbit, 100km sub-orbit, orbit, Satellite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnding Budget: 108,649 Kiribans\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESatellite deployed in circular orbit at just short of 150km near the equator (a little wobble of a few degrees I think). (Time in video is at aprox 1 hour 25 minutes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to apologize for the quality of the video in advance - livestream\u0027s quality is terri-bad.
