Not even bases/colonies have a real purpose with the current science system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I do understand where you\u0027re coming from. However, we have a strong modding community to fill in that gap. At this point, I would consider it a bit of a failing of the community that there are so few exoplanetary-focused mods out there which give bases and stations some real purpose. Most of them are aesthetic at best, and none are particularly rewarding beyond letting you keep doing what you were already doing in the first place to get your station or base set up. The addition of the economy to the game may well help a bit with that; if nothing else, it could well inspire a mod maker to devise a mod which rewards bases with monetary and reputation gains.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T19:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022m1xte\u0022 data-cite=\u0022m1xte\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlayerbase saturated.\u003Cp\u003EMoneyflow stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo potential new players are in control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOld ones already paid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish next version would be 1.0 and \u0022KSP II\u0022 alpha would start. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen i could pay again and squad didn\u0027t need to fish new players outside of original target group by pressing \u0022emergency multiplayer\u0022 button\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI vote for 1.0 and DLCs: resources DLC, MP DLC, Interstellar DLC with multiple star systems, new planets DLSs, parts DLCs, etc. For the same reason.
