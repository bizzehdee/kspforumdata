But I have a bug or incompatibility to report for v1.3, it was with Tellion 6.4x patch. Its hard to diagnostic since it doesn\u0027t crash the game, it froze it. So I can\u0027t produce a crash report or anything. But it seem to be related to science and contract. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was previously running OPM v1.2 with nebuchadnezzar 6.4x hotfix (see #113) and it was working fine. I then installed 1.3 with Tellion 6.4x patch. Started a new game in sandbox to see if it was all good. Everything was looking fine ( I was very exited, It realy looked awesome!) So I opened my carrier save to see if it would work, and it did, at start. The first game freeze happened when I refused a contract to generate an new one. I restarted the game and tried again to see if was a random bug or not. I could reproduce the crash, every 5-10 contract cancelation, the game would freeze. At first, I atributed that bug to one of the contract mod I have. (I updated Mission Controler 2 and Contract window few days ago)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETryed without MC2, bug still there. Without CW, same thing. Without both, same. Edited my save to remove contract related stuff and it didn\u0027t work. At that point I was convinced it my save was just corrupted or something. So I started a new one and decided to not refresh contract at all, its a bit cheaty anyway. But it happened again, this time while I was in flight. At that point, I figured out that it might not be contract mod at all. I so removed OPM and Kopernicus, and now it work. I think that KSP attempt to create contract and crash because of the new planet/biome, or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny one else have a this bug?

But I have a bug or incompatibility to report for v1.3, it was with Tellion 6.4x patch. Its hard to diagnostic since it doesn\u0027t crash the game, it froze it. So I can\u0027t produce a crash report or anything. But it seem to be related to science and contract. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first game freeze happened when I refused a contract to generate an new one. I restarted the game and tried again to see if was a random bug or not. I could reproduce the crash, every 5-10 contract cancelation, the game would freeze. At first, I atributed that bug to one of the contract mod I have. (I updated Mission Controler 2 and Contract window few days ago)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETryed without MC2, bug still there. Without CW, same thing. Without both, same. Edited my save to remove contract related stuff and it didn\u0027t work. At that point I was convinced it my save was just corrupted or something. So I started a new one and decided to not refresh contract at all, its a bit cheaty anyway. But it happened again, this time while I was in flight. At that point, I figured out that it might not be contract mod at all. I so removed OPM and Kopernicus, and now it work. I think that KSP attempt to create contract and crash because of the new planet/biome, or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHm... when did you download the config files? Because the old download link (also) leads to the new patch (the one for OPM 1.4), so maybe the issue lies there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tested it on 1.4 and fail to reproduce contract weirdness or crashes, the things modifying contracts in my install being contract configurator as well as scansat/RT packs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry it again with OPM 1.4, if you can reproduce it reliably, I will need some logs, but I cannot promise anything. Usually, things that freeze the game throw errors before the game itself gets unresponsive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DevilDog0311\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DevilDog0311\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI realize this is a memory-intense mod. I am assuming you are saying: \u003Cp\u003E1. it needs to be the sole mod, or risk being memory-starved thus causing a crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I might be able to use the texture compression, which I have downloaded but not installed yet, in the 32bt KSP then it might work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You state \u0022 if you use KSP 32bit, the best system wont help you much, and if you use KSP 64bit, the best system wont help you much either. Welcome to unity 4.\u0022 I am assuming by that you mean, the 32bit would only have a chance at running this mod with texture compression due to the limit on a 32bit program\u0027s ability to use only 4gigs(approximately)? Also, that the 64bit is not going to allow the full use of my ram?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I have attempted to use this mod, as mentioned in my original post, I have tried 1. on 32bit ksp on a clean install. On 64 bit clean install. No other mods installed. Are you saying that in an install of this mod, in a 32bit clean install(no other mods) that this mod still requires texture compression to be used for it to work properly? Further, are you saying that in a 64bit install it would max my 16gigs(approximately 10-11 gigs free after OS deduction and basic resource/start-up programs)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.It should not require to be the sole mod, but you dont have much to work with in windows 32bit to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Yes, try that. ATM\u0027s efficiency is unparalleled, so that is one of the few things I can imagine helping you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.Using 32bit Ksp, you get a stable client which crashes upon reaching 3-3.5GB, using 64bit you do not even get a stable client (though you might make it over 3.5GB, yay!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the RealSolarSystem plugin is disabled on the 64bit win ksp version I think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.You are right in that it is strange to happen without any other mods installed, but looking at my experience with playing KSP on windows I cannot say it is impossible. Now, I am not that great at reading logfiles myself, but this does look like a memory issue to me, so yes, try ATM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.64bit windows is highly unstable, but 64bit linux is not - that means yes, if you played there, memory would not be the limiting factor. For me, it is CPU and graphics card performance now, but I run a gazillion of mods and my pc is not the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and Eleusis La Arwall suggested opengl mode, that is a very good suggestion. In fact, the only way I ever got KSP loading at all on windows in the last few months was with that option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
