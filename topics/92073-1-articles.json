I\u0027ve got a multi-section ship that I\u0027ve spent the evening shuttling to space for assembly. After finally getting two of the sections close enough to begin docking I proceed to spend the next hour getting them docked (I\u0027m not the best). \u003Cstrong\u003ETHEY DO DOCK\u003C/strong\u003E. However, the shuttling probe that I used to get the pieces into orbit needed to jettisoned so the next part could be attached. Turns out it had no power to deorbit. In my haste I quickload to right before the ship parts docked. I\u0027ve spent the last three hours trying get them to redock and they simply refuse to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve flown the ships apart and back together, rotated them to realign ports, turned things on and off, saved and reloaded, saved and restarted the game, time warped, nothing is working.
