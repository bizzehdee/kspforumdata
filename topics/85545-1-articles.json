When you are close (within 100km is enough) swap to Frofred ( [ or ] key) and use his RCS to get to the now near 0 relative velocity rescue ship. Climb on in and go home. Or do like I did and park him at a station and forget to bring him home. Lost that contract because I only did half of it. You still get to keep Frofred, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick the speed box on the ADI and it changes to surface and target relative speed.
