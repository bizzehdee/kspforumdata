I took the Learstar A1, removed the boosters and main fuel tank and put a copy of it on the Runway. Often when I launch it, the screen shows the VAB interior, then loads the aircraft on the runway. The aircraft then falls through the ground and the runway blows up. The same happens if I take an originally SPH ship, add boosters/launch vehicle/etc, then launch it on the LaunchPad, it falls through the ground and destroys the launch pad. Is this a new form of the Kraken? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T02:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tested this in 0.90 and couldn\u0027t reproduce the issue.
