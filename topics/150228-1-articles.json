The first four episodes will not be connected but episodes 5 through 12 will be a minmus story arc, excluding 6 and 10, which are episodes based on other kerbals (the implication is that they are en-route to Minmus, and that the episode would be too boring as a full episode. There will be scenes at the start with the main five characters though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEpisode 1 is complete, and will be uploaded to youtube on my Pokesanity channel on 18 October.\u00A0 Videos will go up daily until October 30, when Episode 12 will come out on November 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
