My question is regarding the second stage of the modified Saturn V rocket, used to launch Skylab into space in 1973. As far as I know, the modified Saturn V actually consisted of the normal first and second stage, with the third stage being replaced by Skylab itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case of the \u0022normal\u0022 Saturn V, the first and the second stage would usually crash down into the ocean, while the third stage -\u00A0which carried the instrument unit -\u00A0could be steered into another directory after the CSM/LM where separated from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Skylab however, I can\u0027t see, how the second stage would be removed from orbit, after placing Skylab in its orbit and being separated. It does not seem, like the second stage featured the necessary instrumental equipment or the means of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E necessary. Does this mean, that the second stage was just moved away from Skylab a bit at separation\u00A0with solid boosters, but left in an orbit slightly different than Skylabs orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope someone here can provide an answer...

That would mean it would experience more drag than Skylab as well, further lowering its orbit over time. With Skylab being launched on the 14th and crew being launched on the 25th, the S-II would have been in a very different orbit and probably posing no danger to the crewed mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-21T23:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the original proposals (iirc) was to use a Saturn 1 to launch a stage into orbit (with engines and tanks and everything) that later would have been broken into by a crew and converted into a station, wet workshop style.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey canceled it in favor of Skylab, the \u0022dry workshop.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I think it would be really, REALLY cool if they had kept the second and third stages connected on the Skylab mission, and used the second stage as a wet workshop.
