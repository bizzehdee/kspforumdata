So far this little station is pretty sweet. I\u0027m getting ready to fly the sucker to Mun and Minmus but I\u0027ve run into a problem. When I\u0027m in the orbital display, I cannot place maneuvering nodes on the orbits anymore. I can click but nothing happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a pilot on board and I can set it to prograde, retrograde, etc and all that works just fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume the game is confused by all the engines and potential command nodes on the station. Is there anything I should be looking at in particular to restore the ability to set maneuver nodes? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean I *could* just eyeball it to the moons. I did that on my first Munar flight, just manually lined up prograde and fired the engines since I hadn\u0027t unlocked patched conics yet. However, when trying to fly a nearly 100 ton station, that seems like it might be a bit of a headache...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meecrob","CreatedById":104543,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T02:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI get the same issue sometimes.

But seriously, stations are often asymmetrical (with regard to their center of mass) and tend to be more flimsy so they\u0027re difficult to move once built. Whereas a \u0022ship\u0022 (assembled in orbit) is generally designed to have it\u0027s COM central and directly inline with it\u0027s COT and has a more ridged design (typically things being more inline with each other, rather than having heavy parts off to the sides and joined with large docking ports). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, Welcome to the Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T13:21:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of outright eyeballing, undock the lander, calculate the node with it, remember the values, dock it back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
