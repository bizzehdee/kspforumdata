I went on a science expedition on Minmus and managed to get science from every biome except the slopes. Whenever I try, the game thinks I\u0027m in the Minmus \u0027Lowlands\u0027. Obviously slopes is a transitional biome, however, I have tried on all locations on hills where slopes should be and the biome still never registers. Even when I\u0027m in an area where there should be no lowland biomes for kilometers the game still gives me the science for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am nearly certain that this isn\u0027t user error and that the game is registering the slopes as \u0027Lowlands\u0027.
