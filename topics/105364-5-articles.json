This is made especially frustrating as struts are locked away behind a 45-science node and you start with small tanks. I find it somewhat ridiculous that you need to stack 6 tier-2 fuel tanks (not the tiny ones but the next upgrade) in a big wobbly spaghetti rocket just to get the TWR of the most basic engine below 2!

They are basically indestructible at any speed or altitude. You can completely ignore re-entry heating and just hammer your craft into the atmosphere at 4k/s, pop your shoot, watch your gees max out for a couple seconds and then its a long boring drift to the surface. This really needs to be fixed, no parachute should be able to withstand those forces, or any Kerbal for that matter.\n\nSAS is broken. Even a very short stiff craft, a Mk1 and one fuel tank and one engine, often gets stuck in a wobble that uses up all your RCS or battery. Wobble isn\u0027t even the right term, its more live a vibration. The craft stays steady but the gimbals and RCS just fire like crazy in all directions. \n\nAnd yes, I know someone will say \u0022Derrr just don\u0027t uses SAS\u0022 but thats not the point. After you\u0027ve been playing the game for years you just want to run your mission, not have to be at the controls micro-managing every single maneuver. This is why SAS exists and right now it makes playing the game a chore. \n\nThose are the big ones so far that I\u0027ve noticed. I intensely dislike the polar orbit insta scan, I was really expecting it to be more like ScanSat or Kethan where you actually have to scan the surface one orbit at a time and it mad sense to plant multiple satellites in multiple orbits, but this is just a preference, not really broken, just bad. \n\nBut really, those parachutes, those are the worst, re-entry is now much easier and much less interesting than it was before, which should be the opposite of what 1.0 was supposed to do."}]}
