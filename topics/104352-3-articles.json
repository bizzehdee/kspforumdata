You attach individual fairing sections and adjust them, then repeat until the fairing is complete, similar to how KW or NovaPunch do their fairings except with extra customization. Unfortunately, this method of fairing construction does lead to confetti fairings where each section gets separated when the fairing gets jettisoned.\n\nI think KW or NovaPunch fairings opens clam shell style even if build from parts, you first add the bottom adapter, then put decopler and payload on top, then you add the rings and the top.\n\nThen you drop it it split down the vertical seam and from the base, I thought I remember having to use seperatrions on the larger ones. \n\nMain downside of premade fairings is the huge part count and the limited size, I regularly make stuff who is 7.5 meter wide.\n\nThey also showed some preview where they draw the fairing as an line around the payload. \n\nThe seperation picture looks like seperate parts but why is the two straight body pieces different, one is slightly shorter than the other and is yellow on inside.\n\nI suspect that the upper section is not straight but angle a bit, this causes it to get an yellow inside like the top part. I guess the top is an standard nosecone, this let us have insterstage fairing pretty free but we have to get rid of the nosecone as in seperator."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T02:25:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They\u0027ve addressed most everything else, the next update is looking pretty good.

Would you rather have fairings separate as clamshells or as confetti similarly seen in the Squadcast summary? I know I would like to see an option to separate as either, and on top of that, how many sections separate. For instance, interstages could be made by creating a fairing that separates into only one piece.\n\nI am by no means trying to bash Squad or jump to conclusions based on the pictures we have received (as things change - such as the toroidal 8 fuel tank), I want to see the general interest of the community on this topic.\n\nEDIT: Keep up the excellent work Squad! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-19T03:26:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2015 03:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpenSpaceCorp**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T03:20:14Z","Content":"IMHO, after a bit of searching through the forums and a thorough examination of the screenshot, I have come to the conclusion that the picture is showing off the ability of the player to determine where and how the fairing separates.

While i personally am not one to give a crap about 100% realism, i feel itd look better splitting into 2-4 whole pieces and not alot of small junk.\n\nNow id very much love to be able to configure how many petals there are when they split, as almost all of my designs use 3 or 6 way symmetry, and id very much like to have the fairings split into 3 or 6 parts as well. Not that im gonna complain if i dont get that option, but itd be nice to keep them with the trend of my sci-fi designs."}]}
