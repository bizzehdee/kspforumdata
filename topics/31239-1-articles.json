There was a positive message contained in the hard- and somewhat less hard sci-fi of the late 40\u0027s through the 60\u0027s, that for mankind\u0027s myriad struggles and adversity there exist concrete solutions, that science endows us with powers literally magical compared to those possessed by man for the vast bulk of the history of his existence, and that there is nothing truly fundamental stopping us from forging our destiny across the milky way. Anyway suffice it to say that I heartily recommend Heinlein\u0027s juveniles, such as Space Cadet, or some of his collection like The Past Through Tomorrow. Clarke\u0027s Rendezvous with Rama was excellent, but also checkout A Fall of Moondust, Earthlight or The Fountains of Paradise. Issac Asimov, while being my favorite, was probably consistently the least hard of the three (...at least in terms of his fiction). He regularly employed tropes such as hyperdrive and forcefields, but he did generally attempt to respect science throughout. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t neglect more recent authors though! I totally agree with Promii regarding Charles Stross, and Mr Shifty regrading Vernor Vinge. As far as relatively recent hard sci-fi goes I would add Karl Schroeder and Peter Watts to the list. Particularly good was Schreoder\u0027s Permanance; Sun of Suns isn\u0027t exactly the kind of hard sci-fi you\u0027d normally expect, but it is a scientifically plausible subversion of the currently popular steampunk sub-genre.
