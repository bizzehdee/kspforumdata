I installed it nice and new and decided to add some mods included but not limited to Mechjeb, KSI, Interstellar, Infernal Robotics, B9 rocketry, KAS, shuttle orbiter, etc..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were a couple downloads that required \u0027Firespitter\u0027 to be replaced 3 or so times due to it being in a lot of the mods/plugins/parts I downloaded. All of my downloads were moved to the Gamedata folder, which I would assume they would go because the download files would have everything in a Gamedata folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I started KSP up for the first time after installing all these nice things and the game randomly closed halfway through the loading screen with no error messages. Upon inspection and squinting eyes it appeared as though the game crashed while loading files from \u0022landerCabinInternals\u0022 from gamedata\\squad. I simply removed the folder and put it onto my desktop for safekeeping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started KSP once again and this time it seems like it stopped while loading something from \u0022GenericSpace1\u0022 from gamedata\\squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is getting disappointing real fast. Can somebody help me solve this issue?

I suggest deleting those, re-attempting KSP, and then checking after it crashes. If a new one appears, this lends strength to a RAM-issue theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mention KSPI and B9, both part-heavy mods. Part textures are the single greatest RAM-burden during load. During runtime, part textures continue to weigh the system down, but plugins can have somewhat erratic memory consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be noted that the B9 release page itself describes ATM (Active Texture Management) as \u0022practically required,\u0022 just by itself. There are two preconfigured versions, a basic and an aggressive. Download the aggressive, install it with preconfigured settings, and see how that works. If you do manage to get to the title screen, alt-tab out to Task Manager and see how much memory the ksp.exe process is using. If it\u0027s anywhere above 3GB (which is likely, depending on the exact extent of your mod list) then know that no matter what you do, you\u0027ll always be crash-prone. Consider removing mods, or at least pruning duplicate parts from certain mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
