Same issue occurs on all planets with atmo. I\u0027m currently using the latest 1.2 version from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E (0.0250), but I\u0027ve tried all the different .dll\u0027s and shaders posted on the past few pages and the ones that worked all shared this problem. I\u0027ve also tried experimenting with the settings but can\u0027t find the one that would lower the hard outer edge down to the black band between the true atmosphere and the inverted one. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For the time being I\u0027ve disabled all the planet configs--so I can still use Scatterer\u0027s sunflare and terrain shadows at least--but I\u0027d really love to be able to use its atmo effects again as well. I can post my player.log as well, if that would be helpful.\n\u003E \n\nI already mentioned I will make a setting to fix this.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 29 minutes ago, Galileo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hey blackrack, I will be home soon and want to test out the new scatterer. my only question is this, will the newest version work in 1.1.3? The planet pack I\u0027m working on is going to have to be released on 1.1.3 because kopernicus\u0027 future is uncertain for now with the dev being busy IRL. if not its all good. I was perfectly happy with the older versions as well\n\u003E \n\nCurrent version won\u0027t work on 1.1.3, but since 1.2 is not officially released I could make a 1.1.3 release."}]}
