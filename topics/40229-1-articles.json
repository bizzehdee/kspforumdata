In general SSTOs that go much beyond orbit need to be spaceplanes. I have seen non-plane SSTOs go to the Mun and Minmus but in general not farther. I have begun experimenting with non-plane SSTOs though, and especially with the ARM parts it seems they have more potential.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T16:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh good - looking forward to what you come up with.

Beyond orbit, what\u0027s the point in carrying around all those wings, landing gear and jets? Arguably useful for other planets/moons with an atmosphere and particularly fun for Laythe, of course, otherwise - SSTO then detach vacuum transfer/landing stage to carry out the mission and return. Dock and land later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: Er, yes, I might just be being bloody awkward here but I want to encourage people - especially beginners - to look at the cheap and easy possibilities of non-plane SSTOs and designing for different mission stages.
