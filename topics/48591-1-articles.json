It wants to attach to every part around the one you want, but no amount of mouse wiggling will get it into the position you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is especially noticeable with fuel tanks which don\u0027t want to connect vertically with other fuel tanks, if there\u0027s the possibility of attaching radially to another nearby part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion would be toggle button which allows you to select a single part on your existing rocket. Whilst the toggle button is active, that part is the only one new parts can attach to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"possum","CreatedById":84085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T08:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am familiar with that problem and like that idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
