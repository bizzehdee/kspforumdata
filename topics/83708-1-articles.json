Toppled vehicle trick: if torque or RCS is not enough to right the vehicle on its own and you are on a slope (one of two main reasons for toppling - the other is to high a lateral vector on landing) retract your gear, point nose up the slope use retro RCS to build up speed going backwards downhill, extend gear (for one vehicle on the Mun the magic speed was about 2.5m/s) the gear catches and the vehicle topples upwards, enable SAS and leave RCS on and use attitude controls to find the right stable up attitude or thrust with main engines and take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
