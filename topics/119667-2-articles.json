The meaningful statistic for safety wrt power production is deaths per kWh. For the whole world total, deaths per tWh. Coal and hydro are terrible (the latter largely from a huge dam disaster in China---and actually chinese coal is also pretty bad). Solar and wind kill very few people, but the power they produce is no more than noise, so a tiny handful of deaths wrecks their mortality rate. Note that they have very low rates, under 1 death per tWh. Nukes are safer because they make so very much power, with relatively few issues. If we had a Chernobyl every few years, they\u0027d start looking less safe (they\u0027d still beat coal since nuke power beats coal by 3 orders of magnitude).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace reactors are not a problem.

If your math turns out an unbelievable result, it\u0027s usually best to actually disbelieve it and look for your error instead of taking it for truth.\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of using nuclear reactors for space applications isn\u0027t new. And it\u0027s not as simple as you think it is. For example, you conveniently ignore the mass of the radiators required to cool the reactor, which is not trivial - in fact, the majority of the reactor\u0027s output is going to be waste heat. The NTR does not require radiators, because the fuel carries the heat away. If you\u0027re producing power, the heat needs to go somewhere. You did not notice this because you went straight from \u0022the reactor produces heat\u0022 to \u0022I am converting mechanical into electrical energy\u0022. But where does that mechanical energy come from? You forgot the heat engine, the part that converts thermal energy into mechanical energy. And that part is massively inefficient, which causes the huge amount of waste heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome 15 years ago, NASA construted a test reactor called the SAFE-400 (\u0022Safe Affordable Fission Engine\u0022). It produced just 400 kW of thermal power, and it had a built-in dynamo driven by an equally built-in brayton cycle turbine - the best heat engine that physics knows how to build today. It\u0027s rated electrical output was 100 kW. In other words, 25% of the reactor\u0027s output was usable, and 75% was waste heat. At 520 kg weight, the reactor had a specific power of 192 W/kg... and that is presumably measured without the mass of the radiators required to deal with the 300 kW waste heat, since such a thing was not part of the experiment setup according to photos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpscaling the reactor would yield better mass ratios and increase the specific power. Perhaps a fancy cryocooled generator could further improve things, but probably not by a lot, since a.) that is not where the major losses are in the first place and b.) cryocoolers are heavy and require even more radiators. However, to get anywhere close to your dream of 10 kW/kg, the reactor would need to become 52 times as efficient as it was in NASA\u0027s lab... and then it would need to become even more efficient, because that still ignores the weight of the radiators. Unfortunately I need to tell you: this is not going to happen. Even if the SAFE-400 had absolutely zero losses, it would still only have posted ~770 W/kg. And you are never going to get a lossless conversion. 300 W/kg? Sure, may work on a large-scale reactor. Maybe even 500 W/kg in the future, if such reactors were being actively developed, which they are not. 10-100 kW/kg?

For a heat sink of 300K, the Carnot efficiency is 80%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the Carnot efficiency isn\u0027t a limit you can ever actually reach, only approach. And the closer to the Carnot efficiency you get, the more cumbersome and heavy your equipment becomes. The best that is usually achieved in practice is with a combined cycle gas turbine, which uses a gas turbine running on the Brayton cycle, with a bottoming Rankine cycle powered by the Brayton cycle\u0027s exhaust. These achieve thermal efficiencies of about 50% from a 1400K heat source, or in other words, about 60% of the Carnot efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real kicker is that the lower your heat sink temperature, the bigger your radiators have to be, so if you try and save mass by cranking up the Carnot efficiency by dropping the heat sink temperature, the less effectively your radiators work. Radiative heat transfer scales with the fourth power of temperature, so if you drop the heat sink temperature from 500K to 300K, you more or less triple the size of the radiators for a given heat rejection rate, while only reducing the heat you need to reject by about 60%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, Atomic Rockets have a section on this, and it turns out that if you want to minimise radiator mass while maximising power, your heat sink temperature needs to be about 80% of your heat source temperature.

The only assumptions necesary are that the power source obeys the laws of thermodynamics and that the starship may only get rid of waste heat by radiating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us assume that we have a heat engine as a power source with a relative efficiency of \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B7, and an absolute efficiency is \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B7 times the Carnot efficiency \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B5. We can write the available free power, F, as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF = Q\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B7\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B5 = Q\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B7(1 - T1/T2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere Q is the rate of heat flow into the exchanger and T1 and T2 are the temperatures of the cold and hot sides of the engine, respectively.

No pump, no heat exchangers, no expander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA power plant for electricity generation is a significantly more heavy and complex machine than something that just heats up fuel and spits it out the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, it appears that the average Combined Cycle power station gets around 60%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear reactors only get around 40% because of the low coolant temperatures, around a mere 300 degrees celsius. This is due to the fact that water will boil even if pressurized above around 370 degrees. Thus nuclear reactors run well below that margin to prevent coolant boiling in the reactor core and corrosion of the fuel rods which are supposed to last three to four years. This is of course assuming you are using a PWR. If you are using a BWR you have a slightly different problem, the coolant is the moderator, and when it boils it becomes a lot less effective at moderating, thus more boiling shuts down the reactor, creating a strong negative feedback loop in the reactor core and preventing the temperature from getting that high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this is assuming you are using water as a coolant, and you are not using something like the currently being researched SCWR. Now for a reactor on a spaceship you would not want water as a coolant, moderator or anything. You would probably be using a gas cooled fast reactor running the carnot cycle, or a liquid metal cooled fast reactor using a thermocouple. If you want to get really fancy (though I do not know how well this would work, with the neutrons actively altering the material) you could integrate the thermocouple directly into the fuel rods, with the only coolant being liquid metal going to the radiators located on the cold side of the hollow thermocouple integrated fuel rods. Mind, thermocouples would not be efficient, but they would save on mass compared to a giant turbine, and in this sanario fuel is most certainly not a concern, though again, I have a feeling that the neutrons would be a problem, damaging the thermocouple over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking over the article they seem a tad optimistic. Before we begin to fret over if people will oppose the launch, we must look at getting an extremely light reactor that is easy to control, can change power output quite a bit very quickly, needs no maintenance throughout the trip, and most importantly has large margins of safety. Tests in a vacuum chamber lasting a few hours may be good, and definitely provide some ideas, however they do not provide the same experience running one for a few years under varying conditions and loads would. While knowledge regarding the gross points of the design are easily obtainable it is probable that the finer points, such as corrosion of some obscure but essential part, take time to identify.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T10:15:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 10:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NuclearNut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T11:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NuclearNut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NuclearNut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, it appears that the average Combined Cycle power station gets around 60%.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is true (I actually do mention CCGTs in a subsequent post, but I was in nuclear mode at this point).
