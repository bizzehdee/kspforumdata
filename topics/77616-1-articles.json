First of all, the example planet is merely what the noise generates on a particular seed. Copyrighting that is like copyrighting a number, the seed. There are no copyright issues here. Kerbal Space Program likely uses libnoise since there is a port of it for Unity and that is what most people in Unity use for perlin noise generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, all libnoise does is take coordinates and output the height at that coordinate. The settings of libnoise determine how high resolution the noisemap will be, as well as the addressing system you use. (How often you sample the noise map, every two millimeters or every foot?) If your addressing system samples at larger values, the noise will still be the same noise, it will just not be as high of a resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat each individual application does with the noise is up to that application. Kerbal Space Program has highly stylized planets, so it samples at fairly large rates. It is completely dependent on the application, it\u0027s style, and it\u0027s renderer. Whereas Kerbal Space Program has to render this stuff in real time, and have an LOD model that can scale from space to ground seamlessly AND wrap around spherically (libnoise handles the spherical part, not the LOD though), Terragen spends several minutes rendering small chunks of noise. It is not designed to run in real time, so it can sample at higher resolutions and spend more time lighting the scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T21:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ea few things have been added according to the wiki\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-14T21:46:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2014 09:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by megatiger78\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T21:51:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eopps double post\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
