Because the node is instantaneous but your ship is not, you end up burning a portion of your burn \u0022radial in\u0022 for a while at the start of your long burn, then as you pass Periapsis you start to burn a portion \u0022radial out.\u0022 In KSP2, though, the entire burn is Prograde, and what is Prograde changes over the course of the burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I set up a simple test. I got a craft with a poor engine and a lot of fuel into a 100km orbit and set up an ejection burn to 50Mm (halfway between Dres and Jool). I only picked this number because it was reasonably large and reasonably easy to remember, and also caused my ship to need to do about a 7 minute burn.

I also stated in that thread\u00A0 (as you should know) that\u00A0 for an optimal ejection burn using this new system,\u00A0 especially if it is a longer one, you will have to add a radial inward component to your maneuver node, as you have shown here. I still however stand by my contention that at least for advanced levels of inter-body navigation, especially if multiple periapsis kicks are required, this system is not as easy to work with as the KSP1 system for generating the most efficient possible burns. That\u0027s because if you really know how to use the KSP1 node system, you can figure out how to closely approach the optimal burn profile considerably more easily, because 1) you don\u0027t have to fiddle about a bunch to optimize how far inward of prograde you need to aim at the outset to put your burn vector on the optimal secant to approximate an instantaneous impulse at the best spot, and 2) If you need to do multiple periapsis kicks, the KSP2 node is really unhelpful in terms of where to place those, whereas the KSP1 node pretty much tells you exactly where that should be right off the bat. As to why I made my original, incorrect statement of what the KSP2 node does, I think it\u0027s because it gets confused and doesn\u0027t really give you the right trajectory in some situations,\u00A0 like space planes that have multiple parallel engines that can be toggled on and off for very different \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (my most common vessel), and burns where two stages with widely disparate TWRs are used sequentially. At any rate, in order to dispel any notion that I just live to disparage KSP2, I will see what I can do to adapt my\u00A0 navigational approach to the new system and report on what I find here.\u00A0 I will also investigate what situations might confuse the trajectory prediction algorithm.
