There are so many great tutorials out there that it\u0027s difficult to put out content that meets that standard of awesome.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, this is definitely not your definitive \u0022tutorial to end all tutorials\u0022 on rendezvous maneuvers. It\u0027s rushed, not completely comprehensive, maybe it has several errors... but it has dramatic music and large friendly easy to read letters, so It\u0027s got that going for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t use maneuver nodes when time isn\u0027t an issue. A few laps in orbit and a few well placed burns will eventually get you in-line with your target. This is that method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FfYIkzgkhMM?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022KSP2 Freestyle Rendezvous\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you enjoy!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFLY SAFE!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
