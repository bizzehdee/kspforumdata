Thrust to weight ratio (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E): A \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.4 or more and pulling full throttle all the way up trough the lower atmosphere will likely get you in trouble. In reallife rockets are throttled continously\u00A0 to avoid exceeding pressurewaves along the fuselage (Max pressure limits at various speeds and shapes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Drag: The use of cones and fairings is highly recommended, blunt surfaces will bend your contraption if you like it or not. Even large blunt tails\u00A0 (i.e. Space Shuttle center tank) without rounded bottom increase drag alot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Reaction wheels: More than one large active reaction wheel on a multistage craft will inevitably create trouble, having seven different reaction wheels all over the multistage rocket in different sizes, is likely to fail. Disable excessive reaction wheel authority during launch and you will be happier.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E: We don\u0060t need \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E during launch, never.

Center of mass (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E): Ideally, we want to have a launchvehicle which has and keeps\u00A0 the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E above the middle of the height of the rocket. But this is KSP, and we launch how and when we like to launch our pancake, i know. But designing your launchvehicle so that it stays topheavy is beneficial for your space program. Take a close look how soyuz and some proton rockets are buildt, the center stage is sometimes tappered wider on the upper half for this reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Max pressure: Maximum pressure occours at a certain height, speed and atmospheric condition, and is also depending on your individual launchprofile. Don\u0060t slam your rocket into a wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Engine gimbal: Most of the available rocket motors for the first stage provide gimbaling by default. Reduce gimbal massively or disable gimbaling completely on asparagus style first stages on the outer engines, and your rocket will never be seen again on Kerbin...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. Struts: Struts are meant to stiffen your core stage and connect boosters and the like with the core. You get the idea. Putting lots of struts to your craft can be necessary, but usually it takes just a minimum amount for the desired effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9. Control surfaces: Adding control surfaces and fins on strategic points on your rocket mostly helps, but avoid overengineering which often results in resonance to other means of control like reaction wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10. Fairings: As far as i have seen fairings work fine in the current state of KSP2 (around EA 0.1.4 \u002B), even giant ones do their job quite well. So i highly recommend the use of fairings, as intended by the devs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n11: Solid Boosters: Solid boosters (Aka \u0060\u0060The Poor Mans Launchpad\u0060\u0060) are very usefull to save on methalox stages, its an issue of economy and designing concept to overcome the thick atmosphere on the cheap. I highly recommend the use of solid boosters to save on overall weight of the launchvehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n12. Gravity turn: Turning down your rocket gently towards the horizon while gaining altitude is a core challenge in KSP and KSP2, if your 1500 ton twelve stage interplanetary launchvehicle can do this with activated fine controls, you have won the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n13. G-forces: We have a G-force indicator left to the Kerbal portraits, which is also very usefull to keep a sane amount of thrust while ascend, i don\u0060t observe this feature often myself, but sometimes it is helpfull.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne picture to think about:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WFh8VWb.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WFh8VWb.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy launchings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this little guide was somewhat usefull for one or the other (New) player...\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-14T19:54:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2023 07:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 14\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Mikki\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eyou guess it typo, and spell, G-force\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Socraticat","CreatedById":176118,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-10T02:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGimbals and control surfaces should be \u003Cem\u003Eadjusted to the minimum percentage necessary to function properly\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eto reduce the \u0022resonance\u0022 that you\u0027re talking about.
