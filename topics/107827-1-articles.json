Nevertheless I have some things I would like to have in the game which are not:\n\n1: It is hard to tell astronauts apart. I tried sending two of them in a capsule each on the same ship into orbit, and I had a hard time keeping track of which was which and doing what even with just the two of them up there. I would like to be able to tell which capsule is occupied just by looking at them. I would also like to be able to tell whether an astronaut is a scientist, an engineer or a pilot just by looking at them. Perhaps different colored uniforms depending on job or some way of customizing them even? Failing that, is there some way of renaming them to something other than Bill and Bob Kerbal? If there isn\u0060t then that would be a good idea as well.\n\n2: A log of the research you\u0060ve done. Not the tech tree stuff but biomes. Since you get different equipment at different times it can be too much to keep track of whether you\u0060ve landed with your barometer in a desert or whether or not you brought your goo canister to a particular crater on Mun. And the more gear you get and places you can get to the more impossible it gets. Perhaps a biome breakdown tab in the science facility that registers each biome you\u0060ve done any research in, which experiments you\u0060ve done etc. But please please, oh pretty please with sugar on top give me some way of keeping track of all this! If my head explodes it will be your fault!\n\n3: I know the game is hard enough as it is (Trust me, I\u0060m the one who really knows...) but I would like to see life support added to the game, at least as an option for a hard game. One of my astronauts was marooned in orbit without fuel and he\u0060s still there years later, right as rain. It\u0060s not that I want him to die, even though this will obviously be his fate whenever I get around to \u0022rescuing\u0022 him in my inept fashion. But it doesn\u0060t feel very realistic in an otherwise quite realistic simulation to not have life support in it at all.\n\n4: Weather would be nice. Again it\u0060s not that I want to explode, but weather would just make the whole thing more interesting, and the planets with atmosphere feel more real.\n\nI can\u0060t think of anything else at the moment. At least nothing that isn\u0060t my fault. I\u0060m not complaining though to be perfectly clear about that. KSP is a wonderful game as it is and the most fun I\u0060ve had in ages. I also realize that it\u0060s a work in progress and that you\u0060re presumably very busy with more important things so soon after launch. But if you could at least look into doing something about the first point I raised in a reasonable time frame I\u0060d appreciate it very much. That sounds like it could be pretty simple. \n\nPS Oh and if any of the stuff I mentioned can be fixed with mods or it\u0060s actually in the game and I haven\u0060t found it then I apologize. I will just blame it on being a complete noob and pretend like nothing happened."},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T07:28:18Z","Content":"Totally agreeing with 3 and 4. \n\n3: Maybe as extra difficulty level: If selected, it would release extra equipment for life support.\n\n4: Would be realistic as hell but also would need good computing power."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T08:03:55Z","Content":"Number two you can view in the research center archives, but I do wish there was a way to view all the science you haven\u0027t done yet."},{"CreatedByName":"Octa","CreatedById":140058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T08:10:06Z","Content":"Agree with 1, some stripes on the suit and a badge on the IVA-Icon would bee good enough\n\nOn number 2: Go to the Science-Building and when you see the tech tree, there should be 2 buttons at the top left, iirc. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n3: One of my first posts here was a wall of text regarding some mods that should be stock and some that shouldn\u0027t.

Just some clouds forming in the oceans, move those around a bit and then some rain would be more than enough for me. Even if it\u0060s just cosmetic and for the cloud cover I\u0060d be for it, if it can be done without slowing things down too much.\n\nAs for life support I don\u0060t really see why something like that shouldn\u0060t be an optional game mechanic. I mean I\u0060m as bad as it gets with flight simulators. Hell I\u0060m even terrible at racing games. Anything mechanical that moves and I will crash it into something. But even I miss life support in KSP because I understand that it\u0060s one of the major obstacles to space travel full stop. It just feels weird not to have anything at all. Again, it doesn\u0060t have to be full out with urine bags out the hatch and eating minaturized soup cubes every five minutes.
