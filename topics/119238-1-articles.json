However I noticed that because of something I didn\u0027t check pre-flight, one of my four bottom lander stage tank/engines does not have a fuel line attached. This will obviously result in a very unbalanced mess on ascent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had the idea today in the shower (where all good KSP ideas happen) to send an unmanned parts ship with KIS/KAS useables to reattach the one fuel line, and add a few parachutes I forgot. Does anyone know if this is possible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T14:06:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStock fuel lines and struts can\u0027t be attached to two parts via KIS.
