It is very difficult, requires practice and not recommended for your first landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good compromise is to let the ship fall and gain some velocity and brake every so often to maintain a reasonable speed of descent.

If you plan on bringing it home, 4 blue-tip chutes (or 8 gray-tips, or 16 radials) will set it down quite safely back on Kerbin so that\u0027s the easy part. Just have it shed any redundant parts like engines and fuel tanks after your do the deorbit burn and before re-entry and you\u0027ll be fine. This just leaves landing on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most fuel-efficient, but also the most skill-required, method for landing on an airless world is the so-called \u0022suicide burn\u0022. In this case, you do a deorbit burn from a reasonably \u0022high\u0022 low orbit (30-100km or so, depending on the world) and then coast most of the way down. Then, at a point just before it\u0027s too late, you fire the engines full blast, timed so you stop just above the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis takes a lot of trial and error to get right, and it also makes it hard to have fine control over the terrain of your landing spot because you can\u0027t really tell what the terrain will be like until you get down to it, by which time it\u0027s too late to do much about it without wasting all the fuel you were trying to save. Landing spot terrain is a big factor in Mun landings because the terrain alternates rapidly between reasonably flat and OMGTOOSTEEP! all over the surface due to scads and scads of small, steep craters you can only see from low altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I do all my Mun landings using the way less-efficient but way easier and safer \u0022stop and drop\u0022 method. In this scenario, you\u0027re the lowest safe orbit, which is about 10km. As your ship goes along, you carefully note the terrain just ahead. You get a very good idea of what it\u0027ll actually be like on the surface this way. When you see a likely spot coming, burn hard retrograde to kill off all your horizontal velocity right over that area. Then you just fall straight down, burning a little as needed to keep from getting too fast, then settle down gently once you get close to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I like explosions, I usually incorporate a Soviet-style \u0022crasher stage\u0022 in my landers. This is also does the transfer, capture, and deorbit burns. Then it has some fuel remaining to be the \u0022speed brake\u0022 for most of the descent from 10km down to the surface. When it runs out of fuel at low altitude (like 1km), I jettison it and finish the descent with the lander, enjoying the explosions as the crasher stage impacts. The range icons on the debris also tell me exactly how high above the ground I really am without having to look at the radar altimeter inside the pod. The lander then has the fuel needed to take off again and return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dreambish","CreatedById":140312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:41:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI like to pulse the thrusters by spamming X and Z really fast.
