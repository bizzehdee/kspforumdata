Going up is easy, but coming down requires a very precise amount of thrust. Almost more precision than I can handle. A couple of pixels on the thrust indicator is the difference between coming down at 5 m/s for a soft landing or 20 m/s which tends to break things.\n\nI\u0027m at work thinking about what I\u0027ll try next, and I\u0027m thinking that maybe the key is, instead of trying to land with the engines and possibly failing, I\u0027ll find a hovering thrust some distance from the ground where it\u0027s safe, and then push down with RCS.

You can strip Mun of science in one mission. I did that on Eeloo and brought back 18000 science in beta 0.9. All biome visited in kerbal 2 days.\n\nSimply just wait that you sation is nearly above the biome you want to visit to leave and land. Do some hops if you can (to save return fuel). then wait the \u0022station\u0022 is above your lander to take off and you get a cheap docking"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:01:07Z","Content":"Practicing moon landing on Kerbin is a bad idea because gravity is 6 times stronger on Kerbin than on the Mun. You accelerate at a rate of ~10 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 on Kerbin which makes landings very delicate.\n\nHovering won\u0027t work because you consume fuel with engines on. Suppose you get a TWR of 1.00 (hovering) on the Mun at a moment, then say 20 sec later, you lander will go upwards because of your TWR going up as fuel is consumed.\n\nAnyway hovering is extremely fuel inefficient and will waste huge amounts of fuel.\n\nThe most fuel efficient technique to land on a body is called suicide burn (basically falling and full thrust right before landing to brake), but there\u0027s a reason why it\u0027s called that way. It is very difficult, requires practice and not recommended for your first landings.\n\nA good compromise is to let the ship fall and gain some velocity and brake every so often to maintain a reasonable speed of descent. Then when approaching the ground (you\u0027ll know using your shadow on the Mun, radar altitude in IVA or KER) brake to a few m/s to land softly and cut engines at touchdown to avoid bouncing. It may not be the most efficient way of landing, but it is rather easy and is what I used myself for early Mun landings without problems.\n\nIf you\u0027re not confident with landing on the Mun, try landing on Minmus first: gravity is far weaker (1/20 of Kerbin\u0027s gravity) and it has huge flat regions at sea level (0 m on altimeter) which are easy to land on."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:20:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So I am getting a bit greedy and trying to land a science lab for my very first Mun landing.

Not sure if RCS works in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\n\u003E \n\u003E How does everyone else do it?\n\nWell, the 1st thing is, do you plan on bringing the lab back home or leave it on Mun for future use? If you plan on bringing it home, 4 blue-tip chutes (or 8 gray-tips, or 16 radials) will set it down quite safely back on Kerbin so that\u0027s the easy part. Just have it shed any redundant parts like engines and fuel tanks after your do the deorbit burn and before re-entry and you\u0027ll be fine. This just leaves landing on Mun.\n\nThe most fuel-efficient, but also the most skill-required, method for landing on an airless world is the so-called \u0022suicide burn\u0022. In this case, you do a deorbit burn from a reasonably \u0022high\u0022 low orbit (30-100km or so, depending on the world) and then coast most of the way down. Then, at a point just before it\u0027s too late, you fire the engines full blast, timed so you stop just above the surface.\n\nThis takes a lot of trial and error to get right, and it also makes it hard to have fine control over the terrain of your landing spot because you can\u0027t really tell what the terrain will be like until you get down to it, by which time it\u0027s too late to do much about it without wasting all the fuel you were trying to save. Landing spot terrain is a big factor in Mun landings because the terrain alternates rapidly between reasonably flat and OMGTOOSTEEP! all over the surface due to scads and scads of small, steep craters you can only see from low altitude.\n\nThus, I do all my Mun landings using the way less-efficient but way easier and safer \u0022stop and drop\u0022 method. In this scenario, you\u0027re the lowest safe orbit, which is about 10km. As your ship goes along, you carefully note the terrain just ahead. You get a very good idea of what it\u0027ll actually be like on the surface this way. When you see a likely spot coming, burn hard retrograde to kill off all your horizontal velocity right over that area. Then you just fall straight down, burning a little as needed to keep from getting too fast, then settle down gently once you get close to the ground.\n\nBecause I like explosions, I usually incorporate a Soviet-style \u0022crasher stage\u0022 in my landers. This is also does the transfer, capture, and deorbit burns. Then it has some fuel remaining to be the \u0022speed brake\u0022 for most of the descent from 10km down to the surface. When it runs out of fuel at low altitude (like 1km), I jettison it and finish the descent with the lander, enjoying the explosions as the crasher stage impacts. The range icons on the debris also tell me exactly how high above the ground I really am without having to look at the radar altimeter inside the pod. The lander then has the fuel needed to take off again and return to Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Dreambish","CreatedById":140312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:41:02Z","Content":"I like to pulse the thrusters by spamming X and Z really fast.
