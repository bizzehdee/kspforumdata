After initial occurrence, symptoms persist after removal of all mods. (Hence posted in area for un-modded support. If that is incorrect, I invite a moderator to move this thread to the correct area.)\n\nReferences: \n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36651676/KSP/New%20folder/persistent.sfs](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36651676/KSP/New%20folder/persistent.sfs)\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36651676/KSP/New%20folder/Assigned%20Crew%20Roster.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36651676/KSP/New%20folder/Assigned%20Crew%20Roster.jpg)\n\nObserved Symptoms:\n\n1a) After many hours of trouble-free gaming (save started with release of V1.0, continued through V1.0.1 and 1.0.2), crew from newly-accepted rescue contracts or on recently-launched vessels are removed from \u0022Available\u0022 tab but not added to \u0022Assigned\u0022 tab. \n\n1b) \u0022Assigned\u0022 tab has scroll bar (which cannot actually be scrolled or manipulated in any way) despite very short displayed crew list. (see referenced .jpg screenshot)\n\n1c) Cost of hiring next crew is listed as zero funds, but no crew can actually be hired. Note crew list states 10 kerbals out of a limit of 12 (see symptom 3 below).\n\n2) (Actually the first symptom noticed, but of less overall import) Accepted a kerbal rescue contract, then noted that the kerbal in question was in the Mun\u0027s south polar badlands and canceled contract as more trouble than it was worth. Contract was removed, but EVA kerbal near Munar south pole remains. Kerbal is unowned and does not show up in crew listings.\n\n3) As part of my initial efforts to fix the Astronaut Complex weirdness, I upgraded the building from level 0.5 to level 1 (fully upgraded). Astronaut Complex scene remained unchanged, including the note regarding a limit of 12 kerbals on the active roster.\n\nAt this point, I saved a copy of my persistent file, uninstalled KSP, downloaded a fresh virgin install from Steam, copied the persistent file into the new (mod-free) install, and restarted. All the above symptoms remain.\n\nPresumably there is something wrong with my persistent file (see .sfs referenced), as that\u0027s the only thing remaining from the original appearance of the error; but the only obvious issue in the file (to my ignorant and untrained eye) is the section listing the EVA kerbal in symptom 2 (Hanwin Kerman) in the Vessels section, despite no corresponding entry in either the Contracts or Crew sections.\n\nThere are a bunch of craft in that file; of interest are the 2 craft: Rescue Ranger - Kerbin, and Rescue Ranger - Mun. Their crew (including an orange-suit!) are not listed in the Astronaut Complex roster.\n\nNext troubleshooting step is to land and recover one of the affected craft, and see what happens to the crew. (That\u0027s going to have to wait until tomorrow, though. It\u0027s getting late.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T02:57:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Srpadget**\n  \nfix bad link"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T10:33:18Z","Content":"Hi Srpadget, your link to the persistent is broken, if you fix it I can try to load your save, sometimes loading a broken Windows save on Linux fixes it.\n\nAlso I have edited your thread title, this is a family friendly site so some language is not permitted."},{"CreatedByName":"Plume \u0026amp; Akakak","CreatedById":142955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T17:34:06Z","Content":"Hey Srpadget,\n\nIt seems your persistent file is corrupted.\n\nIt is likely that one of your kerbals has a wrong \u0022idx\u0022 value in the ROSTER section of your .sfs file.

I had no idea that the word in question was considered...\u0022salty\u0022...in ANY dialect of English. I have since gone off and gotten myself educated on the topic.\n\nAnd now I\u0027m wondering who else I have shocked/offended all unknowing over the years, with this being the first time I\u0027ve ever had the issue pointed out. Because I\u0027ve used that word as a deliberately-vague non-technical term meaning \u0022unexpected and undesired behavior with as-yet-unknown root cause\u0022 for years. Decades. In less-formal BUSINESS communication. With various international corporate and government audiences. (NASA ... RSA ... ESA ... CSA ... Boeing ... Alenia ... Khrunichev ... Diehl ... etc etc etc.)\n\n::facepalm::\n\n(Oh well, it could be worse...I knew someone once many years ago who condescendingly told a lady she obviously didn\u0027t understand physics. Turned out she was a contractor liaison civilian employee of US Army Ballistic Missile Defense Command...and had a doctorate in physics. The guy left for another project shortly thereafter....)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nPlume \u0026 Akakak:\n\nMy problem does indeed appear to be exactly as your link describes (including issues getting into the Astronaut Complex, though my symptom was less severe: I found I could get back into the Astronaut Complex after entering another scene (the VAB, say) then exiting back out to KSC).\n\nAnd checking my persistent file (the link should be fixed now, btw), I see right at the top of the roster that Jeb\u0027s idx is wrong. I guess he\u0027s jealous that I\u0027m giving all of \u0022his\u0022 glamorous famous-hero missions to Val these days.... Will check (and fix as necessary) the rest of the roster.
