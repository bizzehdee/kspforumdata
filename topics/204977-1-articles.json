Also ensure you\u2019ve disabled Steam cloud sync as this can do bad things when switching versions and remember- don\u2019t ever put mods in the Steam copy of KSP because it\u2019s very likely to break your mods; the tech support (modded) forum is littered with people who\u2019ve done that and then had their games mangled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0Copy current 1.12.2 KSP, paste outside Steam (e.g. desktop) and that\u2019ll be safe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDelete everything out of Steam\u2019s KSP GameData folder\u00A0except the Squad (and SquadExpansion for DLCs) folders.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSwitch versions (right click KSP \u0026gt; Properties \u0026gt; Betas \u0026gt; pick your version- on this topic, why 1.10.1 instead of .2?
