I also \u0022disarmed\u0022 the Grabber and it retracted into its shell but the ships still wont separate. Is there any way to separate them with console commands?

You don\u0027t need a docking port, the claw can attach anywhere. Sounds like something else is going wrong though.

I found the VESSEL section for the space station and deleted the parts that make up the ship that should have decoupled, then gave myself enough money to build another one of those ships so my problem is solved.
