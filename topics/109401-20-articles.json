Probably include some LFO storage as well because engines are relatively short compared to the height of the Mk3 fuselage cross-section (lots of extra room for fuel/ox tanks).\n\nIf a VTOL jet engine is what you want, I\u0027d say it should have high thrust, not be terribly useful beyond 0.5 mach, low ISP (about the same as a RAPIER or Whiplash), and VERY FAST response time especially when throttling up. By fast response time I mean 0.5s to go from idle to full throttle, and 0.75s to go from full throttle to idle.\n\nVTOL jet engines need to be able to respond very quickly to the throttle, or you end up either bouncing off the runway or slamming into it. This is why I\u0027ve never been able to make a stock VTOL jet that I can pilot, the engines don\u0027t respond quickly enough. Rocket VTOL works much better for me because throttle response is instant.\n\nWhile we\u0027re on the subject of requests, a Mk3 pre-cooler to go with the intakes would be much appreciated by those of us who use KSPI-E, and would probably look quite nice as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-01T18:07:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2016 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan**"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalBuzzsaw","CreatedById":158329,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T19:02:22Z","Content":"[@SuicidalInsanity](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/143878-suicidalinsanity/)  WHY IS THE NUCLEAR ROCKET (BOTH MK2 AND MK3) LH2 POWERED AND NOT LF POWERED WHY??\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-01T19:02:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2016 07:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by OrbitalBuzzsaw**"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T19:26:56Z","Content":"Knowing the way M2X went, Mk3 will likely end up getting both a rocket and jet VTOL engine at some point.
