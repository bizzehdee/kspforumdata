(no life. at all.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few things really bother me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne I will mention here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPilots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou give me lots of rendezvous missions - rescues - build a station - expand a station\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan my pilots lock to a node? no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan my pilots lock to target? no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have three space stations now and have rescued lots of kerbals.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a little kerbal army.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey will populate bases eventually. (separate rant about base building coming soon)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of the rescued pilots can lock a node or target either. Not surprised they need rescuing then eh?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to build two and three man command podded ships but you have made it pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s pointless because in early game I only need scientists for stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I going to fly all these rescue missions with no node or target lock? Am I heckers like!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy rescue ships are unmanned automated ships. Not because they are lighter or cheaper.. no.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy first landing doesn\u0027t have a pilot in the lander only a scientist. Not because it\u0027s a one man job... no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s because pilots are not up to the job until they have been to other planets!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPilots should be more or less fully functional right from the off.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen I\u0027d use them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey wouldn\u0027t just be passengers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLeave the levelling up to scientists and engineers if you must level up skills. I\u0027d personally prefer endurance levelling. Like how long someone can spend in orbit before they start making random hoax phone calls. Some wouldn\u0027t like that of course because they don\u0027t care about their being kerbals in space for years at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I digress...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease for the love of all that\u0027s kerbal! Give my pilots some skills!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
