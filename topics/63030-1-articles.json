The plans for a Kraken Drive, while exciting, were science fiction as far as the Jedi Space Program was concerned. Wernher\u0027s suggestion of a Moho mission was shot down almost as soon as it was brought up, as had Jeb\u0027s idea for an SRB SSTO. As for Gene\u0027s EAV (Eve Ascent Vehicle), it was regarded with the same amount of seriousness as the Kraken Drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was why Bob was staring at the stars tonight--he wanted to help out.

News spread fast on Kerbin. Nobody knew quite what to make of it. Some said that a giant rock in the sky didn\u0027t deserve this kind of attention. Others said that this was more than a giant rock in the sky, that this might hold the key to a Grand Tour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher was one of those others. He tapped on the mic to get everyone\u0027s attention. \u0022Gentlemen, what we have here is the greatest discovery since the planets. As many of you know, Bob Kerman has found the first confirmed asteroid in the Kerbol system. From study of its trajectory, we have determined that it is not on a collision course. It is, however, close enough to put on a close-encounter course with Kerbin through use of powerful rockets.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was much more talk in the room now.

At first, Werner was horrified, but he knew that he had to make something that could grab the asteroid. So, he made a new way to latch onto things: The Claw.

The Tracking Station was immediately upgraded to track these asteroids and accurately plot their trajectories. A size labeling system was created, ranging from Size A (smallest, no bigger than an average Mun lander) to Size E (largest, bigger than most entire rockets). Unity was a Size E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFifth, it turned out that initial calculations were wrong.

Bill\u0027s house was shabby and lonely, but Jeb supposed it made sense given what Bill had been through. A voice came from inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come in, the door is unlocked.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb opened the door and found that he was surrounded by dust. Dust on the table, dust on the walls, dust on the floor. It was like no one had stepped foot in the room in a long, long time. He chocked a bit on the cold, stale air. Not the nicest place to have a heart-to-heart conversation, but it would have to do. It wasn\u0027t like Bill would have agreed to meet him anywhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe voice called again. \u0022Mind the dust, I mostly just stay in the living room. It has an attached bathroom and kitchen.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb walked carefully into the living room. There he saw Bill slumped on the couch, watching television with a beer in his hand. On the TV, a news report played, discussing the discovery that Unity was on a collision course. It was mostly panic-ridden hyperbole, as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill turned. \u0022Jeb. It\u0027s been a while.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah,\u0022 the kerbonaut replied, a little shaken by Bill\u0027s tone of voice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What brings you here?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You have to come back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill turned slowly, again looking at the television. \u0022I knew you\u0027d try to make me come back. Sorry, no can do.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But why? Why turn your back on us, this duty, for this?\u0022 Jeb gestured around the room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Duty? Look at this.\u0022 Bill pointed at the TV. \u0022We have four months to live, Jeb. What is the meaning of duty now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So you\u0027re going to waste those four months living in this pigpen?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s all I can do. After all my failures.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb sat down on the couch next to Bill. \u0022You still blame yourself for Danke and Roning, don\u0027t you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah I do, because it\u0027s true. Danke... if I had just landed a little closer we could have save him. Roning... if I had been the first down there, he wouldn\u0027t have been attacked. It should have been me, Jeb.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re suicidal!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, I\u0027m not. Throwing my life away and jumping into the biggest uncertainty in Kerbal history? That\u0027s too much trouble.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb grabbed the televisions remote and threw it into the TV. Both went up in sparks and smoke and glass. Bill didn\u0027t even flinch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t you see what you\u0027ve become?!\u0022 Jeb yelled. \u0022How far you\u0027ve fallen?! You gave up your passion and moved to a pointless life in the middle of nowhere out of fear. Not even guilt--you did it out of fear. Can\u0027t you see how pathetic that is?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, I can. But why stop now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb grabbed Bill by the arm. \u0022I\u0027ll show you why!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe dragged his friend, his comrade, outside and pointed up.
