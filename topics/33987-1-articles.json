The first is my Mun base comprised of 10 separate pieces \u0026amp; the 2 rovers I used to help assemble it all (wanted to avoid having wheels on the base components). There\u0027s plenty of space to add additional components but I\u0027ll have to see how the frame rate goes. Also, I thought next to the arch would be a good spot for a station, but it\u0027s on a slope so it\u0027s sometimes a bit awkward to get pieces to dock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HwGJGc6.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022HwGJGc6.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext are my orbital refueling depots, so far one around Kerbin, one around the Mun and one around Minmus. Next step is to add some reusable landers/shuttles onto the extra docking ports and possibly (they\u0027re all stock for now) get some Kethane mining going. Or possibly to get an equivalent refueling depot around some of the outer planets, although I imagine that could be rough. I assembled the Mun depot around Kerbin and then sent the whole thing to the Mun (that was dumb), but assembled the Minmus depot on location and that was far easier. Live and learn I guess. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin Depot: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hEsfB6t.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022hEsfB6t.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun Depot: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rwYVVrL.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022rwYVVrL.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus Depot: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8Wkokyw.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u00228Wkokyw.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts on what to do next?
