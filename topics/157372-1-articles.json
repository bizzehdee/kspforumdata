The original issue I linked describes one type of crash - right before the monkey window appears. I experience the same issue (see video of it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/bbiwm4l7av72cn0/first.mp4?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E). However, I experience also another kind of crash - when the loading bar reaches the end and the game is supposed to kick in (but it crashes in the same way) - see video \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/f13gq6fmglhh67f/second.mp4?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. There is also\u00A0a third phenomenon I experienced - right about the time the first type crash happens, the window manager crashes but manages to recover and restart and the game loads fine (no video of that, I\u0027m really not filming all my startups).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes the game loads just fine, sometimes I experience the first type crash, sometimes I experience the second type crash and very very rarely I experience the third phenomenon. I\u0027d say that the first type crash is the most common, the next in frequency is the fine loading of the game, the third is the second type crash and the third phenomenon is very very rare.\u00A0I can\u0027t see any correlation with other stuff like running programs - it happens both right after system boot and when running a bunch of other programs like vscode, chrome, etc. Because of me being an idiot I forgot to store the logs. When this happens next time I\u0027ll save and publish the logs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy KSP is basically unmodded with the exception of kOS where I\u0027m programming some stuff in (and because of this it really drives me crazy\u00A0since I have to restart the game a lot). And no, my modifications to kOS don\u0027t cause the crash because it both crashes and not crashes with the same stuff. It is a copy of a steam-installed game that I use for working on mods. I\u0027m running Ubuntu Gnome 16.10 with gnome-shell 3.20.4, X server version 1.18.4, nVidia GeForce 940M with driver version 367.57, I have dual screen setup (as you could have seen in the videos). Ask me for any other config info you need to know (apart from the logs, I\u0027ll post them as soon as I get them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would appreciate any help, hint or trick to make it working consistently. Developing something with \u0026gt;50% of time crashing all the way to the login screen is really a hell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT\u003C/strong\u003E: I experienced the first type crash again, the log is here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/tSB3u6AG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/tSB3u6AG\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-06T08:29:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2017 08:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Dalgaim\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-06T09:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/142722-dalgaim/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022142722\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/142722-dalgaim/\u0022 id=\u0022ips_uid_4411_3\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Dalgaim\u003C/a\u003E, I am sorry to tell you but this is a bug in the Unity3D game engine sending bad window dimensions to the operating systems window manager, this occurs with Unity3D tutorial projects as well, that contain no KSP code or shaders, and selecting different render modes in the Unity3D editor doesn\u0027t change this (options are OpenGLcore first, OpenGL2 first, or auto).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnity Technologies have been informed but no fix has been provided yet, the only 100% workaround I know of is to use the xfce window manager xfwm, which can handle the bad call.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/11382\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThere\u0027s more info here.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using Cinnamon currently, and I leave KSP alone until it\u0027s finished loading, but even then it still crashes Cinnamon sometimes when I drag KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry I can\u0027t help any further with this, it\u0027s totally beyond Squads control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dalgaim","CreatedById":142722,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-06T09:58:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/16426-sal_vager/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002216426\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/16426-sal_vager/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sal_vager\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I was afraid this is the case.
