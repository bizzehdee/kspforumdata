I\u0027ve had an issue which has been driving me insane recently. I\u0027m running a decently chunky modded install.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLiterally every booster that has any significant thrust (especially procedural ones) like the Clydesdale for example, slowly overheat the ENTIRE craft well into the point of overheat failure for most parts (over 1000K!!!), if they run for long enough. It\u0027s so bizarre, as if their heating simply just gets directly transferred into the entire craft at once, over time. But at a ridiculous rate, making launches with any large SRBs, even stock ones, impossible. It happens both when they\u0027re radially attached, or anywhere at all on the craft. They could be on a 50m long ship and still overheat the entire craft at once until it blows up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve sifted through the game and mod files some to try and find any clues, if any mod could change heating in a way to cause this, to no avail. At first I thought it was just Procedural Parts with their SRBs in particular, but then I tried out others and the same issue happened. Any ideas or help would be super appreciated!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: Now that I think of it, I should\u0027ve probably posted on the Modded Installs Technical Support section.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-09T09:02:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2024 09:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 9\u0022\u003EJune 9\u003C/time\u003E by moyashii\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
