So, I\u0027d suggest at \u003Cem\u003Eleast\u003C/em\u003E a quad core. As a benchmark for price, AMD processors are usually about $25 per core. I don\u0027t know about Intel; I\u0027ve never used them. KSP isn\u0027t too hard on the graphics, but if you want to play other games I\u0027d suggest an Nvidia GTX 560 or higher (about $220). You\u0027ll also want at least 4Gb of RAM, but I\u0027d go 8Gb (about $50) simply because RAM is cheap as dirt compared to other PC parts. The motherboard, case, and power supply will be another $300-500 depending on the quality, and another $100 for Windows 7 if you don\u0027t already have it. Assuming you already have a monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc. and that you pick a mid-range motherboard and power supply, that should put you at around your $900 budget for a desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T22:17:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP is in beta, so future patches will add additional options and make the existing code more efficient.
