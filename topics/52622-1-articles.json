Currently, you must click on an instrument, Kerbal, or capsule to acquire science results, then either transmit it or recover the ship carrying it to use the points. That\u0027s two active, uh, actions, and nothing accrues passively.

Science could also be collected on Kerbals orbiting in space or on deep space missions. However, like the current research, there would be a diminishing return for duplicating such experiments. Perhaps, when cost of launching rockets get added to Career Mode, that would also limit attempts to spam space with numerous probes doing the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets be patient and see what the Dev come up with in future updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SyberSmoke","CreatedById":73912,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T04:50:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECurrently, you only get science points when you actively do something: either transmitting the results of a test, or recovering ships.

So, you goto the mun, get some rocks and drop them off at your station. The Mun rocks make you allot of science instantly. But then you have the research on the rocks, they are a project that takes time, so that generates a trickle of science as described. This way you need to have a constant flow of science in to get that trickle, other wise your Kerbals run out of things to look into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cool thing could be that you also would not need to reassess the science tree. Instead the science generated could be applied to the parts it originally unlocked. 0.1% increases to ISP ratings for engines, a little more fuel, a little less weight, a little better transmission capability. Small incremental increases to parts that would take a good amount of science to get. That way your using the science and just do not plateau when you hit the end of the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA thought...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toomuchbrew","CreatedById":57346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T14:48:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea and I think Atwood\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad is making a science lab module for .23.
