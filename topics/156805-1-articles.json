Most of the time these people are open-minded and will listen to a rationally built argument, accompanied with scientific statements. I see no evil in there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately these are a small part of conspiracists and you\u0027re often facing people that firmly believe what they say and that will not listen to any argument disagreeing with them, heating the debate really quickly (because let\u0027s face it, no one likes when people are not listening to what they say, scientists or conspiracists alike)\u00A0and ultimately causing moderator actions (trolls are basically the same except that they have fun doing so). So, as long as moderation watches and calms people down quickly before things heat up, most harm could be avoided.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as a personal opinion, while I don\u0027t agree nor disagree with this decision, I believe it makes little sense when seeing the other rules of this forum. Conspiracy theories are, by definition, closely tied to politics and ideologies, which we are still not allowed to discuss. I\u0027m not sure what would really change \u003Cem\u003Ede facto\u003C/em\u003E by allowing this, other than trolls being more tempted to start such discussions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe the details of the new policy were not stated in these terms.
