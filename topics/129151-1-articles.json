I try to convert any old mods I use to .dds using the converter, but some have texture names hardcoded into .dlls, so conversion wont work... I suppose if there enough non-converted textures remaining, there might be a use for ATM... But with more \u0026amp; more older mods becoming unusable due to more and more changes in KSP releases, even these rare cases are becoming less \u0026amp; less...
