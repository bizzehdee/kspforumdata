Is there anything that I can do before writing off months of work? Its strange when I opened up my gamesaves I found these bizarre persistent files. A dozen or so id say. I forget their names exactly. Something like KUBAC.persistent. Not sure where they came from. Alarmclock maybe. But I deleted them so I only had the regular persistent file.
