I have a little Mun base I\u0027m working on that has a couple of different ships and a rover so far, and I\u0027d love to be able to take a Kerbal on EVA and drag a power cord over to my rover to recharge it. Eventually I\u0027d have one unit in the base to provide power, and power cables running to my other units to provide them with power. Hoses could be used to transfer fuel, oxidizer, monopropellant, breathing oxygen (if they implement it), drinking water (ditto), and anything else. They could also be used to \u0027soft-dock\u0027 for refueling a ship as an easier/safer alternative to standard docking with a space station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacemarine658","CreatedById":38992,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T00:40:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyea maybe if done right\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T09:14:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be a great addition.
