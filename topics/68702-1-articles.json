The lifter is below this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing my latest clustered engine design enables all the engines to be placed near the centre top of the lifter. This allows extended fuel tanks to hang down from the side eliminating the possibility of radial detachments hitting the engines, allows extendibility and also allows multiple SAS modules to be placed on the end of the lifter where they are most effective. This should eliminate the need to use more SAS modules or RCS tanks on the payload which would be wasted after separation from the lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design has a relatively low part count considering the payload it is lifting, (667 - mostly struts), minimal staging and fuel lines and has very high TWR ratio compared to other lifters so you don\u0027t have to wait forever to get your objects into orbit. Starting TWR = 2.27 and rises to over 10 at the end of the orbital burn. Total mass with max payload is aprox 6532 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BxI05KO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BxI05KO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/luXRbHv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022luXRbHv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst stage dropping. The second stage doesn\u0027t drop until the insertion burn at an apoapsis of 100km which means the SAS units are there all the way up to turn the lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uigmUNo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uigmUNo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA shot of the engines between the secondary tanks.

I tend to use MechJeb to launch these and due to the high TWR it engages Limit to Terminal Velocity until around 16km. If you don\u0027t use MechJeb you may want to go easy on the throttle to ensure you don\u0027t run out of DeltaV. If this is a problem it should be a trivial matter to add another set of fuel tanks to the ends of the lifter to give yourself a safety margin, (it will easily take more weight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this is of use to anyone. I have no idea why anyone would want to lift 1000 tons but hey ho. I would be interested in knowing what people think of the design concept as I don\u0027t think this was possible in 0.23 due to the fact that mainsail weren\u0027t really easy to cluster together like the newer engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/yilc65xdff2vdv4/Peacemaker_I.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload craft file.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quasarrgames","CreatedById":91692,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T22:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou REALLY clipped them engines up in there! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb Cubed","CreatedById":70444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T23:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooooots of engines, but still good lifting power.
