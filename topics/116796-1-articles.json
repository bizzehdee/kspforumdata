Unless that\u0027s the orbit to which you\u0027ll be launching your interplanetary stages, and it\u0027s very inefficient as you lose a good 200m/s of Kerbin rotation speed advantage plus most likely miss the exact inclination requiring expensive plane match.

Every part I brougth up there afterwards, I had more fuel than needed. so every mission that went up there, I dumped most of the remaining fuel in them, only keeping enough to deorbit my final stage. It was full before I could even finish the space station! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif).\n\nLater, I went up there and tried bringing a full one. I didn\u0027t modify my lifter to be able to get it up there. I saved the day by pumping the fuel in it into my main stage to get the DV I needed. that was using a cheap-ass lifter tho, I didn\u0027t want to spend too much money\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T12:53:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 12:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thunder\\_86**"},{"CreatedByName":"Adamczuk","CreatedById":146006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T08:38:33Z","Content":"You may say it\u0027s ugly, but I really like your Space Station design!
