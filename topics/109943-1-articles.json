This means you can make a cluster that conducts heat from multiple engines into a single tank - you can have moar thrust for longer.\n\nAlso three versions of the classic orange tank that are all LiquidFuel and nothing but LiquidFuel to use with the new Nuke.\n\nIt\u0027s as stock as it can be. Oxidizer and Liquid Fuel have the same density - so the big orange tank holds 6400 Liquid Fuel. The only Nuke change is the name and it\u0027s surface mount-ability.\n\n**Download**\n\n*[removed link to defunct website]*\n\n**Installation**\n\nJust extract the UberDyneAstronautics folder into GameData. Requires ModuleManager. BSD Licensed.\n\n![7aFJhIG.png](http://i.imgur.com/7aFJhIG.png)\n\n![fGLa4St.png](http://i.imgur.com/fGLa4St.png)\n\n**Change log:**\n\nversion 0.3\n\n- Fixed Orange Jr\n    - \u0027side attachment\u0027\n    - brought inline with T800: mass, cost, breakingForce, breakingTorque\n\nversion 0.4\n\n- repackaged the files into a sub-directory of UberDyneAstronautics to allow multiple UDA mods in parallel"},{"CreatedByName":"spacecookie","CreatedById":101953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T13:27:08Z","Content":"I will give it a try, some pictures would be welcome ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nedit: tested and approved !
