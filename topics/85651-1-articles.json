Usually you have to futz about micro moving the mouse to get the tank to attach squarely, it\u0027s \u0027easy enough\u0027 to get it right, but it is a constant pointless anoyance. If there is a case for \u0027skew\u0027 attachment then the \u0027snap right\u0027 on off could be bound to the angle snap setting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
