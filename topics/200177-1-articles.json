I know. Its a very odd challenge. It will probably receive a lot of criticism. But the reason on why I posted this challenge because over the years of Kerbal Space Program\u0027s development people have been helping each other. Like Matt Lowne\u0027s Blunderbirds (which is an awesome season, especially the music videos in MY OPPINION).\u00A0 So the goal of this challenge is to see how many Kerbals you can strand and then rescue. You can do this with a friend or just by yourself. You could save all your mission that have failed and return those Kerbal home safely. And I mean, jack up some points\u00A0 and popularity but like that doesn\u0027t matter.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin 0 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mun 1 point\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus 1 point\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna 2 pionts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIke 2.5 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve 4 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGilly 2 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoho 3 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDres 4 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool 4 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe 4.5 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo 6 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPol 3.5 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBop 3.5 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVall 4.5 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEeloo 7 points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSun 3 pionts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
