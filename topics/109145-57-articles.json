Your Mk2 endcap hatch is something I had wanted for a long time. The ability to put a door pretty much anywhere on a model. But I found I couldn\u0027t get out it, only in. I fixed this in my game by giving the config file a link to the simplist \u0022Internal\u0022 model I had access to. A small inline passenger can made by \u0022Kerbonov\u0022. So as a suggestion I was wondering If you could  create for your model a very simple \u0022Internal\u0022 so that others could get in and out as well. A simple dark space or if you are feeling creative. A small airlock interior.

A lot of Authors use a system where a simple pixel in the same folder as the cfg file named to the texture file the program is looking for, is there as a sort of place holder. In the actual config file it will have a texture designator like this.\n\ntexture = Wings, Squad/Parts/Aero/wings/Wings\n\nThe \u0022Wings\u0022 before the comma is the pixel named Wings in the same folder. The next part tells the program where in the folder structure the actual texture is located.\n\nSo if your config said something like.\n\ntexture = Wings, Squad/Legacy/Parts/Aero/wings/Wings\n\nor\n\ntexture = Wings, Squad/Parts/Legacy/Aero/wings/Wings\n\nor any other combination\n\nThen amending it to the first example, in the cfg file, to where there is a texture file called \u0022Wings\u0022 will mean the cfg will look in the right place.\n\nSorry so late, you have probably already worked it out by now.

I used mk2 Expansion a lot with 1.10 and earlier and never had the issue you describe. Maybe there\u0027s a problem with your installation or maybe there\u0027s a new issue in 1.12. Regardless, if you post links to your log files (see directions below) other people can help diagnose your problem.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002275006\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed910559063\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/163863-how-to-get-support/\u0026do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\nAwesome, thank you I will post the log files when I get home.

This following is an example of the model pathway in the Mk2 Expansion Endcap.\n\n    MODEL\n\n    {\n\n        model = Mk2Expansion/Parts/Structural/Endcap/Model\n\n        texture = Cockpit, Squad/Parts/Command/mk2CockpitStandard/Cockpit\n\n        texture = ksp\\_l\\_cupola\\_diff, Squad/Parts/Command/cupola/ksp\\_l\\_cupola\\_diff\n\n    }\n\nMk2 in a lot of cases points to Stock textures to skin their parts. In the above the where it says texture =  The  \u0022Cockpit\u0022 and the \u0022ksp\\_l\\_cupola\\_diff\u0022 that are before the comma and after the = are dummy textures that are used as place holders for the folder pathway that is after the comma. So you can see that the real textures are in Squad folders. When Squad changes it\u0027s folder structure then the pathway is no longer correct and the config can\u0027t find the textures. It does not go searching for them. So you either need to go look in an older version of KSP for the correct texture files and recreate their folder structure or you need to put the texture files in the same folder as the Mk2 config file replacing the dummy files and then as an example either simply remove the texture = lines out of the model subsection or rewrite the path as in this example that is specific for this config.\n\n    MODEL\n\n    {\n\n        model = Mk2Expansion/Parts/Structural/Endcap/Model\n\n        texture = Mk2Expansion/Parts/Structural/Endcap/Cockpit\n\n        texture =Mk2Expansion/Parts/Structural/Endcap/ksp\\_l\\_cupola\\_diff\n\n    }\n\nHope this helps."}]}
