If we take the same 1/10th scale distance to Proxima Centauri, the trip there is a little under 1.3 Earth years of real time. Again, if we can get the same 100k time warp, we can be making a trip there in under 7 minutes. This is very reasonable. And in fact, interstellar trips taking a few minutes of real time is right there in the ballpark of what would probably be good gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real trick here is maintaining these 100k of simulation speed multiplier with engines running. You can push physics warp a little past what vanilla KSP lets you, but even if you mod the game to remove that cap, you aren\u0027t getting into anywhere near the numbers you need here. So it would have to work different. Crucially, however, not having some kind of warp that lets you run engines isn\u0027t an option. Times required to reach outer planets of KSP are already on the silly side. So Intercept is in a bit of a bind. They can\u0027t place other stars too close, because then you could get there with chemical rockets by just waiting a little longer, and they can\u0027t put the stars really far away without relying on something like physics warp, because nobody is going to wait for a real life month to get there. So it\u0027s a problem Intercept will have to solve, and we can assume that we will have ability to use torch ships with time warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo where does this leave us with interstellar distances? Well, if Intercept can squeeze out the same 100k multiplier, the 1/10th scale is still very reasonable for interstellar distances. If not, how far can the distances be shrunk?\u00A0The really icky part is that distance is quadratic in time under constant acceleration. So if we still want the trip to be under 7 minutes and we can only do 10k time warp, the distance would have to go down by a factor of 100, or be just 50 times further out than Jool. That would border on broken, because a rocket that can cross that distance in a few hours under warp can be built with tech we have in KSP, and that doesn\u0027t feel sufficiently interstellar. So the time warp in KSP2 can\u0027t fall much bellow the 100k we have in KSP while still supporting torch drives.

But there is still a lot going on. Resource use has to be accounted for, and KSP had it set up in a way where it was a huge resource hog just to process fuel priorities. (I haven\u0027t looked at that code, but I suspect either a bug or bad algorithm. Performance of that system was terrible.) KSP2 should be better, but with a complex enough ship, it\u0027s still far from free. And then there is question of ship orientation. If you simulate torques, changes in orientation, and thrust applied in different directions, then not only do you have to reduce simulation time step to avoid errors, but you also have to consider how any stability/guidance systems will work. You could completely lock orientation, like regular time warp does now, of course, but then you basically don\u0027t have to think about thrust symmetry at all. Just slap engines wherever, and hit warp to prevent your ship from flipping. That\u0027s not great from gameplay perspective. You might want to have something in between. Perhaps, start with normal physics warp, and only if the ship remains stable, allow you to go into higher warp levels with engines still firing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while it\u0027s clear that what you have to do is simplify simulation and increase the time step it can handle for this particular case, the devil\u0027s in the detail of how to actually achieve it. And it\u0027s a mix of engineering and design challenges. So it\u0027s not immediately clear to me what the correct solution is. Intercept has good game designers, though, and had more time to think on it, so hopefully, whatever they came up with will be fun to play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MCWither_Storm","CreatedById":214264,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-13T17:18:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is just one problem I feel:\u003Cbr\u003E\n100k timewarp is not fast enough.

But there is still a lot going on. Resource use has to be accounted for, and KSP had it set up in a way where it was a huge resource hog just to process fuel priorities. (I haven\u0027t looked at that code, but I suspect either a bug or bad algorithm. Performance of that system was terrible.) KSP2 should be better, but with a complex enough ship, it\u0027s still far from free. And then there is question of ship orientation. If you simulate torques, changes in orientation, and thrust applied in different directions, then not only do you have to reduce simulation time step to avoid errors, but you also have to consider how any stability/guidance systems will work. You could completely lock orientation, like regular time warp does now, of course, but then you basically don\u0027t have to think about thrust symmetry at all. Just slap engines wherever, and hit warp to prevent your ship from flipping. That\u0027s not great from gameplay perspective. You might want to have something in between. Perhaps, start with normal physics warp, and only if the ship remains stable, allow you to go into higher warp levels with engines still firing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while it\u0027s clear that what you have to do is simplify simulation and increase the time step it can handle for this particular case, the devil\u0027s in the detail of how to actually achieve it. And it\u0027s a mix of engineering and design challenges. So it\u0027s not immediately clear to me what the correct solution is.
