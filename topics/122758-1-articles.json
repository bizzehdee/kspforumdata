Sometimes I need (want) to put awkward, draggy payloads into orbit or on another body. Sometimes, these payloads are really big, and draggy enough that I can\u0027t keep the tail draggier than the nose with the payload exposed. That makes it fairing time, and that opens up an entire new galaxy of problems. The 3.75m fairing generates a \u003Cem\u003Eridiculous\u003C/em\u003E amount of body lift -- enough to backflip my rockets.

Anything less than perfection will result in a dazzling display of aerobatics, but nothing is going to space today. The other two images in the album show the insanity that is the body lift of the 3.5m fairing. The lift is so incredibly strong that it can backflip a rocket when its nose and prograde marker are only 40 degrees above the horizon. It can backflip a stack consisting of a Mammoth with 2 Twin Boars pushing on the other end and, after it does so, when the rocket starts to fall fast enough it will \u003Cem\u003Eflip it back upright.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow am I supposed to handle this? I have to be doing something wrong, but what? 2.5m and 1.25m fairings don\u0027t give me this trouble. Relatively aerodynamic payloads don\u0027t give me this trouble. Only the 3.75m fairing does this, and I\u0027m at a loss as to how to deal with it without engaging in the fun-killing grind of reverting until the stars align and the payload makes it to orbit.

In anything except a rocket with a 3.75m fairing on it, I can let gravity do the work. I start my turn between 50 and 100 m/s depending on the rocket, relax, and watch the show. I maybe have to touch the controls 10 times total during a bad ascent, and that counts staging. For whatever reason, that fairing overcomes gravity pulling the nose down with its lift, even when the engines are fully gimbaled, reaction wheels are running full power, and all control surfaces are working in concert to keep that nose down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep the thing from backflipping, I have to take a much more active approach to flying it.

If I leave too much of a gap between keypresses, it\u0027s too late; the lift builds up beyond the point of no return, the fairing takes control of the ship and protracted full yaw won\u0027t stop that nose from going back the way it came.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I meant about having to fly it perfectly.

I really mean it when I said it was violent. In the second screenshot in the album, for example, the nose was inside the back side of the prograde ring just prior to the screenshot being taken. I normally keep the nose pointed between the center and the back(towards vertical) edge of the prograde ring during initial ascent.
