Always good to see a New KSP\u0027er getting into the groove. Yeah, only 1 Flag per Kerbal on each Mission. I\u0027d suggest going to Minmus next as it can be abit trickier to land as it\u0027s lower gravity and high ridges, and do some Space Stations and Moon Bases. 1 thing about KSP is it\u0027s best not to rush into the larger stuff until you have the smaller stuff down pat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evrion","CreatedById":70825,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T02:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats on Mun landing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could try getting a remote (non-Kerbal controlled) rover to the Mun, and drive around a bit!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Omicron314","CreatedById":59506,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T02:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongradulations!
