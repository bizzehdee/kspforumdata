How good/bad do you think it is?Can it be improved?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP isn\u0027t, by a long way, the most graphically taxing game out there. Compared to the kinds of graphics demands we see in other modern games - even on their lowest settings - the graphics demands in KSP are minimal by comparison, especially in vanilla. Which makes it so frustrating how this game can grind to a virtual halt just because you wanted to install one or two mods, or because you happened to have been playing for 5 hours straight. Even though my PC is at least 7 years old (2GB video RAM, 16GB of installed RAM,\u00A0 an i7 multicore processor) it still more than meets the game\u0027s current MINIMUM specifications as set by Squad. The fact an old bucket like mine can still run this game fairly well, even with many mods installed, says it all. But do I sound like an entitled little gamer when I say that if I have 7GB of RAM available (as shown in Task Manager) I expect the damn thing to be able to access it, and it can\u0027t. Even in 64-bit! Or perhaps\u00A0 this is still more of a Windows problem than a Unity problem? Or both?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just get the feeling that KSP could and should be able to run at least 60fps even with many mods installed, and it\u0027s frustrating that it doesn\u0027t. Depending on the scene I can get maybe 24-30fps (in v 1.6.0), but that depends heavily on how busy the scene is. While docking with a moderately sized station it can drop to 9-12fps (I thought 1.6.0 was suppose to improve multicore rendering for multiple ships, but I really can\u0027t see any difference);\u00A0 in maximum time warp I\u0027ve seen it drop to 6fps and then shoot back up to 20 then back to 8. Indeed the framerate can be VERY inconsistent with frequent lag, and again I can\u0027t tell if it\u0027s my PC (toggling V-sync makes little difference, nor does setting a frame limit) , the mods, or the game engine. And please don\u0027t tell me to stick to vanilla; mods have defined this game just as they have defined SkyRim. Even Squad members themselves (Nova Silisco for example) contributed mods to this game. KSP just isn\u0027t appealing to me any more in vanilla, because I KNOW KSP can do so much better. The forums are always full of players suggesting or requesting new mods, especially visual enhancements, which says to me the community wants this game to be as good as it can be, and we really need to be asking if it is. Even after Unity5 and 64-bit mode were introduced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a programmer but I can\u0027t help feeling that despite the move to Unity5 and its undoubted improvements, KSP still isn\u0027t running at its full potential; and it feels as if it never will as long as it\u0027s still using Unity. Programmers, mod-makers feel free to disagree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion to Squad-Private Division: stop producing DLC and focus instead on continuing to improve how this game already uses \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eavailable resources\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. No point in creating more \u0027stuff\u0027 for the game if in turn the game becomes so bloated and slow no-one can play it.

(Aside from over all RAM limiting how many mods with assets you can install.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCPU, specifically single core performance is the limiting factor due to all the physics calculations. Considering that this is the opposite of how 99% of games work, it\u0027s not likely to be improved, quite the contrary; newer cpu\u0027s are going the way of more and more cores, further diluting single core performance.\u00A0(Currently KSP can use multiple cores if there are multiple vessels on screen, one per.

Wasting time passing the dish back and forth? Do we break the dish in half, each wash his piece, then re-assemble them at the end? Do you hold the dish and operate the tap while he scrubs? Do any of these sound faster or neater than just washing the dish by yourself? Now imagine I give you 7 helpers! 8 people in total...how will you utilize them to wash that\u00A0single dish without having them get in each others way or just complicate the process? Kind of sounds like the fastest, easiest way is still to have 1 person just wash the dish while the other 7 watch right? Now imagine that for every helper I give you, I make you all younger, thus making all of you\u00A0less proficient at dish washing; who can wash a single dish faster? A lone 40 year old, or 10\u00A04 year old\u0027s?

Firstly, the way KSP simulates vessel physics as a set of connected rigid bodies. It\u0027s a \u0022natural\u0022 way to do it when your vessel building works that way, and a lot of somewhat-realistic structural behaviour emerges from it. But it\u0027s inherently difficult if not impossible to multithread and CPU demand scales worse than linear with part count. Optimising the physics engine will only ever increase the part count needed to lag the game, to actually get rid of physics lag would require a completely different way of simulating vessel physics. Treating the whole thing as rigid (besides robotic joints) would do the job but then you wouldn\u0027t get the spectacular vessel explosions that the game has become famous for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA second source is the Unity engine\u0027s problems with garbage collection. In simple terms, the entire game has to periodically freeze for the engine to do some behind-the-scenes stuff. This is why KSP often experiences regular stuttering. The problem affects any Unity game. It can be mitigated with clever programming but that requires coders to do that. Important to the current discussion, that includes developers of game mods. The garbage collection problems will only really go away when Unity fix it. (And then KSP has to be updated to use the new Unity.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, KSP\u0027s performance problems come down to decisions made by Squad when KSP was first made, and they were at that time entirely reasonable decisions. Many years on, it\u0027s not easy to change it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JERONIMO","CreatedById":188491,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-20T20:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, really?

Compared to the kinds of graphics demands we see in other modern games - even on their lowest settings - the graphics demands in KSP are minimal by comparison, especially in vanilla. Which makes it so frustrating how this game can grind to a virtual halt just because you wanted to install one or two mods, or because you happened to have been playing for 5 hours straight. Even though my PC is at least 7 years old (2GB video RAM, 16GB of installed RAM,\u00A0 an i7 multicore processor) it still more than meets the game\u0027s current MINIMUM specifications as set by Squad. The fact an old bucket like mine can still run this game fairly well, even with many mods installed, says it all. But do I sound like an entitled little gamer when I say that if I have 7GB of RAM available (as shown in Task Manager) I expect the damn thing to be able to access it, and it can\u0027t. Even in 64-bit! Or perhaps\u00A0 this is still more of a Windows problem than a Unity problem? Or both?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just get the feeling that KSP could and should be able to run at least 60fps even with many mods installed, and it\u0027s frustrating that it doesn\u0027t. Depending on the scene I can get maybe 24-30fps (in v 1.6.0), but that depends heavily on how busy the scene is. While docking with a moderately sized station it can drop to 9-12fps (I thought 1.6.0 was suppose to improve multicore rendering for multiple ships, but I really can\u0027t see any difference);\u00A0 in maximum time warp I\u0027ve seen it drop to 6fps and then shoot back up to 20 then back to 8. Indeed the framerate can be VERY inconsistent with frequent lag, and again I can\u0027t tell if it\u0027s my PC (toggling V-sync makes little difference, nor does setting a frame limit) , the mods, or the game engine. And please don\u0027t tell me to stick to vanilla; mods have defined this game just as they have defined SkyRim. Even Squad members themselves (Nova Silisco for example) contributed mods to this game. KSP just isn\u0027t appealing to me any more in vanilla, because I KNOW KSP can do so much better. The forums are always full of players suggesting or requesting new mods, especially visual enhancements, which says to me the community wants this game to be as good as it can be, and we really need to be asking if it is. Even after Unity5 and 64-bit mode were introduced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a programmer but I can\u0027t help feeling that despite the move to Unity5 and its undoubted improvements, KSP still isn\u0027t running at its full potential; and it feels as if it never will as long as it\u0027s still using Unity. Programmers, mod-makers feel free to disagree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion to Squad-Private Division: stop producing DLC and focus instead on continuing to improve how this game already uses \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eavailable resources\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.

enough to at least enjoy (with scattered disabled that is, with scatterer near atmo its far worse).\u00A0 Due to multicore, ive found that if your processor has the cores, larger numbers of smaller

relatively irrelevant solong as you dont exceed RAM limitations by using them, and some may even help you cut down lag if you like to build very large craft and can replace a stack of 2x2 panels with a single much larger panel.\u00A0 Tweakscale is also a good way to save on lag since it lets you make larger ships without using as many things in them (i dont use it ,myself as its not my cup of tea
