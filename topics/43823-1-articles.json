Generally most pieces are obliterated and you don\u0027t get a nice pile, so I was doing controlled crashes at just less than 12m/s to destroy an object or two and scatter the rest, but it wouldn\u0027t produce all the debris when I would later load, I wondered if this was intentional or if it was a possible auto deleted because of some un-met parameter as I\u0027m warned when I exit a vehicle about my thrust setting, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I made a pretty dodgy helicopter with the \u0022Fire spitter\u0022 mod and crashed it into the SPH, cutting all thrust/engine power just before and the whole pile was there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little bit of useless information, but some people might like to make a little graveyard, just hit x before the crash and you should be able to keep all the pieces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, found out, even if you have still have thrust going on a part, but can\u0027t get it down because of a lack of power to the disconnected part, having a Kerbal stand ontop of the piece forces it to stay, which is nice, could potentially use that auto debris/object upon object thing, to make easy deployment platforms for rovers that were persistent and what not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas just wondering if the Dev\u0027s meant on most things disappearing or if it just tended to happen because you\u0027ve generally got thrust up during staging (unless you kinda NEED to hit x, because you\u0027ve put boosters just near some wings and they tend to smash into the rest of your ship, so you need to stop thrusting, which then get\u0027s some persistent debris if any of it survives, having stopped thrust) thus creating the parameter of, the object wouldn\u0027t of been able to \u0022save\u0022 and stay, being thrusted up, so it just vanishes but if you were to thrust down, you\u0027d save all those supply drops, that you waited for to hit the ground, etc. will test this as mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else noticed the forced deletion of debris only when it is trusted up? Only tested this on the ground, but it came back upon relaunch of another vehicle so I\u0027m assuming it was persistent, would this be a work around the 2.5Km disappearing thing? Simply by having killed the engines?
