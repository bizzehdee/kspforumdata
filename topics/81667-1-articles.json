I don\u0027t just mean the texture, but it needs to be normal mapped. I was following a tutorial on youtube, but when I started subdividing, I ran into a problem in that the edge didn\u0027t subdivide at all, so around the outside it still has 18 flat sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k3YnWXH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k3YnWXH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help with this?

I don\u0027t know how to do it Blender, but you can do this in Unity, though you won\u0027t have control over individual faces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/a8h7S4L.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022a8h7S4L.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Normals \u0026amp; Tangents section, change the Normals to \u0022Calculate\u0022 in the drop-down. by default it\u0027s set to \u0022Import\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen change the smoothing angle to something like 50 and click Apply. you\u0027ll see the mesh change in the preview window and the main window if you have in the scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esmoothing angle means if two adjacent normals are X degrees or less apart; they are averaged into 1 normal. so a smaller number will give you more faceted look; a larger number will give you smoothed look. averaging between two normals that are two far apart will make the mesh look too round. generally a number between 30 to 60 is good to start with. You can experiment more and see how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis generally works the same in any 3d app, blender or not. I just don\u0027t know how to do it in Blender.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiliconPyro","CreatedById":19734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T01:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely looking better.
