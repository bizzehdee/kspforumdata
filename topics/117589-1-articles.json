It\u0027s looking to be a pretty good match.\n\nTurn 1: I play a Basic mountain, and instantly follow it up with both of the Sol Rings in my hand. (the first Sol Ring paid for the second) End turn.\n\n![4N2qu20.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4N2qu20.jpg)\n\nTurn 2: Draw, play a nonbasic land that come into play tapped, and use the first land and both Sol Rings (Total 5 mana) to drop a Gilded Lotus. I immediately use Gilded Lotus as black mana to play Praetor\u0027s Grasp. With Praetor\u0027s Grasp, I searched through my buddy\u0027s deck, which has a lot of nasty stuff in it like Myojin of Cleansing Fire, Progenitus, Wall of Reverence, and others. I see Storm Herd, and I exile it face down.\n\n![PpxJtv0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PpxJtv0.jpg)![60GrWOZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/60GrWOZ.jpg)![5fcKFjg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5fcKFjg.jpg)\n\nTurn 3: So far, I only have 9 mana. (*only*, lol) So I\u0027m hoping that my new draw is a mana card, because I don\u0027t have any more land at the moment. Sure enough, I draw a basic swamp. ***TEN!!!*** I play my freind\u0027s own Storm Herd against him on turn three. He only had two lands and a Silver Myr on the ground - he hadn\u0027t even had a third turn yet, and here I\u0027ve just summoned **20** Flying 1/1 Pegasus tokens. There was pretty much nothing he could ever have done to beat that.\n\nWe rematched and I mana-stalled hard and managed to do nothing until he finished me the second round.\n\nEpic. We were talking about it the whole way back from Burger King. \n\nAnyone else have some unforgettable MTG plays?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T05:31:37Z","Content":"My friends and I play Casual. My WIP deck does fun stuff like this:\n\n![Ci6n4fU.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ci6n4fU.png)\n\nSay hi to Turn Five. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI don\u0027t have half the cards yet, but in test plays against my friends, the game has gone from them having the upper hand to them having 0 life in 1 turn. The deck relies on this card for it\u0027s biggest combo:\n\n![dragonstorm.jpg](https://www.abugames.com/images/products/modernmasters/dragonstorm.jpg)\n\nI use mana-adder spells like Pyretic Ritual and Seething Song to cast that spell, then bring out two of each of these:\n\n![Image.ashx?multiverseid=270372\u0026type=card](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=270372\u0026type=card)![Image.ashx?multiverseid=189648\u0026type=card](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=189648\u0026type=card)\n\nBad Things happen within a span of one or two turns. Those four creatures alone can attack for 20. And whenever they attack, for each of them, two 6/6 dragon tokens enter the field. And for each of those tokens, when they attack, two more enter. So on, and so forth.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T05:45:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 05:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starwhip**"},{"CreatedByName":"Camaron","CreatedById":100218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T08:22:24Z","Content":"Wow, can\u0027t let that one go unchecked for too long!\n\nA pure Dragon Deck? I like your style. You wouldn\u0027t know it but the deck I mentioned before is somewhat of a Dragon Deck. It\u0027s actually one-half of an incredibly old Dragon deck I\u0027ve been using and expanding since the beginning of my time playing Magic, around 1998. I eventually split the oversize deck into the \u0022Brute Force\u0022 deck and the \u0022Tactical\u0022 Deck. The \u0022Tactical\u0022 Dragon Deck includes Rimescale Dragon, Skithiryx the Blight Dragon, Keiga The Tide Star. Every basic land in the deck is a snow land, to ensure maximum compatibility with Rimescale Dragon. \n\n![atqxkkd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/atqxkkd.jpg)![KhzYFFe.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KhzYFFe.jpg)![3cKn71O.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3cKn71O.jpg)\n\nSeriously though, I learned this game by playing against my uncle, who used power nine cards against me in his main deck. Dragonstorm was the key to finally beating him. Dragonstorm, Imperial Hellkite, and Kilnmouth Dragon, as well as the old Urza\u0027s Mine, Tower and Power Plant for that extra mana speed. The first time I finally beat him, I had brought out 2 of the Hellkites and an amplified 14/14 Kilnmouth, and then Bladewing the Risen cranked them up even higher to seal the deal. One of my Dragons was eaten by his 9/9 Demon, but the rest weren\u0027t blocked and the game was mine!\n\n![H0PuUcI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/H0PuUcI.jpg)![JTlKXmV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JTlKXmV.jpg)![kRMcOVm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kRMcOVm.jpg)\n\nOnce My friends caught on to Imperial Hellkite, I started using Shaleskin Plowers as decoys, with the upside that if they survive, they still smash a land when they flip. It sure was fun that first time someone fireballed my morph card instantly and saw some stupid 3/2 go to the graveyard. Confusion and horror.\n\n![CkJOeUy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CkJOeUy.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T01:05:17Z","Content":"Wait you can play online?\n\nDo you have to build a deck and stuff?

Its more like a tool with the necessary things available to sort of play the game the same way you would anyway, just digitally. You have to tell it what number to set the life to, change the number of tokens yourself, tap the appropriate stuff on your own. It doesn\u0027t have the rules built in, its like the TABLE in a real world scenario. It doesn\u0027t really do anything for you beyond holding the cards, tokens, and dice off the floor. It will hide and draw deck cards and stuff for you though, and if it doesnt have networking, you can easily run it over skypes desktop share or something of that sort and have it work as intended that way."}]}
