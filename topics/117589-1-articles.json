I immediately use Gilded Lotus as black mana to play Praetor\u0027s Grasp. With Praetor\u0027s Grasp, I searched through my buddy\u0027s deck, which has a lot of nasty stuff in it like Myojin of Cleansing Fire, Progenitus, Wall of Reverence, and others. I see Storm Herd, and I exile it face down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PpxJtv0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PpxJtv0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/60GrWOZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002260GrWOZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5fcKFjg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225fcKFjg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurn 3: So far, I only have 9 mana.

I like your style. You wouldn\u0027t know it but the deck I mentioned before is somewhat of a Dragon Deck. It\u0027s actually one-half of an incredibly old Dragon deck I\u0027ve been using and expanding since the beginning of my time playing Magic, around 1998. I eventually split the oversize deck into the \u0022Brute Force\u0022 deck and the \u0022Tactical\u0022 Deck. The \u0022Tactical\u0022 Dragon Deck includes Rimescale Dragon, Skithiryx the Blight Dragon, Keiga The Tide Star. Every basic land in the deck is a snow land, to ensure maximum compatibility with Rimescale Dragon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/atqxkkd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022atqxkkd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KhzYFFe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KhzYFFe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3cKn71O.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223cKn71O.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously though, I learned this game by playing against my uncle, who used power nine cards against me in his main deck. Dragonstorm was the key to finally beating him. Dragonstorm, Imperial Hellkite, and Kilnmouth Dragon, as well as the old Urza\u0027s Mine, Tower and Power Plant for that extra mana speed. The first time I finally beat him, I had brought out 2 of the Hellkites and an amplified 14/14 Kilnmouth, and then Bladewing the Risen cranked them up even higher to seal the deal. One of my Dragons was eaten by his 9/9 Demon, but the rest weren\u0027t blocked and the game was mine!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H0PuUcI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022H0PuUcI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JTlKXmV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JTlKXmV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kRMcOVm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kRMcOVm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce My friends caught on to Imperial Hellkite, I started using Shaleskin Plowers as decoys, with the upside that if they survive, they still smash a land when they flip.

Its more like a tool with the necessary things available to sort of play the game the same way you would anyway, just digitally. You have to tell it what number to set the life to, change the number of tokens yourself, tap the appropriate stuff on your own. It doesn\u0027t have the rules built in, its like the TABLE in a real world scenario. It doesn\u0027t really do anything for you beyond holding the cards, tokens, and dice off the floor. It will hide and draw deck cards and stuff for you though, and if it doesnt have networking, you can easily run it over skypes desktop share or something of that sort and have it work as intended that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
