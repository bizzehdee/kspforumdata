But there is another requirement in the SETI-Contracts-Unmanned file, which states:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EREQUIREMENT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E type = Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E targetBody = Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure what this means exactly, but maybe this is the reason the OrbitRecovery contract does not show up? But then what is the problem? I have a satellite orbiting Kerbin, although it does not have power, is that the problem? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I hypereditted a satellite with power and connection, and still not next contract....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecond Edit: I think i found the problem, when looking in my archived contracts, the contracts are finished but the sub-objectives stay incomplete. See below in a screenshot where the destination and situation remain incomplete, although i was able to finish the mission. Also my persistent save is saying \u0027state = incomplete\u0027. I am not sure what caused this bug, but it happens with all my SETI-contracts. And it happens only with SETI-contracts. The strange thing is that my last contract actually depends on the earlier starting-contracts and still showed up. Not sure what to do or what could cause this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/2itfvgy.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i61.tinypic.com/2itfvgy.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI m pretty sure the contract does not show up, because all your contract \u0022offer slots\u0022 are used up (I think slots are limited based on the number of stars and your current prestige).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDecline some of the offered contracts and it should show up eventually.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a SQUAD restriction, and I m not aware of a method to circumvent it without causing other issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe archive contracts not having the stuff completed is imho a contract configurator thing and does not have any impact on the progression, only the progression variables (setiOrbit = 10) count for SETI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe additional requirement you stated above should be beneath an ANY node, thus not really relevant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T16:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERETRACTED: user error at fault.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T16:41:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 04:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Errol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Martinoss","CreatedById":128783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T18:51:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yemo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Yemo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESETI disables the stock progression contracts (under SETI-Contracts-General) using ContractConfigurator, there are no other changes.\u003Cp\u003EAlso SETI uses its own variables to store the progression, so it is totally independent of any other progression mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissionController2 does not use ContractConfigurator, I have no idea about the interaction between those 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI m pretty sure the contract does not show up, because all your contract \u0022offer slots\u0022 are used up (I think slots are limited based on the number of stars and your current prestige).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDecline some of the offered contracts and it should show up eventually.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a SQUAD restriction, and I m not aware of a method to circumvent it without causing other issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe archive contracts not having the stuff completed is imho a contract configurator thing and does not have any impact on the progression, only the progression variables (setiOrbit = 10) count for SETI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe additional requirement you stated above should be beneath an ANY node, thus not really relevant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi thanks for your respond.
