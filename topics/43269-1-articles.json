To date, no further missions have been sent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason for this is the completion of the Inari-KSS-IV, a much larger station with a far, far more extensive research lab and habitat module.

Due to a collision risk, this means the Inari-1 must be moved. Thus has brought a dilemma. Normally I would simply demolish the station, but I thought it fun to ask other space experts on the best course of action. I have long-term plans for missions to the Mun and Duna, and that will need some expensive orbital infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo! I\u0027m taking suggestions: What to do with the Inari-1 space lab? The I-KSS-IV is too laggy for any more parts really, so my choices are limited to destroying the I-1 or re-purposing it on a new mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few technical notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Station consists of a single Crew Can core, with full ASAS and is controlled via a MechJeb case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a pair of large solar panels and 6 battery modules. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has 6 roundified monopropellant tanks and a pair of LV-1R engines with a potential Delta-V of about 360m/s, so larger boosts will require a tug vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a standard Clamp-o-tron docking port on the aft end, and a single clamp-o-tron Jr on the front end, limiting attachment points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is currently orbiting kerbin at about 300km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T20:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanna re-purpose it, the first thing I\u0027d suggest is a new module with a docking hub on at least one end (maybe 2 for loads of expansion) and a drive stage. Bring it down to a lower construction altitude (it\u0027s how I do all my station assembly; below 200km) to reduce delta V required for rendezvous and launch.

Add a small, empty Kethane tank, large, empty tanks for LOF and Mono, a medium Kethane converter, about 4 more Gigantor solar panels and/or a Kethane-burning generator, and at least 1 Clamp-o-Tron Sr. Then it could be your fuel station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you do is, you drill Kethane on Minmus then bring it back to this station to be refined into LOF and Mono. It\u0027s more efficient to make LOF in orbit than on the ground, and you want to get it from the place with the lowest gravity so you use less fuel moving it around. So, then you just build a couple of ships that consist of nothing but a big, empty Kethane tank, a drill or 2, 4-6 Gigantors, and the bare minimum of rockets needed to get it to and from Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, IF you really want a refueling station in the Kerbin system. What with an unlimited supply of fuel at KSC, it\u0027s generally easier, although less efficient, just to send tankers to where they\u0027re needed rather than make everything go to a filling station. But if you\u0027re going to do a filling station, might as well go whole-hog and use Kethane \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"19spacepug","CreatedById":75611,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T21:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would add more docking ports and get some sats into near orbit to the station and use it as a refueling station and run refueling missions on the way to your other station and do 2 refuelings at once. plus you have some nice sats in orbit it would be good with the isa map mod still thats my idea you should do what you think and update us on what you decide to do with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"King Arthur","CreatedById":73849,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T21:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would launch a nuke tug in a \u0022pull\u0022 configuration to the station and then haul it to munar orbit to act as your station there.
