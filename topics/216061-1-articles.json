It consists of a large transfer stage docked to a small lander. The lander can is upside down so I constructed the vehicle with the transfer stage command pod as the root part so everthing is pointing in the right direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverthing was fine during the launch, mun assist, transfer, Ike assist, Duna aerobrake and into a 60Km Duna orbit. I sent my lander down and returned and docked with the transfer stage without any problems. Or so I thought, now all the reaction wheels on the transfer stage are borked. I set \u0022control from here\u0022 on the transfer stage command pod, but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E just goes into an uncontrollable tumble which only gets worse over time. I set all the reaction wheels to manual only and found that they are applying force opposite to what is requested (pitching up pitches down etc). The only way I can get the craft to work is to disable all the reaction wheels on the transfer stage and just use the lander can, but obviously it\u0027s tiny and takes an age to move the ship. The engine on the transfer stage is still gimballing correctly so it\u0027s just the reaction wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone else come accross this? Were you able to fix it? Does anyone have any suggestions I could try?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf not, it looks like a bug and I\u0027ll submit a report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woke Kerbal","CreatedById":228327,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-30T10:16:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni am having a similar issue, when i undock my ship it says \u0022no vessel control\u0022 even though i am just in kerbins orbit and have big antennas on my ship, and also enough energy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand yes there is also a drone control thingy, basically both ships worked fine before docking\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turbo Ben","CreatedById":193979,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-04T12:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor anyone else that has this issue, exiting the game and restrting seems to resolve the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
