(I still am, haven\u0027t even landed on the Mun yet, but that\u0027s not the point.) Now, thanks to the very well put together in game tutorials, I can make a spaceworthy craft, and get to orbit, thanks to Wernher Von Kerman and Gene Kerman. I have played many games in the past, and I usually had to read up on their wikis and watch videos, even if they had in game tutorials, but it was not the case with KSP. Good job, Squad, I am very happy with my purchase! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceChipmunk","CreatedById":142023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T16:23:46Z","Content":"It is still worth looking at videos, especially by Scott Manley.

I just watched a video today about landing an aircraft on a mountain, in KSP! I will watch more and more, for now, being a complete newbie, some of the videos boggle the mind.. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T16:06:21Z","Content":"Yay.
