In reality, certain types of\u00A0solid rocket motor can be set up to vary the thrust produced\u00A0during flight (by altering the shape of the fuel prior to assembly), have the nozzle (and therefore the thrust vector) pointed in different directions, or have the length (and therefore fuel quantity and burn time) altered. None of these are doable in KSP, and I feel like the SRBs we have could use an improvement. I\u0027ve made some of the following suggestions elsewhere in the forum on various topics, but I figured that it would be a good idea to collect them into one place and have a focused discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are some things that I would like to have available for SRBs in the game:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nEditable thrust/time profile for the burn duration of the rocket, unlockable either for advanced SRBs only, or as an upgrade to SRBs that can be researched in some way. Real solid rocket motors can have changes made to the thrust that is produced as they burn fuel, because the shape of the fuel determines the exhaust quantity produced at a given time and therefore the thrust. This is useful for limiting acceleration, which is now important for crewed launches as well as being a useful thing to control in the lower atmosphere where air resistance can be very detrimental.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nProcedural segments containing solid fuel, usable by an advanced nozzle piece or pieces instead of having one single part that contains all the solid fuel. This way, solid rocket motors can have more configurable burn times, and can be adapted for more uses.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAn advanced nozzle part that can have its thrust direction adjusted (within a reasonable limit) before flight. Anyone who\u0027s ever tried to mimic an Atlas V rocket or the Space Shuttle\u00A0will understand why this is useful: it makes it far easier to ensure that the overall thrust vector of the vehicle points through the center of mass even with an unbalanced design. SRBs on the Atlas V are able to do this; the engines have good gimbal range, but the main reason that the rockets (particularly the variants with only one \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E) do not tip over is that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E nozzles are adjusted pre-flight so that the thrust acts through the center of mass. This is also another reason why changing the thrust/time profile is useful, because it can be altered to suit a changing center of mass (which is most commonly encountered on Space Shuttle designs).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLarger diameter SRBs. Not a high priority compared to the other suggestions, but it would be nice to have some 2.5m SRBs. And in fact, some 0.625m ones would be convenient as well for making cheap and\u00A0small launch vehicles.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNosecones containing a separation motor. This isn\u0027t directly related to SRBs, but as separation motors usually use solid fuel, it is still relevant.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magzimum","CreatedById":167187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T19:26:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you add that in the stock game, please keep everything as it is, with a big checkbox clearly visible stating \u0022\u003Cem\u003EMake Stuff More Realistic but also Moar Complicated\u003C/em\u003E\u0022.
