It covers the basics of spaceflight, how to perform rendezvous and docking (shoving the nose of the spacecraft into a used engine nozzle) as well as how to perform a orbital transfer and how to get back home.

Usually I start at about 15,000 Meters, reaching 45 degrees inclination at around 35,000 so I cross that dense atmosphere in as little time as possible while still gaining a little lateral momentum. When I have some time I should probably start calculating the perfect values (including speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t have hard facts to support it yet, but it seems so far the best approach is to go vertical for a considerable amount of time and keep the apogee close to the rocket for most of the ascent, only pushing it forwards when you are about to reach the 60,000 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"supertoaster98","CreatedById":10495,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-15T17:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk.
