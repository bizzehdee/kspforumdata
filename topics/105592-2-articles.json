I was running at 10 Gigs during the crash and I almost feel like it was something else because I was hardcore testing with explosions and launching an awesome Space shuttle I built. I jettisoned MY srbs on the shuttle and they impacted my wings and caused rapid disassembly of the entire ship and then crash! But I really had to push hard for this crash and I\u0027m starting to feel like all the hate for 64 bit is being proven here in this thread as just being mis-informed modders who don\u0027t know how to ask for/read the error report. The very first thing you see in a report is if the user is running 64 bit or 32 bit so it\u0027s super easy for them to see and deny help to those using 64 bit. When they say 64 bit was causing too much headache for them the real reason was this! It\u0027s kind of too good to be true how much more stable 64 bit is in this version of KSP and I\u0027m starting to wonder just how much of the issues really are from the Unity engine itself and not just problems with code on Squad\u0027s end.

I was running at 10 Gigs during the crash and I almost feel like it was something else because I was hardcore testing with explosions and launching an awesome Space shuttle I built. I jettisoned MY srbs on the shuttle and they impacted my wings and caused rapid disassembly of the entire ship and then crash! But I really had to push hard for this crash and I\u0027m starting to feel like all the hate for 64 bit is being proven here in this thread as just being mis-informed modders who don\u0027t know how to ask for/read the error report. The very first thing you see in a report is if the user is running 64 bit or 32 bit so it\u0027s super easy for them to see and deny help to those using 64 bit. When they say 64 bit was causing too much headache for them the real reason was this! It\u0027s kind of too good to be true how much more stable 64 bit is in this version of KSP and I\u0027m starting to wonder just how much of the issues really are from the Unity engine itself and not just problems with code on Squad\u0027s end. Anyways I wanna see later if I can replicate the crash and if so I will update you guys.
