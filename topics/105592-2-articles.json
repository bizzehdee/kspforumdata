(Also the toolbar still gives you Nyan Cat on the loading screen and the message saying you\u0027re using 64 bit)\n\nAs for 64-bit specific bugs: I still get the stop-motion IVA pictures of the kerbals in the bottom right corner while flying. I can\u0027t seem to find anything else being wrong with it though, apart from very minor things like the screen glitching out for a bit on transition between the KSC screen and the inside of any building.

Also overall performance under Linux is not as good as on Windows.\n\nI have no idea where you got this, but it is completely false.
