In many versions of the plan, this lander would not be large enough to able to carry the entire crew in one trip, but would need to make two or more trips between the landed Mars Transit Vehicle and the Earth Return Vehicle waiting in orbit (it would refuel on the surface after returning from the first trip, and pick up the rest of the crew). Often the mission plans would launch this as part of the Mars Transit Vehicle- so it could equally well be thought of as the ascent stage of the Mars Transit Vehicle rather than as a separate craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMars Surface Mobility Vehicle-\u003C/strong\u003E Like the Mars Ascent Vehicle, actually launched as a part of the Mars Transit Vehicle. Basically a 2-man pressurized rover (the Mars Transit Vehicle carried a crew between 4 and 8, depending on the mission plan variant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMars HAB Module/ Surface Infrastructure-\u003C/strong\u003E I list this as a combine entry because in many versions of the plan, these components would all launch atop the same Ares V rocket These components would include additional living space and supplies for the crew during their extended surface stay (for the mission plan variants that were more than flag-and-footprints), a power supply (variously solar or nuclear in different mission variants), and in some versions In-Situ-Resource-Utilization equipment to derive Meth/LOX rocket fuel and breathable oxygen from the Martian atmosphere (in some mission variants, the Mars Ascent Vehicle would even carry some of this Meth/LOX up to the Earth Return Vehicle, which would in those versions be waiting mostly-empty in orbit except for very limited amounts of fuel with contingency equipment... Otherwise, this fuel would only be used for the Mars Ascent Vehicle- though this at least meant mass savings on a smaller ISRU reactor and power plant...) At least one version also included a backup power-supply (based on RTG\u0027s) and additional scientific equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, how many Ares V launches are we up to already- three? And we haven\u0027t even included the 3 Transfer Stages for each of the above payloads, which brings it to 6 total launches... But wait, there\u0027s MORE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrion Crew Capsules-\u003C/strong\u003E Because the mission clearly wasn\u0027t already heavy/expensive and bloated enough, the mission designers for Constellation decided to launch the crew on entirely-separate Ares I rockets in not one, but TWO or more Orion Crew Capsules (even though the crew capsule would only need to hold the astronauts for a few hours before rendezvous with the Mars Transit Vehicle in Low Earth Orbit, and using a single heavier capsule with additional seats would have been much cheaper/easier). They could of course have always launched the crew aboard the Mars Transit Vehicle in the first place- which would be designed to hold the crew under high G-forces (during Martian re-entry/landing) anyways- but apparently that would have been too efficient, and would have made the Orion Capsule designers very unhappy... One of these Orion Crew Capsules would have hitched a ride with the Earth Return Vehicle to Mars orbit (you know, it really beats me why they wouldn\u0027t have just left it in LEO), and the other would have (quite wastefully) been de-orbited...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(OK, I\u0027m being a little cynical about the need for the Orion. The Orion Capsule would be utilized to return the crew to Earth\u0027s surface upon returning to LEO instead of riding the Earth Return Vehicle down, which would have been very risky/dangerous and difficult to heat-shield with a vehicle that size. With a fresh transfer stage, technically the Earth Return Vehicle could have been re-used, and even ferried fresh crews to Mars orbit to rendezvous with the Mars Ascent Vehicle which would be left behind in Mars orbit: as the ERV would be left in a stable parking orbit above Earth after the mission...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, we\u0027re totaling 3 payloads that each require an Ares V launch- plus a separate transfer stage (also launched atop an Ares V rocket) that would dock with in in LEO- as well as 2 Ares I launches for the crew capsules for each mission? (with only a slight possible re-usability for the ERV)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars Direct, by contrast, only required two Ares V launches per mission (with no separate transfer stages to my knowledge!) although the crew would have been smaller (3-4 people) and had to deal with MUCH more cramped conditions...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe major mission design differences that saved mass on Mars Direct:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Greater utilization of ISRU capabilities- use of ISRU fuel for the production of ALL fuel beyond what was needed to get to the surface of Mars. This meant all of the vehicles could arrive on Mars empty- including the Earth Return Vehicle (which would launch with its return fuel onboard in most versions of Constellation). Slower production of fuel (due to a longer stay \u002B the ISRU reactor being launched earlier before the manned mission component) also required a smaller reactor and power plant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) The Earth Return Vehicle would also serve as the Mars Transit Vehicle- the same living space would act as lander, surface base, and return vehicle for the crew (though an additional HAB module would still be launched). Sure, it meant a rather heavy ascent stage compared to having a separate Mars Ascent Vehicle (something a NASA engineer criticized it for in the video), but it also meant you didn\u0027t need separate living spaces for your surface stay and your return to Earth... (both of which would need to be quite large for anything more than a flag-and-footprints mission) This was a MAJOR mass-saver on Mars Direct vs. the Constellation mission plans/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) No contingency equipment- one of the things that added mass to the Constellation mission plan which I hardly even discussed was its inclusion of contingency equipment. Basically extra supplies, (cramped) living space, and even fuel for an emergency early return-voyage to Earth with the tiny Orion capsule that would accompany the Earth Return Vehicle to Mars acting as both a transfer stage and additional living space during the long return-voyage. Fortunately, at least the Constellation mission designers had SOME sense when it came to this aspect of the mission plan- not only was the contingency equipment remarkably lean when it came to mass, (in some mission versions) it would also be left in Mars orbit after the first mission, and not launched again with subsequent missions unless it was ever needed and used up by one of the missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) Lower-energy Mars transfer. This one should be relatively simple/intuitive for any KSP player. The Mars Direct mission plan called for a minimal-energy (Hohmann) transfer, which would take 6 entire months. The Constellation Mission Plan, by contrast, made use of a shorter transfer that required more fuel: 2-3 months transit time if I remember correctly (though it must be pointed out this would require less than twice the fuel- the Oberth Effect, which derives from E = 1/2 mv^2, whereas Delta-V is proportional to burn time, means that a rocket with a 50% higher Delta-V expenditure near Earth would acquire a *LOT* more than greater 50% energy. Thought of a different way, the faster you leave Earth\u0027s SOI, the less time its gravity has to pull you back in, and the faster you make the Earth-Mars transfer, the less time the Sun\u0027s gravity has to slow you down...) Of course, most players rely solely on minimal-energy transfers as time is meaningless to them with time-warp and no life-support or crew psychology requirements...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(5) MANY other \u0022luxuries\u0022, including but not limited to greater living space on the Constellation mission plans. The Constellation mission included things like toilets that made use of Mars\u0027 gravity and equipment to heat up meals, for instance, whereas Mars Direct relied on the kind of waste-in-a-bag and cold-soup diet utilized by Apollo astronauts if I remember correctly...
