The question is to what extent?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally would go somewhere near the more strident end of the spectrum. Reducing impact tolerances significantly for some parts, the I-beams, the structural fuselage, and girders in particular, as well as adding altered, \u0022broken\u0022 versions of parts when abused (landing on your engine, smacking something into another something, burning something) that would be less or not at all functional.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T03:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me it\u0027s really less of a question of how extensive a damage system one \u003Cem\u003Ewants\u003C/em\u003E, and more of a question of how much the game really \u003Cem\u003Eneeds\u003C/em\u003E. Also worth discussing exactly what you mean by damage -- do the parts get crumpled in predefined ways, and can they be fixed; at what point to things like fuel tanks explode, and can they \u0027vaporise\u0027 or otherwise destroy less combustible parts around them; how should being in a vacuum affect damages and/or repairs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been thrown about before several times, but rarely have I seen people actually come to an agreement of what they\u0027d like damage to be as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazro","CreatedById":55825,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T12:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe damaged parts would show up at a certain threshold like the impact tolerance value we have now, maybe a damage tolerance value for each part? Fuel tanks would obviously have much lower damage and impact tolerances. The damaged versions of the parts would have much lower impact tolerances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploding parts would have a blastradius value. Everything in that blast radius gets a certain shock, as if it hit something hard. If it\u0027s damage or impact tolerance is low enough, it would also explode and cause a chain reaction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertain parts can be fixed on-orbit. Battery packs, antennae, probe cores, and structural pieces come to mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing would be affected by a vaccuum. That would be silly. Having to micromanage everything in a vaccuum would get tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T12:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, I mean things like explosions -- shockwaves won\u0027t travel through a vacuum, and flames from an explosion won\u0027t get very far due to lack of oxygen -- and a half-decent simulation of what happens when things get a bit banged up if they\u0027re supposed to have air inside -- a vacuum has no air pressure, so big dents might just pop back into shape whilst in space, due to the air pressure inside. There are a lot of things to consider, unless you want damage to be very selective in what it does. If it\u0027s going to be in, it should affect everything in a reasonably realistic manner, I think \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
