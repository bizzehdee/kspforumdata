And your low % engines like the 909 and the Poodle are not meant as kerbin asent engines- they\u0027re normally space and lander engines.\u003Cp\u003EYour LV30, Aerospike, and Mainsail are all very close together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why I have the poodle and skipper, are to compare to KR-2L which is OP for a vac engine, which supposedly occupies the same space, All those configs give you around vac 4500 - 4700dv. at 1.3 starting TWR, which is enough to get to orbit. And it\u0027s the only way I could think of somehow comparing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVacuum engines are more difficult to compare. If we are talking landers - it depends where you land and your minimum TWR requirement, overall weight (you got to bring your lander there to begin with etc), fuel usage (more refuels, from \u0027mothership\u0027 more landings). I didn\u0027t use lander as example, as you definitely won\u0027t be going for max payload, neither you\u0027ll be going for max dv. In my experience poodle makes for pretty bad lander engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just one case. Max load for said engine. Matching your payload to the engine will give you different results, for example, if your payload is a single Mk1-2 pod, the skipper will outperform Mainsail, or any of the new engines. Using staging, multiple engines, etc you can do better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use LVT30 and LV 909 as baselines, and look at the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can notice, Mainsail has bigger difference with the baseline than the S3 KS - 25x4. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELFB -KR 1x2: 20/152 over-performs 2.3%, while mainsail under performs 1.7%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKR-2L is obviously overpowered for a vac engine, and I\u0027m not sure where to place 48-7s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as I said compound problem. Some over perform, some under-perform. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMainsail needs a boost, so it falls between LV- T30 and S3 KS - 25x4. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELFB -KR 1x2: 20/152 needs to be toned down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKR-2L: 28/199 - 14% - definitely needs work, especially it\u0027s ASL Isp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, for purely stock game (no automatic dv calculation), most of this is not an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"78stonewobble","CreatedById":97559,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T09:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dodgey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dodgey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat I got from your response is that because fun is subjective (which it is) and because some people might have fun with some parts, who are we as individuals to say I don\u0027t like that part, we should change it. Because we can choose weather or not to use a part, we are not being forced to use that parts. So why can\u0027t we just let them have their fun if we don\u0027t have to use those parts which we deem OP.

Adding the new engines, as they are, does not detract from anyones experience, they are still able to play ksp exactly the way they did before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not paradoxical. The engines are here and they are what they are, thus people can play with them. Sure if we could spool back time and unrelease them, then balance them, then re-release them, then it would fit the hypotheticals of what if people never had access to them and thus couldn\u0027t like or dislike them. Now that would be paradoxical since it would remove any dislike or like and thus ambition to travel back in time and change it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, it\u0027s not paradoxical to say that, in my humble oppinion I don\u0027t mind if they\u0027re tweaked, I might even prefer it, but if other people (they exist), enjoy them the way they are, then let them, because the matter isn\u0027t that important to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"78stonewobble","CreatedById":97559,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T09:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SofusRud\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SofusRud\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt is totally related to this issue.

I am saying the engines are overpowered and should be balanced, and here\u0027s the reason why (they\u0027re a whole heap of threads about this, I\u0027m not going to explain it here). The counter argument is a combination of the following statements; why are you trying to take my fun? You can just change the configuration files. Just don\u0027t use them, no one is forcing your to use the engines. They are not arguments based on anything apart from emotional defences and self victimisation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou said yourself that you are not opposed to balancing of the engines, I\u0027m presenting reasons why they should be balanced. If there\u0027re more and better reasons why it should be balanced then why shouldn\u0027t they.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn response to your paradoxical statement, you said this; \u0022Personally, I\u0027m not adverse to balancing of the engines in Kerbal space programme. I just don\u0027t need it enough, to hinder other people to play with unbalanced engines\u0022. That\u0027s a paradox because if the engines were balanced, then people wouldn\u0027t be hindered by playing with unbalanced engines. If the engines were UP what would your argument be then?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regards to your final statement to SofusRud, in your opinion, should every suggestion in the suggestions and development page require a poll to indicate weather or not the majority of the community wants that feature in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlbert VDS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust because in sandbox the player is not restricted by the same aspects as career mode (economics, progression ext) doesn\u0027t mean that they are not restricted by other aspects of the game (physics, engine balancing ect).

I never said 1000 engines or engines picked by throwing arrows at numbers on a wall. Which is not the case here... Since we are not talking about 990 new engines or arbitrarily selected performance numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most I\u0027ve said is something akin to: A broad selection of engines in regards to performance.

A basic lesson in life is that there are other people in it and that these people are different from oneself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s still not paradoxical. The engines are there and some people like them. It becomes paradoxical, if we discuss hypotheticals what if\u0027s. Then we might as well ask, what if no engines were balanced, then there wouldn\u0027t be a problem either, because people would never have played balanced engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I can easily answer your question about what if the engines had been up. Then it would have been the same. If people enjoy them, they should have right to play with them, as long as I have engines that suit me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the last bit...

Can you honestly say you would? I guess if you always do the math you would, but I don\u0027t think most people do that. I\u0027ve always assumed the math was withheld to encourage experimentation, and that in mind I think overpowered is far better than under. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said I\u0027m pretty particular about how I play, I\u0027m not even sure I\u0027d notice something being overpowered unless it was grossly so, because if my lifter has extra fuel when it stages or if I have to throttle below 25% it gets a redesign. I meet that criteria with reasonable looking rockets so arm doesn\u0027t really bother me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for challenges around here, I\u0027ve never bothered, so I can\u0027t speak on that, but I have to ask, does arm actually effect those if everyone is on an even playing field? How does it change the nature of them? And since this is alpha, would you rather nerf these or have more options added to fill in the gaps?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
