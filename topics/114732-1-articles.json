At least...it is simple to understand, but maybe not simple in execution. So it is with eager trepidation that we begin work on a new effort.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when I first started this mission report, it was only for a circumnavigation of Kerbin. It started out as a possible land circumnav, but ended up as a sea-based circumnav (with some roving in the middle). Some of that design process is included below, with links to the specific posts about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter Kerbin, I decided to continue on. Up to this point, I\u0027ve hesitated in posting about my further exploits. I do read some of the mission reports, but I\u0027m not a big poster in here. However, I thought I would go ahead and continue to post some of my travels and engineering work to get there. I don\u0027t know if this will be of interest to anyone, but here you go...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with that being said, I have no idea how many of these I might do. So far, I\u0027m up to four bodies circumnavigated (with only two posted in this thread at the moment). I\u0027ll try to keep this index up to date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s always a strange push and pull with how much \u201Cstory line to interject into these mission reports. I am sort of on the fence of this for my own mission report. I started writing these posts with a bit of flare from the perspective of pilots, engineers, and scientists while progressing. When I did so, I found that it sort of mirrors my own internal dialogue as I progress through this challenge. It turned into a strange pull of wanting to drive something fast, solve problems in a neat way, and do something useful with it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstraints for this mission are per the circumnavigation challenge rules. Also, I\u0027m using the same crew for all of these, so that means that I have to retrieve them and send them on the next adventure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo read on, my friends, and hopefully you will find something useful and/or entertaining within this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSea-Based\u00A0Equatorial\u00A0Circumnavigation of Kerbin -

The seeds for such an effort were laid nearly a year ago when Wilsey took Bartger on a polar rescue trip by jeep. The young pilot and medical officer drove twelve hours to reach a crash site deep in the arctic tundra. Their persistence showed what we are truly capable of, should we put our patience and minds to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pilots remember Wilsey\u0027s story well: a newly minted pilot who went out of his way to rescue a friend. The engineers salivated at the thought of conquering a new project, and the scientists were skeptical, waiting for the glory hogs to once again absorb the entire spotlight. The pilots were excited, each of them vying for a coveted spot on the roster. Nobody knew how long this project would take, or how to get to the finish line...but they all quickly went to work devising a route to circumnavigate the globe. In the meantime, the engineers wasted no time digging out Wilsey\u0027s famed jeep to see what improvements needed to be made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113778\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThe Elcano Challenge\u003C/a\u003E dictates that the vessel be manned.

In my previous challenge, I probably could have finished the challenge faster had I simply done the challenge instead of spending time on creating a vehicle that could withstand up to 4x warp. However, I wanted to ensure the best chances for crew survival. So herein lies the engineer piece; it\u0027s one more problem to solve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scientists, sadly, are being a bit left out in this sandbox game. Quite frankly, I didn\u0027t feel like unlocking tech tree parts or dealing with monetary concerns just to get up to the point of executing this challenge. (I find it far too annoying how deep rover parts are in the tech tree, but that\u0027s just me.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to get on with it... Here is the old rover, aptly named \u0022Jeep.\u0022 It isn\u0027t spectacular, but it\u0027s fairly capable and robust. Unfortunately, I figured out that a lot of the parts are now obsolete. I had used the small control surfaces to provide downforce when driving (to improve wheel grip) and used probe cores to provide torque. The torque was just enough to flip the vehicle back onto its wheels after a crash. Alas, these parts no longer work quite the same way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news is that there is now a smaller torque wheel and it provides a descent amount of torque. So here is my first round redesign: The modified Jeep, which under v1.0, costs over 100k (yikes) mainly due to the four RTGs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fniGFUf.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fniGFUf.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter \u201Ctesting\u0022 the jeep for a while (by which I mean playing around), I finally realized that at some point it\u0027s going to need to go into the water. Not surprisingly, it sank up to the windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022k2SGD4I.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k2SGD4I.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I tried to modify it for some aquatic work, but after trying several different parts I realize that I have limited (or no) experience building a boat, let alone an amphibious rover. I hear intakes work well for floating, except they don\u0027t hold the rover up very high in the water and they don\u0027t really withstand being bumped into the ground much (which a rover likes to do).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, it quickly becomes clear that actual movement on the water is going to require something other than a rover wheel. The rover is definitely too small to carry enough fuel for any appreciable water crossing, and the pilots planning the route discovered there\u0027s a lot of water to cross.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have what I think is a really strong rover, but no idea how to get it across the water.

It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mostly been me fumbling my way through boats. Wilsey\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s rover still provides ample examples of how to build a strong vehicle and is used as an inspiration for starting. I learned that boats are finicky. I needed to keep as many parts as possible up out of the water. Anything dragging in the water (especially big parts) increases the drag quite a lot. Rather than explaining everything I found on the way, here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a set of selected pictures and a summary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must confess, my first avenue of approach was actually to build a rover that could float. Quite frankly, that turned out to be a big failure.The background in this picture turns out to be significant because it\u0027s about as far as I got with the rovers that could boat (due to frustration). The reason is because they drag so many parts in the water that they just can\u0027t get any appreciable speed. Rovers simply can\u0027t get pontoons low enough in the water to push the main parts above the splash zone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Pglni4P.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Pglni4P.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see below, I tried a couple different types of pylons, but ended up sticking with the Modular Girder XL because they had fairly low water drag but were stiff and stout enough to stand up to the splashdown impacts. They are also strong enough to deal with roving over land. I also stuck with the scoop intake for the same reasons.

After fiddling around and doing some more conversion testing, I realized that I can actually save some space by making the design rely more on ISRU than what I was initially trying. Rather than trying to store as much LF onboard as possible, I realized that (for this mission) it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s more efficient to leave the resources in Ore form. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo run ISRU, I need either two large solar panels or two large fuel cells. I ran a few tests and confirmed that the ore-\u0026gt;LFO-\u0026gt;EC exchange process is enough to produce net gain, without regard to the ore extraction rate. To offset ore concentration concerns, engineers decide to include both the solar panels and the fuel cells, since the weight is fairly insignificant compared to the total craft. That will allow the craft convert ore day or night. More importantly, if some Oxy is stored onboard to run the fuel cells, the vessel can convert Ore to LF while sailing.

That might not sound like much but I\u0027ve prospected most planets and moons in several games and that\u0027s actually pretty good. In fact, it\u0027s about as good as it gets anywhere that\u0027s reasonably accessible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Survey Scanner does NOT show you where the Ore is, nor does it show anything remotely related to actual Ore concentrations. Ore is based on biomes and all the Survey Scanner shows you is general regions the size of Texas where most of the surface area is composed of 1 or more of the better biomes. The idea is, you then land the NBS and/or ground scanner in the \u0022hot\u0022 regions you see on the map to learn which biomes have the best stuff and how much they actually have. Then you find instances of those biomes in places more convenient to your operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe NBS shows nothing at all until you do the orbital survey, even if you have already used SCANsat to map actual ore distributions from space instead of doing the crude survey. But once you do that, the NBS will report fixed averages of Ore across the whole expanse of each biome. To see the true values in the ground and thus spot local hotspots, you need to use the ground scanner and have it scan each biome. Thus, on the ground, it\u0027s best to have both the ground scanner and the NBS and have their displays both open at once. That way, you can use the NBS to spot local hotspots in the distance and the ground scanner will tell you when you get there (because the NBS map is a snapshot that doesn\u0027t change as your ship moves).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, because Ore is defined by biome and also tends to concentrate in the biomes at the highest and lowest elevations (plus the poles), the hotspots withiin a biome also go by elevation. So if on a given planet, the Highlands and Lowlands have the most Ore and the Midlands have just a trace, then within the Highlands the hotspots will be at the highest elevations and in the Lowlands the hotspots will be in the lowest elevations. (I wrote a tutorial on all this---see my sig).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, assuming the Shores are about as good as it gets on Kerbin, you\u0027ve got it made. Just pull up barely onto the beach, which is the lowest elevation ASL in the biome, and drill. There might be slightly better spots up and down the coast if you bother to look, but that might take you out of your way, given that when you\u0027re going by boat, you want to just hit the headlands. You\u0027ll actually have more trouble finding beaches with low enough slopes to land on in the general area you want to stop in. The one thing to be careful of is that some spots of very low ground, like small sandbars, are actually treated as the ocean biome, not Shores, and the ocean biome is hardcoded to have zero Ore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T00:52:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou said \u0022launch and initial splashdown\u0022 went OK.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhh, yeah.

The scientists finally realize the folly of their lack of participation; complicating and quite possibly dooming the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pilots, as you can imagine, are excited to get the show on the road. The ship is an ugly beast of a prototype, but at this point they don\u0027t much care. They get to fly! Er...boat!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mission report overall is lagging behind a bit (due to real life events). Up until now, I\u0027ve been working with KSP 1.0.2, but starting for the mission I have upgraded to KSP 1.0.4. Changes with 1.0.4 mean that the basic jet engine (BJE) now produces less thrust and has half the ISP that it did in 1.0.2. While this isn\u0027t much of a problem for planes (which received some drag changes), it had quite an impact on the prototype Calamari.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thrust change has resulted in a lost in top speed of about 20%, and the ISP change doubles the fuel requirement. These two changes will increase the estimated 2 to 3 refueling stops to 5 or more. This is kind of a pain in the back side, considering that ~95% of the trip was going to be on the water. I did some quick math (without mapping the exact distances) and I think 5 stops will be the absolute minimum. With the additional overhead associated with starting, stopping, modifying the route, getting on/off land, etc..., I expect it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be upwards of 7.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to admit, partly out of frustration with recent changes plus other external pressures have pushed me into starting the mission. It did strike me as sort of funny how self-inflicted pressures in a video game can reflect the reality of politics and management.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve made a few changes to the ship design:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nReduced the Fuel Cells from 2 to 1\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMoved the external command seats out of their own service bay into the utility service bay\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nReplaced the fuel tank with a conical fuel tank at the back\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIncreased the LOX\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was done to reduce some of the skin friction (and hopefully increase speed). I had to remove a fuel cell to make space for the crew seats, and I increased the starting LOX so that I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to generate as much while underway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn either case, here it is. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve named this ship \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCockroach,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 given how it looks with the solar panels deployed. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWaterbug\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 was another good recommendation by a friend, though the ship had already been christened. There are seven pictures, but I shrunk them down a bit. So hopefully that\u0027s not too much bandwidth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/zb53X/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 1 itself is fairly uneventful. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve launched the ship and made a run for the first little peninsula due east of KSC as my first stop, hoping to make it by nightfall but fell a little short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf note, I am now painfully aware of the difficulties I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve introduced with untested design changes. If you look at that list above again, the end result is that the CoM is too far aft while Ore is burning out. The resulting problem is the rear pylons are digging into the water too far when under warp, which causes them to wake and send the boat out of control. So right off the bat, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m limited to 2x warp until I get up to top speed, then 3x warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also clear now that I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really need the increase the onboard Ox to support the mission, and removing the extra service bay didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t give that much of an increase in speed...unfortunately.
