I used blender to make sure my parts were rotated and orientated correctly, and i have had them all in blender to make sure the would fit snugly. I first started to manipulate the nodes through the config file only, then after some looking around, started using KSPFactory instead. I still have to close and reopen KSP to check my tweaks and this is rather time consuming. So my question is - Am i doing something back@$$wards? and is there a better way?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chickenplucker","CreatedById":3454,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T07:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis may not be the correct way, but I always just spend an hour or so messing around with notepad\u002B\u002B and the config file. I think the 3ds max script auto exports the node for you, but I\\\u0027m not sure if blender has that luxury. To help speed up manually editing nodes, remove all but the parts you are working on, and maybe leave in the mk1 command pod, a fuel tank and engine. Then the game will load much quicker and save some of your sanity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
