Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the rover\u0027s brakes were tampered with. Though the police suspected Debra\u0027s science partner, Misty Kerman, of murder, she was acquitted in the following trial. Even though the killer was never identified, the Kerbal Space Program has flourished since.\n\nOn Eeloo, Jebediah was teaching a cadet named Agaden how to use the suborbital moon \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E - a craft designed to get up to six people anywhere on a moon (or at least a celestial body with no atmosphere) - when he lost control and crashed. Jeb survived, but Agaden died before the mountain rovers arrived. Initially, Jeb was blamed for it; the MechJeb module was tampered with, and everybody in the Kerbol system knew of Jeb\u0027s contempt for \u0022that sorry excuse of a copycat.\u0022 However, an autopsy of Agaden\u0027s body proved that she was poisoned before her \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E training flight. Though Jeb was cleared of the murder, as Gus\u0027 statistics showed Jeb was most likely to kill himself and/or others via vehicle crash (and Agaden might have survived if she wasn\u0027t poisoned), he wanted to find out who killed his star student.\n\nMeanwhile, on Laythe, Sheri Kerman drowned near Froze-up Beach. Though her boyfriend, Bob, was suspected of the murder, he had an alibi for the time of her death; Bob was taking a surface sample up to the U.S.S. *Oregon* in orbit of Laythe (and several crewmembers vouched for him, and he was on the crew manifest for the ascent vehicle) and the launch site was five kilometers away from the crime scene (and the surface sample was taken farther away). He could not have used a rover to get there and back in time, as his driver\u0027s license was suspended earlier for speeding and the rovers were programmed to shut down and alert command if anyone with a suspended license tried to control it. Being a scientist who always asked questions, Bob contacted his three best friends - Jeb, Bill (in transit to Eeloo from Duna to test new skis), and Val (in the U.S.S. Zeus, orbiting Jool) - and asked them for help in hunting down the killer. The boys eagerly agreed; Val was reluctant at first, but eventually decided to help out the three.\n\n**WILL OUR HEROES FIND THE KILLER?** \n\n**ON WHAT PLANET WILL HE OR SHE STRIKE NEXT?**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-03T22:34:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2019 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Mars-Bound Hokie**\n  \nImportant detail missed"}]}
