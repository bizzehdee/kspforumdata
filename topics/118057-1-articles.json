In my case I have a protobodyne inside a service bay, inside a fairing, and so on launch I can\u0027t access it in order to set it as the \u0022control from here\u0022. Therefore my navball is not oriented properly since it\u0027s using the wrong command module.\n\n**Suggestion: Allow access to the \u0022control from here\u0022 right click option from VAB/SPH so that you can select it and save so that it would be persisted for future launches.**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T18:56:28Z","Content":"\u0022Control from here\u0022 is very accessible in ANY situation before launch. You just have to zoom in and rotate the camera with Middle Mouse.\n\nOr even easier; change the root part in the VAB/SPH to the Probodobodyne core. (Yes, its Probodobodyne. Not Protobodyne.)\n\nNo new features needed for things that are already in the game."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T19:23:46Z","Content":"I would rather want an action group for \u0027control from here\u0027. This would help VTOLs, where I normally put a probe-core under the plane, and when I go VTOL, I switch to that, so it\u0027s easier to land.\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t have a middle mouse button."},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T20:45:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Control from here\u0022 is very accessible in ANY situation before launch.\n\nThis is wrong. Only AFTER you launch is this available. Not before. It is not accessible in the VAB nor SPH. It does not have the GUI attribute that allows it to be accessed in the hanger.\n\nEven then, after launch zooming in is not sufficient. In this case the zoom levels are not granualar enough to allow me to position the camera inside the small service bay in a way that lets me click on the controller. Only one of the zoom levels gets me inside the service bay and I\u0027m not able to click the proto\\*dyne due to other components in play. Not what I\u0027d call \u0022very accessible\u0022.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E No new features needed for things that are already in the game.\n\nThe things you mentioned are workarounds. They are not the feature I described, and therefore are not already in the game. That\u0027s like telling someone to dig a hole and giving them a spoon to do it with and saying it\u0027s the same as a shovel.\n\nIt\u0027s certainly not intuitive nor is it a good UI experience."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T20:59:18Z","Content":"I believe we have a difference in what you call launch and what I call launch. What I meant with launch is the actual lift-off. Before lift-off, with your vehicle on the runway or launchpad, you CAN zoom in and select the probe core.\n\nBut I do agree with Turbomuffin. An actiongroup to set control could be very useful."}]}
