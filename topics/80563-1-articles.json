It\u0027s above the cloud cover and I want to build a telescope/observatory on it. Having a devil of a time landing there though in the first place with just a basic rocket (I want to plant a flag as a beacon for later). I\u0027ve tried...oh roughly 20 times now? You\u0027d think I\u0027d land there simply by accident at this point but nope, have hit all around it but never on it. A helicopter is really the ideal craft to get me there but we don\u0027t have one of those, nor do I have anything for a VTOL and the plateau isn\u0027t long enough for me to land on, so I\u0027m stuck with a rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips for aiming these sub-orbital trajectories? I get up to about 70 km (just easier to maneuver and the trajectory stops moving once airborne) then make my adjustments to deal with spin and that sorta thing. Then I let it fall and make what few adjustments I can on the way down until the atmosphere grabs the rocket again and I lose control. I don\u0027t really see what more I can do but figured I\u0027d ask. Or does anyone have any alternate ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T03:24:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, what you can do (Instead of trying to land a whole plane) is attach parachutes to your plane and activate them when you are over your target (After you deactivate your engine of course) that way you can land vertically without a VTOL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T04:02:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not drive a rover up the mountain?
