I heard Felipe calling the tech trees more of an introduction to newer players. To me, this seems like it should stay as an extended tutorial. A story seems intrinsic to career mode. Maybe mission 1 could be to put a telescope into orbit and we unexpectedly see a kerbol system-sized asteroid 20 kerbolnautical units away and we start doing rocket science to find out how to get out of the Kerbol system. As the updates pile on, new solar systems are mapped and we plan our mission to get out of the system. Story aside, the minor stuff would include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Achievement system (for visiting and landing all planets/moons and easter eggs as well as other random things like \u0022Docking master - Dock 500 times\u0022, \u0022Space Station into Orbit\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Customizing stats. You gain science to improve the drag, efficiency, mass of parts/engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart availability:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Most of the parts are available, and only the really good/large ones like large tanks, mainsails, and nuclear engines should be unlockable. After these are unlocked, NEW parts become researchable as the updates pile on. This is where science comes in. We go and do science to research newer parts that are going to get us out of the kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would kind of make sense after having done an extended tutorial. It would make beginners follow a story, and when (or if) they complete it, they can then do whatever their heart desires in sandbox mode. (Maybe you can make sandbox mode only unlockable after completing the story? Although that would make no sense because kerbin would have been accreted onto the asteroid.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Sorry if i posted in the wrong channel)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T02:48:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 02:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Expwnential\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
