Its kapital city, Kerlin, was surrounded by the mighty armies of the Koviet Union. While the Kazis desperately tried to destroy all the snacks they had hoarded, the Kerbal States were trying\u00A0to gather up the Kazi rocket scientists that worked on the K-2 rocket, the first missile of sorts. Werhner von Kerman and his missile team had heard of the strict snack confiscation policy imposed by the Koviets, and together they decided that they loved their cheese dip too much to surrender to the Koviets. Desperate to save their snacks, they snuck towards the Kerbal State\u0027s army under cover of darkness. After many days of travel through the woods, they finally surrendered to KS forces. The Kerbal States hit the jackpot of rocket scientists. But even the lead rocket scientists in the world could not keep up with a somewhat obscure kerbal that had only recently gotten out of prison.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002207jRzk0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/07jRzk0.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nK-2 rocket, ballistic reentry test, first object to cross the K\u00E9rman line\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(34,34,34);font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0 One year. Sergei Kermanolev had only been out of prison for nearly\u00A0a year, and was still facing charges for supposedly hiding snacks from the Kommunist Party. Only recently had he failed in attaching SRBs to a fighter plane to boost its clime rate. While he worked on SRB powered planes unsuccessfully under his superior Klushko, the Kazis finally surrendered unconditionally. With the surrender of the Kazis, the Koviet forces captured K-2 rockets that were sent back to Krussia. Kermanolev, Klushko, and other Koviet scientists analyzed the captured rockets and started to draw designs for improved versions. Political\u00A0tensions rose between the UKKR (Union of Kommunist Kocialist Republiks) and the Kerbal States over how to divide up the old Kazi land.\u00A0With the future of Kerbin very uncertain, the rocket scientists on both sides worked frantically to develop interkontinental ballistic missiles to attack each other. With the Koviets getting more and more secretive and less open to negotiations with the KS, the Kold War had begun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-27T02:50:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2016 02:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Sanic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sanic","CreatedById":149920,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T20:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 MOAR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EPrelude Part 2 - The Intermediate Years\u00A0- 1346\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 With the Kold War now in full swing, the KS and UKKR raced to develop larger and larger S-bombs, special bombs designed to rapidly decompose snacks and thus shatter the morale of the enemy. Both sides raced to create missiles that could strike the enemy from interkontinental distances. In 1346, Sergei Kermanolev and other top Koviet rocket scientists were sent to Kermany to develop rockets based on the captured K-2s. Armed with this knowledge, Sergei Kermanolev further developed the K-2 into his K series of rockets, beginning with the K-3. Under pressure from the Kommunist Party, and the military, the early K series rockets were all military missiles designed to carry larger and larger S-bomb charges. But while Kermanolev toiled on the early K series military rockets, the Kerbal States turned their attention to their captured\u00A0K-2 rockets...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0It wasn\u0027t much, but at least they had their cheese dip. Wernher von Kerman looked around his almost barren room. The Kerbal States had\u00A0shelled as little as they could on the living quarters for the rocket scientists. Werner sighed as he ate his cheese and crackers, taking some comfort in the fact he wasn\u0027t captured by the Koviets. Still, he was a prisoner, along with his team, but at least he got to work with rockets. He had heard rumors from some members of his rocketry team that had barely escaped the Koviets about their strict snack policy. Wernher was interruped from his snacking when a KS soldier opened his door and told him they had an important mission planned that would require his expertise in rocketry. Eager to do something, anything really, he agreed to go with the soldier. As he walked towards the launch tower, he noticed the familiar black and white coloring of the K-2 rocket. Wernher asked the soldier, in stiff English, what the rocket was for. The soldier replied \u0022Research.\u0022 Werner \u00A0noticed something being done with the nose cone\u00A0of the K-2, but before he could ask the soldier what they were doing with the rocket, he was called over by another solder standing near the launchpad\u00A0to help with the inspection. Wernher asked his fellow scientists what the rocket was for. They didn\u0027t know either, but from the looks of things the top nosecone was meant to detatch. Abruptly, the spaceport PA announced 5 minutes until launch, and told all kerbonnel to head to the assigned viewing areas for the historic launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Wernher von Kerman\u00A0and his fellow scientists were ushered into Mission Control and finally informed about the nature of the mission. Wernher was\u00A0exhilarated. The Kazis had never allowed him to do such a thing, because of pressures on the K-2 development. Pictures from space! Wernher was about to go outside on the beach naked and dance in joy when he was once again interrupted by the PA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 10... 9... 8... 7... Wernher reached for the cheese dip only to realize it had all been eaten. Still, the loss of his favorite snack during this great moment could not dampen his mood. 6... 5... 4... 3...\u00A02... 1... Ignition! The rocket, with its heavy warhead removed, had an incredible TWR of almost 10, and sprang off the pad on its groundbreaking mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uXcsaOp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uXcsaOp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Despite the incredible speed of the launch, it was rather uneventful, and after reaching an apokee of 74km, the booster burned out, and the small nosecone seperated. By this time, the probe was out of sight. The PA announced that all was well, and an apokee of 74km had been reached. After an uneventful yet nail-biting experience, the tiny payload was recovered only a couple kilometers from Kape Kanaveral. After much debate, the coolest looking photo was chosen for press release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vIzUQPn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vIzUQPn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Back in the Koviet Union, the recent news craze about the first photos from space from a KS rocket finally convinced the Kommunist Party to allow their rocket scientists to made dual-purpose rockets that could function as space launch vehicles and IKBMs. Emphasis was placed on the missile portion, but this did not stop Sergei Kermanolev from developing the most overbuilt IKBM ever. While it was able to be used as an IKBM, Kermanolev had his sights set on space, and cared less about its practical applications as a missile. With the UKKR seemingly eons behind the Kerbal States in rocket technology, Wernher von Kerman\u00A0and his team worked at a more lax pace, not predicting\u00A0the massive leaps and bounds the Koviets would make in rocketry technology in the coming years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-10T06:24:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2016 06:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Sanic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parkaboy","CreatedById":64208,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T20:42:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is great!

The president of the Kerbal States, Harry K. Kerman, ordered Wernher and his team to build a research-only rocket as to avoid looking like a \u0027warmonger\u0027 using a soon-to-be military missile as a launch vehicle. The Jool-C launcher was now of limits to scientific payload, forcing the Kerbal States to develop a new and more explody\u00A0rocket into orbit. President Kerman couldn\u0027t have chosen a worse time to stop the Jool-C\u00A0development. President Kerman clearly ate some drugged snacks that day, because right after banning the use of the Jool-C for a satellite, Kerman announced that the KS would put a satellite in orbit during Kerbonational Keophysical Year, meaning that Wernher and his team had until late 1958 to put something in orbit with a completely new rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Sergei Kermanolev munched on his cabbage glumly, awaiting approval for his newest rocket.

He heard a knock on the door, and the mailkerb handed him a letter bearing the official Koviet seal.

This meeting is dismissed.\u0022 Kermanolev felt somewhat odd about being the only one to get up and leave, all eyes in the room on him, but nonetheless he had gotten the go-ahead for K-7 production.

A small avionics package and batteries were packed into a metal sphere, where four Communotron 16s were fastened onto the side to transmit the menacing beeps.\u00A0In a single Kerbal month, the Stayputnik 1 was tested and approved for launch atop the barely tested K-7. Sergei Kermanolev was feeling more confident about this launch than any other, despite the K-7 having only worked once before, and that K-7 being a slightly older model than the one being used for this launch. The Stayputnik was the future of kerbalkind; it practically defined the \u0027caution to the wind\u0027 attitude of all future Koviet missions. The K-7 stood at the Launchpad, fully fueled and ready to take its tiny payload into orbit.

This could mean only one thing: Sputnik was a success, and the Koviet Union had forever etched its name into the history books by being the first to put a satellite in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bVurVYb.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bVurVYb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Sergei celebrated, he and his fellow scientists kept an eye on Stayputnik\u0027s telemetry, to calculate which country would be hearing the beeps from space. A mere 10 minutes after probe separation, Stayputnik 1 passed over the southern part of the Kerbal States.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lsWKDo6.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lsWKDo6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 20 minutes later, the team determined Stayputnik 1 was seeing its first sunrise from orbit. Having no cameras onboard, the Koviets were left to imagine what the view was like from orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SExPvUC.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SExPvUC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Stayputnik 1 would continue to transmit its menacing beep across Kerbin for many months to come.
