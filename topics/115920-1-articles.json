Anyway, there is only very tenuous proof for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main evidence is in the orbits of long period comets. You\u0027d expect these to come randomly from any direction. But in reality they seem to have a preference for some inclinations over others. This could be explained with a very distant planet giving them gravity slingshots. The numbers for long period comets also don\u0027t match up. If you simulate the formation of the solar system you can see roughly how much stuff there should be in the Oort cloud. But if you compare that to how many long period comets we see, there is a 2 orders of magnitude discrepancy. This would again be explained by a distant planet. The orbit of Sedna is another weird thing. Sedna has an elliptical orbit with a periapsis way past Neptune and an apoapsis about 1000 AU. Since its orbit never even comes close to Neptune it is a mystery how it ever ended up in such an elliptical orbit. And Sedna isn\u0027t alone, there are other bodies with these weird orbital parameters. All of which could be explained by another heavy object in a very distant orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, all these things could also be explained by a close pass of a few stars a couple million years back. We know that there isn\u0027t anything really big out there thanks to IR observations. But something the size of the earth could exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe implications depend entirely on the body that we detect. Extremely elliptical orbits with a very high apoapsis imply a interstellar capture, circular in a cleared orbit implies formation within the solar system. We can\u0027t really say until we see it. We know its possible from exoplanet observations, so it wouldn\u0027t be that big a surprise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"benzman","CreatedById":82512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T19:32:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had never heard of Nibiru so I Googled it.

There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 that can be attributed to the gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System.

Anyway, there is only very tenuous proof for it.\u003Cp\u003EThe main evidence is in the orbits of long period comets. You\u0027d expect these to come randomly from any direction. But in reality they seem to have a preference for some inclinations over others. This could be explained with a very distant planet giving them gravity slingshots. The numbers for long period comets also don\u0027t match up. If you simulate the formation of the solar system you can see roughly how much stuff there should be in the Oort cloud. But if you compare that to how many long period comets we see, there is a 2 orders of magnitude discrepancy. This would again be explained by a distant planet. The orbit of Sedna is another weird thing. Sedna has an elliptical orbit with a periapsis way past Neptune and an apoapsis about 1000 AU. Since its orbit never even comes close to Neptune it is a mystery how it ever ended up in such an elliptical orbit. And Sedna isn\u0027t alone, there are other bodies with these weird orbital parameters. All of which could be explained by another heavy object in a very distant orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, all these things could also be explained by a close pass of a few stars a couple million years back.

But something the size of the earth could exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe implications depend entirely on the body that we detect. Extremely elliptical orbits with a very high apoapsis imply a interstellar capture, circular in a cleared orbit implies formation within the solar system. We can\u0027t really say until we see it.

Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a gravitational interaction with another body.[35] In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested \u003Cstrong\u003Ethree possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt\u003C/strong\u003E, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the Sun in the stellar cluster in which it formed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trans-Neptunian planet hypothesis has been advanced in several forms by a number of astronomers, including Rodney Gomes and Patryk Lykawka. One scenario involves perturbations of Sedna\u0027s orbit by a hypothetical planetary-sized body in the inner Oort cloud. \u003Cstrong\u003ERecent simulations show that Sedna\u0027s orbital traits could be explained by perturbations by a Neptune-mass object at 2,000 AU (or less), a Jupiter-mass (MJ) at 5,000 AU, or even an Earth-mass object at 1,000 AU.\u003C/strong\u003E[37][41] Computer simulations by Patryk Lykawka have suggested that Sedna\u0027s orbit may have been caused by a body roughly the size of Earth, ejected outward by Neptune early in the Solar System\u0027s formation and currently in an elongated orbit between 80 and 170 AU from the Sun.[42] Mike Brown\u0027s various sky surveys have not detected any Earth-sized objects out to a distance of about 100 AU. However, it is possible that such an object may have been scattered out of the Solar System after the formation of the inner Oort cloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach of the proposed mechanisms for Sedna\u0027s extreme orbit would leave a distinct mark on the structure and dynamics of any wider population. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00CB\u202080 AU)\u003C/strong\u003E. If Sedna were captured from another planetary system that rotated in the same direction as the Solar System, then all of its population would have orbits on relatively low inclinations and have semi-major axes ranging from 100\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153500 AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, one with low and one with high inclinations.
