I\\\u0027ve tried gliding, landing skids, splashdowns, you name it; the wheels or skids just aren\\\u0027t enough to land without the plane coming apart. And they aren\\\u0027t large, either - just the command module, an engine and some wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m looking for any tips on how to make an effective landing on a smallish spaceplane that leaves it able to take off again.
