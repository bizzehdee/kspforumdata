However, whenever I try to land my plane it explodes from the shock of landing. I\\\u0027ve tried gliding, landing skids, splashdowns, you name it; the wheels or skids just aren\\\u0027t enough to land without the plane coming apart. And they aren\\\u0027t large, either - just the command module, an engine and some wings.\n\nI\\\u0027m looking for any tips on how to make an effective landing on a smallish spaceplane that leaves it able to take off again. Any help at all is appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T14:38:03Z","Content":"Are you using C7s rolling landing gear?

Or are you talking about the plugin ones that extend and retract?\n\nAlso, a bit of extra information: I\\\u0027m usually going about 45 mp/s when I hit the ground.

They will enable you to land at almost any speed. The ones in that pack will often cause you to explode when landing at a speed over 30 m/s"},{"CreatedByName":"Cswartz9","CreatedById":22468,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T14:47:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, the plugin ones.

You want that needle to be as close to 0m/s as you can manage as you are about to touch down.\n\n\u003E ![H7X0V.png](http://i.imgur.com/H7X0V.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T19:44:51Z","Content":"Instead of wheels, add a Cart, it\\\u0027s more tolerable, and you can use brakes as you slow your plane on the runway.
