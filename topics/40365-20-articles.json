A microwave system doesn\u0027t have to actually generate power itself, it simplies receives it and that\u0027s why they are so damn efficient. Sure, you can build some truly excellent small spacecraft using the microwave systems but actually guaranteeing power throughout a mission actually requires the investment of a great deal of time and effort. That is the primary balancing factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1 electric charge = 1KW is not entirely arbitrary, it\u0027s a convenient unit based on the generating capacity of the stock solar panels. In space, with no atmospheric losses, you\u0027d expect to get somewhere in the region of 1600W/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E from a perfect solar panel. That means a 100% gigantor would need to be around 11m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E of collecting area to generate 18KW. Even taking into account less than optimal efficiency, this is a number that probably isn\u0027t too silly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, using 50KW = 1 electric charge, the gigantor now has to be minimum 550m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, which it just isn\u0027t. Deploy one of these solar satellites in Low Kerbol Orbit and 80MW\u002B would be obtainable from one solitary panel if you pushed it to the limit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see logic to restricting the amount of input microwave power to a particular dish though, the other thing that could be worthwhile would be to make orientation of the receiving dish matter - a single dish couldn\u0027t receive power from transmitters on opposite sides of the dish. Then you\u0027d have to add extra dishes pointing in different directions to maintain power supply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately though, reliable microwave power is the reward for developing good space infrastructure and for the taking the long term option of deploying infrastructure, rather than just slapping a nuclear reactor on the back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbinator24","CreatedById":81601,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T18:34:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Fractal,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you see my reply at the bottom of last page?

It uses extremely high power lasers to vapourise small pellets containing Deuterium and Tritium fuel, the extremely rapid vapourisation causes compression of the fusion fuel and initiates a fusion reaction. In the case of the VISTA, we are using inertial fusion to generate thrust rather than to generate electrical power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to vapourise 30 of these pellets per second in order to generate something very closely approximating to continuous thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine requires electrical power to power up the laser system, however, the key realisation is that when we initiation fusion in the fuel pellet we can achieve far more thrust than could be achieved by the laser alone because we get the energy from the fusion of all the Deuterium\u002BTritium fuel as well. That means we can achieve reasonably high thrust and excellent specific impulse with moderate power input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t finalised all of the mechanics for this yet but expect that it will require moderate amounts of power (think upgraded nuclear reactors), it will have average thrust (think 500-800kN) but fantastic specific impulse.

Propellant tanks could also serve as further shielding for any crew. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest danger to life would actually not be those onboard the vessel but to objects nearby - this is not an engine that you\u0027d want to activate in the vacinity of a space station or near another ship - the fusion reaction occurs at the very tip of the conical region and so nearby objects would be completely unshielded from the high neutron and gamma ray flux. If I can implement such dangers in a way that isn\u0027t too crippling I might do this, it would provide a drawback to what is going to be a seriously powerful engine.
