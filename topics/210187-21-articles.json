There were good code but written for a different system, there were absolutely terrible code written for the same system, and there wasn\u0027t enough of us to rewrite everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds familiar? \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow we managed to survive the mess? By writting wrappers. We defined a framework in which we would develop our product - and this framework, indeed, took a lot of work from all the team to get done right. We took months on it, and we only managed to accomplish that because the Manager had a solid background on development himself and agreed that the solution was solid - but hell, we took a lot of heat due the lack of \u0022results\u0022 for a lot of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the framework got ready, we wrote a Facade around every 3rd party code - essentially shelling code around our interfaces, writing code to convert things when needed. Some CPU were wasted on these conversions, and again some heat because CPU resources are usually limited on embedded systems - but, again, we got lucky because the hardware were over dimensioned for the task and we have some fat to burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only time we got screwed was when the Top Brass, worried about how slow were were developing the thing, decided to \u0022help\u0022 by hiring contractors to accelerate the deliveries. It was not totally bad, the knowledge of the contractor effectively helped on some issues - but the dude was being paid by task, not time spent, and so he did things the faster he could - taking shortcuts over our framework and doing direct calls inside the components instead of using our public interfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuess what? We lost months of development rewriting a good part of the code he wrote, not because the code was bad (some of it was, but if the thing works, then it works!), but because he didn\u0027t follow up our interfaces and made calls to things that wasn\u0027t meant to be called outside their contexts, completely screwing up the stacks of the threads and halting the whole system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, one of my colleagues, besides being a very good electrical engineer, was (frankly) a bad coder.

Working alone is, almost always, way \u0022easier\u0022 - but most of the tasks of nowadays development are too big to be handled by a single dude, and so we end up working on teams, where\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eeverything\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0is more complicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eworst problems\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0on working on teams bigger than 3 or 4 dudes is the Chain of Responsibility.

New features, on the other hand, is how management is able to sell more copies of the product.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I hate to tell you: they are not exactly wrong.

If someone gives a really annoying bug a low priority, it will be essentially not fixed until the end of the project when no new features are left to be added. But since at this point the sellings are usually stalling, there will be no money left for developers, and so we have a bug that will never be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBug Priorization is a Lost Art, I can tell you.

When it launches in EA next year it will be about 5 years of development, and like sweatbox this announcement gives me substantial pause in regards to the state of the game. What happened with KSP1 is irrelevant in this discussion in my opinion. The context of the previous communications over the past 3 years including the last delay announcement\u0027s phrasing appeared to set an expectation of delivering a feature complete game at launch. This announcement not only is a radical departure from that tone, it also lacks any indication as to the state of the roadmap features or any target/expectation of cadence for when they will be added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the \u0022just getting each feature finished and \u0022polished\u0022 enough to enable for users \u2014 not starting on each feature from the beginning.\u0022 when in context to the stated rational for early access just doesn\u0027t pass the sniff test. If you\u0027re at the point of \u0022polishing\u0022 those features then the \u0022getting users feedback on the core experience\u0022 is meaningless because it is not going to substantially change a nearly complete feature that is \u0022just getting each feature finished and \u0022polished\u0022 enough to enable for users\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also been very optimistic and looked forward to when KSP2 would launch. This announcement however seems like it came from a completely different direction when compared to the last 3 years of communications, and as such it gives me the feeling that Private Division had kicked the can as far down the road as they could and Take Two ran thin on patience and gave Private Division an ultimatum to either start generating revenue or cancel the project. I will check it out when it hits early access launch like I\u0027ve said before, however, given the context of things I will very likely refund it and wait until there is at least most of the expected features and an established cadence of how quickly they are delivering the features on the roadmap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-21T09:33:12Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2022 09:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by PopinFRESH\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-21T10:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou see the mess created in people\u0027s minds by the lack of communication?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust repeating the same old information from 2019-2020 over and over again and just presenting the KSP1 \u002B Interstellar mods feature set without coming through with the real answers and solutions.
