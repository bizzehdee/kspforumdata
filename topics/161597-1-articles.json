But anyway, time to tell whoever comes across this topic. I\u0027m at school now, waiting for classes to start, having to deal with the day, with another kind of pressure. My beloved cat, Tara, had to be put down last night. She wasn\u0027t eating or drinking, and we made the decision after she hadn\u0027t had anything to eat or drink since Thursday. She was 15 years old, and we got her as a stray kitten at two weeks since birth. Unfortunately, she didn\u0027t get the amount of food necessary for her body to grow during kittenhood, so even though she was considered roughly 90 in cat years, she still looked like a month-old kitten in size. Everyday when I came home from school, she would be waiting for me outside the house. A friendly \u0022Meow\u0022 when I got through the door, and nearly every night she would jump up on my bed and sit there, curling up in a little ball and purring, which helped me to go to sleep. She lived a nice, happy, fruitful life, and we cannot thank her enough for that. We rescued her from sickness and hunger as a kitten, dumpster diving for food, and gave her a home, a warm bed, and a nice outside area to explore and sit in the sun when she was cold. She was with us for 15 years, and now she\u0027s playing with Kenny up in the sky, having all the milk and chicken she could ever hope for. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETara: 2002 - 2017 \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-04T22:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy condolences on your loss\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-04T23:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like you were great friends.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-05T00:14:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLosing a pet is terrible.
