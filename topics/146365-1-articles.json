I know what everyone must be thinking, \u0022keep your hands away from the spacebar!\u0022 and I do. Most of the time its purely accidental, a water bottle falls over or my elbow hits it etc. Im thinking it would be great to have a toggle button to double tap for staging this way early staging mishaps could be avoided.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-22T19:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can lock staging so the spacebar doesn\u0027t accidentally stage with Alt-L.
