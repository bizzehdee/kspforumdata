I\u0027m trying to pick up asteroids with a somewhat sizable ship (let\u0027s say at least a 32 fuel tank with a skipper on it) - but even if I line it with Vernor engines it is kinda sluggish, and no matter what it seems to shake like a wet golden retriever when it should be holding still. What is that shaking thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly, i haven\u0027t been able to figure out a good, strong configuration for adjusting thrust and brakes with the RCS.

Each point where they\u0027re at produces a torque on the center of mass, so you need to find a way to make those torques equal in the direction you want to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Senormeens","CreatedById":145344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T01:42:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the maneuverability make sure your RCS is balanced around the center of mass. too much RCS at one end and not the other will make your craft pivot around the center of mass, but if the ports, and thrust, are evenly spread, it should make translating the craft to be much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the asteroid make sure your thrust is lined up with the new center of mass after grabbing the asteroid. you can right click on your new space rock and select target center of mass, which will the put your thrust pointing through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the shaking i don\u0027t know what could be causing that, i have never run into it before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T04:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor asteroids, I tend to turn OFF the RCS modules at the front of a given rocket, they\u0027re less useful and MAY be poorly placed.
