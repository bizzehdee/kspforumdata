There are only three locations you can stock up on this stuff, and they each present unique challenges. You can rather easily and quickly get it from asteroids, but only some asteroids have it and you don\u0027t know if it does or not until you reach there, so it\u0027s kind of like a double-or-nothing. Eve has its obvious drawbacks, but you don\u0027t have to worry about landing your refinery (so it can be bigger) and power generation is simple. Eeloo is just really, really far away, which means that your initial setup will take years and you have serious problems with power generation (I think you need 3 jumbo solar panels to provide 1 EC/s) so you either have to blitz RTGs, also refine ore for fuel cells, or come up with some other creative solution. There\u0027s a potential 4th solution if you\u0027re running K\u002B, which involves a solar-orbit particle collector. That just sounds like a huge pain in the ass, but could be fun. Still difficult, so I like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContrast that with ore, where you could just do the standard thing where you plop a refinery on Minmus and go to town. Nobody would bother with the technical challenges of siting it elsewhere. This makes you really problem-solve to get your infrastructure up, so that when you warp that first vessel you feel like you\u0027re really earning it. CRP isn\u0027t a crippling dependency, it\u0027s more just an easy sheet of resources you can include. Besides, it\u0027s Roverdude\u0027s stuff - it\u0027s pretty much as close to stock as you\u0027re going to get.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
