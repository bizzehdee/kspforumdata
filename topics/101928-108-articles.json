Back when the whole \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E split, or invention of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, however you want to put it, they were at one time both required for either one to work. I know that they are currently both stand alone mods. My question is how or what is the big difference between the 2 mods now? Why would a person want to use both mods vs. just using one or the other? This may come off sounding bad, but I mean this as an honest question.\n\nIve pretty much always put both of them in my game, and im not a big user of anything any of these 2 mods ever did. I only just did some occasional attachments of parts in the field basically.\n\nSo if someone can give me a pretty good idea of the differences, and/or the reasons to have both mods I would appreciate it. thanks"}]}
