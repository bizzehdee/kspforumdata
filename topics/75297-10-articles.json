I\u0027m not sure if KSP\u0027s mechanics will allow something accurate enough for some folks. A few of flat wide lifting body fuselage sections (like the X40s) might be cool, I need to know more about FAR drag models to get correct settings for them though. I\u0027m focusing on getting IVAs into all the crewed parts right now. so new engines/bodies won\u0027t happen for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
