The banding is ok on smaller craft where there is only one or two stripes, but it gets repetitive on some really big fairings. I think one of the problems of KSP parts is proportions. I find that often its so much harder to build on a small scale since most of the parts are built for larger scales. On small scale detail work, you often see people using odd parts such as parachutes or solar panels since non of the other parts are suitable for that kind of detail work. Wings are my main problem. On a big 747 or so, or even a mk2 scale craft, it works fine, but if you want to make a tiny plane like Cupcake\u0027s stuff, you have to get really inventive.

On smaller rockets, it looks ridiculous cause it can take 10 to 20% of the upper stage. The banding is ok on smaller craft where there is only one or two stripes, but it gets repetitive on some really big fairings. I think one of the problems of KSP parts is proportions. I find that often its so much harder to build on a small scale since most of the parts are built for larger scales. On small scale detail work, you often see people using odd parts such as parachutes or solar panels since non of the other parts are suitable for that kind of detail work. Wings are my main problem. On a big 747 or so, or even a mk2 scale craft, it works fine, but if you want to make a tiny plane like Cupcake\u0027s stuff, you have to get really inventive. On the other hand, the solar panels are the opposite. The gigantor panels are reasonable for large stations and so on, but not really on smaller \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, but the small retractable panels look too small to actually be useful, even if the mechanics are fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood point on the small rockets, it does look silly in almost every application at that scale, and a lot of the parts are designed for larger applications. \u00A0Building on a small scale is as fine an art as building on a giant scale in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat discussion so far, although I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve heard form the \u0022leave them be\u0022 camp yet. \u00A0I guess one argument against it is it would be potentially craft destroying for people updating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-29T22:27:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne arguement for leaving them be is in-game usability.
