Floodlights on boom for asteroid targeting. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/om9cA)\n\nInstructions: \n\nStandard vertical launch ascent profile. Turns well in atmosphere but don\u0027t push your luck. Note that the SRBs do not separate--one stage to 70km, then eject the lifter, light the LV-Ns and circularize. Take care separating from lifter, you can damage the towing boom. \n\nAction Groups:\n\n1. Toggle LV-N engines\n\n2. Toggle conventional rockets (emergency thrust)\n\n8. Toggle solar panels\n\n**Craft file:** **http://kerbalx.com/kuzzter/Kranefly** **MkE.craft\u0022 target=\u0022\\_blank\u0022\u003Edownload Kranefly MkE\u0027\u003Ehttp://**[**download Kranefly MkE**](http://kerbalx.com/kuzzter/Kranefly)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T15:21:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 03:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T14:01:27Z","Content":"Awesome, right in the nick of time. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI just don\u0027t like how it is a manned craft instead of probe-powered.
