It happens when attachment point of the wing is in front of the centre of mass, so KSP thinks the elevons should be used like canards and reverses them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the problem stems from the swept wings having their centre of lift further back from their attachment point that most wings, so they are hard to place without causing the above affect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/HDG7Y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
