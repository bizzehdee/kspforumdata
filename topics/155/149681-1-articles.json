Also has a lot of extra utility that we can leverage for various effects.\n* Upgraded Vectrosity to latest version.\n* Upgraded Vehicle Physics Pro to latest version.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BCode cleanup\n* Heavily reduced garbage generation caused by foreach loops, Linq usage, and various other things.\n* Made sure that all of our singleton classes properly clean themselves up.\n* Optimized KerbalEVA.\n* Rewrote CrewManifest and related crew handling (roster, vessel crew list, etc).\n* Optimized PartModules.\n* Optimize latitude/longitude/altitude calls to often use a combined get-all method.\n* Fix how some enumerator interfaces are declared in classes.\n* Optimized waypoint site name generation to generate a lot less garbage with its string lists.\n* Many part modules now cache parts instead of polling the entire vessel multiple times per frame.\n* Revised how most forces and torques are applied (see note on this subject below in Moddability).\n* Added DoubleCurve\n* ScenarioModules now awake and load during game load and so are valid in modules\u0027 OnStart.\n* Considerable work to Krakensbane and FloatingOrigin to improve precision and performance and lower garbage.\n* Various \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E fixes and performance improvements.\n* Default KSPEvents and KSPActions to being nonpersistent in terms of state. This means all their fields won\u0027t be serialized/deserialized to and from the save game files.\n* Now always use g0 = 9.80665 and G (big G) = 6.67408e-11 for gravitational constants.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BFlow Overhaul\n* Rewrote resource flow entirely. Now just four flow modes. Can set per-tank priority for all but AllVessel and NoFlow. Surface crossfeed for rocket engines as well as jets. Fixed priority issues. Much faster. PartResources no longer MonoBehaviours. Can set crossfeed per attach node. Electric Charge now uses STAGE_PRI so can be prioritized. Resource transfer in flight can be set to require valid crossfeed for those resources which obey crossfeed.

This fixes the hop when retracting landing legs.\n* Added tweakable that allows player to specify whether his wheels deploy while shielded in a cargo bay.\n* Fix landing legs being exported to the wrong collision layer.\n* Wheel gravity is now properly handled in a standard manner, which should fix a good deal of instability.\n* Fix EVA kerbals blowing up wheels on contact. They now go through them.\n* Fixed landing legs teleporting from a semi-deployed state to a semi-retracted state when retracted.\n* Wheel damage does not process damage for two seconds after a vessel loads, prevents spontaneous explosions.\n* Suspension colliders are no longer disabled for 0.5 seconds upon retract, causing them to fall through the ground momenarily, blowing up your engines.\n* Deployable landing gear and legs now have deployment sounds.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BCommunications Networks\n* Additional functionality and gameplay components to the Antenna and Probe parts through a series of distinct but related mechanics. When CommNet is enabled, probes will require a connection back to Kerbin or to a control point to have full control, and crewed vessels lacking pilots will have slightly limited control without such a connection. Relays can extend the range of such connections and bounce signals around planets and moons that would otherwise occlude. Science transmission receives a bonus for high signal strength. New antenna parts allow building complex networks, which can be visualized in map view. See KSPedia for more details.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BKerbNet\n* Added KerbNet, which allows the player to see terrain under their satellite, and place custom waypoints with a targeting interface. Allows the player to see biomes and anomalies at higher levels. Scan field of view for KerbNet varies by part and smoothly changes between surface altitude and orbital altitude.\n* KerbNet allows all probes and labs manned by a scientist to map as long as they have a communications network connection that eventually bounces to Kerbin.\n* Gave KerbNet visibility modes to hide some of the interface around the map.\n* Gave KerbNet auto-refresh settings to allow it to refresh without player intervention.\n* Gave KerbNet enhanced mode, which activates on some vessels such as rovers to give them better sensors in certain situations.\n* Add game option that allows KerbNet to either orient to the orbit normal, preventing flipping when passing over the poles, or to orient to north, which is less disorienting for some players.\n* Many aspects of KerbNet given flavor and fluff. Scanning a sun results in yellow and white noise, scanning a gas giant is similar except hued based on that planet. Stars and scan static can appear in the background past the horizon of a scan.\n* Resources can specify a scientific abbreviation. Utilized in KerbNet for the mode icon.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BDebug Window\n* Completely overhauled the debug window to utilize new Unity GUI.\n* New debug console has syntax highlighting that highlights classes with persistent pastel colors if they bracket their names. [Bracket] your class names in debug logs modders.\n* New debug console has command input support which is moddable, type /help for a full listing of commands, and what they do.\n* Added new debug screen for creating kerbals with specific names, genders, skills, levels, and classes.\n* Debug options for displaying errors/exceptions as screen messages.\n* Added set orbit debug cheat screen.\n* Added rendezvous controls to set orbit debug cheat screen.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BOrbits\n* All anomalies (ObT, mean anomaly, eccentric anomaly, true anomaly) are now consistently negative when approaching the periapsis for both elliptical and hyperbolic trajectories (previously, only hyperbolic trajectories used negative anomalies). This means that eccentric anomaly and true anomaly are now in the range -pi..pi instead of 0..2pi for elliptical trajectories.\n* Reference frames instead of quaternions are used for calculating orbital position and velocity, leading to increased speed when rendering patched conics.\n* Improved precision in orbit calculations.\n* Rewrote orbit targeting / closest approach finding.\n* Fixed issues where objects jump when going on and off rails.\n* Fix target orientation markers when the target is on rails.\n* Refactored such that orbital position and velocity and vessel position and velocity are correct for the FixedUpdate cycle.\n* Made target relative velocity work for celestial bodies.\n* Trajectories that re-encounter a body just escaped are now detected.\n* Trajectories that encounter two bodies now correctly show the first encounter even if it is further out (eg, Mun stealing a Minmus encounter).\n* Elliptical encounter trajectories no longer flicker.\n* Conic patch settings (draw mode and limit) are now exposed in the Video Settings.\n* Added game option for legacy orbit targeting.\n* Map node labels space themselves out nicely when cluttered.\n* Targeting info for moons in other SoIs now works.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BContracts\n* Contracts are now also weighted by celestial body, so if the player starts declining contracts to Jool, they will see them less often.\n* Contracts now keep track of if they have been viewed. There are three states: unseen, seen but not clicked, and clicked and read.\n* Contract weighting now applies negative weight if a contract has been viewed when it expires.\n* Exploration contracts now always appear in Mission Control if there is not one currently available.\n* Explore contracts overhauled, they now utilize the same logic World Firsts used to use to select a \u0022package\u0022 of related objectives. They can appear multiple times per planet now, and should have a much more logical progression than they used to.\n* Exploration contract progression slowed slightly, now requires science on a planet before allowing a fly by of the next one. Also, in the early game, return from orbit and return from fly by are required before advancing on the Muns of the homeworld.\n* Removed old single objective World First contracts, other than the initial four.\n* Waypoint captions for survey contracts now state the altitude band of each waypoint.\n* Fix contract orbits not cleaning up properly when their contracts are cancelled as opposed to completed.\n* Grand tour contracts now require a new vessel to complete, so they cannot be cheesed by keeping one around that has seen every planet.\n* Fix contextual surveys not properly bouncing the navigation waypoint.\n* Asteroid recovery objective reworded and given a note for clarity.\n* Asteroid side objectives in facility construction contracts will now not appear unless the same requirements for asteroid recovery contracts to appear are met.\n* Crew transfer progress tracking objective reworded to make it clear that it does not need to utilize existing crew.\n* Reworded objective to hold above a waypoint in stationary orbit contracts for clarity.\n* If Kerbal G limits are enabled, tourists can either require going unconscious or require not going unconscious during the trip. Check the parameter details!\n* Adjusted Exploration contract flavor text to work better in multi-objective scenarios.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BBiomes\n* Biomes for many bodies have been redesigned for clarity, beauty, and utility. And we\u0027ve hidden a few extra surprises around as well!\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BEaster Eggs\n* Added hidden fun stuff to almost every planet.\n* Mohole given an empty PQSCity, which allows it to appear in KerbNet.\n* Gave many easter eggs colliders.\n* Fix Duna\u0027s SSTV not playing.\n* Unburied Duna\u0027s MSL.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BOther Work\n* Advanced Tweakables option in Gameplay Settings. With it off, some advanced features are hidden. Defaults off.\n* Autostrutting available for all parts (AT).\n* Autostruts can be gated behind a technology in career and science mode defined in Physics.cfg, by default it is the same technology regular struts are on.\n* Add grandparent mode to auto-struts.\n* Parachutes can have automatic holding of deployment until safe (AT).\n* Actuation toggles now affect symmetry counterparts in editor (some other \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/gimbal bits do too). Also hidden under Advanced Tweakables (AT).\n* Utilize HSV color space in more locations.\n* Quadrupled the amount of loading screen messages. You know, the important stuff.\n* Loads of new options in the difficulty settings.\n* Science data can be transferred by the part-part transfer mechanic (for certain probe cores).\n* Added physics easing for when landed/splashed vessels come off rails.\n* Certain probe cores (and the new science container part) can transfer data with no EVA required.\n* There is an additional drag curve whose function is to raise drag coefficient to a power based on the mach number. This leads to blunter things having (relatively) more drag supersonic than they did and pointier things having (relatively) less than they did. Pods will slow down better on steep reentries and planes will produce drag in better proportion to how streamlined they are (less overpowered airplane drag).\n* Fairings now include support for placing multiple payloads in them (and showing trusses for said payloads).\n* Tourist contracts work better with the Kerbal Gee Tolerance option.\n* Add a small negative contract weight for contracts that are read but not accepted.\n* Existing resource narrow band scanner ported to KerbNet interface, allowing it to zoom, among other things.\n* Removed biome readout information and flag rendering on narrow band scanner.\n* Added ellipsis to many text labels and fields, to prevent overflow while looking nice.\n* Input keys in the settings screen automatically expand with screen resolution.\n* Default parachute deployment mode set to \u0022when safe\u0022 - players everywhere rejoice.\n* All tooltips cooked to a nice golden color.\n* Added Viewmatic Survey Satellite stock relay craft.\n* Added /b4d455 command, which starts a game off with basically everything.\n* Background ambiance in the space center scene now fades smoothly between birds by day and crickets by night.\n* Background ambiance in the space center scene now fades out when at max time warp.\n* Background ambiance in general no longer always starts at zero, it randomly seeks when the scene loads. Hence, loading a game no longer immediately plays the exact same bird trill.\n* Most stock planes given a look over based on player feedback.\n* Added editor part categories for ground, electrical, communication, thermal, payload, and coupling parts.\n* Screen message text given much higher visibility.\n* Facilities in the space center now have verbose context menus in sandbox mode, allowing you to see their upgrades. They always show the maximum level of upgrades.\n* \u0022Require Complete\u0022 on antennae is now persistent and its state is saved.\n* Added community contest winner kerbal and unique waypoint names.\n* Camera can now be pointed at parts, not just vessel center of mass.\n* Added Plane and Relay vessel types/icons.\n* Airbrakes now have deployment limits.\n* Rebalance fairing panel mass downwards slightly.\n* Difficulty options for limiting part pressure and G-force tolerance.\n* Difficulty option for kerbal G-force tolerance. Kerbals go unconscious if their tolerance is exceeded.\n* Slight performance tweaks to some early 1.25m engines.\n* Swap around some early science parts in the tech tree.\n* Redid Eve\u0027s atmospheric pressure curve to smooth it out and remove errors. Eve\u0027s atmosphere thins out much faster now, so the high atmosphere is thinner. Also tweaked Jool\u0027s atmosphere so it rapidly goes from 15 atmospheres to 50 in the last few kilometers to achieve crushing pressures.\n* Can right-click on icons in the staging list to trigger the Part Action Window.\n* Support Rigid Attachment (non-bendy) option for part joints in cfg and in the PAW.\n* Added an \u0022Action Groups Always Allowed\u0022 advanced difficulty option.\n* Add 0.625m heat shield.\n* Lift from capsules and heat shields better handled to make lifting reentries better (easier).\n* Restructured in-flight pause menu to better show all options.\n* Don\u0027t lock all controls when using Warp To, only some.\n* Fix terrain vanishing at 1000m depth.\n* Allow targeting of close vessels by double-clicking.\n* Angle the canopies of parachutes in symmetry away from each other.\n* Resource transfer rate when transferring between parts now based on ingame time (taking warp into account) not realtime.\n* Fix issues with TR-2L stats.\n* Show tooltips on kerbal portraits.\n* Fix scientist skill text.\n* Fix issue with ladders not being re-grab-able if you board a seat, retract a ladder, leave the seat, then extend the ladder.\n* Update maneuver node patches (for targeting) when the vessel target changes.\n* The runway lights now follow the day/night cycle.\n* Moved a low tech wheel to a lower tech tier.\n* Moved an atmospheric sensor down to the science tech branch.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BMisc Fixes and Changes\n* Fixed issue where disabled \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E would enable during staging. Mods need to set stagingEnabled=False in their ModuleRCS blocks (unless they want staging on).\n* Catch exceptions during part loading so the loading process doesn\u0027t come to a halt.\n* Fix some issues with decouple modules, allow specifying the ejection force vector.\n* Try/catch the other PartModule update loops so one bad module doesn\u0027t interrupt others.\n* Don\u0027t try to set constant KSPFields.\n* Null check when getting resource mass on unloaded vessels with removed resources.\n* Remove some debug spam when querying Science Subjects by ID.\n* Fix Resource Display to show all resources correctly.\n* Improve launch clamp stability on revert.\n* Fix an issue with ModuleTripLogger not applying to kerbals in non-root parts.\n* Ablative shields with Ablator tweaked down in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E no longer show up pre-scorched in flight.\n* Ablative shields no longer show solid black when reaching zero ablator.\n* Fix serious regression with flow multipliers in ModuleEnginesFX.\n* Fix a wrong rotation in Moment of Intertia calculations.\n* Correct stock temperature gauges to use gauge threshold.\n* Fixed currency symbols not displaying properly when UI scale is changed by using inline Text Mesh Pro sprites.\n* Probe cores now have a hibernate feature which offers only partial control when activated but draws much less electricity. Can be set to automatically hibernate in warp (advanced tweakable).\n* Added a game setting for default throttle (rather than keeping it in Physics.cfg).\n* Fix bug where space center view can be messed up on loading a save from the main menu if the game was switched away from during load (old workaround was clear the input locks).\n* Renamed Science Tech to Scanning Tech since that\u0027s what it\u0027s for.\n* Fixed where CoPOffset and CoLOffset had CoMOffset added to them during application.\n* Fixed where an exception during loading of parts would stop the game loading.\n* IVA navball works like normal navball (vectors hidden when velocity is too small, radial and normal cues show only in Orbit mode).\n* Fix an issue where prop requirement met (on engine menus) was not being intuitively correct. See note in Moddability, below, for how to update jet parts.\n* Fix kerbals sliding on ladders.\n* For EVA kerbals, \u0027\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027 light shows whether the kerbal will reorient when a translate key is pressed (as set in Input Settings). T toggles this behavior when in EVA mode.\n* Several dialogs (such as quicksave) now accept Escape and Enter keys for dismissing or accepting contents. Science reports accept Tab to cycle messages.\n* Quicksave and Quickload hotkeys (F5/F9) work in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E view.\n* The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E part search tool now clears when pressing Escape.\n* Crossfeed toggle module can now require a technology researched to enable itself.

(onVesselPartCountChanged, onVesselModified, docked, undocked, et al)\n* Added onScreenResolutionModified event, fires when the screen resolution is modified.\n* Added many accessors/setters.\n* Vessel control level can be clamped to a field in Vessel (so can be restricted to Partial even if otherwise would be Full).\n* GetModuleMass/Cost methods can now be passed the situation.\n* Fix where kerbal mass (if set to nonzero) was not applied in the editor.\n* Added two new dictionary-related classes (DictionaryValueList and ListDictionary).\n* Celestial bodies now cache all of their PQS Cities.\n* All game root nodes now generate a random persistent seed, which is different from game to game.\n* All forces on valid parts except wheel forces are now done via Part.AddForce/Torque/AddForceAtPosition. Note that the forcemode used is Force; to use a different forcemode, convert the force to the correct amount. It is the job of the Flight Integrator to then apply all these forces to actual rigidbodies (rather than all the disparate modules\u0027 job).\n* Use mass-weighted average angular velocity of parts for vessel angular velocity.\n* ITorqueProvider now reports two Vector3s, positive torque (that produced by control actuation 1,1,1) and negative torque (that produced by -1,-1,-1).\n* Added various accessors.\n* Node definitions can take an extra digit after size, either 0 or 1: that sets whether the node can crossfeed. Defaults to 1 (yes). NODE definitions can take crossfeed = True/False\n* ModuleEngines now supports \u0060clampPropReceived = True\u0060. This will clamp the ratio of propellant requested based on prior results, so if IntakeAir is listed first and less than the full requirement is returned, it will request only that ratio of further propellants. In this case the \u0022Prop Req Met\u0022 display will show the minimum requirement-met ratio rather than the average. Engines that use IntakeAir (or other cases like that) need to have \u0060clampPropReceived = True\u0060 in each of their MODULEs that do that, and need to have that PROPELLANT first and the other PROPELLANTs later. See stock jet cfgs for examples.\n* Added another crew transfer event.\n* Added more startup options for KSPAddon\n* Allow kerbals to have/save/load arbitrary experience points.\n* ResearchAndDevelopment.GetTechnologyTitle(string id) will convert a tech ID to a tech title and is available as soon as parts start loading (can be used in GetInfo() ).\n* Support max pressure (dynamic \u002B static), \u0060maxPressure\u0060, and max G, \u0060gTolerance\u0060, for parts.\n* Added system to allow mods to add custom difficulty settings.\n* Added CelestialBody.hasSurface so mods that add a PQSController to gas giant don\u0027t cause silly things such as \u0022Plant a flag on Jool\u0022 contracts.\n* Replaced all checks for experience traits (Pilot, Scientist, Engineer) with individual experience effects. They are now loaded before part loading so can be queried in GetInfo().\n* Icons in TechTree.cfg can now use a relative path (allows mod icons to live outside the Squad directory).\n* Added KSPAssemblyDependencyEqualMajor as an attribute. Use instead of KSPAssemblyDependency if you want to force requiring the stated major version, not \u0026gt;= the major version, from your dependency.\n* If you are setting a vessel\u0027s position and/or changing its orbit, call Vessel.IgnoreGForces(framecount) on the vessel for the number of frames that g forces should be ignored (try 1, then 2 if that doesn\u0027t work, etc).\n* ModuleDeployablePart (covers antennas, solars, radiators) also has a gResistance (for Gs) as well as windResistance (for Q).\n* Crew transfer now derives from a generic abstract PartItemTransfer class. Classes can derive from it to implement any kind of (crew transfer-style) part-part transfer. Also we fire an event right before a crew transfer is created so mods can just kill it and easily create their own CrewTransfer-derived class and have that be called on that event.\n* Extended ModuleScienceContainer to allow sending and, (from ModuleScienceExperiment) receiving, experiment data. Also added support for a Collect All option to such containers.\n* ModuleColorChanger supports changing arbitrary shader colors and implements IScalarModule. ModuleAnimationSetter works similarly and is used to more directly link an animation to being set by IScalarModule.\n* PartModules now support upgrades. In a MODULE node, add an UPGRADE node. Inside that add one node per techID you wish to provide upgrades, in ascending order. Inside that place keys and nodes you wish to upgrade. e.g. \u0060UPGRADES { basicRocketry { maxThrust = 250 } }\u0060 will change maxThrust to 250 once basicRocketry unlocks. Upgrades will never override persistent data. Further, by default they overwrite each other; to make a node apply on a clean slate (so you can, say, add two PROPELLANT nodes and not have them conflict due to the overwrite logic) set \u0060IsExclusiveUpgrade__ = True\u0060 in the upgrade\u0027s node. That will clear the upgrade state and apply that upgrade fresh. Upgrades are applied only when you add a part to a craft in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, they don\u0027t magically apply in flight. When a part on a craft is upgraded, a new option will appear in the PAW (when in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E) where you can view the current stats of all those modules with upgrades.\n* ModuleEngines now supports alternate (RealFuels-style) throttling and rates.\n* ModuleEngines now supports throttle-Isp interactions. Turn on with useThrottleIspCurve = True and set the throttleIspCurve and throttleIspCurveAtmStrength curves. Final Isp = input Isp * Lerp(1, throttleIspCurve.Eval(throttle state), throttleIspCurveAtmStrength.Eval(atms of pressure))\n* Support part upgrades, see docs.\n* Added events dealing with kerbals going on/off ladders on parts and added a new vessel field for accessing the vessel of the part of the ladder the kerbal is climbing (if all of those are valid).\n* CelestialBody now has thermo/atmo stats methods so FlightIntegrator\u0027s temperature calcs can be called from anywhere / any mod.\n* Events that throw an exception now print the full stack trace.\n* PartModuleUtil.PrintResourceSI() is now just KSPUtil.PrintSI().\n* Add ModuleDragAreaModifier with field areaFactor. Note: this will also affect buoyancy and thermo.\n* Added ModuleHeatEffects and FXModuleThrottleEffects which can take any number of IScalarModules and are set by skin temp and throttle respectively.\n* AvailablePart.entryCost is now get-only and calls a static delegate so they can be \n* FindEngineNearby and FindEngineInterface are now PartModuleList methods instead of being duplicates in FXModuleAnimateThrottle and ModuleAlternator.\n* Many KerbalEVA, Kerbal, and KerbalExpressionSystem methods made virtual, and kerbal spawning in ProtoCrewMember and EVA spawning in FlightEVA made delegates.\n* Added IContractObjectiveModule, which allows mods to specify valid parts for contract objectives, rather than it being configuration based.\n* Waypoint captions on the map are now moddable.\n* Added game events for CommNet status changes both for the connection in general and the connection to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n* Added game event that fires when PQS starts, just before the sphere is started.\n* Added game event that fires when PQSCities start.\n* Added game event for orbital resource survey completion.\n* Added game event for vessel control state changing.\n* Orbit now has a constructor that clones another orbit.\n* Vessel now has a method to kill all parts in permanent ground contact (eg: launch clamps).\n* Added ModuleGenerator.isGroundFixture for launch clamps.\n* The \u0022escape\u0022 progress milestone now uses standard World First award methods, which allows it to be disabled by mods properly.\n* Icon_Hidden tag now hides all children of the transform so tagged.\n* Add requiresFullControl to events, actions, and UI controls. If false, will work normally in full and partial control and refuse to work only with no control. If true, will work only with full control.\n* AssemblyLoader ignores abstract classes.\n* Support symbols in the font.\n* Made Kerbals and EVA kerbals more moddable. EVAs and the flag now have partial part cfgs which can be modded. All Kerbal and KerbalEVA methods are virtual and the FSM is opened up. New hooks added.\n* Made vessel load/unload/pack/unpack ranges changeable in Physics.cfg.\n* Support adding options to the game difficulty screen.\n* Vessel now has radarAltitude. Use it for min(altitude, heightFromTerrain)\n* add PartModule.OnIconCreate which runs just before the partmodule is stripped from the icon gameobject when the editor part icon is being created.\n* Particle systems can be registered with FloatingOrigin for handling origin/krakensbane offsetting natively.\n* ProtoPartResourceSnapshot no longer relies on strings, and its resourceValues node is now inaccessible. Instead, directly get / set the amount/maxAmount/flowState.\n* PartModules now come with a resHandler object (of type ModuleResourceHandler) for handling ModuleResource / RESOURCE nodes, so code need not be duplicated.\n* When a landed vessel goes off rails and is detected to be landed on parts, not the ground, it is offset up slightly, controlled by one static Vessel field HeightFromPartOffsetGlobal (default 0.5 meters) and one instance field heightFromPartOffsetLocal (default 0 meters). The vessel is offset upwards the sum of those two fields.\n* Fix OnVesselSwitching always sending a null reference, add OnVesselSwitchingUnloaded.\n* Allow reference to Kerbal\u0027s animator cache and renderer cache.\n* Add map toggle interface for mods.\n* OrbitTargeter opened up, delegate added for creating the on-click context menus so they can be modded.\n* Add delegates so KB apps can be modded.\n* Add currency-agnostic CanAfford method.\n* Add many more options to ModuleLiftingSurface and for customizing body lift.\n* ModuleAnimateGeneric now supports defaultActionGroup.\n* ConfigNode now formats float and double values such that no data is lost.\n* ConfigNode AddValue/SetValue now support most types.\n* Flag decals in IVAs (InternalFlagDecal module)\n* Add Crew counts to Vessels\n\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n"}]}
