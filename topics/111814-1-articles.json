I tried to strike a balance between low part count, faithfulness to the historical design, and performance. This plane flies beautifully and is very manoeuvrable and easy to fly and land. Top speed about 100m/s at low altitude. With SAS on, it takes off automatically at about 30m/s. Recommended landing speed no more than 40-50m/s. Turn off the engine just before touchdown and apply brakes immediately, otherwise it will take too long to come to a stop on the single rear brake (enabling the front brakes will cause the plane to tip over). Replace the radial engine with a turboprop for more realistic speeds but with historically inaccurate technology.\n\n[KerbalX link for craft file](http://kerbalx.com/repbasic/Focke-Wulf-Fw-190)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T09:25:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 09:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by repbasic**\n  \nspelling"}]}
