I\u0027ve rebuilt the wings and nose and boosted the dV to 2.4km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used the X-wing as inspiration here and the Meteor is deigned to fill the same role as a long ranged fighter capable of acting away from carrier support. I\u0027ve opted for a pair of aerospikes as my standard fighter engines due to their mix of high power, reasonable efficiency and compact size. I\u0027ve removed the weaponry to people can either arm it themselves or simply use it for civilian tasks and cruise around the system in style and it can even be used to land on smaller planetary bodies due to the rear mounted landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EStats\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELength: 11m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Rest coming soon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ctuyxyxry9pv4ae/SF-23E%20Meteor.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ctuyxyxry9pv4ae/SF-23E%20Meteor.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/znjaA4r.png\u0022 alt=\u0022znjaA4r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cobPC2b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cobPC2b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
