Right now the only *potential bug* that I can see is no contracts appearing in the ALL tab of Contract Configure. However still not convinced it is a real bug because of other things are going on in my game right now. If I get time I do a test without any other mods. Just this and Contract Configure installed. If it does turn out to be a real problem then I post link to the logs as well. \n\nThe main thing is it seems to be working so far in career mode. Still have lots of bits to check but I am really enjoying this so far. Honestly without this mod and Station Science. I would start to loose interest pretty quickly in KSP in general.
