I can\u0027t figure out why large advanced SAS units explode inside the External Tank due to overheating while the craft just sits on the launch pad. I have a stack of 30 offset inside to make controlling the shuttle possible. One explodes due to overheating and then others.\n\nKSP 1.0.4 plain vanilla. No mods. Fresh download.\n\nWindows 7 Pro.\n\nFirst reported to me in 1.0.3.\n\nCraft file: [http://kerbalx.com/inigma/STS-6-Space-Shuttle](http://kerbalx.com/inigma/STS-6-Space-Shuttle)\n\nSimply load craft in VAB, then CLOSE the cargo bay doors, hit launch, and wait for physics to load. Boom! Consistenly duplicatable.\n\n**Update 1:** this appears related to whether or not the mk3 cargo bay doors are closed. Closed? Explosions. Open? No explosions. Please confirm. The cargo bay doors have to be closed for it to trigger.\n\n**Update 2:**\n\nSquad:\n\nFurther testing has allowed me to create this simple SAS Cargo Bay Heat Bomb based on this bug:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

This is an orientation issue (east, west) with the mk3 cargo bay and at least in my test, a SAS unit attached to an attachment point connected to the belly, with the SAS units just at or going over the lip of the top of the cargo bay. With the closed mk3 cargo bay belly facing east or west on the pad or runway, the effect causes the mk3 bay to somehow trigger a overheat reaction slightly below the top of the bay targeted at the middle sas unit. And it does not have to be a SAS unit. It can be other parts.\n\nIf the cargo bay belly faces north or south, the effect is not triggered.\n\nGranted, I don\u0027t make craft like this, however when I have a fuel tank attached to the bay loaded with SAS units for my shuttle, it causes explosions. This craft above is just a simplified version showing up the effect in all its simplistic glory. \n\nThe work around is simply to launch with your craft with mk3 cargo belly facing north or south and not east or west.\n\n**Update 3:** Bug report submitted to tracker and confirmed already by Squad: Bug report submitted: [http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5181](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5181)\n\nPlease add your own simplified test bug craft files and steps to duplicate to the report, or submit a new report if you think your experience is unrelated.\n\n**Update 4:** And of course a video. In good taste. Exploiting... er exploring the bug a bit.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Su6UxX-OohE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T03:08:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 03:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by inigma**\n  \nchanged topic to better reflect bug discovery, added bug report info"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T16:14:14Z","Content":"I am experiencing the same thing.
