Methane is better. Only mildly cryogenic...can be used in rocket engines...can be used in jet engines...and the high dead-weight of our tanks in KSP compared to real life makes holding methane/LOX for extended periods more reasonable. Given that, make the chemistry fit.

I posted some information about real-life liquid hydrogen rockets (propellant volume and mass ratios) to point out that there is more to rocket engineering that calculating the ratio of propellant to oxidizer for complete combustion (such as extra fuel being needed to cool parts of the engine, or protect its surfaces with soot in low-chamber-pressure RP-1 engines, or decrease the atomic weight of the exhaust for better efficiency...so LH\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E engines are run fuel-rich, if I recall correctly). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea to try to make liquid fuel be liquid hydrogen because it doesn\u0027t fit with the masses and sizes of the tanks in KSP.
