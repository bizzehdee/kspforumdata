Making fairings in ksp1 was easy peasy and took no time at all. Now, for the same result, dragging individual arrows has made it super annoying. Please bring back the function of just being able to move the mouse to where we want them to be and click.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T12:28:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes please!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greyflex","CreatedById":226591,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T15:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFully agree, \u002B make the see-through fairings functionality the same as before, it\u0027s annoying that it doesn\u0027t go fully transparent and stays in your way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"histalonia","CreatedById":195885,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T18:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, building the new fairings is not that intuitive either.\u00A0 Would be cool to have a single button that would automatically build the fairing.\u00A0 Or perhaps two buttons, one to automatically build it to minimize drag, and one to minimize mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumeee","CreatedById":105622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T18:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t like how KSP1 implemented fairings because you could do nice rounded fairings like most of the real ones.

Dragging the column up, stopping, then dragging the column down makes it move up one step before moving down. Really annoying to get used to. Then there\u0027s the fact that they never want to close against the part above, although thankfully I can just select another part to get it to take.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sea_Kerman","CreatedById":226149,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T19:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat dragging thing seems to be a quirk of the snapping grid, it goes away if you turn snapping off\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T22:16:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224246451\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212869\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677526626\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022226149\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sea_Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Sea_Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat dragging thing seems to be a quirk of the snapping grid, it goes away if you turn snapping off\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYo nice, thanks for the tip!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"msaspence","CreatedById":118349,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T11:34:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd let them, clip models.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
