Sure Ceres generates heat inside, who knows, it could even be producing MORE heat per unit volume in its core than Earth does (not that there\u0027s any reason to believe it is, but I suppose it\u0027s possible). The KEY difference is total surface area divided by total volume. Heat can only escape out of the surface. Per unit volume, Ceres has 13.3 times more surface area than Earth does. That means that whatever the residual decay heat it has simply escapes too fast to help maintain a molten core. Ceres certainly cannot have a molten core today, perhaps it did a long time ago, but that actually depends on how much of it is ice, I suppose. Ice doesn\u0027t have decay heat, which would also help contribute to an early death of internal-heat-driven geological activity on Ceres.
