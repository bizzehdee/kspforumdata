However, the OS, AFAIK (and I haven\u0027t paid attention), only defines \u0022click\u0022 and \u0022command click\u0022. Most mice (again AFAIK) send \u0022command click\u0022 when you click the right button, and most game writers (Squad included) use that as \u0022right click\u0022. The mice that Apple sells do this these days (have a right and left click). My mouse does send something when I click the scroll wheel button. Currently it brings up the widgets, but I\u0027m not sure how what it sends matches anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat info is middle click suppose to bring up?
