Was pre-docking (17.1) so I had to EVA Bob to the lander (Mk-1 Pod, ladder, fuel tank, poodle, landing gear) first. Blow the decoupler. Then burn retro. And of course I burnt too much fuel on retro. Since Bob was game, decide I would attempt a suicide burn at last minute. Pulled it off, no idea how. But fuel was not looking good for rendezvous. While Bob did his magic moment on Mun surface I switched to orbiting return craft (probe controlled), lowered periapsis to about 40K. Then back to Bob, launched when return craft was on downhill slope of orbit. Got within a klick or so, burning everything including all of the mono. Once the tanks were dry, EVA\u0027d Bob and made it. Barely.
