Try adding a girder underneath the length of the rover, then attach the wheels to that. Then strut from each wheel\u0027s node to the main body. You will lose some stability, as your wheels will be less spread out, but it should be a bit more solid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re prepared to mod then there are some great options.

I tested the crap out of that construction technique (100\u0027s of kms of full-throttle roving on Kerbin). I think the strength of the part they\u0027re attached to has something to do with the durability. Also, it looks like you strutted the front and back girders together, and that helps with overall craft stiffness. I think having a floppy craft really increases the potential dynamic stress on the wheel joints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only recommendation on your current design would be to move your second pair of wheels farther forward. The front pair takes the most abuse, so that will help unload them. It\u0027s far better to pop a rear tire than a front one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, jump that thing off the launchpad at full throttle and see if you can find areas that need reinforcement. ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
