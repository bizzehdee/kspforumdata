Full-time career player here.\u00A0So,\u00A0some of you may already be aware of my thread about leaving Kerbin more seriously and actually approaching a real, mostly successful mission beyond the Kerbin system. You can find it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/127924-super-excited-duna-operation/\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0Unfortunately, after my first stage of operations, it has slowed down a lot, and at the time I didn\u0027t have as great of technology (So I only had two things deployed to the Duna SOI at the time). Since then, I\u0027ve been doing more research farming Minmus and Mun, and with about 80% of my tech tree completed, I decided to take the opportunity of the transfer Window between Eve and Kerbin. This time, I had just unlocked the Nervs, and I was super excited to try them out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gfqrM8I.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gfqrM8I.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, I had spent nearly 1 million funds to deploy that Flotilla, as I was very excited to meet Eve. Kerbal Alarm Systems was my best friend. Shortly before the transfer window, I was testing out the nuke on an Evian Exploration Vessel, which also carried three kerbals. I decided to Refuel a little and mine on Minmus, and after 40 some kerbal days, the transfer was on the Horizon. I had sent my first Kerbals beyond the Kerbin system for the very first time. I felt a little scared for them, but I knew at this stage I wasn\u0027t going to Land on Eve. I first wanted to establish an orbital station and a mining operation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-22T20:08:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2015 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Der Anfang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
