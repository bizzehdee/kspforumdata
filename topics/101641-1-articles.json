Most pepole have heared of them trough some channel or have actually used them, so they do not need the publicity - however they deserve the credit this form of publicity grants them, cause they\u0027re great mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose mods that need the publicity are the mods that are new or that are less frequently used or have a specific target audience. They have been the main Focus of MM\u0027s but seem to be falling to the sidelines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI therefore suggest to either do a more balanced 2 new \u002B 1 major mod approach over 3 weeks to give publicity where needed and credit where do or extend Modding mondays to feature 2 Mods each week with one being a more famous mod of the week and the other being a New Frontiers mod (it\u0027s the best name I could come up with that sounded better than \u0022Recommended mod\u0022 or the potentially inaccurate \u0022Newbie of the week\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T02:21:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to Kerbal Network: the place to talk about the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T03:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*meant to click in the reply box, opened Skyrim by accident* \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I feel like this should be looked at as well.

It is not a \u0022the Devs demand you play this\u0022, it is not a \u0022Squad officially sanctions that this exists\u0022; and it is most certainly not a sign of having won some sort of contest, or somehow a redeemable right to receive free advertising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, this is KSP\u0027s community team saying, in their own way, their \u0022thank you\u0022 to us (the community) for participating, for creating content, and for being awesome. And in doing so, they in turn engage us, motivate us and foster the community spirit between us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally cannot see an argument for why one person who has created something should deserve this \u0022thank you\u0022 more than another person who has also created something. Both are equal members of the community, both have chosen to sacrifice their free time for the benefit of others. Often the only difference between the popular mainstream modder and the obscure newcomer is how long they\u0027ve been doing this already - because a mod that lives longer will be discovered by more players. And suggesting that someone is somehow less deserving of a shoutout than someone else just through having the, uh... privilege? ...of having contributed for a much longer time, that is (in my own opinion) not logically sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a movement in psychology that is suggesting that our society has a bit of an \u0022underdog complex\u0022. We are subtly influenced, through the stories we hear, the news production by the media, the social conventions we exist in and even such things as basic human compassion, to always favor the small, less powerful and less famous over the big, the more powerful and more famous. This bias exists completely independent of the actual merits of these parties, and it goes as far as us rejecting the very notion that someone who has achieved a lot might actually deserve recognition for doing so - even if the very act of achieving something took an immense amount of effort and dedication. Sure, we congratulate and respect them, but at the same time... deep down, our hearts are really with that other guy who\u0027s just had their first, tentative little success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a subconscious process, and that means we aren\u0027t generally aware of it. But I think this discussion here is a very good example of how this subtle bias manifests. At such a point, when we are considering to hold one party more privileged than another, we should carefully examine our reasons for doing so... and whether there actually is a logically sound reason to sideline the lesser privileged party, or whether their work is merely worth less to us just because they aren\u0027t small and little-known.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
