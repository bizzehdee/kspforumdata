Eventually I had \u003Cem\u003Eadded everything back in\u003C/em\u003E and it mysteriously still works.

Sometime while trying to rendezvous it will actually guide itself back to kerbin and I have to immediately correct the course. Also sometimes when it actually makes a half decent rendezvous it will sometimes go back and forth, say for instance I set the approach to 300 meters, it will get close and then will go right by it, it won\u0027t stop itself. It will then correct itself and over correct and miss it completely again. Then it will just get into this sling shot dance with my space station where it gets close and is coming in too fast and doesn\u0027t stop. It will go from 3.4K and come in too fast and zoom right by, back out to 3.4k and back and forth again. :/ very aggravating. My flying skills aren\u0027t good enough to rendezvous by myself yet. I can dock, but getting the rendezvous is a pain.

It would be cool if someday there was an ability (even limited) to have finer control over the ascent curve (coughBECAUSEFARcough). E.g. allowing the user to add inflection points by time/stage/altitude to refine the precise ascent path. (vs. the smooth single-curve path that MJ calculates now, which is very mathematically pleasing but which sometimes leads to very bad You Will Not Go Into Space Today results with certain unnamed aerodynamic mods) I\u0027m just going to go ahead and assume that\u0027s insanely complex to actually implement....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all your work!
