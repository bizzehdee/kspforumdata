Now this doesn\u0027t matter normally, but since cargo bay doors are animated in a non kinematic way (the physics engine doesn\u0027t really care that you moved a collider that you perceive you attached something to), the bay doors will move, and whatever you\u0027ve tried to jam onto them won\u0027t.

part you want to attach it by to be the root, and then save it as a subassembly.\u00A0 Then build/load the ship you want to put it in, load the subassembly, and hold down Alt while placing it to force node attach mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hurric","CreatedById":150872,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T13:29:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSubassembly .... is this something to do with

experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0If you click the arrow at the top left above the parts list it adds a new column with more icons, one is a green rocket which is your \u0027Sub Assembly\u0027 tab. \u00A0Clicking on this opens a column for your sub assemblies. \u00A0You can drag your ship into the box at the bottom and it gets added to the column. \u00A0To add an existing sub assembly to a vessel that you are in the process of building open the sub assembly column and select the one you want. \u00A0It then appears in your build space like a new part does and you can attach it to available nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sub Assembly/Merge functions can be a bit fiddly to use as you need to ensure that the \u0027root\u0027 of your sub assembly is the bit you want to attach to your vessel. So usually it will be a decoupler or docking port on one end of the assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hurric","CreatedById":150872,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T00:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.....I have saved and copied your text\u00A0for\u00A0the future \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-29T00:24:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2016 12:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by hurric\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ImmaStegosaurus!","CreatedById":160589,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T22:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBit OT but I had a problem with cargo bays too.
