I piggybacked this rover to Mun orbit. The rockets are to de orbit and land the rover, I then get rid of them when I land. for some reason though, the rockets do nothing. I can\u0027t change the orbit by even a little bit. Also worth mentioning is that when on the launchpad, the rockets have a TWR of about 4, but it won\u0027t take off either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0026lt;a  href=\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/mPS6Lh5.jpg\u0027 alt=\u0027mPS6Lh5.jpg\u0027\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-28T10:32:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2014 10:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by matt3526\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T13:10:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPress Alt\u002BF2 to open the debug window, see all that damage being done to the cupola?
