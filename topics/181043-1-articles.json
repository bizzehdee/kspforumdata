It\u0027s also worth noting that the obesity crisis in the US and other countries has got to be related to diet, and likely the ease of consuming vast quantities of empty carbohydrates (sugars, in particular, but they\u0027re mostly the same thing from a dietary standpoint). Insulin resistance leads to inflammation, so I suppose there could be something real with some dietary changes. Finding real studies is non-trivial.
