The bigger the solar system, the more delta-V you need to go somewhere, the longer it takes, and the longer time between launch windows. All these things are the opposite of fun. Trust me, I played Orbiter, with its full-size solar system, off and on for decades, then dumped it as soon as I heard about KSP, because KSP is so much more fun. And most of that fun comes from the tiny solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuclear_Wizard","CreatedById":20145,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T02:40:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kimberly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kimberly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou could just modify it \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E you get to Laythe. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I don\u0027t think it\u0027s cheating, if it makes the water behave normally; a 1-ton anchor should sink anyway!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, that could work. I\u0027ll start messing around with some parameters, and hope I don\u0027t break everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I found a solution. I took the Hooligan Labs mod and made an \u0022anchor\u0022 airship by modifying the small \u0022cirrus\u0022 part. The main change was making the envelope volume parameter negative. I also removed the animation, so it didn\u0027t expand at all when activated, and increased the impact tolerance so it didn\u0027t break when it got to the ocean floor. It took some messing around to get the ship to sink, and hit the bottom at a reasonable speed, but it works wonderfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a Kethane oil rig floating on Kerbin, with a drill module (attached to a modified KAS winch) just over 1km under the water, filling up the surface tanks.
