You will find it easier if you can add at least a couple of radial air scoops in a suitably aesthetic location. If not then consider a pair of T30 rockets as you will have to make up more altitude and speed with the rockets. They have 2.5x the weight but 4.3x the maximum power of the 909 but you will need to lift more rocket fuel in the first place.

The further apart the lift and mass centers the more downward torque mass creates. Its all about leverage. Same goes for the undercarriage, place the rearmost pair just behind the center of mass so the plane can tilt back using the leverage of the control surfaces, if the wheels are too far back the leverage of the mass to wheels distance overcomes the leverage of the control surface to wheel distance and the craft will not lift its nose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let us know how it goes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T02:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022glacierre\u0022 data-cite=\u0022glacierre\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI find quite easy to make jet based SSTO with veery weak rocket engines and little oxidizer (or just ions!), just enough to give you the last push.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, but that\u0027s because you already know how to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point here is that I see a lot of people who try to start with a working plane design and then add a few rockets and some rocket fuel to get themselves into space.
