Technically speaking, there are other 32-bit and 64-bit instruction sets, but the 32-bit instruction set which is most common is IA-32 (\u0022Intel Architecture, 32-bit\u0022), also known as i386 or x86 (both referring to the Intel 80386/i386 processor, which was the first one to use it). x86 is because it\u0027s an extension of the 16-bit instruction set on previous Intel processors ending in 86 (i.e. 8086, 80186, 80286), which IA-32 is backwards compatible with (x86 can properly refer to anything which is compatible with the original 16-bit instruction set). When it was extended to 64-bit (by AMD, not Intel), it was frequently called AMD64 (Intel had a not-backwards-compatible 64-bit architecture called IA-64, which is used on Itanium chips); the vendor-neutral name is x86-64. Incidentally, there\u0027s no inherent reason x86 can\u0027t refer to the 64-bit version like it could refer to the 16-bit or 32-bit versions; it just doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"turkwinif","CreatedById":84592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T20:29:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBetween my two posts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, I know some of those words! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all of the responses, reading all of that was fun and an eye-opener.
