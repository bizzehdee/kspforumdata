Unfortunately, this frequently results in burns that are 20\u002B minutes long -- which can only be reduced to 5 minutes (at best) by applying 4x physwarp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy usual fix for this is to add extra engines -- but of course this is inefficient, as it means I\u0027m trading dV for TWR, weight, and cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if, as an alternative to physics warp (or extension to it passed 4x), there was a level of \u0022time dilation\u0022 that essentially did:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erate X (normally 1) =\u0026gt; increase effective thrust and rate of resource consumption of all engines by X; scale current velocity and gravitational effects on physics-loaded objects by X; time for objects on rails (including bodies) advances at a rate of X seconds per 1 second of time in the local reference frame\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Essentially, if all of the math was corrected -- temporarily multiply the current vessel\u0027s thrust, but alter the world so that the thrust multiplier doesn\u0027t gain any advantage other than real-life time savings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could happen as an extension of physics warp -- 6x could be 4x physwarp * 1.5x time dilation, 8x would be 4x * 2x, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
