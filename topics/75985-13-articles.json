Then go back and edit the long description (markdown), the license, images and videos, the URLs, etc etc etc - but save each edit at every step. Then when there\u0027s enough information, publish the mod so other people can see it (instead of just the author).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fields could auto-save when you tab (like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reviewboard.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReviewBoard\u003C/a\u003E does), or just have the \u0022Next\u0022 buttons actually save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the big organized projects, it probably doesn\u0027t matter; they\u0027ll slog through the signup.
