To achieve this, you can:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Place them on the top side of the craft and entering belly first. Not the best, as you mentioned, this doesn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t stop the heat from other parts to bleed into them, but its still better than being exposed directly to the airstream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Place them in the bay. Don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t forget to open it before use of the RCS or else it may cause problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Use reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Use vernors. They run on Liquid fuel, so no need for extra monopropellant cans, and are much more aerodynamical than RCS thruster blocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent isn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t usually as fast as reentry, so the main problem tend to be when entering. BUT, when you are returning, control surfaces will work again and (if your craft isn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t relying on the RCS to actually fly straight) then you might not need them anymore. Of course, with exception of SSTO, which have to deal with ALOT of heat during ascent, then i suggest using one of the above mentioned methods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T21:13:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck your profiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they overheat on ascent, you are spending to long to low. Check your ascent path. You want to hit max airspeed then use aerodynamic flight to start a climb to initiate a gravity turn to orbit. If you go beyond max thrust speed, climb faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they overheat on reentry, you are coming in too steep. I have yet to see any orbit with a Pe of 45 km leave the atmosphere again. That is your baseline reentry profile. You never use a intersecting trajectory to reenter atmospheric worlds. That is a waste of fuel and won\u0027t even buy you much time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS blocks hit 70% of critical temperature on reentry for me. That isn\u0027t even concerning.
