You only get out as much as you put into something. Games which are absolutely amazing like Witcher 3, Fallout 4, Tony Hawk 5... no... NO... DEFINITELY not Tony Hawk 5.... where was I? Oh yeah, those amazing games lose their shine because they are fixed in what you can do (even Fallout where you can now build settlements still is limited)... but even the base game of KSP, Lego and Minecraft have unending possibilities. On top of it, KSP is not limited to a specific age group (ie no sex and/or violence and/or swearing... welllllll okay, there is SOME violence when you crash but you just grow new Kerbals after all). AND it\u0027s educational. Learning that you cannot just aim for the moon and fly toward it and have a hope of landing on it. AND learning that sometimes you have to burn away from a target to get closer to it (sounds bonkers but true)... and dropping stuff into the sun isn\u0027t as easy as it seems (\u003Cem\u003Eso I found that Orbital Mechanics is not the name for a space garage after all. Who knew???\u003C/em\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup... KSP could only be better if it enabled mods... but what\u0027s that you say... MODS EXIST? Yup... KSP turns from a small indie game into something freaking huge when you include all the vast number of mods out of there. Some are crap but the majoriity are beyond amazing. Some include scifi spaceships... some include real ones like the SpaceX craft and NASA favourites like Apollo and Mercury and Gemeni. Even Russia and Chinese craft are available. Others turn the game from a basic space simulator into a real depiction of our solar system. Utilities range from making re-entry harder to including autopilot systems that assist in your flight across the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only limitation to the mods scene is memory due to being limited to the 32 bit version of Unity. The 64 bit version of Unity (which is the engine KSP runs on) is currently unstable... still... So currently you find that you can add stuff to KSP... find it runs crap and then have to chop out bits you don\u0027t need just to make it run stable. Then you find more mods you want and have to chop out other bits to get those to work. But is all the hassle worth it... DEFINITELY.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you can play the game your way... Be it in Sandbox mode... be it in Science mode... or be it in full on Career mode. All are fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes... You can say that I just adore this game/simulator/time travel machine (start playing in the morning and you wonder why it\u0027s gone dark outside and people are banging on your door wondering where you have vanished to... true story!). There really isn\u0027t anything as good out there that lets you run NASA your way...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd NO... out of all the excellent AAA games released in 2015 I have to say that KSP was STILL my game of the year... That\u0027s every year since 2012 for me now... since I watched this following video in fact (thank you so much NerdCubed, for all the hours I\u0027ve lost playing this game heh... oh and go to 6:45 where he shows off KSP... as he says, It\u0027s basically NASA if run by an... idiot)... \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n1g3oTXjDM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n1g3oTXjDM\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Space Program - BEST GAME EVER!

They say they didn\u0027t but seeing the craft blow up live on TV would be horrible). My dad actually did me a mapping board that he taped a flight path of the Apollo craft onto so I could track it with drawing pins with little notes while sat in front of the TV. I was 8 years old and it got me well and truly hooked. In fact Gagarin launched less than a month after I was born so you could say I am a child of the space age.

My first game was on an IBM 370/158 mainframe... Then on Dec PDP-11\u0027s. These were all games that literally spit numbers at you and had no graphics at all (mainly because it was on teletypes heh. Actually come to think of it, the first space game I played was one I wrote in ALGOL on an Elliot 803 and those teletypes ran on compressed air... I kid you not. So yeah.... I have been playing space games for ages. I even played lunar lander by post when I was at Grammar School in the computer science class (you had to send your burn guesses to a guy who worked at the university and he returned your printout showing what happened.. and yeah, we all crashed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah... I guess I am a space fan... and totally bummed that we aren\u0027t on the moon now... Great that Tim Peake is on the ISS though (I\u0027m a brit). I think the US just lost their way. Oh and regarding the myth that we didn\u0027t land on the moon... then why are we still using the Lunar Laser Measurement mirror that Armstrong and Aldrin left behind.

My terminal was running REALLY fast so I should have realised... but everyone else in the country was yelling at my boss, asking him what happened to their computer access hehe). Ironically that first job had me in Systems Support where we were supposed to help the idiots who didn\u0027t know what they were doing. I just made the OS on the mainframe go into a recursive loop and when we sent the bug report to IBM it made them put back the release a couple of months just to fix it... (I was sooooooo proud that day lolz). Yup, ,my talent was trying to make things break by doing crazy stuff.... I was king of the bug finders (and still am to this day). In fact I just managed to kill Jeb by getting out of the capsule during the last part of re-entry....
