I saw that you needed KSP 1.0.5 for the mod to work. So I thought that it would be no problem. So I went to Steam, pulled up the Properties window for KSP, went to Betas, and selected 1.0.5. Easy. But when I went back to my Steam library, instead of seeing \u0022Kerbal Space Program - [previous 1.0.5]\u0022, I saw \u0022Kerbal Space Program - [previous]\u0022. I didn\u0027t really care about it so I got \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E extension into my GameData folder and started the game. The game told me it was updating so I waited until it was done. Then, I clicked \u0022KSP (64 Bit version)\u0022, and started the game. What I saw on the title screen wasn\u0027t Earth like it should of been, It was still Kerbin. I thought that was weird so I checked the version of the game. it said that I was on 1.3.1 even though I updated to 1.0.5. So I thought that it was because of the fact that I was using the 64 bit version so I exited the game, and start the normal version. The game was loading normally up until it stopped at Squad/Parts/Aero/fairings/fairingSize1/fairingSize1. It\u0027s not frozen because the yellow sentences (I don\u0027t know what they are called), were still changing to different puns and references to the game. It\u0027s still loading as I am typing this.
