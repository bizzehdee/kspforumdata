I\u0027m surprised this wasn\u0027t pushed further. Could you combine it with Microled or something weirder. Make one light produce many! Or interlay them for some special functions.(direct optical processing info? Computer in a monitor assuming you can\u0027t do that whe cathodes.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould this, if made now, be better than current monitors? SED or FED? And can SED multiscan? I read FED can\u0027t. Does it need it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this was made would this bring us back to analog connections and how much would it change Computer video processing needs. I\u0027m assuming this has something to do with current costs. Would it reduce back down again? I never liked CRT being eliminated. Always felt scummy and unnecessary..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould this hypothetically be brought back as a competitor to modern displays to make higher end monitors with less problems and less overhead?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would assume it would be great for anyone using consoles like how we used to or low end or even high end monitors that should be close distance. Not to mention if it simplified and reduced GPU costs. Could we get it where we buy one for gaming and one for other uses? We all have slots for a second video card. Why not two video cards. Especially if the difference in processing methods was enough to not need the same bandwidth as pure digital. Could the be like super powerful tiny display cards? If all the info is stuck together before display could it work? or combine it correctly in the monitor somehow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr make combo cards where it can be produced in both analog direct methods combined with digital. I would think you could simplify certain things down. Maybe duel monitors with both hookups or something if needed. Then focus the RTX type stuff from one display port and the other stuff from the analog like the background. Unless you can do all of it with analog processing of some sort. Could you process directly to analog with something different to simplify some of it and not just translate it to send an analog signal?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still wonder if microled can\u0027t start being used as hybrid electronic/optical computing. Maybe that tec becomes processing and CRT becomes display again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there are lots of scan guns couldn\u0027t they also make SED/FED so taht you can easily do lots of split screens for different games. Maybe different consoles at the same time or split screen for old fashion multiplayer. They should make these for retro games. And make them work with actual retro consoles. That would be a cool seeling point. Hook up an old atari or amiga or nintendo. The monitors could have cool sleek 50\u0027s looks also as the cabinet. Rounded monitor anyone?! Isn\u0027t there a really old type of TV that was supposed to be CRT and rotate on a hinge and was shaped like an eye. Might have been in a music video or something. It looks a bit like the eye from lord of the rings, but it\u0027s a 50\u0027s/60\u0027s retro case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022_Z.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://static.turbosquid.com/Preview/001309/898/CD/_Z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut eye shaped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe I\u0027m just thinking of this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022maxresdefault.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nsMjKjqphHc/maxresdefault.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine if we had these and had a true return of the desktop again.

GPUs have always created a digital image and only turned it into analog signals if that is how it was to be output.

The actual creation of display signals after that 3D processing is turned into a 2D image is a small part of a GPUs job that has had the option of both digital and analog output from the same GPU for several decades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-05T04:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t it have less power requirement.
