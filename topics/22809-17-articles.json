Sorry in case it was already considered (but I can\u0027t find about it in this thread). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is very nice, lots of good features and such. But for one thing, that is closely connected with time: countdown to burn time. Yes, that value that appears to the right of the Navball and down when a node exists. Problem is, it is way too small and almost not noticeable. IMHO, such an important value should be put in full evidence, at least when the focus is on the relevant ship and the time-to-burn goes below a set threshold (say, 10 sec., but could be adjustable). I believe everything needed to set an \u0027alarm\u0027 at burntime-10sec. already exists in KAC, the only thing should be to create an action when that alarm goes off, that will display the countdown in a larger font, in a set position onscreen (I would initially set it just @ the center) and a set colour (I would initially make it dark red, to differentiate from other readings and provide a sense of urgency). At burntime = 0, or shortly after in case no burn was initiated, this additional display will disappear being no more relevant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing nothing more than a value to be properly displayed at the correct time (already known to KAC), I am under the impression that you could very easily implement this.

That would certainly be outstanding, as I see the KSP stock game itself being erratic in showing such value. If you can get a correct burn duration, then you can also implement correctly the \u003Cstrong\u003Ecountdown to the node\u003C/strong\u003E (what I was asking, but probably I was not clear enough) as the time left before the node (current time minus time of the node, both perfectly known already to your mod) minus half the burn duration (this last term I have never seen considered in stock KSP countdown).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you are going to calculate the burn duration, you may also make this a perfect tool by including a warning that a split-manouever is required (another thing totally lacking in KSP). A split-manouever must be done whenever the burn duration is too long compared with the orbit period (generally the case with low-thrust engines) so that a single continued burn would also be applied at a wrong position; instead the total burn duration must be split to occur in a number of orbits, always at the same phase. In case of a split, the node must not be cleared until after the last portion of the burn, and possibly an alarm should be re-created after each partial burn to warn for the time of the next.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T04:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn such a case it\u0027s probably best to remove the previous maneuver node and generate the next with the remainder of the maneuver until complete.

However, I can\u0027t really ask KAC to implement the perfect solution as it goes way beyond time calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn split-manouevers, the correct solution requires to recalculate the orbital change with each single burn, and each burn to be applied so to consider the full time of the manoeuver and the end position of the intercept. However, nothing like the above can be asked from KAC, I have yet to find any of the navigation mods with KSP be able to consider a split-man, less so to solve it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would rather keep and update a single node for the whole manouever, instead of generating new ones, but this is only a matter of preference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout long-durations, this is another aspect that KSP doesn\u0027t seem to me accurate enough. Speed should be integrated along the burn, while mass is decreasing with fuel expenditure and therefore acceleration increases. There is no simple solution to this navigation problem, integration over burntime is the way serious tools go. Instead the whole KSP model for calculating trajectories seems to me to account only for the end-result (final speed, final mass). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELacking better tools with KSP, it would be enough for me that KAC provides for the approximate 50/50% before/after the node.
