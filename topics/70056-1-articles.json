It\u0027s only more efficient when the target orbit is roughly 12 times (or more) bigger/smaller than your current orbit (this is due to the Oberth Effect - you may have noticed when burning for Minmus, the time it takes to raise your apoapsis to Minmus height is much much shorter than to raise it to Mun height, despite them being roughly the same distance (Kerbin to Mun roughly equals Mun to Minmus). The reason this works is because, as explained in the next paragraph, you\u0027ll end up travelling slower at apoapsis which is a good thing in this case). This is because dV changes are much more sensitive at higher speeds. That is the Oberth Effect in a nutshell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBi-elliptic inclination transfers use this to their advantage - in contrast to the Oberth Effect, changing your direction costs less the slower you are travelling (because you have less velocity to kill in one direction and less to gain in another). At the apoapsis of a bi-elliptic transfer, you\u0027re travelling much more slowly than you would be in a circular orbit so it costs much less to change direction. Then it\u0027s just a normal circularising burn at periapsis and you\u0027re done, as opposed to burning anti-normal for ages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a KSP example, if you\u0027re going to Moho, it can be more fuel efficient to burn to Jool height, lower your periapsis when you reach apoapsis and then burn at periapsis for an encounter. You\u0027d end up using less fuel than a stright up Hohmann transfer orbit down to Mohos height (even less if you pull off a Jool gravity assist instead of a burn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: if you\u0027re wondering where the name \u0027bi-elliptic\u0027 comes from is because you make two elliptical orbits - the first is to raise your apoapsis a lot, the second moves your periapsis. If your periapsis goes to the same height as your apoapsis, it\u0027s a Hohmann Transfer orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-22T00:17:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2014 12:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI\u0026#039;m drunk and I made some typos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T00:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KydonShadow\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KydonShadow\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAh, I meant the bielliptic statement you made.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort, distilled version of what ObsessedWithKSP wrote above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBielliptic inclination change means you burn at the intended inclination point prograde and raise your apoapsis on the opposite side as high as reasonable (the higher the better, usually near the SOI boundary), then coast to that apoapsis, do the inclination change for negligible amount of dv there, then coast back to periapsis and burn retrograde to lower your apoapsis back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: applies to circular and near-circular orbits, things are a bit more complicated for elliptical orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the most efficient approach if the inclination change you intend to perform is large, and at about 60 degrees it breaks even with classic inclination change done in single burn.
