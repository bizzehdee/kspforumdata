(You\u0027d see the numbers in the contract UI before accepting, i.e. \u0022this payload is N tons, is diameter X and length Y\u0022. More awkward payloads would be worth more funds.)\n\n- You can only get one of it (it\u0027s in limited supply).\n\n- The default spacecraft icon for a vehicle that has a commercial part on it could be something custom and different which signifies \u0022commercial payload.\u0022\n\nThe contract would be to put *that specific part* into whatever orbit (or other situation) designated. It means you have to design a custom spacecraft around that part, and you can\u0027t have one ship satisfying multiple contracts unless you make it move multiple payloads (which is a valid option, and presents design challenges of itself).\n\nThe fun part would be having occasional freakishly awkward payloads, e.g.: super dense; big \u0026 draggy but super *light*; really long and skinny; unable to tolerate high acceleration; etc."},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:46:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I feel like the sat missions should somehow remove control of the sat - you were paid to put it there, but perhaps they meant for you to leave it there lol...\n\u003E \n\u003E Does this seem abusive to you guys, or normal?\n\nIf you feel that it is wrong you can just roleplay.
