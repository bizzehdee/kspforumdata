You would not only be asked to place specific parts in a specified orbit, but will also eventually generate secondary missions from them, go swap \u0027data\u0027 or \u0027parts\u0027 from them, that you have to take up and either do it with an EVA or a robot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould even have a procedural station system, where you\u0027re tasked to move pre-generated modules. (Or maybe not fully procedural, but rather a community driven system where users can submit a section design that can be approved and pushed out to the general userbase and the system then pulls parts out of the pool as needed.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could even go a step further for a PvE element options: An AI agency or two that will pick up contracts if you don\u0027t. Players would have another element to factor into their decision making: Do I skip all of these contracts, and risk letting the \u0027AI\u0027 company snag them and pull ahead in prestige? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see anything wrong with missions that can be completed with a multi-mission vessel, but I think it needs to be contrasted with ones that take specific and dedicated craft or sub craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T20:18:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022itstimaifool\u0022 data-cite=\u0022itstimaifool\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s a fair point.

The key thing is that once you launch the satelite, that satelite is not available for later contracts. To me that sounds both reasonable and plausible. To me, cheating would be if you could use the old sat for new contracts. That would imply that the manufacturer of the sat somehow managed to peek into the future and equip the sat for future missions. Beside, it\u0027s not like I have 10-20 contracts that can be covered with one sat when I launch it. More like 2-3 if I\u0027m lucky with the orbits.
