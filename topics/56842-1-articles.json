This mission burned me out to much.... But I had to do it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI designed this back in 0.21. It\u0027s a roundtrip through the entire Kerbol system, planting a flag on all of them and then returning to Kirbin, taking 1347 days from start to finish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main principle of the mission architecture was not bringing more fuel to certain points of the mission than necessary, the Apollo approach as it were.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is obviously done with the landers and tugs, but also by splitting the fuel reserves. Only the parts that are needed for Eve and Moho are taken to the inner solar system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt jool the fuel reserves split up and use Tylo\u0027s gravity to swing down to Vall and Laythe, thus not having to accelerate the 18 tons of fuel down and out of Tylo\u0027s gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor such a slow long mission it was pretty hectic, and after Eeloo success became uncertain because I took to long in getting there and missed the opportunity for a proper burn to Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubsequently I had do a do a 2000 m/s burn to get Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guestimated the deltaV I had left and what it would take for the rest of the mission and decided to gamble that I would make it instead of prolonging the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a rendezvoused with the Kirbin re-entry capsule at the end the lander had 2 units of fuel left\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q2V6a9-FUHM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-22T11:02:32Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2013 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nephf","CreatedById":66354,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T17:39:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow. this is awesome!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T17:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUtterly magnificent.
