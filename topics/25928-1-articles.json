I didn\u0027t right the hight down as it was a tester but it was way off and I did this for a couple of hours trying to get it right. Any way about 1hour ago which is 14 hour game play since Friday night I finally got a near 100% Apoapsis and periapsis which height was. AP 100.142M and PA 99.583M. I was messing around with views and looking at jebediah looking all chuffed and smiling and then I ended the flight. Then I realize when I went back there where no flights to be found \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny one else done this error yet?.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T20:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccidentally hitting \u0022End Flight\u0022 instead of \u0022Space Center\u0022?

I am still abit confused and use trial and error along with looking at some vids as well, but I try to keep the vids down. There is alot of creativity in building and running the game - explore the many possibilities here - I have lost many a time or losing things as well in my computer lifetime and banged on my keyboard a few times....check out the crazy people who get angry when somethin breaks in their game - you wont feel so bad !!! I have - and compared to what I have seen, I want to start over !
