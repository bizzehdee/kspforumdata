Someone on FB posted the following link recently. [http://www.globalresearch.ca/utah-whooping-cough-outbreak-pertussis-only-in-vaccinated-children/5441385](http://www.globalresearch.ca/utah-whooping-cough-outbreak-pertussis-only-in-vaccinated-children/5441385)\n\nQuickly I dismissed it as propaganda, because I\u0027m not one who thinks that vaccines are evil. But for some reason, at this moment, that made me wonder if I was technically being an anti-intellectual. I simply assumed it was biased, which in turn means I was acting biased. So I started poking around. Found that many of the other articles there had the stereotypical right-winged political points. So yeah, there\u0027s a good chance it\u0027s blatant propaganda. That\u0027s still giving into cognitive bias though. If someone believes something that is false, it doesn\u0027t mean the individual is wrong about everything. So, onward to Google -- I want to see if anyone has ever talked about Global Research News and biased reporting. It took four pages of links (all pointing to global research news or other like-minded sites that simply suggest reading it) before I landed on the first link containing what I wanted. On that link, the bias was being talked about. The website? Democratic Underground. Great. So the first source I come across talking about bias on another site, is a site that is obviously going to contain bias. See what I\u0027m getting at? Now, I could have spent another few days sifting through medical journals and hunting down statistics, but the sad fact is that there\u0027s this thing called TIME that most of us simply don\u0027t have much of. So I found myself throwing my hands in the air and resorting to my original opinion, giving into my default bias. Doesn\u0027t that mean I am being anti-intellectual?\n\nThe search for truth, it seems, has become beyond ridiculous, and arguably, not even worth the effort. This is a problem that seems new in our society, ever since the beginning of mass communication. Unfortunately, the amount of time invested for a con-artist to create a work of total bull, is far less than the time required to reveal the work as such. The problem is amplified because EVERYONE can be an \u0027expert\u0027 now, and all they need is a blog. And I\u0027m not just talking about politics, but science as well. If you doubt something, such the moon landings, all you need is your own space program to go up there and see for yourself.\n\nThis is a problem that I feel is only going to get worse. We\u0027ve already reached a point where everything seems in doubt. Even news sources like The Onion, who aren\u0027t even TRYING to fool anyone, occasionally get picked up by news portals as legitimate articles. Deception has become easy in a way that nobody ever could have imagined. \u00221984\u0022 is already simplistic and naive now. Even photographic and video evidence will probably soon be considered useless, because the ability to fake them is in the hands of every John Doe with a computer. Some day there will be a criminal case with falsified security video (or perhaps it has already happened and nobody knows it).\n\nGoing back to my original thoughts... really, what IS anti-intellectualism? Most see it as intentionally ignoring the truth. But if you don\u0027t know what the truth is, what if it\u0027s really a lack of resources (time, money, IQ, etc) to discover the truth? We\u0027ve come a ridiculously long way. If we want to know for sure that objects on Earth fall at 9.8m/s/s, yeah we can all reasonably do that. If we want to know for sure about the LHC? Well... yeah. I\u0027m gonna go play a game now ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nJust some random thoughts. Granted, I know there are people out there who are just driven purely by cognitive bias and do not want to see truth, but are they really the majority or not? Maybe people just don\u0027t have a million lifetimes to spend on research."},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T16:27:07Z","Content":"Given the amount of deliberate misinformation being put out by people claiming to be scientists and others who one should be able to trust in such matters, it\u0027s quite likely that the truth is by now unknowable.\n\nBut it likely always has been.

And to ask right questions you need to rely on the true values and true definitions.\n\nHowever, the definitions you need to proceed with caution, because some definitions describe things invented by man, and not found in nature such as democracy or any other political system.\n\nBut there are also definitions of things and phenomena that occur in nature, and here the problems begin, because our perception of the world has an impact on the definition of what we create. Today probably could try to rely on a number of scientific definitions, but is the science behind 10 years does not change or expand the description of those things or phenomena?\n\nProbably yes, so doubt as to the correctness of the many solutions proposed by science are justified. \n\nToday, many people implicitly believe everything what reads on the condition that the article is a signature of the authority with the academic title.

A person cannot make reasonable judgments outside their own field of expertise. (Unfortunately, many people are too unwise (or dumb) to understand the simple fact of their own ignorance and stupidity, and blindly follow their beliefs as if there is no question that they are true.) \n\nSo a wise person puts their faith in the experts of a field, and in doing so, in a way becomes just as smart as the expert. This is the real power that language has brought us as a species. As a collective whole, we are vastly more intelligent than even the smartest individual, because we can pool our knowledge and brains- or at least, wise people can.\n\n(There are many examples of people who have rather low IQs but still understand this concept, and understand their own limits of their intelligence, and so, trust what experts say who are more intelligent than them. They are following wisdom. That\u0027s why there\u0027s a distinction in my mind between \u0022wisdom\u0022 and \u0022intelligence\u0022. There are also many examples of people who have reasonably high IQs and still question experts in other fields. I\u0027ve met some very intelligent people who are young Earth Creationists and/or climate change deniers. These people are smart, but they are unwise. See the difference?)\n\nThis faith is not like blind religious faith; the experts have actually led us to many innovations and a far greater and demonstrably true understanding of the physical world. Furthermore, experts can form differing opinions, and we can take those differing opinions into account.\n\nI feel this problem really extends to our system of government, too. The problem with democracy is that it assumes that the common man is qualified to make judgments on extremely complex issues. He is not. The common man is very ignorant, and really doesn\u0027t have any business making foreign policy or economic decisions. The only reason democracy works at all is because on average, most politicians can figure out how to make reasonable choices in regards to governance. But the common man is, for the most part, unqualified to determine which politicians are good and which politicians are bad. \n\nThis isn\u0027t really our fault, even if we had the interest in some topic, we\u0027ve all got lives to lead and can\u0027t afford the time to be experts in, say, Middle East diplomacy or economic theory. However, as the old saying goes, while democracy is pretty bad, but it\u0027s still better than the other forms of government we\u0027ve tried. The ideal governing body would actually be a benevolent superintelligence, but somehow I doubt that xenophobic humans will ever allow themselves to be \u0022ruled\u0022 by such a being, no matter how obvious its good intentions are, at least, not anytime soon.

The group performs some amount of checking to verify that the provided information is true. From this, in all areas the content provider expresses an interest in being able to modify, they are provided a rank. Something like 1-5. A level 1 rank is someone that has only passing familiarity with a given topic, whereas a level 5 would be akin to someone with a PhD, 10 concurrent years of experience, etc.\n\nEach page would have two views to it. One is the non-CP view (general user) which can be organized with filters to display information on the topic ranging from highest to lowest ratings. The second view is the CP view, where they can see all the proposed edits to a page (anybody with a ranking in the required topic(s) can make a proposal). The proposals are voted on by the members involved with this page/topic. There would be some sort of ascending scale as you shift from 1-5. Not quite as slow as exponential, but maybe not quite as fast as logarithmic. The idea here being that in the case of something like global warming, where something like \u002B95% of climatology experts agree it is occurring, this would stand out above the statements by unqualified posters somewhat regardless of number. As has been pointed out many times, one of the sources of confusion on where scientists stand on a topic such as global warming, is that you have people with official sounding accolades (PhDs and the like) making statements, when their field of expertise is something completely unrelated like communications theory.\n\nIdeally, what would occur is every so often, (5\u002B years?) a given topic might be given a forced reboot where anyone who participated would be informed of a new version of the page (unreleased to public view) where they would get to hash things out again to cover any new advances. Anyone from the previous version of the page who chose not to participate in the new page, would simply have their votes not count in the new page. This SHOULD help in the case where new information suddenly appears and you have a shift in understanding, but for various reasons old participants are unable to update (retired, too busy, no longer care, etc).\n\nWill this prevent bias in the topics from the current group of scientists involved in a topic of research? Nope, but that isn\u0027t what this system would be for. In fact, providing that bias is actually part of the point, because the system should end up allowing a random viewer to see what the current reigning theory among actual qualified experts is. As time passes and the reigning theory changes, this should allow for it to shift away.\n\nJust a thought."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T18:46:15Z","Content":"That\u0027s basically Citizendium... which failed miserably, having managed to scare off all of the actual experts they\u0027d attracted.

This is a problem that seems new in our society, ever since the beginning of mass communication.\n\nI think this is actually a misconception. Let\u0027s just say that I\u0027ve been around many of the corners of the web and people will employ confirmation bias to the utmost degree. The problem isn\u0027t so much the truth, but the fact that we have far too much information with far too little ability to actually process it... and then we lie to ourselves by saying \u0022Oh, just read the wiki article.\u0022\n\nThe source of your information is more important than the information itself, not to lend inherent credibility, but to provide the means to dispute. I\u0027ve read far too many academic articles that are cited in debate only to turn out to be riddled with bias and data tampering. I particularly like this line (paraphrased) \u0022While it is controversial in the academic community to use a student t distribution for the data we used it for, we did so because we thought it better represented the data.\u0022 Basically, \u0022we are data tampering to confirm our hypothesis.\u0022\n\nThe problem is, I cannot actually dispute the hypothesis; and I really cannot 100% say that using math in a controversial way is the same as data tampering. The line pretty much makes me believe so, but I am ignorant on the intricacies of statistics; I can read about the distribution, but where is my actual experience? Can I say I am \u0022informed\u0022 simply because my interpretation of what someone wrote makes me believe something? And what about the actual material the study wanted to prove? What if it was trying to prove that gravitational acceleration at the surface of the earth is 9.81m/s, disputing the study doesn\u0027t really \u0022prove\u0022 anything, it only angles my belief system.\n\nEven if you were a doctor, you\u0027re still human. Being a doctor gives you much better ability to actually dispute the methods of the study, but was it not a doctor who performed it to begin with? There are points where the truth just may not be known, despite accreditation.\n\nSo what is an anti-intellectual?\n\nA person that cannot admit he/she knows nothing; a person that cannot accept that tomorrow up can be down, down can be up, and the laws of physics completely changed.\n\nDo note: Admitting you know nothing is not the same as succumbing to authority for authority may know nothing as well, it only means that you understand that all your knowledge rests tepidly on the BELIEF that it is true and that a widely shared belief still does not make something true.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Even photographic and video evidence will probably soon be considered useless, because the ability to fake them is in the hands of every John Doe with a computer. Some day there will be a criminal case with falsified security video (or perhaps it has already happened and nobody knows it).\n\nReally; this is a broken aspect of society. What I know of digital forensics is that they look for compression artifacts to detect edited video; of course there\u0027s nothing illegal about starting an open source project that tries to mask compression artifacts and if they change their algorithm frequently enough it can mask the use of the software.\n\nOf course, various forensic evidence can also be planted; while forensic scientists will look for evidence tampering, if a stray hair of yours turned up on the body of a dead person, perhaps your blood under said person\u0027s fingernails, it is never a 100% certainty that there is none. And if someone thinks it is a good idea to discuss how to defeat the tests for tampering, well freedom of speech.\n\nThe laws we make to protect us from the government fail to protect us from ourselves."},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T21:57:19Z","Content":"Do things fall?
