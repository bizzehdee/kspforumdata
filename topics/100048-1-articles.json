It has not been tested with a paylod heavier than 3 tons as that is as much mass I could reasonably fit inside the short cargo bay of the orbiter. It is also capable of flying completely unmanned Like the real life Buran.I advise that you to do your gravity turn in the craft towards the east as the is more landmass to the east which makes aborting a more viable option and presents more area for the boosters to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction Groups\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- Toggles maneuvering engine on the orbiter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Toggles cargo bay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0- lowers landing legs on the boosters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbort- Detaches the orbiter From the boosters and deactivates all of the engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight Instructions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
