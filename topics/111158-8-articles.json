The forums are fun for me, and I figured that moderating would make them less fun (and it has, but it\u0027s a job that needs doing).\n\nI would love to be able to separate my regular posts from my posts made in a moderative capacity, and indeed it\u0027s a topic that comes up among the mods form time to time (using colors or fonts to make it explicit when one is moderating). However, a veteran mod explained to me that such things are counterproductive for a number of reasons, a moderator should remember that his or her words will always be read through the lens of \u0022said by a moderator\u0022 and if users need special fonts or colors to figure out when you\u0027re moderating then you\u0027re doing it wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T17:40:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E *Why the banana?
