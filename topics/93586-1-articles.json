When I set the SAS to maintain orientation to one of the direction indicators, such as prograde, this induced a wobble. However, when I set it to \u0022Stability Assist\u0022 the wobble immediately went away. With stability assist the ship is simply holding its current attitude. However, when you set it to one of the direction indicators, the ship is constantly making minute corrections as it orbits the planet, which produces the wobble. It appears the SAS needs a bigger deadband to eliminate the rapid oscillations. My advise would be to use the directions for initial alignment and then switch to stability assist.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T05:13:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven a single strut between any 2 fuel tansk makes the connection exponentially more rigid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also add very little extra processing power (theyre physicsless more or less), so adding 20 struts to a craft atop the normal part count adds little if ANY lag.
