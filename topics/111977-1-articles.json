It doesn\u0027t make any sense to add shuttle wings if they can only be used by a few people and take hours to design. Here\u0027s how I would make them easier.\n\n1. Add new external tank parts that dont have as much fuel as an equivalent kerbodyne but have a much higher center of mass that stays in the same place as it drains (to represent the different fuel locations of the real shuttle ET).\n\n2. Add a 3 x KS-25 engine cluster with very high gimbal rates with its thrust initially pointed at the center of mass of the shuttle stack.\n\n3. Make Big-S wings longer so they actually match a full shuttle fuesalge (cargo bay \u002B 2 monoprop) and slightly increase the drag and lift values\n\n4. Take the larges srb and rescale it to 1.875m (as a new part) with much more fuel and thrust. In comparision to the real shuttle and SLS 1.25 m and 2.5 m are way to small or large.\n\n5. Add Stockalike OMS and nose RCS pods that are balanced\n\n6. Match Mk3 monoprop with Mk3 cargo bay texture (just aesthetic but this is so annoying)."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T02:49:31Z","Content":"Instead I would download a stock space bar to orbit replica from the spacecraft exchange if you don\u0027t want to put in the hours."},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T05:26:15Z","Content":"Even Mech-Jeb isn\u0027t space bar to orbit- but seriously, who wants to rely on others designs that use exploits and hacks to get to orbit.

I\u0027ve had good success so far with current parts better than I have ever had. I still believe the Dev\u0027s should impliment 1 or two things to really help out the building of shuttles, mainly a solid 3.75m high gimbal high thrust engine is really neccessary to replace the usual 3 Skippers, or single \u0022Rhino\u0022 setup.\n\n1. You can make this using a multi-compartment Design with the fuel drain at the top(largest tank is on top, smaller sized tanks further down the stack, connect to cockpit ). I\u0027ve more or less fixed fuel balance issues using this setup. It keeps your COM high up all the way to orbit. \n\n2. **YES**, really a 3x KS-25 engine cluster with high gimbal in general would be oriented to shuttles. Currently the \u0022Rhino\u0022 can work for mid sized designs (think KSO sized shuttles) but loses out to 3 Skippers in looks and thrust. But there is no happy medium and higher gimbal will always help.\n\n3. I currently Use the Big -s wings for my smaller sized shuttle design. Simply put both of the new \u0022shuttle wings\u0022 work well for a mid to smaller size shuttle design. Which currently is the ONLY size \u0022supported\u0022 in career and in sandbox without extensive workarounds.\n\n4. This will never happen. Add multiple boosters together to get what you need, I don\u0027t see the Devs creating a new part size class just for historical SRB size. \n\n5. This is to specific even for a shuttle enthusiast. Nothing stops us from setting up perfect recreations using the current RCS thrusters. the OMS pods are little more difficult but having two alternatives \u0022MK-55, Thud\u0022 (The radial mouted one) and the basic \u0022LV-909 Terrier\u0022 makes asking for even more dedicated OMS pods difficult. \n\n6.
