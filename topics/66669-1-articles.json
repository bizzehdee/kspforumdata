How would you like it to be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, since we\u0027e talking about a proper belt, not just some lone rocks drifting in space near Kerbin, I think the density of asteroids in the belt should be quite higher than the one in Kerbin\u0027s proximity. Enough asteroids so that, if you want to go and check one out, you can do so without tons of efforts, but still not so many as to pose problems while traversing the belt. I think you understood me, maybe around 100 bodies or a bit more on Dres\u0027s orbit, of different sizes (maybe not limiting them to the sizes of the ones near Kerbin). Maybe they could be, partially or entirely, randomly generated, as I guess the ones coming soon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd like, if you want to track one of them, you can\u0027t do it from the tracking station, since they\u0027re so far out, you\u0027d need a space telescope. Or, you\u0027d have to go near one (relatively near) and then select it from map view to check its trajectory...

Large\u003C/strong\u003E - E.g., Dres. Known objects, observable from Kerbin with sufficient optics, permanently tracked in the tracking station. Essentially, you could place say 3-10 more little asteroids in Dres-like orbits, objects on the scope of Bop, Gilly, Pol, and Minmus. These would be run on rails as Dres is.
