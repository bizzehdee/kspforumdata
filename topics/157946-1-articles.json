As such, I\u0027d consider competency level pedestrian. I can get in to Kerbal orbit with little issue, I can get a Career mode to orbit Mun and Minmus, I can land a single Kerbal on both, get them off the surface again and back home, but that\u0027s about the extent of it. Being that I am committed to Career mode (love it; it makes me feel I have to work for things), my competency basically ends there. Making a craft that orbits, say Mun, and drops a lander that is expect to return to orbit and dock with it again to come home is not something I have been able to accomplish; indeed even make an attempt (I don\u0027t practice docking enough).

Because of this, my stock-scale launch vehicles have actually evolved in such a way that they work well with MechJeb anyway (except when there are interstage fairings, which MechJeb refuses to autostage below 50km). However, it doesn\u0027t work so well for scaled-up versions of Kerbin, and I\u0027ve found that the high thrust required plus the different launch profile that\u0027s needed means that its generally more effective to fly manually in a scaled-up system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDocking is another thing where MechJeb is extremely useful only up to a certain point.

However, it fails when you need to dock in a tight space. Cargo bays or the inside of structural trusses really don\u0027t agree with MechJeb; the way that it\u0027s coded means that its docking autopilot won\u0027t dock if the target docking port is inside the vehicle. So for situations like that, it\u0027s good to dock manually. The rendezvous and docking autopilots are pretty good for beginners though; I learned to do rendezvous and docking maneuvers properly by watching it happen automatically with MechJeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-20T14:09:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222991142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157946\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489968003\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118956\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jros83\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, jros83 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see MechJeb is popular, or seems that way.
