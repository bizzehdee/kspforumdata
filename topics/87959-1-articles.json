The recent list of contracts I accepted was testing a parachute at a certain altitude and speed and a decoupler on a suborbital trajectory and a certain altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some unknown reason, and after repeated attempts with different craft designs, it seems like the system has stopped recognising me meeting the conditions as set out in the contract to test the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, I don\u0027t see the \u0022green check\u0022 beside the altitude and speed parameter for this parachute test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in case of the second example, when I put the craft in a suborbital trajectory, it does recognise that part of the contract being met, but I climb and descend through the altitude as prescribed in the contract without getting a confirmation of hitting that goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome to think of it, I abandoned my first attempt at 0.24.2 because when I went to rescue a kerbal stuck in orbit, I couldn\u0027t board the craft due to his clone mysteriously appearing in the empty pod that I had just boosted up into the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone come across this issue and if they have is there a solution other than restarting a new career?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you guys want me to provide a list of all the mods and the log output, I can do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying to replicate this in an unmodded install is out of the question because a) I\u0027d have to do all these contracts again and I wouldn\u0027t know when the issue would crop up \u0026amp; \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve done most things that the stock game offers and do not see myself continuing to play this game without some of my favourite mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
