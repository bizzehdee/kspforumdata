I want to work out the specific impulse of the mainsail engine, BUT I want to do it through the power of mathematics! I know what it should be, because the game says (280s ASL), and I know the equation, I just don\u0027t know how to apply the numbers to the equation. Could someone help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so for the equation I need the thrust in newtons (which is 1500 kN) and the fuel consumption in kg/s. That\u0027s where a problem arises, because the fuel consumption is given in l/s, not kg/s. How do I convert between the two? Is it possible without knowing the density of the fuel? Am I just being an idiot?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really want to get my head around this, I don\u0027t know why I just enjoy working these things out, even if they have already given me the answer! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T09:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working from memory here, but I think one unit of fuel (there\u0027s some discussion as to whether the units are liters or not) masses 5 kg. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, you can look at the fuel mass of a tank (right click in the VAB for the extended data) and divide by the capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T09:36:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Iforgotthis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Iforgotthis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Efuel consumption is given in l/s, not kg/s\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not really true, fuel unit is not specified (it was in earlier versions of KSP but is not now) and corresponds to 5 kg in case of liquid fuel and oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be very strange fuel if its one litre was 5 kg anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iforgotthis","CreatedById":102487,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T09:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s not really true, fuel unit is not specified (it was in earlier versions of KSP but is not now) and corresponds to 5 kg in case of liquid fuel and oxidizer.\u003Cp\u003EIt would be very strange fuel if its one litre was 5 kg anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow right you are...
