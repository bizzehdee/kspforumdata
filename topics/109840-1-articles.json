Aero is good, and it has really added a lot to the game.

I never could get on with FAR so its a happy medium. My ships finally come screaching towards the surface at some dangerous (read:standard kerbal) speeds. On my first orbital flight I made the rookie mistake of leaving my chute and final decouple stage in one stage...needless to say that ship cam hurtling towards the planet at a pretty incredible speed and then suddenly came to a not so incredible speed.\n\nAlthough alot of the threads seem to be comparing the current 1.02 aero to the 1.0 aero? Forunatley I never played it at 1.0 so i currently dont suffer from the \u0022change is to hard to get used to game is broken please revert to 1.0\u0022 syndrome\n\n\u003E \n\u003E While id love a death ray, fgor now we are stuck with kinetic missiles.......at least stock.......anyways, back to my fleet im building up around dres, i have 10 warships sofar (ohh teh lag, THE LAAAAAGGGGGGG!!!!) all loaded in one place, each like 200 parts.

But really, box shaped rockets fly quite well even in FAR and even IRL. Fortunately they heat up now so punching through the atmosphere is no longer possible."}]}
