Finally, a mod that would act as an on-screen protractor! I just wanted to know what my current phase was with Mun, relative to Kerbin, Kerbin\u0027s current phase with Duna relative to the Sun, Minmus\u0027 current phase to the Sun relative to Kerbin, and so on. It would be possible to muck through with accurate distance measurements, and if I were just to compute distances and stick them in the law of cosines, I could develop a massive network of satellites and compute distances to all the objects from individual satellites, but that\u0027s just a little ridiculous. I don\u0027t want Protractor or Mechjeb to do my orbital calculations for me. I want to compute my own orbit, I want to calculate exactly when my burn needs to start, and then I want to compute what angle that happens at, and then I will know exactly what my phase angle needs to be when I throttle up, and then I just want that on-screen, and I don\u0027t want to reinvent the wheel. Are there any good tools existing that will let me select three arbitrary bodies and tell me the angle between two relative to the third, wherever I am, whenever I ask?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alexmun","CreatedById":68608,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T14:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer\u0027s flight engineer component will give you the angle to your target body.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T15:55:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich stat is that?

I have to repeatedly take the difference of the true anomalies, switching back and forth between target planets, and then add to that the angle of periapsis, and then watch that number change and hope I don\u0027t miss it while I\u0027m computing. I guess the better way would be to compute the next instance of it occurring, compute the true anomaly of the current or the target, and then launch from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, thank you, Mr Shifty, for the doc.

I will keep this in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, if the eccentricity is 0, and there is no periapsis, how does Kerbin even _have_ a true anomaly?
