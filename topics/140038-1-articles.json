If not, leave semi-deploy pressure low and stage the parachute manually when you\u0027re sure to be going slowly enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, if you do end up in the mountains, pray that your flightpath puts you in a valley. On a typical re-entry profile, safe deploy speed might not be reached until about 4000-4500m altitude, leaving no time to be braked by chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(edit: physics actually lends a helping hand here: if you are in low orbit and set Pe to about 20km, you\u0027ll end up picking up a lot of vertical velocity and be able to deploy parachutes safely at around 4000m. Being in low orbit though, it is relatively easy to guess your landing zone. If you are in a much higher orbit (like the 800km orbit in the Orbiting 101 tutorial) and set Pe to 20km, that additional re-entry speed will give you a much flatter trajectory lower down, and you actually slow to safe parachute speeds at around 7500m. So if you are too high to judge your landing zone easily, physics has the effect of making it matter less!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-19T07:54:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2016 07:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T08:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst: I have never had exactly the failure that you describe in 1.1.2, so take this with a grain of salt -- a few more experiments are necessary to know exactly what failed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn previous versions, I can say for a fact that parachutes had to deploy in a particular order.

The 1200m full-deployment\u00A0altitude is supposed to be measured straight down to the surface of the ground (not sea level, as said above).
