This would also give another use for rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmake contracts like: 3 tourists would like to have a good view while on minmus, so put them in a lawn mower chair and drive them around. Also this would require tourists to sit in chairs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmake tourists that seek thrill: 2 tourists would like to experience 5-7g.
