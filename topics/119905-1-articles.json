It is easily calculated from Eccentric anomaly (E), which in turn is calculated from Mean anomaly (M), which is linear on time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, the equation that relates M and E (\u003Cem\u003EM = E - e*sin(E)\u003C/em\u003E, where \u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E is eccentricity) can\u0027t be solved for E. It is usually either approximated by a sine series or calculated by iteration, say, with Newton\u0027s method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sine series is pretty inaccurate when e is not \u0022very small\u0022, and I\u0027d say in KSP e is almost never \u0022very small\u0022. Newton\u0027s method is safer, but I\u0027m not sure calculating something by iteration, for every vessel/celestial body, for every frame, is the best way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know it KSP takes a third way out that I don\u0027t know of, or if it brute forces Newton?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T16:20:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know, they bypass the problem entirely by calculating the true anomaly from state vectors\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
