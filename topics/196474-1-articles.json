I have tried everything I could think to try and get it to stop, looking through google, forums and what not. I have tried multitude of guides on fixing the issue. But nothing worked. Only mod I use atm is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, current and up to date. Kerbin, along with all other planets, have either a shadow permanently casted over it, or the shadow flickers like a demonic strobe light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond: Fuel Transfer issue. Since 1.10.1, I have had a fuel transfer bug. Trying to transfer fuel from one tank in an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E into another, or a rocket in general,\u00A0and the button sticks on STOP. Either it duplicates the fuel (without adding to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E) or it doesnt transfer at all. Would appreciate any help possible to try and make it playable for me!!! Edit: I have tried uninstalling, reinstalling without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, verify integrity, tweaking options under both KSP and in my NVIDIA panel, updating Drivers, windows ect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a fresh install right now, no mods and only the DLC is installed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-23T03:28:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, as it is technically a modded install, I\u0027d normally move this over to Modded tech support.\u00A0\u00A0 But I highly doubt that it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E causing this, so we\u0027ll leave it here for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you got the game through Steam, verify the local file integrity, that will correct any corrupt files.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for fuel transfer, I believe this is a known bug, but I am not familiar with the details on it.\u00A0 There are other threads here that address it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-23T03:54:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shadow flickering\u00A0is really bad, you can easily replicate it by just\u00A0moving the camera a bit with an active vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are with zoomed out because they are more \u0027\u0027steady\u0027\u0027 when you are close to zoom they flicker way too fast to screenshot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/ah0RrHO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/ah0RrHO\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMun:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/6gEA52d\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/6gEA52d\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/4P6stl1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/4P6stl1\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-23T04:42:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2020 04:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Boyster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"griever0by0birth","CreatedById":206924,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-23T14:34:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to Gergamels post, as of now, it is unmodded.
