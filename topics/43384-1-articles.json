A quick redesign resulted in Explorer III, which successfully took off from Kerbin, flew to Duna, put 2 Kerbals on the surface to plant their flag, brought them back up to the orbiting command craft, which then brought all 3 safely back to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing that mission, I then decided to see just what the craft was capable of and have so far sent it to to land on Ike, Dres, 3 of Jool\u0027s moons, Laythe, Pol and Vall, Eve\u0027s moon Gilly, and out to Eeloo. In each case the lander put two Kerbals on the surface, and then all three Kerbals have returned to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction groups:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 to toggle the solar panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 to toggle the ladders on the lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it seems like a strange choice, but these just happen to be the default keys for those functions that I use on all my craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander is fitted with drogue chutes to help with landing on Laythe and Duna. If you are going to a moon or planet with no atmosphere, feel free to remove them to save some weight. All the missions I flew were done with the chutes on board, so it\u0027s not an issue to leave them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft uses a lander for excursions to the surface, leaving a command ship in orbit. Therefore you need to be able to rendezvous and dock to use it successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo save weight, the lander is not fitted with RCS, which is instead fitted to the command module. Once you get the lander back close enough for docking, you should change ships and perform the final docking with the command ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the lander has returned to the command ship, any fuel remaining in the lander should be transferred before ditching the lander. This just gives an extra safety margin to the returning vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou shouldn\u0027t have problems with fuel supply on the lander, but if you need to save weight getting back in to orbit, the external tanks can be ditched once they are empty. However, don\u0027t do this before landing, as the legs are attached to them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhilst the craft has enough fuel to visit and return from the bodies mentioned, it still pays not to waste it by transferring outside optimal transfer windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do happen to find yourself getting low on the return trip, you can always rely on aerocapture at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownsides:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design does use a big asparagus stage for the initial launch, so the first few tanks become empty fairly quickly after launch, so be ready to drop them. Despite the large number of tanks at launch, it is stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t like leaving debris out there, I\u0027m afraid this is not a design for you, as it does tend to shed quite a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the initial ejection burn, which uses a skipper on the second stage, most of the interplanetary transfer uses the nuke engine, so be prepared for longer burn times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter dumping the launch and second stages, this is what you are left with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/exp01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022exp01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/exp02.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022exp02.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/exp03.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022exp03.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVall\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/exp04.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022exp04.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/exp05.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022exp05.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/exp06.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022exp06.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/exp07.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022exp07.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEeloo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/exp09.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022exp09.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is all you are left with when you start heading back to Kerbin, and most of that gets dumped once you are sub-orbital!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/exp10.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022exp10.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can download the craft file here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/z8qbepsjafc1h5c/Explorer%20III.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EExplorer III\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-21T18:18:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2013 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
