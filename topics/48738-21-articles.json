Specifically I am wondering about the Kethane mod and the Extra-planetary Launchpads mod. In other words will the KAS pipes also transfer ore, metal, and kethane from say a drill rover to some \u0027extra-planetary launchpad\u0027 silos for storage and transfer ship parts to a \u0027launchpad\u0027 for construction? If so, then the capability of a fully functional Mun base is within reach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roxette","CreatedById":84963,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T08:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steelrose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steelrose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... will the KAS pipes also transfer ore, metal, and kethane ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KAS pipes effectively form a temporary link between vessels, once the link is established, any configured resource can be transferred between parts in the same way as it can be between tanks on an ordinary vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Disclaimer - mods that incorporate resource-specific DLLs in addition to physical parts may be subject to usual potential software conflicts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steelrose","CreatedById":100930,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T17:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Roxette\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Roxette\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe KAS pipes effectively form a temporary link between vessels\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the next question is will the like be there after I exit and reload?

HOWEVER... when physics kicks in after reloading, the link and anything connected to it MAY explode. Surprisingly, it seems to happen more often when linking vessels on a moon/planet surface than if everything is floating in orbit, I suspect due to interactions with the surface and gravity. The other options are docking ports or a mod that allows contactless resource transfer. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-system/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-system/\u003C/a\u003E is the only one I am aware of that is operational with KSP version 0.23.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steelrose","CreatedById":100930,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T20:22:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHurm...
