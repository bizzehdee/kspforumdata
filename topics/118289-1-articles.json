However, there are still reasons why it is valuable. Setting up refueling stations out in the solar system can make future missions a bit easier to manage because you can stop vessels at them to top off their tanks. This extends their potential mission range and increases your margin of error so you are less likely to leave something stranded and out of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stress that the practicality of this is something greater with stationary facilities than it is with carrying all the equipment on mobile missions. You can keep pulling ore and cracking it while other missions are going on, or in transit, so you do not have to keep fast forwarding time while waiting to fuel up. Have a surface base that extracts ore, and an orbital facility that holds the fuel, plus a tender to transfer from one to the other. You just have to remember to take control every once in a while to do the exchange. If you are going to do a crewed mission, send these things ahead as probes. By the time your crewed mission gets there, it will be ready to top off and can return on a full tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T22:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fearless Son\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fearless Son\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn general, it is probably not worth the extra mass to take mining equipment with you compared to just taking along more fuel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA complete mining addition to your craft can come in at under 5 tons... about as much as an FL-T800 tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt very quickly becomes worth it in credits in game, and mass efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as my time... well... its easier to mine on the Mun, than to send more fuel to munar fuel depots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven more so for Duna/Ike/Jool system... and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlimited, indefinite operations around a celestial body... that is worth it to me\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey key is to do other stuff while the miners work in the background\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T23:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s worth it.

Use Roverdude\u0027s UKS mod. This has a part called a Logistics Hub, the entire purpose of which is to eliminate the drudgery of moving resources around between different ships, stations, and bases. It basically magics resources from 1 place to another via \u0022cargo drones\u0022 (that don\u0027t actually appear in the game) which consume fuel and take time to travel. So what you do is build a mining/refining/fuel-storing base on Kerbin about 3km from KSC so not in physics range, and include one of these Logistics Hubs on it. Then have it teleport the fuel up to your ship in LKO. No need to build a base on Minmus or travel to/from it, no need for rendezvous and dockings, and less game-time spent on refueling than doing it manually.
