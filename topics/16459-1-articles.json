These inward faces all have docking clamps on them so that the arm can attach itself anywhere needed for access to the craft under construction. The pieces of the frame can be shipped up in chunks that have docking clamps at the end of each truss piece so that they can fit together. This allows it to be built as long as it is needed too, allowing for a bit of flexibility!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe arm itself is fairly straightforward, with lots of hinges for flexibility, hydraulics to extend its reach when needed, and rotating parts to manipulate orientation easier. It is mirrored so that when moving from one anchor to the other, it doesn\u0027t need the same end to be attached each time, making it easier to change location. The arm could simply attach to any newly delivered parts, pull them inside the frame and place it where necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a basic design of just one end of the arm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i826.photobucket.com/albums/zz185/AesusVaro/screenshot3-2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot3-2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is basically it!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-09T17:08:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2012 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Krackit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serratus","CreatedById":12069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T17:11:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHate to break Your party.

For each end of the arm, three rotatrons will allow for full articulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did some thinking about this as well. I didn\u0027t consider a ring structure, but I did think it would be important to have a few double-ended arms. Tools like claws could be attached separately. I think a long truss with plenty of attachment points and 2-3 arms would be all you\u0027d really need for assembly, though; your part delivery ships would attach to the station hull and parts could be pulled off one-by-one to build the larger craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose arms might not always be the best solution, though. Suppose you\u0027re trying to connect two very large ships by multiple attachment points simultaneously. Instead of using an arm, you might want something more specialized that pulls two ships together at a perfect angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe possibilities are endless and exciting. :-) You know, if we ever get docking nodes...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T17:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majiir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majiir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHarv can suck it up and let us do it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember you are playing in HarvesteR\u0027s garden, but then again, if you can show that orbital construction is possible and fun, and if enough people want it, HarvesteR might change his mind \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T17:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERemember you are playing in HarvesteR\u0027s garden, but then again, if you can show that orbital construction is possible and fun, and if enough people want it, HarvesteR might change his mind \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy statement was, of course, a little tongue-in-cheek. It\u0027s my hope that docking will come sometime and that the implementation will be flexible enough that it\u0027s no more effort to add in-orbit construction. Really, orbital construction and docking are the same thing; you\u0027re just attaching bits together by docking points. My only fear is that docking may be implemented in a narrow way that only connects controllable vessels, not a more flexible way which connects groups of parts. It\u0027s a minor distinction, really, which is why I\u0027m optimistic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T17:51:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI for one would like to see orbital construction as well, after all, how do we build the orbital VAB in the first place?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krackit","CreatedById":21101,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T18:35:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven if that method of construction isnt what HarvesteR has in mind, it doesnt necessarily mean we will be barred from doing it!
