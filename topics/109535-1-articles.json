It\u0027s persisted through 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, I\u0027ve just never bothered starting a thread about it. It seems to happen faster if I switch between screens more, so if I\u0027m going VAB, tracking station, administration, then launchpad, it\u0027ll crash faster than just starting up a flight on the launchpad and flying around for a while. \n\nI\u0027ve got about 40 different crash dump folders right now, and that\u0027s after I cleaned it out a week ago. They all seem to say pretty much the same thing, so I\u0027ll just put up the latest [error.log](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6yzb1y17gliptrn/error.log?dl=0) and [output_log.txt](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5fejkcmk72b8mvh/output_log.txt?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Li0n","CreatedById":142527,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:38:02Z","Content":"The game have different memory leaks who leads to a crash when it hits the 32bit limit (around 4Gb). The more you change scene the more you fill the memory. Flying low is also know to increase the leaks, try disabling terrain scatter, it should helps. The [new heat system](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118658-New-Heat-System-causes-memory-leak) should also be avoided.\n\nThere is already a bunch of thread discussing this issue"},{"CreatedByName":"GraviTykillz","CreatedById":60694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T00:00:19Z","Content":"ive been having the same problem mate..i just save every 3 or 4 mins. Hope they fix this soon"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T13:25:51Z","Content":"Well at first I didn\u0027t think it was a memory leak issue, no crash report has listed more than 70% of the memory being used. Terrain scatter hasn\u0027t been on, and it definitely hasn\u0027t been related to the new temperature gauges on my install. As much as it\u0027s crashed, it actually has never seemed to be a direct result of the temp gauges, and that was a 1.0.1 issue anyways, this has been happening since 1.0.0.\n\nLooking at my error log it seemed odd that the address space for the program only has about 100Mb left out of 2Gb, but that still seems like more than enough to prevent writing to the same memory address. Apparently 32-bit windows installations only let each program itself use 2Gb of memory addresses, anyone know anyway to increase that?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T13:52:52Z","Content":"adinfinitum, can you try running a new copy from c:\\Games please, your downloads folder may be \u0022protected\u0022.\n\nThe crash looks to be memory related so a lower texture setting might help."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:07:04Z","Content":"Alright, I\u0027ll try that, I\u0027m re-extracting 1.0.2 to C:\\Games now, once it finishes I\u0027ll play it for a while and see how it goes. \n\nI\u0027m pretty sure my textures are set to half-size right now, I don\u0027t really mind lower settings on external textures, but is there any way to keep IVA textures full size while externals are a lower size?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:09:34Z","Content":"Well the memory crash may just have been because of where the game was, so just use the settings you\u0027re happy with for the moment.\n\nThough the SM3 terrain shaders have caused trouble for players on older Nvidia cards, it might be worth testing KSP with those off."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:15:43Z","Content":"Was looking good for a while, but the same thing happened again off the fresh install in C:\\Games. 69% of physical memory used, and 74Mb of user address space left over. I actually turned the SM3 shaders off right after I first downloaded 1.0.0, they slowed my game down too much for my tastes so I\u0027ve left them off since then. \n\nLooks like my best option now is to turn the textures down some more, and see if I\u0027ve got any driver updates that might help. \n\nLast time I really played KSP all the time was back before they added in the tech tree and career mode, has all the stuff they\u0027ve added since then really brought the amount of active RAM usage up over 2Gb? Or is it just Unity not dumping old data before loading new stuff?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:17:27Z","Content":"What\u0027s using the last 30% of your RAM?"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:25:53Z","Content":"Nothing as far as I know, I haven\u0027t watched the memory window in task manager at the exact same time it crashes yet, but from what I have seen when watching the memory is that the memory usage given by the error.log is the total used by all processes. I haven\u0027t seen KSP go above 1.9-2.0 Gb, and Firefox usually takes up another 0.3-0.5 Gb, which would put my total up around 2.5 out of 3.5 available memory, which is right about the 70% I usually see in the crash logs."},{"CreatedByName":"Meridius","CreatedById":106907,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:26:26Z","Content":"I concur with adinfinitum and the game (1.0.2) is unstable with some sort of memory leak. Playing in the campaign mode, I keep CTD. This last entry into the game, I kept changing scenes (VAB, Science, Admin, etc.) with the Performance Tab running. My allocated memory kept steadily rising in the scene and would go down as I entered the new scene (~950 mb to ~1100 mb). After about 5 screens, CTD. Did this twice. Right now, the game is very unstable."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:41:38Z","Content":"What OS do you have on your computer Meridius? From what I\u0027ve seen poking around on the internet so far any 32-bit windows installation only let\u0027s each program use a maximum of 2Gb at once, and I think that might be why I couldn\u0027t find any threads with a similar problem. It\u0027s been a really long time since I\u0027ve gotten a new computer, I just upgrade pieces as I need, but if most computers from the past few years came with 64-bit windows that might be why it doesn\u0027t seem to be a very common problem, at least not as common as the heat gauge leak."},{"CreatedByName":"Meridius","CreatedById":106907,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:12:22Z","Content":"I have a custom built (e.g. build myself from components) Intel i5-3550 @ 3.30 GHz with 16.0 GB, Windows 7.0, 64-bit (OEM, so no added crap!) with a NVidia GeForce GTX 660 w/2GB VRAM (latest driver 350.12).
