Terrain scatter hasn\u0027t been on, and it definitely hasn\u0027t been related to the new temperature gauges on my install. As much as it\u0027s crashed, it actually has never seemed to be a direct result of the temp gauges, and that was a 1.0.1 issue anyways, this has been happening since 1.0.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at my error log it seemed odd that the address space for the program only has about 100Mb left out of 2Gb, but that still seems like more than enough to prevent writing to the same memory address. Apparently 32-bit windows installations only let each program itself use 2Gb of memory addresses, anyone know anyway to increase that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T13:52:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eadinfinitum, can you try running a new copy from c:\\Games please, your downloads folder may be \u0022protected\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crash looks to be memory related so a lower texture setting might help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I\u0027ll try that, I\u0027m re-extracting 1.0.2 to C:\\Games now, once it finishes I\u0027ll play it for a while and see how it goes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure my textures are set to half-size right now, I don\u0027t really mind lower settings on external textures, but is there any way to keep IVA textures full size while externals are a lower size?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell the memory crash may just have been because of where the game was, so just use the settings you\u0027re happy with for the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough the SM3 terrain shaders have caused trouble for players on older Nvidia cards, it might be worth testing KSP with those off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWas looking good for a while, but the same thing happened again off the fresh install in C:\\Games. 69% of physical memory used, and 74Mb of user address space left over.

I haven\u0027t seen KSP go above 1.9-2.0 Gb, and Firefox usually takes up another 0.3-0.5 Gb, which would put my total up around 2.5 out of 3.5 available memory, which is right about the 70% I usually see in the crash logs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meridius","CreatedById":106907,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:26:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI concur with adinfinitum and the game (1.0.2) is unstable with some sort of memory leak.
