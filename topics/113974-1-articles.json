Where the clouds met the mountains, their edges churned and roiled, driven by the fierce, frigid, hurricane-force winds cascading into the valley below. As the wind descended and spread out across the valley floor it slowed and warmed, until by the time it reached Boris Kermanskiovitch, it was merely a chilling breath. He stood, looking out over the valley, his bare hands folded behind him, oblivious to the cold as the wind whispered around him. He wore a heavy coat trimmed with fur, massive thick boots that added to his already imposing height, and a tall \u003Cem\u003Eushanka\u003C/em\u003E on his head, the ear-flaps always pinned up, emblazoned with the Crimson Star of the Ussari Union, and the insignia marking him as a Kommissar. He stood, impassively, a half-smoked rattail dangling from his lips, and observed the flurry of activity in the distant pit in the valley floor as snow slowly drifted down around him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sensed the other\u0027s approach, and leaned heavily on the ancient wooden railing before him. It creaked and groaned in protest, as did the worn floor boards as the other Kerbal joined him at the railing. Boris did not look away from the valley, but produced a half-empty pack of rattails from his coat, which he offered wordlessly to the newcomer, who took one as he, too, leaned on the long-suffering railing. The newcomer dug out a match, struck it into flame on the railing, and lit the rattail, taking a long, deep drag. He took it from his mouth and regarded it for a moment, blowing the smoke out to mix with the harsh draft, then took another slow drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u042C\u0424\u042FSCHT\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E,\u0022 said Igor finally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly the slightest flick from Boris\u0027s eyes, \u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u042C\u0424\u042FSCHT\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022D\u0414?\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022\u0419\u0423\u0417T.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022\u0419\u0423\u0417T!\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022D\u0414!\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022D\u0414?\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ED\u0414\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E,\u0022 Boris sighed heavily.

She looked up at them as she walked, reminded of the frigid, sparkling winter nights back home on the taiga. How many times had she stared up at them, the cold biting at her face, as they seemed to beckon and whisper? As long as she could remember, she dreamed of being up there, in that immaculate lucidity.

She would be the First.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, not \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E first. That honor had already been claimed by another. No one had seen it coming. No one had expected it. The Foreigners had been the first to put a Kerbal into space. And not only into space. He had orbited the planet, opened his hatch, climbed out, and claimed the first spacewalk as well. Valentina began to climb the steep ladders up the scaffolding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had been an embarrassment to the Imperium the likes of which had not been seen in a generation, broadcast live over the air where not even they could conceal it. Funding to the overwhelmed Ussari space program had flowed freely since then. The Union would reclaim technological superiority at any cost. A race was beginning. A race to the heavens, and beyond. The Foreigners boasted loudly about their next planned launch. A second Kerbal in space before the Union had launched even one was unthinkable, and yet there it was, on the entertainment box, for the world to see. The Imperium had not even tried to suppress it. Valentina reached the platform at the top of the stairs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the accident. Live, on the entertainment box, for the world to see. Smoke, and confusion, and fire. So much fire. She knew the Kerbish language well enough to understand the announcer\u0027s pained and futile calls for help, before the screen went to static. It had been heart-wrenching to watch, even if they \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E strange foreigners. Everything had changed after that. And tomorrow...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUgh, how she hated politics. She reached out, and touched the cold steel casing of the solid rocket motor. This was something she could understand. Valentina began to walk down the platform, along the flank of the massive rocket, running her stubby fingers along the painted steel. This, this was something \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E. She was to be First. She knew why she had been chosen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe was the Best. Top of her class at the Imperial Air Force Academy. Thousands of hours flying the fastest things on wings at a ridiculously young age. She flew like the infamous Ussari winter: ice cold. No mistakes. She took to the theories of orbital mechanics naturally, could work out the equations in her head as if she could \u003Cem\u003Esee\u003C/em\u003E the trajectories. She could run faster, climb higher, punch harder than any of her fellow Select. She had remained conscious for over a minute in the vacuum training chamber, had pulled eighteen G\u0027s in the centrifuge. But she knew this was not why she was chosen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe was chosen because she was the smallest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other three Select were all small, but even Sergei stood centimeters over her. His ego, of course, was not so small. Valentina reached the tip of the rocket. Within the pointed nose cone and its launch escape tower, was her tiny, spherical pod. It was a simple matter of physics, really. This rocket would take her on a suborbital flight into space, but only just. Every gram saved on the pilot was another precious few meters of altitude. She would be little more than inert payload anyway. The Foreigner had flown his rocket all the way to orbit by his own hand. Valentina\u0027s rocket was completely unguided. It would rely on careful engineering and a natural gravity turn to bring her to space for just a few fleeting moments. It was the best--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Valentina,\u0022 said an ominous voice behind her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E,\u0022 she said to the wind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Language!\u0022 the Voice scolded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time she did roll her eyes.

He probably ate them, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Indeed.

From some cavern in his heavy coat, he produced her wide-brimmed hat with the two small, gold stars marking her as a Lieutenant. He placed it gently on her head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come. Is cold. If you catch death, I must see Kommissar. I do not like to see Kommissar.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina sighed, and descended another steep staircase with him. Igor had a very dry sense of humor. He was also the only person she\u0027d ever known who spoke with an accent in his native language. She thought it must be all the rattails he smoked. That couldn\u0027t possibly be good for the brain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two walked in silence through the deserted complex. Above, the M\u00FCn now shown down with a sickly light. It had always made Valentina uncomfortable. She couldn\u0027t quite say why. She much preferred the darkness of a starry night to that insincere glow. Around them, the wind swirled and blew on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt whispered troublingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-14T00:57:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2015 12:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T16:01:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDun Dun Duuuuuun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T05:23:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 2: A New Dawn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDawn broke as clear as the night had been, the frigid wind replaced by a cool stillness. The sun, still hidden behind the mountains that ringed the valley, lit up their snow-covered peaks like flaming beacons. As indigo light slowly drained into the valley, Valentina Kerman stepped out onto the running track next to the fitness center. She breathed deeply as she did her morning stretches. The stillness of this place at dawn had always amazed her.

Valentina stumbled but managed to keep her footing. She charged onward, keeping pace just to the side and slightly behind Sergei. No sense making this any more unpleasant than it needed to be. The two plodded on, in their awkward, head-low, but surprisingly swift Kerbal gait. She could hear him grunting, straining to stay ahead. Good, let him exhaust himself.

It seemed like such an odd way to think about it, it belonged to the People of the Union after all, but never before had she had something so completely her own. Every dial, every gauge, she knew them better than her own face. Blindfolded, upside-down, and under water, she could operate every switch and locate every button not even by feel but by pure muscle memory.

She would rather be up there now, training, than down here with... politics. The whole day had been handshakes and speeches about courage and sacrifice and awkward small talk. The Foreigner had brought a small cadre of comrades, and representatives from the Empress, the Imperium, the military, the Academy of Sciences, the design bureaus, the NKOTB, and all the Union Oblasts were in attendance. She\u0027d never seen a bigger group of people who really didn\u0027t want to be around each other. Off in a corner, a traditional Ussari band played traditional Ussari music. They had tried playing the music of the Foreigners for a time, until it was mutually agreed that continuing to do so might inadvertently trigger a war and the band should just stick to what it knew.

Other than Sergei, everyone seemed to be getting along quite well, for people who weren\u0027t supposed to like each other. Were these really the untrustworthy adversaries? Only months ago, this place, built in a deep pit, dug out of a hidden valley, surrounded by impassable mountains, in the middle of inhospitable steppe, had been the most closely guarded secret in the Union. Now the very people it was most to be kept secret from were wandering about looking at everything. She looked again toward the Foreigner, having a very animated conversation with an adjunct from Abvonovichatkaderivokistan, though she was quite sure neither spoke the other\u0027s language, and finally saw a friendly face coming her way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Have you ever seen hair like that on a person?

And immediately wished she hadn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Remember where you are,\u0022 Dibella said with a wry grin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith difficulty, Valentina choked the bitter stuff down without gagging or spitting, \u0022gah, tastes like rocket nozzle!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Quite.

That is why you were chosen as the first pilot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We are hardly even pilots. The rocket is unguided, and even the attitude controls are locked out without the emergency override code.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s simply a precaution.

No one deserves it more. You will get an orbital flight. And it will be longer than Sergei\u0027s. Or Tercella\u0027s. And you will do greater things.

Then Igor, too, was gone. Valentina looked at the item in her hands. It was a bit of colored paper, folded skillfully into the shape of a bird.

The scrabbling and muffled voices outside as the hatch was bolted shut brought the whisp of a memory to the back of her mind. As she reached, it seemed to drift farther, like a star so dim she could only see it from the corner of her eye; if looked at directly, it vanished. She sighed, and pushed it away. One thing she \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E sure of, that hatch had slammed closed with all the finality of a tomb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, Valentina Kerman felt very alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-20T08:10:39Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2020 08:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T05:56:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUdachi, Comrade Pilot... udachi.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T04:32:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight\u0027ve overdone the Papers Please reference a bit there, but otherwise, I love it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T05:45:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh - I facepalmed when I finally figured that reference out.

Then she looked to the control panel to her left.

Deep blue faded to rich turquoise dusted by frail white clouds. She could see sunlight glinting off of individual waves.

The pod tumbled on, and the entire great breadth of Ussari spread out before her further east, taking up the entire horizon as the opposite curve of Kerbin drifted into view, with the stark blackness of space beyond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the M\u00FCn wandered into view, and suddenly filled her with an inexpressible terror that jolted her back to reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe shouldn\u0027t be seeing this. She shouldn\u0027t be seeing \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E of this. She was much too far north!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstinct came roaring back, and Valentina desperately tried to restore power. Main buss A, dead. Main buss B, undervolt. Cross feed from aux batteries, switch the breaker, and... there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA single bulb flickered weakly to life, casting a dim yellow in the cabin. Debris floated everywhere. Quickly, cautiously, she reset the circuit breakers for the most important systems. The map gauge confirmed she was far off course to the north, heading towards the frigid North Yaltik Sea. She had to fire the retro rocket pack and land before she reached it. The pod could land in the water, but the nearly freezing water would kill her in minutes if she landed there. With that gaping hole, the capsule would sink like a stone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control, this is \u003Cem\u003EKedr\u003C/em\u003E, do you read?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control, \u003Cem\u003EKedr\u003C/em\u003E, do you copy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a sound. She couldn\u0027t be sure if the ship was even capable of transmitting. Or receiving. Or if the rest of it, and the retro pack, was there at all. She reached for the manual controls and--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lockout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe couldn\u0027t fire the rockets, jettison the service module, or set attitude for reentry. Even if the automatic system still worked, without buss A there was no way to power it. In frustration, she slammed her fist against the plastic cover. It shattered, sending cascading about the cabin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as she knew, the controls still wouldn\u0027t work without the override code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeep in the back of her mind, something leered and snickered in the shadows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe was done for now, there was nothing--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA small, colorful paper bird drifted past her faceplate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMouth agape, she gently reached out and plucked it from the airless vacuum. Gingerly, awkward with her thick gloves, she unfolded it. The words \u0022override code\u0022 in a certain heavy, deliberate script appeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Igor, I could \u003Cem\u003Ekiss \u003C/em\u003Eyou!\u0022 Valentina squealed to the instrument panel.

Still nothing. Had she set the power correctly? Were the right valves on? Maybe--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe felt the ship move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe tried another button, pressed, held... after an eternity, the ship moved the other way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe firing is delayed! It wasn\u0027t like this in the simulator!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith agonizing lethargy, she brought the capsule around to the right attitude and stabilized it. She wasted no time hitting the sequence of switches to fire the engine. After a heartbeat of eons, she finally felt the push as it fired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe hoped it would be enough. If the altimeter was working, she was already dipping back into the atmosphere. The tiny engine fired on and on. She willed it to go faster. This wasn\u0027t the right attitude for reentry. With the service module in place, the capsule would eventually flip around nose-first, even with the attitude thrusters, pointing the parachute pack directly into the fiery plasma.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come on, come on, faster!\u0022 Valentina yelled at the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally she felt the push cease, and saw the light on the console go from yellow to red. Slowly, ever so slowly, she brought the ship to the proper reentry attitude. She switched off the safeties and fired the decoupler. A slight bump, and the console lights changed again. There, now the ship should be stable, just have to hope the heat shield--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a tremendous jolt, and the craft started oscillating wildly. The view in the window began rushing around, the push of acceleration returned, and the Thing in the back of her mind cackled with glee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419!

The module should have been detached before changing attitude! Now it must be jammed against the bottom of the capsule by the force of air rushing against it. She looked at her horizon gauge, spinning around and around. It was canted off to the side, too, the pod made unstable by the mass pressed against it. Gee force pushed her deeper and deeper into her couch as the pod plunged into the thickening atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShuddering and shaking now returned as well, Valentina could see a dull orange glow through the hole in the hull. It grew brighter, whisps of superheated plasma and glowing bits of... \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E streaking past. Then in an instant, the capsule shifted, and now the plasma was \u003Cem\u003Einside\u003C/em\u003E, flailing and searching like a thing alive, incinerating anything it touched. The edges of the window-hole incandesced in red and orange. She was paralyzed by the crushing gee force as the Thing in the back of her mind paced rapidly back and forth like an anxious animal, giggling all the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as quickly as the tempest had begun, it faded. The glow dissipated, the acceleration dwindled, and soon the pod was simply falling. Not willing to trust the altimeter any farther, Valentina hit the manual parachute release, and was relieved as the pod bucked back and forth beneath it. Eventually she felt the reassuring push as the canopies fully opened, the capsule slowed, and gently rocked on its lines. A loud \u003Cem\u003Ebang\u003C/em\u003E, as the heat shield decoupled and fell away, then she hit the switch for the landing airbags.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo indicator light either way, no sound or motion. For all she knew they might not even be there anymore. It would be a hard landing. She strained, trying to see anything useful through the charred and blackened window-hole, but could see nothing but sky and clouds from this angle. She had no idea if she was even over land or--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pod slammed into the water, only theoretically softer than solid ground. The impact knocked her senseless for a moment, water pouring in through the hole as the capsule bobbed and rolled in the waves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis, at least, Valentina had trained for. Not much time. She knew the parachute would quickly drag the pod under the water, even if it hadn\u0027t been flooding. Her timing must be perfect. Just before it did, it would roll over with the hatch pointing to the sky. She had to blow it then, up and out of the water and away from the ship, then climb out before the sea poured in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe had to move quickly. The Thing in her mind bounded back and forth, slobbering and whimpering, still not daring to leave the shadows. Faceplate still down and locked, good. She closed her suit valves, unhooked the umbilicals, then unfastened her harness. The survival kit was under the couch, she would need the medical kit out of locker A3--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hatch blew out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe had just enough time to recognize that fact before the incoming torrent of water smashed her face into the instrument panel, and again darkness took her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-13T08:25:00Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2019 08:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T03:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EChapter 7: Into the Light\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing but darkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThick, crushing, suffocating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina started awake, consumed by a darkness so deep it stung her eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhere am I?

Another explosion to her right, followed by another huge fin. Then another, and another, dozens of them, swarming her, surrounding her. Bizarre sounds now filled the air, and an awful, low rumbling she could feel in her spine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe water broke again, and a new form rose above the surface barely a meter away... and kept rising, and rising. Teeth. Cruel, serrated, blade-like teeth, each as big as her head filed past in a jagged line as the form kept rising, smooth black skin glistening in the failing sunlight. Then it stopped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina blinked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tiny eye, no bigger than her own, winked back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe colossal, conical head loomed over her like a building, like a planet.

Valentina pinched her eye... bulges. Then she reached out a hesitant hand. All over the skin were circular, grey scars. Her fingers brushed the smooth, rubbery hide. She felt it tremble at her touch. The eye blinked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe calm was broken by that deafening, vibrating rumble she felt more than heard. The head then swiftly sank back below the waves, the rows of giant teeth sliding past at a horrifying pace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then it was gone, and Valentina was alone among the rolling swells as the sun sank towards the horizon. With nothing else for it, she set off in the direction of shore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome time later, the sun now touching the waves, she took her first shaky steps up the beach, exhausted. For just a moment, she thought it was over, before a large wave slammed into her from behind and drove her face into the gravel. She crawled the rest of the way up the beach, coughing and gagging and shivering as the water swirled around her hands and knees. She finally reached an old, bleached log at the high tide line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe pulled herself up it onto her elbows, and looked beyond. A dense forest of spruce and pine spread out before her, here and there the last stubborn patches of winter\u0027s snow clung to the shadows. Small furry things also clung to the shadows, eyeing her suspiciously and wondering if she was edible. Beyond the forest, a snow-covered mountain towered, lit up yellow and gold by the fading sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m... home?\u0022 Valentina said incredulously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeariness was beginning to set it. With effort, she pulled herself up onto the log and looked out over the ocean. To the southwest, the sun was at last dipping below the sea, painting the horizon and clouds in brilliant red and crimson, while the deeper sky drifted from sapphire to indigo and into violet. It was truly--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn ominous, low buzzing just to her left drew her attention. She slowly turned her head, and looked into the thousand eyes eyes of the biggest mosquito she had ever seen. Its head was bigger than hers, ending in a half-meter long proboscis tipped by drooling, razor-sharp barbs. It rubbed its forelegs together in anticipation of its next succulent meal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina grunted in annoyance, grabbed the proboscis, twisted till it was pointed at the sky, and \u003Cem\u003Epulled\u003C/em\u003E. The head popped cleanly off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe body felt at its neck-stump for a moment, as if not quite grasping what had just happened. Eventually it wandered off, seeming very confused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina sighed and looked down at the horrible insectoid visage in her hands. It was going to be a long, cold, weary night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh well, at least now she had dinner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-07T05:42:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2016 05:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T15:28:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI crush you like baby!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina = Heavy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dbmorpher","CreatedById":77927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T15:18:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Kerbin mosquitoes are a meter long?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T15:42:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah - on CatastrophicFailure\u0027s version of Kerbin, the kerbals developed spaceflight as a way of escaping from the local wildlife once and for all.
