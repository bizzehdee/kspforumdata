Where the clouds met the mountains, their edges churned and roiled, driven by the fierce, frigid, hurricane-force winds cascading into the valley below. As the wind descended and spread out across the valley floor it slowed and warmed, until by the time it reached Boris Kermanskiovitch, it was merely a chilling breath. He stood, looking out over the valley, his bare hands folded behind him, oblivious to the cold as the wind whispered around him. He wore a heavy coat trimmed with fur, massive thick boots that added to his already imposing height, and a tall *ushanka* on his head, the ear-flaps always pinned up, emblazoned with the Crimson Star of the Ussari Union, and the insignia marking him as a Kommissar. He stood, impassively, a half-smoked rattail dangling from his lips, and observed the flurry of activity in the distant pit in the valley floor as snow slowly drifted down around him.\n\nHe sensed the other\u0027s approach, and leaned heavily on the ancient wooden railing before him. It creaked and groaned in protest, as did the worn floor boards as the other Kerbal joined him at the railing. Boris did not look away from the valley, but produced a half-empty pack of rattails from his coat, which he offered wordlessly to the newcomer, who took one as he, too, leaned on the long-suffering railing. The newcomer dug out a match, struck it into flame on the railing, and lit the rattail, taking a long, deep drag. He took it from his mouth and regarded it for a moment, blowing the smoke out to mix with the harsh draft, then took another slow drag.\n\n\u0022\u042C\u0424\u042FSCHT,\u0022 said Igor finally.\n\nOnly the slightest flick from Boris\u0027s eyes, \u0022\u042C\u0424\u042FSCHT?\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414?\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\n\n\u0022\u0419\u0423\u0417T.\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\n\n\u0022\u0419\u0423\u0417T!\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414!\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414?\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414,\u0022 Boris sighed heavily. Igor nodded, rose, and saluted smartly. He did not wait for the senior Kerbal to return the salute, but pivoted on his heel and withdrew, silent but for the creaking floorboards. Boris listened to him depart, staring off towards the valley. At length he stood, and took a long, final drag on his rattail, now down to a nub. He plucked it from his mouth and held it before him, turning it back and forth in his stubby, callused fingers, holding in the acrid smoke. Finally he flicked it away, watched it arc through the air and land in the snow, which retreated out of revulsion.\n\nHe blew the smoke out in an ominous cloud, \u0022D\u0414.\u0022 For a time he stood motionless, hands clasped behind his back again, staring at nothing.\n\n*\u042C\u0424\u042FSCHT*, he thought, *D\u0414.*\n\n\u0022D\u0414...\u0022 he said to the wind.\n\nSlowly, a trembling sneer grew on his lip, the trembling then spreading over his entire body.\n\n\u0022P\u0426TI\u0419\u0022 he swore roughly, spat, and then stormed off.\n\nSnow swirled as the wind whispered indifferently.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-27T08:21:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2018 08:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T11:54:38Z","Content":"**Chapter 1: A Clear Night**\n\nValentina Kerman pulled her heavy coat tight against the uncaring wind. She walked quickly on, ignoring it, across the complex. The cold never bothered her much anyway. Despite the multitude of lights, the stars shown brightly overhead on this crystal clear night. She looked up at them as she walked, reminded of the frigid, sparkling winter nights back home on the taiga. How many times had she stared up at them, the cold biting at her face, as they seemed to beckon and whisper? As long as she could remember, she dreamed of being up there, in that immaculate lucidity. How many times had she stood there, oblivious to the snow up to her waist, reaching and dreaming until her old gran-*deda*--?\n\n\u0022Comrade Pilot!\u0022\n\nValentina jerked back to the present, returning a tepid salute to the surprised young technician as she walked past. The facility was nearly deserted at this hour, but Kerbals could still be found here and there, going about some important task on this unseasonably cold spring night. She tried to keep to the shadows as she moved, the technicians wouldn\u0027t say anything, but she needed to avoid--\n\n\u0022Comrade Pilot!\u0022\n\nShe gave another listless salute. She still found it odd that they looked at her with such awe. If only they knew... She looked up at the brilliant stars again. It wouldn\u0027t be long now. Two more days. She just had to get through tomorrow. She hated such politics. Get through tomorrow, and then it was just the automatic actions of a well-trained pilot. Then, she would bring respect and an honorific to her family. Just get past the political--\n\n\u0022Comrade Pilot.\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419*.\n\nSpeaking of politics...\n\n\u0022Comrade Political Officer,\u0022 she saluted smartly this time, \u0022it is late for you to be about.\u0022\n\n\u0022One might say the same of you, Comrade Pilot,\u0022 he smiled a wide smile that did not touch his eyes, \u0022with respect, papers, please.\u0022\n\nShe held his gaze and resisted the urge to roll her eyes as she handed him her small document wallet. The other Kerbal took it, produced a tiny flashlight, and meticulously looked over the myriad of paperwork.\n\n\u0022As expected, Comrade, all is in order,\u0022 he said as he handed the wallet back to her with that cold smile, \u0022there is a chill in the air tonight. Do keep warm.\u0022\n\nShe saluted again. He returned it, turned and left, saying before he did, \u0022glory to Arsotzka.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked. That was an odd thing to say. She sighed and walked on, hearing somewhere off behind her, \u0022Halt! You there! Papers, please!\u0022 She turned a corner, and there it was, looking helpless as a beached whale on its horizontal rail carrier. Her rocket. Her passage into space. She approached slowly and stared up at the multitude of engine nozzles in their protective covers. She would be the First.\n\nWell, not *the* first. That honor had already been claimed by another. No one had seen it coming. No one had expected it. The Foreigners had been the first to put a Kerbal into space. And not only into space. He had orbited the planet, opened his hatch, climbed out, and claimed the first spacewalk as well. Valentina began to climb the steep ladders up the scaffolding.\n\nIt had been an embarrassment to the Imperium the likes of which had not been seen in a generation, broadcast live over the air where not even they could conceal it. Funding to the overwhelmed Ussari space program had flowed freely since then. The Union would reclaim technological superiority at any cost. A race was beginning. A race to the heavens, and beyond. The Foreigners boasted loudly about their next planned launch. A second Kerbal in space before the Union had launched even one was unthinkable, and yet there it was, on the entertainment box, for the world to see. The Imperium had not even tried to suppress it. Valentina reached the platform at the top of the stairs.\n\nAnd then the accident. Live, on the entertainment box, for the world to see. Smoke, and confusion, and fire. So much fire. She knew the Kerbish language well enough to understand the announcer\u0027s pained and futile calls for help, before the screen went to static. It had been heart-wrenching to watch, even if they *were* strange foreigners. Everything had changed after that. And tomorrow...\n\nUgh, how she hated politics. She reached out, and touched the cold steel casing of the solid rocket motor. This was something she could understand. Valentina began to walk down the platform, along the flank of the massive rocket, running her stubby fingers along the painted steel. This, this was something *real*. She was to be First. She knew why she had been chosen.\n\nShe was the Best. Top of her class at the Imperial Air Force Academy. Thousands of hours flying the fastest things on wings at a ridiculously young age. She flew like the infamous Ussari winter: ice cold. No mistakes. She took to the theories of orbital mechanics naturally, could work out the equations in her head as if she could *see* the trajectories. She could run faster, climb higher, punch harder than any of her fellow Select. She had remained conscious for over a minute in the vacuum training chamber, had pulled eighteen G\u0027s in the centrifuge. But she knew this was not why she was chosen.\n\nShe was chosen because she was the smallest.\n\nThe other three Select were all small, but even Sergei stood centimeters over her. His ego, of course, was not so small. Valentina reached the tip of the rocket. Within the pointed nose cone and its launch escape tower, was her tiny, spherical pod. It was a simple matter of physics, really. This rocket would take her on a suborbital flight into space, but only just. Every gram saved on the pilot was another precious few meters of altitude. She would be little more than inert payload anyway. The Foreigner had flown his rocket all the way to orbit by his own hand. Valentina\u0027s rocket was completely unguided. It would rely on careful engineering and a natural gravity turn to bring her to space for just a few fleeting moments. It was the best--\n\n\u0022Valentina,\u0022 said an ominous voice behind her.\n\n\u0022P\u0426TI\u0419,\u0022 she said to the wind.\n\n\u0022Language!\u0022 the Voice scolded.\n\nThis time she did roll her eyes. She turned.\n\n\u0022Hello, Igor.\u0022\n\n\u0022Is late. You should not be about. Is important day tomorrow.\u0022 Igor simply towered over her. He towered over most Kerbals. He was built like a stone, and twice as stubborn. He probably ate them, too.\n\n\u0022Indeed. How do you expect me to sleep on a night such as this?\u0022\n\nIgor raised his eye... bulges, \u0022is great Valentina Kerman afraid of uniforms and handshakes?\u0022\n\n\u0022I would rather fly to space on the *outside* of this rocket.\u0022\n\nHe smiled... warmly. From some cavern in his heavy coat, he produced her wide-brimmed hat with the two small, gold stars marking her as a Lieutenant. He placed it gently on her head.\n\n\u0022Come. Is cold. If you catch death, I must see Kommissar. I do not like to see Kommissar.\u0022\n\nValentina sighed, and descended another steep staircase with him. Igor had a very dry sense of humor. He was also the only person she\u0027d ever known who spoke with an accent in his native language. She thought it must be all the rattails he smoked. That couldn\u0027t possibly be good for the brain.\n\nThe two walked in silence through the deserted complex. Above, the M\u00FCn now shown down with a sickly light. It had always made Valentina uncomfortable. She couldn\u0027t quite say why. She much preferred the darkness of a starry night to that insincere glow. Around them, the wind swirled and blew on.\n\nIt whispered troublingly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-14T00:57:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2015 12:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T16:01:57Z","Content":"Dun Dun Duuuuuun!"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T05:23:42Z","Content":"**Chapter 2: A New Dawn**\n\nDawn broke as clear as the night had been, the frigid wind replaced by a cool stillness. The sun, still hidden behind the mountains that ringed the valley, lit up their snow-covered peaks like flaming beacons. As indigo light slowly drained into the valley, Valentina Kerman stepped out onto the running track next to the fitness center. She breathed deeply as she did her morning stretches. The stillness of this place at dawn had always amazed her. Back home, in the taiga, dawn was a cacophony of sound as the wildlife that had survived the night boasted that fact to each other.\n\nShe began around the oval track at a leisurely jog, looking out at the facility. A good morning run would help to calm her nerves. None of the others would be up yet, the Kommissar had designated this a rest day of sorts, at least until... later. She sped up as the crisp morning air filled her lungs and her muscles warmed up. Yes, a nice, solitary run would be a good start to the day. Work out the stiffness from the plank-like--\n\n\u0022Valentina.\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419*.\n\n\u0022Sergei.\u0022\n\nHe came jogging up alongside her. Sergei Ilyich Kermanski. It was a minor honorific, but still more than she had, and granted to Sergei\u0027s family by the Imperium its self, for something his father had done during the Troubles. What exactly, he would never say, but never stopped reminding everyone of the rest.\n\n\u0022You are up early,\u0022 he said with his typical smirk.\n\n\u0022It seemed a good time for a run... alone.\u0022\n\nHe raised an eye... bulge, \u0022you have snuck away from your handler again, yes?\u0022\n\nOf all the pompous--! She kept her eyes ahead, \u0022he sleeps.\u0022\n\nSergei made a show of looking around, \u0022there is no one to disturb us, then? A race, perhaps?\u0022\n\n\u0022You always loose.\u0022\n\n\u0022Valentina, you wound me! I am wounded. Surely you are not one to shrink from such a challenge.\u0022\n\n*\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0419\u042DV*, there was just no avoiding it, \u0022very well.\u0022\n\n\u0022A lap, then? To the flag pole?,\u0022 the smirk bared teeth, \u0022Go!\u0022 He stepped into her and shoved, darting out ahead.\n\nSo typical. Valentina stumbled but managed to keep her footing. She charged onward, keeping pace just to the side and slightly behind Sergei. No sense making this any more unpleasant than it needed to be. The two plodded on, in their awkward, head-low, but surprisingly swift Kerbal gait. She could hear him grunting, straining to stay ahead. Good, let him exhaust himself. Valentina\u0027s own body was working like a precision-tuned aircraft, her foot-falls perfectly efficient, her breathing rapid but measured. Her timing must be flawless.\n\nThe pair rounded the final curve, heading back toward the unadorned flagpole in the center of the track.\n\n*Now!* \n\nValentina surged forward, digging into her reserves of strength, quickly closing the gap with Sergei. She saw the elbow coming. She grabbed, twisted, drawing a squeak from him, pirouetted and rebounded off, then passed out of his reach, passing the flagpole a moment later. She continued on for a moment before slowing, then turned, ready for...\n\nSergei was half a meter behind the line, red-faced and panting.\n\n\u0022You...cheat...!\u0022 He huffed.\n\n\u0022You elbow.\u0022\n\n\u0022An...accident!\u0022\n\n\u0022Unlikely.\u0022\n\n\u0022I...shall see...Kommissar!\u0022\n\nValentina grunted and rolled her eyes.\n\n\u0022If you ever actually *saw* the Kommissar, you would run away as fast as you could, just like anyone else,\u0022 she said, putting her hands on her hips, head cocked, \u0022and you would still be slower.\u0022\n\n\u0022Gah!\u0022 He blurted, balling his hands into fists and drawing himself up to his full, unimpressive height, \u0022I do not have to take such insult from a mere peasant girl!\u0022\n\nValentina narrowed her eyes. *That* stung.\n\n\u0022ST\u0414LI\u0419S\u041AI\u0423!\u0022 She took a step toward him.\n\n\u0022Kiss your mother with that mouth?\u0022 He smirked, \u0022oh. No, I guess you don\u0027t.\u0022\n\nThat was--! He was--! Even for him--! She bared teeth and prepared to charge.\n\nSuddenly, the brightening dawn dimmed. They both looked up.\n\n\u0022Ah, Comrade Igor,\u0022 Sergei said with a smug smile, \u0022your charge here was just about to--\u0022\n\nIgor lowered his massive head till it was a centimeter from Sergei\u0027s face, whose smile quickly faded.\n\n\u0022Break. You.\u0022 Igor said softly.\n\nSergei\u0027s eyes widened till they took up most of his face.\n\n\u0022Like. Egg.\u0022\n\nHe swallowed hard.\n\n\u0022You. Go. Now.\u0022\n\nSergei suddenly remembered some very pressing matter somewhere not there, and scuttled off. Igor straightened, and glowered.\n\n\u0022Valentina.\u0022\n\n\u0022But he... I...\u0022\n\nIgor sighed like a gale, \u0022is my job protect you. If you break Sergei, I laugh. But you not go to space. And I must see Kommissar.\u0022 He smiled, \u0022I do not like to see Kommissar.\u0022\n\nAs if finally deciding it was safe to come out, the sun hesitantly peeked over the mountains to the east. Warm light flooded the valley, and an unfamiliar sound. Valentina looked up, and beheld a strange sight. As a pilot, she knew aircraft. Even this one.\n\nThe Foreigner had arrived.\n\n\u0022Come,\u0022 said Igor grimly, \u0022is time.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-14T00:56:56Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2015 12:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**\n  \nmore P\u0426TI\u0419"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T06:58:15Z","Content":"I\u0027m liking Igor already. \n\nNot to mention the cussing. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"minepagan","CreatedById":132643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T22:02:57Z","Content":"LOL!

He was so *dashing!* Not at all what Valentina had been expecting. Of course, she wasn\u0027t quite sure *what* she\u0027d been expecting. She\u0027d never met a Foreigner before. No one had. The occasional exchange trainee from some far corner of the Union, perhaps, but none of them were so... foreign.\n\nThey milled about on the concrete apron not far from the launchpad, where her rocket had been erected earlier that day and was now draped proudly in the Great Flag of the Ussari Union. \u0022Her\u0022 rocket. It seemed like such an odd way to think about it, it belonged to the People of the Union after all, but never before had she had something so completely her own. Every dial, every gauge, she knew them better than her own face. Blindfolded, upside-down, and under water, she could operate every switch and locate every button not even by feel but by pure muscle memory. She knew her pod better than the engineers who built it by now, they still had to reference manuals and diagrams.\n\nValentina sighed and looked away. She would rather be up there now, training, than down here with... politics. The whole day had been handshakes and speeches about courage and sacrifice and awkward small talk. The Foreigner had brought a small cadre of comrades, and representatives from the Empress, the Imperium, the military, the Academy of Sciences, the design bureaus, the NKOTB, and all the Union Oblasts were in attendance. She\u0027d never seen a bigger group of people who really didn\u0027t want to be around each other. Off in a corner, a traditional Ussari band played traditional Ussari music. They had tried playing the music of the Foreigners for a time, until it was mutually agreed that continuing to do so might inadvertently trigger a war and the band should just stick to what it knew. And of course, the Political Officer, wandering through the crowd in his never-ending quest for papers. Strange, that he seemed to keep his distance from the Foreigners.\n\nAt least things were winding down now. The flow of awkward handshakes seemed to have tapered off. And come to think of it, she hadn\u0027t even seen--\n\n\u0022Valentina.\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419*.\n\n\u0022Sergei.\u0022\n\nShe kept her eyes forward as he sidled up next to her with his usual smug grin.\n\nHe nodded towards the Foreigner, off aways talking to the Premier of Nusad, \u0022\u0414\u0418\u0419\u0414 \u041A\u0424\u0426\u042F\u0418I\u041A\u0424V\u0414 D\u0424 SVID\u0414\u0419I\u0423\u0414 V\u0424D\u041A\u0414?\u0022\n\nWell that was a rude thing to say. Valentina kept her face neutral. What was Sergei up to?\n\n\u0022\u0418\u0423\u0417T?\u0022 He grinned, \u0022M\u0414\u042FI\u0414 SH\u0414\u042F\u0414P\u0424V\u0414 SP\u0414SI\u042C\u0414 ST\u0424LICH\u0418\u0414\u0423\u0414, D\u0414?\u0022\n\nHer eyes widened. Now that was uncalled for. She thought she\u0027d seen the Foreigner twitch, and... oh, no, he\u0027s coming this way! She took a sidestep away from Sergei.\n\nThe Foreigner stepped right up to Sergei with his perpetual, mischievous grin, that stood in such contrast to Sergei\u0027s smug smirk. \u0022Ah dunna believe we\u0027ve met, sir,\u0022 he said, extending his hand.\n\nSergei\u0027s smirk deepened, \u0022Kipitan Sergei Ilyich Kermanski of People\u0027s Imperious Crimson Air Force,\u0022 and he snapped a salute. The Foreigner stood there grinning, his hand still outstretched. Sergei let it hang well into awkwardness before slowly lowering his own hand and taking the Foreigner\u0027s.\n\nWhich was followed immediately by a soft, wet, crackling sound.\n\nSergei suddenly stiffened, eyes wide, smirk gone.\n\nThe grin never left but something subtle changed in the Foreigner\u0027s eyes, \u0022and you know bloody well who Ah am b\u0027now. Ah dunna care a RatSquirrelFish\u0027s fluffy wet behind what y\u0027say of me, but Ah\u0027ll have y\u0027know m\u0027mum was a damn fine lady, rest her soul, and Ah\u0027ll not have her spoken ill of in m\u0027presence. So if\u0027n Ah hear any such as that out of you again, then international relations be damned, and Ah\u0027ll be obliged to show you y\u0027r own elbow.\u0022\n\nValentina clapped a hand to her mouth to stifle a giggle.\n\nHe gave Sergei\u0027s hand a single, brisk shake, eliciting another squeak as something popped, then released it. He turned to Valentina, the mirth back in his eyes.\n\nThe Foreigner tipped a non-existent hat to her, \u0022and once again, a *great* pleasure to have met you, Luftennant, and the *best* of luck tomorrow.\u0022 And with that, he was gone.\n\nThe other two Kerbals stood silently for a moment, shaded from the spring sun by their wide-brimmed hats, one with his hand still hanging in the air, fingers bent into headache-inducing forms, twitching slightly.\n\n\u0022Did you not know?\u0022 Valentina finally asked, looking off towards the Foreigner. Sergei stood perfectly still, other than his twitching, but his huge eyes slowly moved to her.\n\n\u0022The gentleman speaks fluent Ussari. Quite well for one not born to the tongue.\u0022\n\nSergei\u0027s eyes crept forward again. Then he slowly turned on his heel, and walked stiffly off, his hand still sticking out in front of him.\n\nValentina folded her hands behind her back and looked around the crowd once more. Other than Sergei, everyone seemed to be getting along quite well, for people who weren\u0027t supposed to like each other. Were these really the untrustworthy adversaries? Only months ago, this place, built in a deep pit, dug out of a hidden valley, surrounded by impassable mountains, in the middle of inhospitable steppe, had been the most closely guarded secret in the Union. Now the very people it was most to be kept secret from were wandering about looking at everything. She looked again toward the Foreigner, having a very animated conversation with an adjunct from Abvonovichatkaderivokistan, though she was quite sure neither spoke the other\u0027s language, and finally saw a friendly face coming her way.\n\n\u0022Have you ever seen hair like that on a person? Why, it doesn\u0027t even look real, and yet it is.\u0022\n\n\u0022They are strange people,\u0022 said Valentina.\n\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 said Dibella Kermanov, smiling. Like Sergei, she was the progeny of a respected Imperium official, but quite decent despite that.\n\n\u0022Here, try this,\u0022 she said, handing Valentina a cup of dark, steaming liquid.\n\nValentina grimaced at the smell, but took a small sip anyway. And immediately wished she hadn\u0027t.\n\n\u0022Remember where you are,\u0022 Dibella said with a wry grin.\n\nWith difficulty, Valentina choked the bitter stuff down without gagging or spitting, \u0022gah, tastes like rocket nozzle!\u0022\n\n\u0022Quite. It\u0027s a drink the Foreigners have brought. They call it \u0027coffee.\u0027\u0022\n\nValentina stared at the cup of black fluid, \u0022they drink this? Willingly?\u0022\n\n\u0022It would seem. I am told, it is an acquired taste of sorts.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked. It was clear these Foreigners were not to be trifled with, \u0022surely, acquiring such a thing is an act of great will.\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 Dibella took a sip and grimaced, \u0022supposedly it\u0027s a motivator of some sort.\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414, I am very motivated to never touch it again!\u0022 Valentina said, her eyes wandering back towards her rocket in the distance.\n\nDibella followed her gaze, \u0022are you getting nervous?\u0022\n\n\u0022I do not get nervous.\u0022\n\n\u0022I do,\u0022 Dibella turned to look off towards the rocket, \u0022enough for two. Really, I am grateful. You get all the attention and notoriety and politics. No one will care about my flight. I can just focus on the science.\u0022\n\n\u0022That, or I could spontaneously explode.\u0022\n\nDibella gave her a look, \u0022I thought you didn\u0027t get nervous.\u0022\n\n\u0022I acknowledge risk.\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed. That is why you were chosen as the first pilot.\u0022\n\n\u0022We are hardly even pilots. The rocket is unguided, and even the attitude controls are locked out without the emergency override code.\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s simply a precaution. We might go mad up there, after all. No one knows.\u0022\n\n\u0022*He* seems normal enough,\u0022 Valentina nodded towards the Foreigner, who was now dancing the *prisyadka* with a rather bewildered-looking technician, \u0022well, mostly.\u0022\n\nDibella gave her a heavy-lidded look, \u0022I have my doubts.\u0022\n\n\u0022Sergei\u0027s flight has no such precaution.\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, we will know by then-- ahhhhhhhhh,\u0022 Dibella smirked and raised an eye... bulge, \u0022so that\u0027s what this is about.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked, \u0022what?\u0022\n\nDibella smiled warmly and took the other Kerbal by the elbow, \u0022Tia, even knowing you this fairly short time, I know that no one on this world wants to be up there more than you. No one deserves it more. You will get an orbital flight. And it will be longer than Sergei\u0027s. Or Tercella\u0027s. And you will do greater things. Remember, this is still just the beginning.\u0022\n\nValentina smiled, \u0022where is Tercella, anyway? I have not seen her since that third round of boring speeches.\u0022\n\nDibella rolled her eyes and then scanned the crowd, \u0022last I saw, she had that foreign engineer cornered. Or perhaps he had her? Anyway, they were discussing technical specifications on the new liquid engine.\u0022\n\nValentina frowned, \u0022the Political Officer--\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414, Comrade Pilot?\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419*.\n\nThe pair turned and saluted.\n\n\u0022Why, Comrade Political Officer,\u0022 said Dibella, \u0022\u0027tis a busy day for you, D\u0414?\u0022\n\nHe smiled his cold smile and threw his arms wide, \u0022\u0027tis a *glorious* day! Our poor, backwards rivals come to us in peace to behold the bounty of the great Ussari Union! We take our place as leaders in the great march forward, and look to a future of cooperation!\u0022\n\nThe two short Kerbals shared a look.\n\n\u0022Papers, please.\u0022\n\nThere were the usual automatic exchanges and shuffling.\n\n\u0022As expected, all is in order Comrades. Now that you mentioned Comrade Sergei, where is he?\u0022\n\nValentina looked at him innocently, \u0022he said he was going to see the flight surgeon. To give him a hand.\u0022\n\n\u0022He did?\u0022\n\n\u0022He did?!\u0022\n\n\u0022He did.\u0022\n\nThe Political Officer blinked with wide eyes.\n\n\u0022Well, then,\u0022 he scratched at his chin, \u0022that\u0027s quite... decent of him. \u201C He stood, looking very confused for a moment, which was a rarity in itself. Valentina desperately tried tried to keep a straight face, and Dibella narrowed her own eyes and looked at her. Finally, some distant act caught the Political Officer\u0027s eye, and the mirthless smile returned.\n\n\u0022I must investigate this matter further. Good day, Comrades, glory to Arstotzka!\u0022 He said, and stormed off.\n\nDibella and Valentina looked at each other, then shrugged.\n\n\u0022You there! Hiding beneath the table! Papers, please!\u0022\n\nDibella sighed, \u0022what a country,\u0022 took another sip of \u0027coffee,\u0027 and grimaced.\n\n\u0022Perhaps this would be better with some milk and sugar?\u0022 She said, \u0022come, let us find the teacart.\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLater that evening, long after the spring sun had set, Valentina Kerman plodded into her small room in the barracks, feeling completely spent. *This is no way to begin a historic space flight*, she thought. She didn\u0027t even bother turning the lights on, just collapsed onto her hard, narrow bed. She looked out the window towards her rocket across the facility, lit up by floodlights. She noted a scaffolding around the second stage now, and thought that odd at this hour, but any further contemplation was quickly cut off as she slipped into a troubled sleep.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-20T08:02:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2020 08:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**\n  \nP\u0426TI\u0419"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T15:14:52Z","Content":"No!

Only a few tiny, hesitant clouds crept slowly across the sky. It was a perfect day to fly. Valentina rose early, feeling very groggy and unsettled. She had a simple breakfast of *kasha* and tea while listening to the weather briefing at the flight center, then began her preparations and struggled into her bright orange pressure suit.\n\nIgor and Tercella met her there, the latter going over the pre-launch checklist with her as they climbed aboard the small, open-topped utility vehicle.\n\n\u0022Have you had your breakfast?\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\n\n\u0022Brushed your teeth?\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\n\n\u0022Bathed?\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\n\n\u0022Space-diaper?\u0022\n\n\u0022D--\u0022 Valentina shot her a look. Tercella was the bright, young daughter of a factory worker from St. Kermansburg far to the west, and nothing if not practical. And thorough.\n\n\u0022What?\u0022 She said innocuously, \u0022*P\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS*! It is on the damn list.\u0022\n\n\u0022Language!\u0022 Bellowed Igor as he started the engine.\n\n\u0022D\u0414,\u0022 said Valentina flatly.\n\n\u0022Survival kit?\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\n\n\u0022Flotation vest?\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414.\u0022\n\n\u0022Checked your seals...?\u0022\n\nIgor began slowly driving towards the launch tower, \u0022you ask many questions today.\u0022\n\n\u0022I am designated check pilot today, it is my job,\u0022 Tercella said tersely.\n\n\u0022D\u0414,\u0022 said Igor over his cliff-like shoulder, \u0022now I have for you. Why you so late returning to barracks last night?\u0022\n\nTercella glared at him, \u0022advancing diplomatic relations.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, and would your diplomacy involve a certain foreign engineer?\u0022 Valentina smirked.\n\nTercella went from glare to glower as the ute hit a bump, \u0022he has a brilliant mind. His theories on nuclear propulsion are revolutionary. And he has some serious misgivings about the new ethanol-fueled engine for the orbital flights.\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s smirk grew, \u0022is that so?\u0022\n\n\u0022A doctorate-level engineer, trained as a kerbonaut. Imagine that! Have the people who design the ships, fly them, why cannot...\u0022\n\nValentina raised an eye... bulge, \u0022sounds like someone has made a friend.\u0022\n\n\u0022*P\u0426TI\u0419*!\u0022 Tercella was nearly shaking.\n\n\u0022*Language*, Tercella!\u0022\n\n\u0022Certainly not! He\u0027s crude, obnoxious, short-tempered, and swears like a farm hand!\u0022\n\nValentina raised the other one.\n\n\u0022*\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0418\u042DV* on you!\u0022\n\n\u0022Language!!\u0022 Igor nearly shrieked.\n\nTercella stuck her tongue out at him.\n\nIgor sighed, \u0022I not getting paid enough for this.\u0022\n\n\u0022We are Imperiousists, we do not get paid at all.\u0022 She said flatly.\n\nValentina giggled all the way to the launch pad. It helped to drown out the butterflies in her gut.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe three pulled up to an odd greeting party of sorts at the base of the crew access tower. A dozen white-clad technicians stood rigidly, lining the short path to the elevator.\n\n\u0022Comrade Pilot!\u0022 The first one snapped a salute as Valentina approached.\n\n\u0022Comrade Pilot!\u0022\n\n\u0022Comrade Pilot!\u0022\n\nValentina proceeded down the line, receiving each nervous and excited hail, Igor and Tercella following closely. Igor\u0027s eyes darted about suspiciously, even for him. As she reached the elevator, the final technician gave his salute, then they dispersed to their various tasks.\n\nTercella turned to her, \u0022well, this is really it. Good luck. Fly safe.\u0022\n\nValentina smiled, \u0022thank you. D\u0424--\n\n\u0022--\u0424o not say it,\u0022 Tercella held up a finger, \u0022I *will* see you back here tonight. If you die, I will kill you.\u0022\n\nValentina waved as she and Igor rode the simple elevator to the access arm. She gasped as it reached the top, and a figure limped toward her.\n\n\u0022Comrade Director?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Valentina!\u0022 He clapped her gently on the shoulders, \u0022it is a momentous day! I wanted to perform the final checks and see you off personally.\u0022\n\n\u0022I.., ah, this is an unexpected honor, Comrade...\u0022 She stammered.\n\n\u0022*P\u0426TI\u0419* to such formalities!\u0022 Igor opened his mouth, but closed it quickly at a look from the Director, \u0022that is for the Kommissar!\u0022 He put a hand lightly on her shoulder and led her towards the waiting pod, \u0022please, you must dine with me tonight after your official debriefing, I want to hear every detail!\u0022\n\n\u0022Ah... of course, Comrade,\u0022 she said abashedly.\n\n\u0022*Zdorovo*!\u0022 The Director exclaimed, \u0022Mikhail here will get you prepared, I will bolt the hatch myself. Nothing will be amiss today!\u0022\n\nValentina nodded, then squeezed through the hatch into the tiny, spherical pod she knew so well. Then came the laborious process of connecting the myriad of hoses and cables, with the technician\u0027s help, Igor keeping a close watch the entire time.\n\nEventually she fiddled the cloth cap with her communications equipment over her head, \u0022comm check. Control, this is *Kedr,* how do you read?\u0022\n\n\u0022This is control, reading you loud and clear *Kedr*,\u0022 said a familiar voice.\n\n\u0022Dibella? Is that you? Where is Sergei?\u0022\n\n\u0022Sergei is... indisposed,\u0022 came the smiling reply, \u0022I will be capcom for the day.\u0022\n\n\u0022Sergei smash hand in door, very sad,\u0022 said Igor from the open hatch, \u0022is bruised and swollen, look like eggplant. Doctor say he fine in few days.\u0022\n\nValentina smiled. Well, this was a pleasant development. She\u0027d been expecting to have to hear Sergei all day.\n\n\u0022The countdown has crossed one hour to launch, *Kedr*.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Kedr* copies, Control.\u0022\n\nAt last Mikhail stopped fooling with the connections, gave her a thumbs-up, and backed out of the pod.\n\nIgor\u0027s ham-like head replaced him. He looked grim.\n\n\u0022You come back tonight, please. If you not come back, I must see Kommissar,\u0022 then he smiled, \u0022I do not like to see Kommissar.\u0022\n\nValentina smiled back, \u0022I will come back, I promise. D\u0424 SVID\u0414\u0418I\u0423\u0414, Igor.\u0022 She raised a hand. As he took it in his own massive pair, she felt him press something into her palm.\n\n\u0022To watch over you,\u0022 he said, and winked, which looked very disturbing on his huge face. Then Igor, too, was gone. Valentina looked at the item in her hands. It was a bit of colored paper, folded skillfully into the shape of a bird. She thought it an odd thing, coming from Igor of all people. She clipped it to a checklist on the instrument panel.\n\n\u0022All set then? It\u0027s time,\u0022 said Director Kermanev from the hatch. She gave a thumbs-up. He smiled, \u0022tonight, we dine.\u0022\n\nThen the hatch banged shut, making Valentina jump. The scrabbling and muffled voices outside as the hatch was bolted shut brought the whisp of a memory to the back of her mind. As she reached, it seemed to drift farther, like a star so dim she could only see it from the corner of her eye; if looked at directly, it vanished. She sighed, and pushed it away. One thing she *was* sure of, that hatch had slammed closed with all the finality of a tomb.\n\nSuddenly, Valentina Kerman felt very alone.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-20T08:10:39Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2020 08:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T05:56:10Z","Content":"Udachi, Comrade Pilot... udachi."},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T04:32:50Z","Content":"Might\u0027ve overdone the Papers Please reference a bit there, but otherwise, I love it."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T05:45:48Z","Content":"Heh - I facepalmed when I finally figured that reference out.

One pull would send her pod shooting away from a failing rocket.\n\nIn theory.\n\nWith no way to shut down the five huge solid rocket engines below once they were lit, she had her doubts about the abort system\u0027s ability to out-run them. Sure, she\u0027d been over all the test data, been heavily involved in the test program, even, but--\n\nShe stopped.\n\n*Am... am I nervous?* She thought, *that is ridiculous, I do not get nervous. I have landed half an airplane on a damp sponge before, why would I be--*\n\nShe stopped again. Not nervous, just nerves. Nerves, that\u0027s all. Nothing to do now but listen to the mission control chatter and flick the occasional switch. She looked over the expansive instrument panel before her, covered in an obscene amount of switches, knobs, and lights. She knew each one by heart, by feel, by simple spacial awareness. Then she looked to the control panel to her left. All the *important* things, covered by a piece of plastic locked by an override code she wasn\u0027t trusted with.\n\nValentina frowned. There was a tool kit under her couch. The plastic was pretty flimsy, maybe she could pry it up. There was a screwdriver in the kit. But that would hardly be professional. Still probably wouldn\u0027t work without the code. Maybe she could--\n\nShe snapped her head to the right and looked straight into the horrible face of... the breaker panel? Valentina realized she\u0027d been holding her breath. For a moment... just a moment... she could have sworn she heard--\n\n\u0022Say again, *Kedr*, did not copy that.\u0022\n\nHad she said something?\n\n\u0022Ah... disregard, control.... must have jostled the mic...\u0022\n\n\u0022Understood, *Kedr*, countdown is proceeding normally, thirty minutes to launch.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Kedr* copies.\u0022\n\nJust her mind playing tricks, that\u0027s all. Still, that was unusual. Growing up in the taiga, you never let your mind play tricks on you. There were plenty of hungry things trying to do that already. Her *deda* had taught her that when she was very little, one of the very first things she remembered. Everything before that was... fuzzy. She sighed and looked out of the small window in front of her, seeing nothing but the inside of the protective nosecone covering her capsule. Soon, through that window, she would be the first of her people to see her planet from above the atmosphere... and only the second person ever. She should be brimming with excitement. Why on Kerbin did she feel like--\n\nValentina snapped her head left, seeing only more indicators. She\u0027d been holding her breath again. She *knew* she\u0027d heard--\n\n\u0022Say again, *Kedr*, did not copy. Your heart rate\u0027s up, are you all right?\u0022\n\n\u0022Must have bumped the mic again. I am well, just excitement building,\u0022 she lied.\n\n\u0022Copy that. Final clearance has been received, ten minutes to launch.\u0022\n\n*Ten minutes*? The thirty minute call was only moments ago, wasn\u0027t it? Had she been in a fog that long? For a moment, Valentina thought of calling a scrub to the launch right there... but no, not when they were so close, not over some little preflight jitters. This will be a *Great* Day, and only the first of many. She grabbed a checklist and went through it once more.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u0022*Kedr*, control, five minutes to launch. Terminal countdown has commenced.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Kedr* copies, final gyro synch complete.\u0022 As Valentina had hoped, the nerves began to abate as the clock ticked down. Just well-practiced, automatic actions now. No room for thought.\n\n\u0022Four minutes, beginning startup sequence, pre-ignition heaters running.\u0022\n\nIt all came down to this. All the hours of training, the exhaustion, even the damn politics.\n\n\u0022Three minutes, close your visor, verify bleed valve status, Kedr.\u0022\n\nValentina closed and locked her helmet visor, sealing out the last of the sound from the cabin. Nothing but her own breathing, now amplified off the thin plexiglass. It was time.\n\n\u0022Down and locked, cabin bleed valve to flight dump, safeties locked.\u0022\n\n\u0022Two minutes to launch, *Kedr* now running on internal power, clear umbilicals.\u0022\n\nShe threw the final few switches, and again looked out the window at the featureless nosecone wall. Nothing left to do but wait.\n\n\u0022One minute, launch key in, all systems go!\u0022\n\nShe crossed her arms over her narrow chest and grabbed the straps on her harness, scrunching into her launch couch, and fixed her eyes on the gauges. Finally, this was it. Everything would be different now. The fulfillment of a dream, but more importantly, honor and respect for her family, so long departed. And perhaps... even atonement. Then why did she feel--\n\n*\u0022Dven\u00E1dtstat...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Od\u00EDnnadstat...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022D\u00E9syat...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022D\u00E9vyat...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022V\u00F3sem...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Sem...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Shest...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Pyat...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Chet\u00EDreh...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Tree...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Dva...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Od\u00E9en...\u0022*\n\nWait, what was--\n\n\u0022Ignition!\u0022\n\nThe whole world became Sound.\n\nIt was everywhere, everything. Sound filled reality with empyrean ubiquity. She could feel it, smell it, *P\u0426TI\u0419*, she could *taste* it! It was far beyond pain or pressure, it was like sentience from her very *bones*. A memory drifted up, but was quickly scattered by the sheer power. For a moment, she thought the rocket had simply exploded, then acceleration slammed her deep into her couch and the gauges came alive.\n\n\u0022*Kedr* has cleared the tower!\u0022 There were cheers and whoops in the background.\n\n\u0022*Poyekhali!*\u0022 Valentina squealed, completely overwhelmed by the moment.\n\n\u0022Control reads *Strannik-\u0411\u02DC* is stabilizing, how do you read *Kedr*?\u0022\n\n\u0022I am receiving you, I am well,\u0022 she tried to drag her focus back to the mission, \u0022the noise is truly incredible.\u0022\n\nAcceleration and vibration were already rising. The 2.6 gees at ignition soon climbed past three as the rocket slowly pitched over with gravity. Three large, sudden jolts caused a hurried scan of the instruments.\n\n\u0022*Kedr* is on course... deviation within limits... getting bumpy up here...\u0022\n\n\u0022We copy that, *Kedr*, confirm telemetry is good, you are still on course.\u0022\n\nAcceleration rose past four gees now, edging into the unpleasant. The tiny cabin was shaking so much Valentina could barely see the gauges, with the worst still yet to come. She gritted her teeth and shifted in the couch.\n\n\u0022*Kedr*, check your indicator, we read your course drifting northward.\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414, I see it,\u0022 the vector was wandering off its target, slowly pulling the rocket\u0027s trajectory away from the intended landing zone.\n\n\u0022Guidance is suggesting you abort. It doesn\u0027t appear to be improving.\u0022\n\nValentina eyed the large, red abort handle on the panel. Three more sharp jolts rocked the capsule. Then she looked at the map ball and did a quick mental calculation.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s still within the secondary landing zone. We\u0027ve come too far to panic over a mild course deviation, I say we continue. Maybe it will settle out after booster separation.\u0022\n\nThere was an agonizingly long pause while she waited for a response from mission control. Gee force was now edging over the five mark on the gauge.\n\n\u0022Control concurs,\u0022 came Dibella\u0027s relieved voice. We will monitor, and respond as needed. Thirty seconds to booster sep.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Kedr* copies.\u0022\n\nValentina knew they would be the longest thirty seconds of the short flight. As the engines grew ever more powerful in the rapidly thinning air and the ship grew ever ever lighter as the propellant was burned away, it accelerated faster and faster. Valentina could no longer make out the instruments from the violent shaking.\n\nBut she knew the feeling well enough from centrifuge training.\n\nFive and a half gees... now six...\n\nThree more jolts. Then a fourth.\n\nSomething went red on the warning panel. She couldn\u0027t tell what it was.\n\nSeven gees... instinctively, she started grunt-breathing, desperately trying to keep oxygenated blood in her brain.\n\nSeven and a half...\n\nEight...\n\nEight and a half...\n\nDarkness began closing in at the edges of her vision.\n\nThe ship was coming apart.\n\nA ragged shimmy back and forth... and the punishing acceleration died away. The sound and shaking dropped to a low rumble. Valentina blinked back into reality.\n\n\u0022*Kedr*, respond, do you copy? *Kedr*, do you copy?\u0022\n\n\u0022Control, *Kedr*, I am here. Staging is good, core stage has ignited.\u0022\n\n\u0022Control copies staging. Thought we\u0027d lost you for a moment there. You had a bunch of people about turn blue, we\u0027re breathing again.\u0022\n\nHad she actually blacked out? She hadn\u0027t thought so. \u0022Core stage is much smoother. More of a push now. Course has stabilized, still off to the north. All systems are green.\u0022\n\n\u0022Control concurs. That should have been the worst of it, two minutes to core staging.\u0022\n\nThe rocket clawed higher and higher, though its course was now more horizontal than vertical. Valentina again wished for some sort of window in the nosecone. All she had were instruments to know the outside world. And they were now telling her she was already traveling higher and faster than anyone before. Well, anyone but *him*. At least the flight had smoothed out. The next two minutes passed uneventfully, the core solid motor performing exactly as expected. The final stage would be milder still, specially de-tuned for a slow, easy push out of the atmosphere and into space.\n\n\u0022Approaching final staging, *Kedr*, set comm array to mode three.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Kedr* copies, mode three.\u0022\n\n\u0022Relay acquisition is good, staging in *tree... dva... od\u00E9en*... mark.\u0022\n\nJust a *thump* this time. The mounting acceleration dropped once more, sound dying to a distant rush.\n\n\u0022Staging is good... final stage reads nominal.\u0022\n\n\u0022Control concurs, *Kedr*, standby to switch... ah *Kedr* check your vector we read your course deviating.\u0022\n\nValentina checked the gauge. The vector was drifting northwards again. The dull rumble seemed to be rising quickly.\n\n\u0022I read the same.\u0022\n\n\u0022This isn\u0027t looking good. Telemetry is showing multiple channels off spec. Try resetting... channel... buss... sxkkvvzz\u0022\n\nShe checked the breaker panel. Why was it getting hard to move?\n\n\u0022Say again control, did not copy.\u0022\n\n\u0022Telem... set... cxkgyzzz\u0022\n\n\u0022Say again, did not copy, say again.\u0022 She reset the comm switch, tried a different antenna, then noticed the gee meter. Four gees, rising faster than ever before. Far beyond what this motor should be producing.\n\nP\u0426TI\u0419!\n\nThe course vector was deflecting farther and farther, pushing the craft off to the north.\n\n\u0022Control, *Kedr*, do you read? Control?!\u0022 Nothing this time, not even static. Standard procedure was clear, here.\n\nAbort the mission.\n\nValentina steeled herself and strained for the abort handle on the panel before her. Her gloved fingers stopped a centimeter away. She pushed again, struggling against the acceleration making her arm feel heavier and heavier. It was just out of reach! Gritting her teeth and snarling she surged at it once more, her fingers just brushing the edge, then with her last ounce of strength...\n\nLowered her arm with as much control as she could muster, knowing if she just let it drop her bones would shatter. Too late, the abort motor couldn\u0027t pull against this kind of acceleration anyway.\n\nSix... seven... eight gees...\n\nOne by one red lights blinked on all over the warning panel, then something exploded in a hail of sparks.\n\nNine gees... now ten... now eleven...\n\nEven grunt breathing couldn\u0027t help now. This shouldn\u0027t be possible! Darkness danced at the edge of her vision once more, she could feel her bones pressing through her flesh, her eyeballs distorting and blurring.\n\nTwelve... *thirteen*...\n\nThe capsule creaked and groaned. Something else exploded. The tiny window cracked and shattered, the air rushing out in an instant.\n\nDarkness closed in, narrowing her vision to a point.\n\nFourteen... fifteen... then the gauge exploded.\n\nSparks cascaded across the panels, the cabin lights flickered and burst, and the darkness took her.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-07T05:39:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2016 05:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T03:25:29Z","Content":"**Chapter 6: Into Darkness**\n\nValentina Kerman was bathed in brilliant, warm, penetrating light. She could hear... something. All around, faces... familiar faces... soft and indistinct. She felt like she was floating.\n\n*Am... am I... dead?*\n\nBright... so bright...\n\nShe raised a hand against the blinding brilliance.\n\nAnd blinked.\n\nPure, unfiltered sunlight streamed in through the hole in the cabin where the window had been. A steel washer floated weightlessly by. Slowly, the sun drifted past the edge, and the capsule was plunged back into darkness.\n\n*No, I am... I am in space!*\n\nDisoriented, she checked her suit display... still holding pressure, backup power on. The nosecone must have decoupled! What on Kerbin had just happened? Light from the window drew her attention again...\n\nThen all... conscious... thought... ceased.\n\nThe curve of Kerbin passed into view as the ship slowly tumbled. The fuzzy line of the atmosphere gently gave way to the patchwork of vivid blues, greens, and whites spread out below like a map. Valentina could see the ocean. She had never seen the ocean before. Deep blue faded to rich turquoise dusted by frail white clouds. She could see sunlight glinting off of individual waves. As the pod turned, here and there were criss-crossing trails of white within the thinner clouds, converging at the land. She realized these were ship tracks from the busy port city of Kerbelsk.\n\nThe city now came into view, and Valentina could see the maze of roads... the long, thin, black smudges of smoke from the factories... the port its self... even individual ships, all with incredible clarity and detail. She saw the railroad tracks, snaking throughout the city and then concentrating beyond the city to the east, merging into the Great Trans-Kerberian Rail Road. She could see the scar it made for leagues and leagues as it cut through the dense taiga forest, and huge, kilometer-long trains headed by more smudges of smoke as they went along.\n\nTo the north, the green of the forest diffused into the white of the tundra like a line of battle. The pod tumbled on, and the entire great breadth of Ussari spread out before her further east, taking up the entire horizon as the opposite curve of Kerbin drifted into view, with the stark blackness of space beyond.\n\nThen the M\u00FCn wandered into view, and suddenly filled her with an inexpressible terror that jolted her back to reality.\n\nShe shouldn\u0027t be seeing this. She shouldn\u0027t be seeing *any* of this. She was much too far north!\n\nInstinct came roaring back, and Valentina desperately tried to restore power. Main buss A, dead. Main buss B, undervolt. Cross feed from aux batteries, switch the breaker, and... there!\n\nA single bulb flickered weakly to life, casting a dim yellow in the cabin. Debris floated everywhere. Quickly, cautiously, she reset the circuit breakers for the most important systems. The map gauge confirmed she was far off course to the north, heading towards the frigid North Yaltik Sea. She had to fire the retro rocket pack and land before she reached it. The pod could land in the water, but the nearly freezing water would kill her in minutes if she landed there. With that gaping hole, the capsule would sink like a stone.\n\n\u0022Control, this is *Kedr*, do you read?\u0022\n\nNothing.\n\n\u0022Control, *Kedr*, do you copy?\u0022\n\nNot a sound. She couldn\u0027t be sure if the ship was even capable of transmitting. Or receiving. Or if the rest of it, and the retro pack, was there at all. She reached for the manual controls and--\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419*!\n\nThe lockout.\n\nShe couldn\u0027t fire the rockets, jettison the service module, or set attitude for reentry. Even if the automatic system still worked, without buss A there was no way to power it. In frustration, she slammed her fist against the plastic cover. It shattered, sending cascading about the cabin.\n\nBut as she knew, the controls still wouldn\u0027t work without the override code.\n\nDeep in the back of her mind, something leered and snickered in the shadows.\n\nShe was done for now, there was nothing--\n\nA small, colorful paper bird drifted past her faceplate.\n\nMouth agape, she gently reached out and plucked it from the airless vacuum. Gingerly, awkward with her thick gloves, she unfolded it. The words \u0022override code\u0022 in a certain heavy, deliberate script appeared.\n\n\u0022Igor, I could *kiss* you!\u0022 Valentina squealed to the instrument panel. She flipped the paper over, and stopped.\n\n12345.\n\nUnbelieving, she entered the code into the panel. The red light changed to green.\n\n\u0022Unbelievable, that is the kind of thing an idiot puts on his luggage!\u0022 She said aloud as she manually powered up the controls.\n\nQuickly, must act quickly. Need retrograde attitude first, 34 degrees nose down.\n\nShe hit the button to fire an attitude control thruster.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nShe hit it again.\n\nNothing.\n\nDeep in her mind, something snickered again and eyes pierced out of the shadows.\n\nShe pressed it and held. Still nothing. Had she set the power correctly? Were the right valves on? Maybe--\n\nShe felt the ship move.\n\nShe tried another button, pressed, held... after an eternity, the ship moved the other way.\n\n*The firing is delayed! It wasn\u0027t like this in the simulator!*\n\nWith agonizing lethargy, she brought the capsule around to the right attitude and stabilized it. She wasted no time hitting the sequence of switches to fire the engine. After a heartbeat of eons, she finally felt the push as it fired.\n\nShe hoped it would be enough. If the altimeter was working, she was already dipping back into the atmosphere. The tiny engine fired on and on. She willed it to go faster. This wasn\u0027t the right attitude for reentry. With the service module in place, the capsule would eventually flip around nose-first, even with the attitude thrusters, pointing the parachute pack directly into the fiery plasma.\n\n\u0022Come on, come on, faster!\u0022 Valentina yelled at the ship.\n\nFinally she felt the push cease, and saw the light on the console go from yellow to red. Slowly, ever so slowly, she brought the ship to the proper reentry attitude. She switched off the safeties and fired the decoupler. A slight bump, and the console lights changed again. There, now the ship should be stable, just have to hope the heat shield--\n\nThere was a tremendous jolt, and the craft started oscillating wildly. The view in the window began rushing around, the push of acceleration returned, and the Thing in the back of her mind cackled with glee.\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419! ST\u0414LI\u0418! **\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0419\u042DV**!*\n\nIn her haste she\u0027d mixed up the procedure. The module should have been detached before changing attitude! Now it must be jammed against the bottom of the capsule by the force of air rushing against it. She looked at her horizon gauge, spinning around and around. It was canted off to the side, too, the pod made unstable by the mass pressed against it. Gee force pushed her deeper and deeper into her couch as the pod plunged into the thickening atmosphere.\n\nShuddering and shaking now returned as well, Valentina could see a dull orange glow through the hole in the hull. It grew brighter, whisps of superheated plasma and glowing bits of... *something* streaking past. Then in an instant, the capsule shifted, and now the plasma was *inside*, flailing and searching like a thing alive, incinerating anything it touched. The edges of the window-hole incandesced in red and orange. She was paralyzed by the crushing gee force as the Thing in the back of her mind paced rapidly back and forth like an anxious animal, giggling all the time.\n\nBut as quickly as the tempest had begun, it faded. The glow dissipated, the acceleration dwindled, and soon the pod was simply falling. Not willing to trust the altimeter any farther, Valentina hit the manual parachute release, and was relieved as the pod bucked back and forth beneath it. Eventually she felt the reassuring push as the canopies fully opened, the capsule slowed, and gently rocked on its lines. A loud *bang*, as the heat shield decoupled and fell away, then she hit the switch for the landing airbags.\n\nNothing.\n\nNo indicator light either way, no sound or motion. For all she knew they might not even be there anymore. It would be a hard landing. She strained, trying to see anything useful through the charred and blackened window-hole, but could see nothing but sky and clouds from this angle. She had no idea if she was even over land or--\n\nThe pod slammed into the water, only theoretically softer than solid ground. The impact knocked her senseless for a moment, water pouring in through the hole as the capsule bobbed and rolled in the waves.\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419!*\n\nThis, at least, Valentina had trained for. Not much time. She knew the parachute would quickly drag the pod under the water, even if it hadn\u0027t been flooding. Her timing must be perfect. Just before it did, it would roll over with the hatch pointing to the sky. She had to blow it then, up and out of the water and away from the ship, then climb out before the sea poured in.\n\nShe had to move quickly. The Thing in her mind bounded back and forth, slobbering and whimpering, still not daring to leave the shadows. Faceplate still down and locked, good. She closed her suit valves, unhooked the umbilicals, then unfastened her harness. The survival kit was under the couch, she would need the medical kit out of locker A3--\n\nThe hatch blew out.\n\nShe had just enough time to recognize that fact before the incoming torrent of water smashed her face into the instrument panel, and again darkness took her.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-13T08:25:00Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2019 08:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T03:57:22Z","Content":"**Chapter 7: Into the Light**\n\nDarkness.\n\nNothing but darkness.\n\nThick, crushing, suffocating.\n\nValentina started awake, consumed by a darkness so deep it stung her eyes.\n\n*Where am I?

Is this oblivion?*\n\nFocus...\n\nScratching... whispering... laughing...\n\nShouting... crashing... screams...\n\n*...must not open...*\n\n*...no matter what you hear...*\n\n*...must not open...*\n\n*Madness... this is what madness feels like... darkness... darkness forever... inky green darkness....*\n\nGreen...?\n\nShe blinked.\n\nThe darkness.... *changed*.\n\nShe blinked again.\n\nThere was a *difference*.\n\nThe darkness outside was tinged with green.\n\n*Panic* roared and howled in her mind. Her lungs begged for breath. A hallucination?\n\nNo, no the darkness *was* getting greener... getting *lighter*.\n\nFocus... a little more, just a little more...\n\n*Panic* thrashed and raged behind the Door. Another impact, a splinter flew off, wood crackled.\n\n*....must not open...*\n\n*....must not open...*\n\nAnd then, as the green grew lighter and lighter, enormous shapes materialized out of the gloom. They shifted, and turned, like living mountains. The strange noises grew louder.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nThe Door split down the middle.\n\n*...you must not...*\n\n*...you must not...*\n\nThe water grew ever greener, ever lighter. The huge forms moved, circled. Points of light reflected on waves. Her lungs burned, her muscles shrieked, her head throbbed. Darkness, like an old wound, began to close in at the edge of sight.\n\n*...in here! They\u0027re in here...!*\n\n*...you must not open...!*\n\n*...come quickly...!*\n\nThe Door shattered into a thousand shards. *Panic* burst through, all claws and teeth. It charged at her, jaws wide as an open tomb. She burst through the surface of the water into unimaginable brightness. Into the Light.\n\n*...help! They\u0027re in here...!*\n\n*...quickly...!*\n\n*...no matter what you hear, you must not open this door...!*\n\n*...but papa...*\n\n*Panic* was upon her.\n\nShe shoved her fist down its throat.\n\n*Panic* gagged.\n\n\u0022Not today,\u0022 she said into its wild, rolling eyes, \u0022today, I live.\u0022\n\nShe grabbed its spine from the inside, and broke its neck.\n\nFlailing, Valentina hung in the air for just a moment before splashing back into the water. She foundered, found the knob that inflated her neck dam, grabbed the catch and threw open her visor--\n\nAnd got a facefull of frigid seawater for her troubles. She floated there, gagging, coughing, heaving, but she was *breathing*. She was *alive*. She took a moment to just breath, bobbing amidst the rolling swells, but only a moment. She looked around... land! *There*, not far, just a few hundred meters--\n\nThe water in front of her exploded upwards in a jet of mist, then a monstrous, triangular fin broke the surface, easily four times her height and black as night. Another explosion to her right, followed by another huge fin. Then another, and another, dozens of them, swarming her, surrounding her. Bizarre sounds now filled the air, and an awful, low rumbling she could feel in her spine.\n\nThe water broke again, and a new form rose above the surface barely a meter away... and kept rising, and rising. Teeth. Cruel, serrated, blade-like teeth, each as big as her head filed past in a jagged line as the form kept rising, smooth black skin glistening in the failing sunlight. Then it stopped.\n\nValentina blinked.\n\nA tiny eye, no bigger than her own, winked back.\n\nThe colossal, conical head loomed over her like a building, like a planet. The eye stared.\n\n\u0022Well?\u0022 She yelled at it, \u0022come get me!\u0022\n\nThe eye stared impassively.\n\n\u0022Do you have any idea what I have been though today? I have been blown up, shot into space, crushed, battered, burned, shaken, and nearly drowned! And I. Have had. Enough! So come at me, fish! I break you!\u0022\n\nThe eye stared, with the patience of aeons.\n\nThe water lapped quietly against the enormous flank. Valentina pinched her eye... bulges. Then she reached out a hesitant hand. All over the skin were circular, grey scars. Her fingers brushed the smooth, rubbery hide. She felt it tremble at her touch. The eye blinked.\n\nThe calm was broken by that deafening, vibrating rumble she felt more than heard. The head then swiftly sank back below the waves, the rows of giant teeth sliding past at a horrifying pace.\n\nAnd then it was gone, and Valentina was alone among the rolling swells as the sun sank towards the horizon. With nothing else for it, she set off in the direction of shore.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSome time later, the sun now touching the waves, she took her first shaky steps up the beach, exhausted. For just a moment, she thought it was over, before a large wave slammed into her from behind and drove her face into the gravel. She crawled the rest of the way up the beach, coughing and gagging and shivering as the water swirled around her hands and knees. She finally reached an old, bleached log at the high tide line.\n\nShe pulled herself up it onto her elbows, and looked beyond. A dense forest of spruce and pine spread out before her, here and there the last stubborn patches of winter\u0027s snow clung to the shadows. Small furry things also clung to the shadows, eyeing her suspiciously and wondering if she was edible. Beyond the forest, a snow-covered mountain towered, lit up yellow and gold by the fading sun.\n\n\u0022I\u0027m... home?\u0022 Valentina said incredulously.\n\nWeariness was beginning to set it. With effort, she pulled herself up onto the log and looked out over the ocean. To the southwest, the sun was at last dipping below the sea, painting the horizon and clouds in brilliant red and crimson, while the deeper sky drifted from sapphire to indigo and into violet. It was truly--\n\nAn ominous, low buzzing just to her left drew her attention. She slowly turned her head, and looked into the thousand eyes eyes of the biggest mosquito she had ever seen. Its head was bigger than hers, ending in a half-meter long proboscis tipped by drooling, razor-sharp barbs. It rubbed its forelegs together in anticipation of its next succulent meal.\n\nValentina grunted in annoyance, grabbed the proboscis, twisted till it was pointed at the sky, and *pulled*. The head popped cleanly off.\n\nThe body felt at its neck-stump for a moment, as if not quite grasping what had just happened. Eventually it wandered off, seeming very confused.\n\nValentina sighed and looked down at the horrible insectoid visage in her hands. It was going to be a long, cold, weary night.\n\nOh well, at least now she had dinner.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-07T05:42:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2016 05:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T15:28:01Z","Content":"I crush you like baby!\n\nValentina = Heavy"},{"CreatedByName":"dbmorpher","CreatedById":77927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T15:18:54Z","Content":"On Kerbin mosquitoes are a meter long?"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T15:42:23Z","Content":"Yeah - on CatastrophicFailure\u0027s version of Kerbin, the kerbals developed spaceflight as a way of escaping from the local wildlife once and for all.
