Can we expect the update to release soon or much later? Squad hasn\u0027t given a bunch of answers on this but it would be nice to know something that we don\u0027t already know about the update since we\u0027ve been waiting awhile. Tell us something good about the progress being made. Is it close to being released? Maybe even give a time frame of when we can expect the update. There hasn\u0027t been any real good news about the console update other than they\u0027re working on it, and something would be better than nothing. Hopefully Squad will take a look at this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbalmexican","CreatedById":175598,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-06T05:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hear you the game has the most bugs I have ever seen and I love the game but I can\u0027t deal with having to start all over again withmy designs that don\u0027t save because everything get wiped out and the update we were supposed to get that we didn\u0027t get only if xbox live would give me my money back I would take!!!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SleepyInsomniac","CreatedById":174215,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-06T07:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I agree. I could live with all of the other multitide of bugs in this game but not the file corruption. I would pay more for just that fix. Squad has said they will have a fix early this year but I\u0027m pretty sure the only thing coming out is an announcement of a future release of the new port attempt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erikinthebakery","CreatedById":166663,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-07T20:59:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure the new port attempt IS the file corruption fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
