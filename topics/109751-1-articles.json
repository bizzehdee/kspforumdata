Kerbals sliding 400ft on the Mun and accelerating the whole way while stretching and contorting wildly until they\u0027re going 100m/s and explode is... not?\n\nI\u0027d love to see a mod that just addresses some of what you\u0027d expect from EVA physics. E.g.:\n\n1. When a kerbal hits the ground they should not bounce nearly as high as they do.\n2. When a kerbal is sliding along terrain, they should be slowing down a lot more than they do.\n3. Kerbals recover their equilibrium mid-air after something like 10s without impact, and ~3s when on the ground and not moving. Personally I\u0027d just prefer this to be lower, but the ideal system would look at trauma from impact and tie that to disorientation time.\n4. Maybe have a difficulty setting for kerbal survivability from impact, just so that the hardcore guys can tweak it and everyone else can let kerbals bounce from upper atmo ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnyway, just an idea!"},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T08:44:56Z","Content":"Bumping for interest.  \n\nIs there any mod out there that tries to do something of this sort?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ser","CreatedById":104207,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T15:45:39Z","Content":"I\u0027m thinking about killing kerbals under some realistic conditions on impact, including those who are in a vessel. That\u0027s became more needed now when there is Kerbal Krash System mod that makes a part to deform instead of dying with a \u0022puff\u0022 sound on impact. That has a side effect of a pilot surviving an insane crash. So 4 is under research now."}]}
