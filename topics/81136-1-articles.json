I gamed this game for some time, got some insights and want to share them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you read the forums much? No it spoils my \u0027fresh\u0027 opinion, I will however do that a lot right after this topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you at least read the \u0027do not write this\u0027 topic? Yes, that I did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of what you mention is already in that topic - why did you mention it again? I think I\u0027m giving a slightly different outlook over these subjects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of these things are already in mods - why mention them here? I like mods but since career mode is a subject for some competition, I would like for mod content to be implemented into the maingame and its career balance to not keep asking myself \u0022Am I cheating career?\u0022 after activating yet another mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to suggestions as brief as possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA activity combined with craft inventory - applying and/or removing spacecraft elements via EVA. Most basic would be fuel lines and connection struts after docking to make orbit assembled craft less wobbly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterface option to equalize the amount of liquid in two tanks. Maybe needing an extra module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStructural capability to relink triple etc modules back into the triple etc adapter and or other symmetrical items like O shaped aircraft with a cargo hole in the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo of the above would benefit from ghost parts - i.e. virtual constructs that can only be occupied by their real counterparts for the sake of symmetry. That would allow to carry a spaceship from space to virtual construction dock, add ghost parts (with symmetry etc) then have kerbals on EVA replace these parts with their real counterparts from inventory - thus no need to implement any building tools into EVA - just fill the gap from inventory ability similar to repacking chutes. As for relinking triple and other items, it\u0027s just a case of different symmetry types and of the many ways to solve it is a ghost module similar to a subassembly, running extra checks on symmetry logic between its logical front side, back side and trying to apply middle module multiple times according to the symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast is science - what noob would I be without mentioning that. First I thought of prototype system - I.e. any way of making it necessary to go to place X to be able to open a tech tree part Y. Then I thought of it to be too linear and came up with prototype to upgrade system. Starting with psychology of what it is now - early flights and career must be a challenge, yet providing a minor freedom of choice of development, then switching to near creative mode after exploring a couple of nearby planets. How could we tweak science so that it doesn\u0027t break early challenges and yet gives some incentive to experiment above and beyond? My answer was upgrade system. Each item in tech tree would have 3 upgrades of 3 tiers. first would be power/speed of work/durability depending on module, second would be isp/energy usage/drag and last would be price or weight. Each tier of upgrade would give a part a 5% in approppriate field. How to program - we have a table of science data from experiments of all types, filling the bar (getting most data) for certain experiment would make the game check another table whether that instance holds an upgrade for any modules. If yes - yay, \u002B1 level of upgrades for new modules of this type (not retroactive). Table of upgrades could be either pre-written, random or semi random, i.e. aero related upgrades in atmospheres and/or 3 different levels of each 1 upgrade scattered between \u0027easy/close\u0027, \u0027avg\u0027 and \u0027hard/far\u0027 locations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPluses of my research suggestion - it does not mess up starting challenges too much because it takes much research for upgrades to really kick in. It does create at least a bit of an inspiration to do research trips after the tech tree is done with. It is not extremely hard to code most of it into existing structure as a side project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading, that was a fresh opinion of a gamer who played for some time without toying with forums or mods too much, on things he\u0027d like to see in unmodded game. That being said I already have mods to show center of RCS, docking port alignment and advanced navball and really think they make life more convenient, yet not too automated, which is what this post was about. Hope your time was not completely wasted.
