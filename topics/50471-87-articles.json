I assume that your file isnt RSS v6 safe? this is where i may need a touch of hand holding to explain it, seeing as its much like your post about changing the moon, which i was able to do fairly easily, what lines do i need to copy fron your cfg and paste into the current cfg? would it be from the \u0022SSColor32\u0022 line to the triple \u0022}\u0022 for each body?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this is alot to ask, still learning how these cfg files are put together. feel free to PM me if need be (like if your reply would be a text wall)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enote i dont use planet factory, if this will cause issues... I am unsure exactly what will be considered official when Nathan releases all the planets/moons/bodies (if he plans on adding them all) but i would really like the planets to look like what they represent, if its as simple as a few lines of text and some png files\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: i attempted to try this on my own with poor results, lol, the new moon works fine though. I think waiting on official releases may be safer for me when it comes to RSS, the setup is too easy to ruin without me really understanding it better.
