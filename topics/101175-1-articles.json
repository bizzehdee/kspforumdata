(The body that Dres is an analog of) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m suggesting is to add a similar spot, most likely as a new small biome, to Dres that can be seen from space. This would give a small point of interest that players could aim to investigate and I think would help add interest to a body that is regarded by most players as the most boring to visit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that the Kerbin system is not meant to be a 1:1 compared to our own system. For that reason I don\u0027t think it needs to be an exact imitation of the spot on Ceres (Most likely icy) It just needs to be an area that stands out noticeably compared to the rest of the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T21:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage, it\u0027s still unclear whether the bright spot on Ceres is an actual surface anomaly, or merely instrumentation error, so I think it\u0027s rather too soon to talk about adding something similar to Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T21:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure.
