The Orange line is quarter second rolling average. Black line is the trend 0.08 to 4 seconds, 4 to 51.08 seconds (800 kmh), 51.16 second to MaxQ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe yellow line below is the bump and rattle index, that is how much the quarter second average deviated from the half second average. The green line is the surge and puke index, that is how much the 1 second double filter average differed from the trend. Both are in g-forces\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is shown to Max Q 1). because they complete data makes it difficult to see the launch trend and 2) because I haven\u0027t finished analyzing the data after Max Q to MECO. The last bump before Max Q is pretty characteristic of the post-Max Q data, so I have to do some more filtering and better line fitting after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what are the points of the plot,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-2 to 0 seconds, TWR increases to 1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n0 to 4 seconds, TWR increases from 1 to 1.25 (acceleration is 2.5 m/s \u002B g) TWR increase is not linear, 1) because launch clamps remove downward force There is an immediate pulse of acceleration of about 0.1g (or greater because-). 2) second stage monitors forces that are buffered by the first stage structure and mass.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4 to 51 seconds, TWR increases from 1.25 to 1.68,\u00A0 acceleration rises according to 2.201 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E \u002B 0.0864t \u002B g therefore extrapolate that TWR (ideal, max, liftoff) was 1.22\u003Cbr\u003E\nat 51 second TWR drops to from 1.68 to 1.48 over a period no greater than 5/12ths of a second. The last moment of normality was at 51:08 seconds, during a quarter second period thrust dropped on average for the quarter second rolling average 1.2a per 1/12th second and stabilized at 51.2 seconds where it remained, the extrapolated drop in engines was 12% (88% thrust on power down).\u00A0 Note that if Falcon-9 had lost one engine, it could have still sustained this thrust at full throttle of remaining engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n51.1 to Mach 1 (1100 km/h) TWR increases from 1.48 to 1.56, the period is noted for a somewhat smoother ride and less surge and puke. Somewhere after this the accelerations become less predictable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMach 1 to Max Q - TWR increases from 1.56 to 1.60 and has nearly returned to pre-cut status.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter Max Q \u002B 100 kmh (1350 kmh) and at an altitude of about 12500 meters, rockets acceleration begins to slowly increase in rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
