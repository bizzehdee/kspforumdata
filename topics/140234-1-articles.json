I have a story, an art style and more that suddenly came to me. I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s an easy task making a video game, but I know what I am after.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been told that VG development is difficult before but it hasn\u0027t stopped me, what has stopped\u00A0me,\u00A0is my lack of knowledge. I\u0027m looking into a book that should help guide me through Unity (not the preferred game engine for this, but acceptable nonetheless), but I still feel there is a disconnect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor any of you who honestly know me on the forum, this may sound like a lie to grab pitiful attention, \u003Cstrong\u003Ebut it\u0027s not\u003C/strong\u003E- I was diagnosed with mild Autism very young and I struggled to pick up English. I spoke in\u00A0what my parents jokingly called, \u0022Klingon\u0022. I had my own language as a child with everything having a name and even being able to make commands in this made up language. (Point being) I struggled with English and I recently picked up another language and I struggled the same as I did with English. Coding, which is essential in game development, is just another language. I \u003Cstrong\u003Ewant \u003C/strong\u003Eto learn how to do programming and eventually become good enough to move onto another aspect of game design, but I just can\u0027t right now. I need help\u00A0as it\u0027s all too foreign and I feel I need a more\u00A0guiding hand to help sort through the mess that is coding.\u00A0So if anyone wants to help\u00A0me\u00A0bridge this gap, it would be \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egreatly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr if you simply want to let me drive the story and design it yourself, I\u0027d be good with that too \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0.

Just start writing the first code and try to get it to work. Following along with a video might be a good idea, until you know how the process of compiling/running code works and you can try to write your own. At first, it will be frustrating, but when you get over that first hurdle you will quickly be able to do more and more. Compile often to see what your code does (or does not do). Do not quit as soon as something does not work out, but try finding out what the issue is. Do not forget that a lot of people started where you are, and asked the same questions you did.
