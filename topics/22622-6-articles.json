I was wondering if you\u0027d have any interest in redoing the stock Structural Fuselage and add additional structural fuselages in different sizes and lengths. The Structural Fuselage doesn\u0027t really fit stock designs unless it\u0027s a spaceplane, but the part is nonetheless very useful. If it came in different sizes/lengths it\u0027d be even better.

The arcjets, I do use as they require lesspower hogging than resistojets. The radial engines I use less but they do have their place and they do come in handy. Since your pack is so small and well optimized, I see no reason to need to cut stuff out. Oh, and why on earth would I use the 2.5m inline RCS tank for a probe? Those monoprop engines have become a staple on my probes as they are made lighter and I don\u0027t need to do hour long circularization burns with ion engines when I go to planets.
