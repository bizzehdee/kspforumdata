But now having those mods in place with version .22 causes the research screen in Career mode to act very strangely. Though I have no tried it, I assume using a clean install would fix those issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am wondering if anyone knows of an easy simpler way to move my files in and out of the steam folder in an efficient way, to consider the game either modded or not modded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?

Takes files from here, put them there, and able to restore to original. The only special features are a backup hidden folder for original files and will tell you both mods changed the same file(s) so they are dependent and connected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Silent Hunter 3/4 all mods used standard structure to be \u0022JSGME ready\u0022 which was nice. In KSP you have to set up your entries like: \\KSP_win\\MODS\\Amazo\u0027s Mod v1.2\\GameData\\Amazo\\Parts\\.... Then JSGME takes contents of \u0022Amazo\u0027s Mod v1.2\u0022 folder to root (same as JSGME.exe) which is KSP_win so GameData folder will mesh. Maybe KSP community will adopt JSGME folder structure too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T10:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not just duplicate the whole game install.
