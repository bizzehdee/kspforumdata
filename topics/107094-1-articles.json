I\u0027ve been playing it totally stock so far, and I haven\u0027t even tried out the new stuff like science labs and resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut having played through many career mode games (both stock and modified) ever since they invented career mode, I think what\u0027s really missing now is a campaign mode. Here\u0027s how I envision it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome cutscene cinematics maybe featuring kerbals in balloons or bi-planes or what have you. Then someone (John F. Kerman?) starts the Kerbal Space Program. Yay! Cheering kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 1: You have a fixed amount of cash and the level 0 tech. Goal of the scenario is to escape the atmosphere, but you need some launches and recoveries to get a little more tech. (So far, this is basically the same as career mode.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 2: You are given a few more parts to work with, some more money, and now you must get a kerbal into orbit and back again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 3: Unmanned probe to the Mun. Again, you are given some cash and a limited set of tech. Goal is a crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 4: Unmanned Mun flyby and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 5: Manned Mun flyby and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEtc. Rather than grinding cash and science using contracts and experiments, each scenario would give you the tech and cash you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could have scenarios like Apollo 13, where something goes wrong and now your job is to get your kerbals back home. You could have a mission later on where there is already a base on the Mun, and you have to deliver supplies and/or scientists. Etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you could still just play with the existing game modes, but these campaign scenarios would be fun if they were plotted out imaginatively.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T06:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe whole point of KSP is you make your own campaign.
