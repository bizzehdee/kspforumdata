You have to DOCK using as many mods as you want as long as it technically works (the ship can move a little but it cant blow up) [AGAIN use as many mods as you can]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will require some practice here are my tips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Build a decently sized space station (big enough for your ship to dock in and add the docking mechanism to this.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Launch it into orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. DO NOT END THE FLIGHT!!! You have to press Esc., Space Center\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.Now build your ship that will dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Launch it, make sure to use rcs, and also you gotta time it right that you get to the station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. use the RCS to fine tune your docking,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Use lander legs to keep your self connected to the dock (you have to put yourself in the docking slot on your space station)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Press Esc. Go to space station and switch back to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Use the landing legs again on the station to close in the ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.
