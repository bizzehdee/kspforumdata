But I do agree with one point, other than solar, most electric power vessels do a poor job of transforming energy, so with an interstellar fusion reactor more than 90% of the net reactor output needs to be channeled or you have an over heating issue, some heat in deep space is good, too much is bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for black hole drive, maybe you pat yourself on the back, until you then discuss how exactly you created that black hole to begin with, see I don\u0027t have that problem with fusion reaction, humans have done that and several times. So far as yet we have not created a black hole, nor do we even have an idea of the energetics required to create one. Being dead in the water in a ship with no way of stopping is just as good as being dead, unless you have on board the means of generating another black hole. See, if you can\u0027t scribe a way of making one of these things, that means you have to wait until a neutron star degrades to the point inwhich it is of useful size, but if you don\u0027t have a drive to begin with how will you reach that star, but with fusion drive you could reach it, just not quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI picture most FEP drives using other forms of energy to get themselves into a hyperbolic trajectory out of our solar system, im thinking maybe 100,000 to 500,000 m/s (again the problem here is to achieve this you need exhaust velocities in the sub-c range and insane ISPs, but with a really large ship this is possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T04:23:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is really needed for interstellar travel is some sort of reactionless \u0022space drive\u0022 (\u003Cu\u003ERendezvous with Rama\u003C/u\u003E), because if reaction mass needs to be carried for both acceleration and deceleration the rocket equation will make the amount of propellant ridiculous, no matter what\u00A0the Isp is. Anti-gravity (Kzinti gravity planer) would be the best, but I guess that isn\u0027t considered \u0022theoretically possible\u0022 yet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best bet with near-future technology would be\u00A0laser-riding solar sail propulsion, with the sail being augmented by some form of nuclear propulsion (fusion pulse or NTR) at least\u00A0for deceleration at the end of the trip. A nuclear\u00A0reactor could be used for power generation during the cruise phase, and for thrust as needed, either as a nuclear-thermal rocket or powering fusion-pulse lasers. Launch mass might be conserved by collecting\u00A0interstellar hydrogen for decelerating,\u00A0while decelerating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the payload itself, while sending out a scouting probe would be ideal, by the time the results of the probe made it back to Earth the mission may well have been forgotten. That\u0027s if there\u0027s even someone left on Earth with the ability to \u0022listen\u0022 for the message from the probe. Similarly, a manned scouting mission would be pointless. So it may as well be a colony ship. A full generation ship would have to be incredibly massive, so it would be better to have most of the people in deep-sleep. I wouldn\u0027t want to rely on machinery to keep everything running and to wake everyone up at the end, so some awake crew would be required. The crew would work in one or more\u00A0shifts running anywhere from 5 to 20 years, before waking up their replacements and going in the sleep tanks themselves. Ideally, all the crew for all the shifts would be trained on Earth ahead of time, so they would just need to be briefed upon waking before the previous shift goes in the tanks. The \u0022cruise\u0022 crews would need the least training with the \u0022arrival\u0022 crew needing the most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T05:18:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222408063\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002265930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455419586\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNah, my interstellar ship doesn\u0027t go that fast, it takes 50,000 years to traverse between the stars, avoiding alot of the troubles of zipping around out at c-fractions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo the math on power requirements.

That\u0027s effective breeding population, which is about 1/3rd of a normal population that breeds at 30 so we can look at 6000 individuals total should be a satisfactory population size. I figure you would need 10 kw/person so that is going to be around 60 MW, not alot of power. Each person in such a rock pile will need 100 tonnes (being generous) so thats 6 billion kgs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif we say 2/3rds of the dV came from FEP getting accelerated than thats 70000 dV since we are traveling for 10,000 years we dont really concern ourselves too much with the acceleration rate on Sol escape velocity has been achieved so an acceleration of 0.00001 \u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E is fine. OK so lets see 70000/0.00001 = 7,000,000,000 sec = 8101 days = 22 years; actually I could go with 0.00001 \u003Cem\u003Ea. \u003C/em\u003EOK so now we have \u003Cem\u003Ea.\u003C/em\u003E ISP units are in V, so lets say we specific impulse is 10,000,000 m/s that means N = \u003Cu\u003Em\u003C/u\u003E * 10,000,000. F = m\u003Csub\u003Eship\u003C/sub\u003E * a = 6E9 x 0.00001 = 60000 N. looking pretty good.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003Em\u003C/u\u003E = 60000/10,000,000 = 0.006 kg/s * 7,000,000,000 = 42,000 tonnes of fuel which is not alot considering that we have a ship weight of 6,000,000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK so next power, as the other posts have described, power is the real problem. Power for Force = 2 * k * E/sec /ISP\u00A0 = 2 * 0.8 * w / ISP =\u00A0 w * 0.00000016.\u00A0 w = 6250000 =\u00A0 6.25 MW, we easily could increase the specific impulse by 10 fold and increase acceleration and velocity shortening trip time, but alas we have to factor our reactor fuel into the equation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a problem. So lets say our 100 tonnes per person = 100000 are spread at a density of 0.1 that means we have a 1000000 liters per person. That is 6,000,000,000 liters. if we assume 4/3 pi r 3 then that means we\u00A0 have a radius of 1.157 km, which means we have a surface area 4 * pi * r2 = 14 Km^2 with which to radiate waste heat (or to insulate).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I prefer this over a fast ship is very simple, no matter were you go you will have to terraform, which in an of itself is risky given you can create snowball planets if you get it wrong. You are going to have to bring animals, plants, everything to rebuild ecosystems in some form (probably as frozen cells in a near absolute zero freezer). So having a ship capable of lasting millenia is the way to go. Terraforming to the O2 will take time, the only zero ready state organisms are going to be a couple of species of cyanobacterium. Land plants for instance require O2 to keep their roots alive, so basically you need a place to hang out to get O2 to a level where the basic land plants will survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ouion","CreatedById":38531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T15:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy Ideal Interstellar Travel Methods:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneration Ship: A method which a spacecraft has a internal earth like environment and a crew consist of 10,000\u002B(depends on the size of the ship) that stays on the ship for a extended amount of time until the ship reaches its destination.

See, if you can\u0027t scribe a way of making one of these things, that means you have to wait until a neutron star degrades to the point inwhich it is of useful size, but if you don\u0027t have a drive to begin with how will you reach that star, but with fusion drive you could reach it, just not quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI picture most FEP drives using other forms of energy to get themselves into a hyperbolic trajectory out of our solar system, im thinking maybe 100,000 to 500,000 m/s (again the problem here is to achieve this you need exhaust velocities in the sub-c range and insane ISPs, but with a really large ship this is possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-close-in-on-creating-black-hole-in-lab/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-close-in-on-creating-black-hole-in-lab/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can create black holes in giant particle accelerators- something which got conspiracy theorists riled up when they figured that out, saying it would destroy the entire world (in reality, it would just implode very quickly unless it quickly accreted more mass.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222408129\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002265930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455423826\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289439\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StrandedonEarth\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/14/2016 at 8:23 PM, StrandedonEarth said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is really needed for interstellar travel is some sort of reactionless \u0022space drive\u0022 (\u003Cu\u003ERendezvous with Rama\u003C/u\u003E), because if reaction mass needs to be carried for both acceleration and deceleration the rocket equation will make the amount of propellant ridiculous, no matter what\u00A0the Isp is.

A nuclear\u00A0reactor could be used for power generation during the cruise phase, and for thrust as needed, either as a nuclear-thermal rocket or powering fusion-pulse lasers. Launch mass might be conserved by collecting\u00A0interstellar hydrogen for decelerating,\u00A0while decelerating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the payload itself, while sending out a scouting probe would be ideal, by the time the results of the probe made it back to Earth the mission may well have been forgotten. That\u0027s if there\u0027s even someone left on Earth with the ability to \u0022listen\u0022 for the message from the probe. Similarly, a manned scouting mission would be pointless. So it may as well be a colony ship. A full generation ship would have to be incredibly massive, so it would be better to have most of the people in deep-sleep. I wouldn\u0027t want to rely on machinery to keep everything running and to wake everyone up at the end, so some awake crew would be required. The crew would work in one or more\u00A0shifts running anywhere from 5 to 20 years, before waking up their replacements and going in the sleep tanks themselves. Ideally, all the crew for all the shifts would be trained on Earth ahead of time, so they would just need to be briefed upon waking before the previous shift goes in the tanks. The \u0022cruise\u0022 crews would need the least training with the \u0022arrival\u0022 crew needing the most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReactionless drives are impossible under the current laws of physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222408572\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002265930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455464895\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002238531\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ouion\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, ouion said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy Ideal Interstellar Travel Methods:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneration Ship: A method which a spacecraft has a internal earth like environment and a crew consist of 10,000\u002B(depends on the size of the ship) that stays on the ship for a extended amount of time until the ship reaches its destination.
