However, KSP being the great game that it is, forced me to improve and persevere. I\u0027ve gone from barely being able to get into orbit, to going to the Mun/Minmus and back; rescuing Kerbals in orbit of Kerbin and the Mun. And I\u0027m about to try my first \u0027ferry a VIP\u0027 contract. I suppose playing in old \u0027Science\u0027 mode made me a bit soft; I didn\u0027t have to worry in previous versions about aerodynamics, nor did I have to think about the most efficient way to build a rocket as a result of VAB, launchpad, tracking station limitations. So I think in that respect it\u0027s actually made me a better player. And that surely is the mark of a truly great game: a game that frustrates you like crazy, but keeps you coming back for more. and ultimately makes you better at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for all your comments and replies to my last post!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTim\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: While I find getting into orbit less of a challenge now, I still get nervous about re-entry heat. It took Jeb 4 tries to return to Kerbin safely from Minmus before I managed to burn off enough velocity to stop him burning up! And I can\u0027t even imagine how I\u0027m going to get them home from interplanetary journeys! In fact I don\u0027t even know how a return trip to Duna would work. How many heat shields would I need? One for the lander, one for the return to Kerbin? Where would I put them? Should I put the orbiter in orbit first, then send the lander and dock them (transferring samples is now possible in 1.1.1)? So many questions! It\u0027s a whole new game entirely, for me anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPPS: Oh and congratulations to Squad on how stable 1.1.1 has been so far.

If you\u0027re returning from Minmus, you only need to drop to about 25km for pretty much any reentry capsule. Any lower and you wont\u0027 slow down enough before hitting the thicker parts of the atmosphere. Too much higher than that and you won\u0027t slow down enough to get your apoapsis under 69km.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as for re-entry from interplanetary space, perhaps you might want to try breaking into LKO before reentering. Instead of coming back into the Kerbin system and immediately reentering the atmosphere, why not slow your craft down into a low orbit (anywhere from 80km to 150km) and then reenter from there? It will take a significant amount more fuel to accomplish (and as such you\u0027ll need to create a larger craft than you necessarily need) but it will greatly simplify reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for Duna (though with stock aero this may be different) I never particularly needed any heat shields. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is so thin that you don\u0027t really get any friction unless you come in super fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T20:43:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current version is 1.1.2.\u00A0 So, if you\u0027re really playing 1.1.1, you should update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t need any head shields at Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, as far as returning from Duna goes, a heat shield with full ablator is overkill.\u00A0 I removed almost three quarters of the ablator from the heat shield when I did a Duna return the other day.\u00A0 That may have been a bit too much, but everybody got through the atmosphere safely in the end. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t want your Kerbin periapsis too high or too low.\u00A0 Either one can be a massive failure mode.\u00A0 Don\u0027t be afraid to save and try entering with different periapsis values to get a feel for where the edges of the envelope are.\u00A0 I believe I came in with a periapsis of 32 km on my return from Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SorryDave","CreatedById":119474,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T22:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo for you to stick it out, I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t rage quit.
