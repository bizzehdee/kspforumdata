The Heliport is not really big enough to land anything but a very small Helicopter/VTOL. Yeah, so there it is, makes for a nice photo if scatterer behaves. I may or may not build a contract pack for my mod (MM script) NoFuel, depending if or when I get the actual mod proper built. Where all fuel tanks are defueled on launch and you have to build the infrastructure to fuel your space program, with contracts around prospecting and supplying fuel to a nearby depot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n224 parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/SelfishMeme/Mining-Rig\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/31hLnAU.png\u0022 alt=\u002231hLnAU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/BGx2q/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T15:45:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks great man!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I can picture a few of these strategically placed around Kerbin for lonely seafarers to get a cup of tea and commence bunkering operations.

I think it depends on how your physics engine feels that day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
