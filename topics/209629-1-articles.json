You get just the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and you can build crafts, but thats it. I feel like it could be a good way to test out building crafts without paying for the game. In order to fly the crafts you need to get the full release of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ember12","CreatedById":217583,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-04T20:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a cool idea, and might help get more people interested in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-04T20:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like people to be able to fly their rockets with limited parts around Kerbin, just to check out the flying aspect too. Maybe limit it to generic plane and rover parts, and one or two sizes of rocket parts, in the early-mid tech range. That way, the exciting content such as the cool future tech or the cool celestial bodies are still reserved for the full version but demo players can try out the flight UI and graphics. Also, limiting parts would make things simpler so that players aren\u0027t confused by an overabundance of incompatible resource types in the demo.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedderThanMisty","CreatedById":215672,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-04T20:48:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that if they\u0027re going to do a demo, it\u0027d be very similar to the existing ksp1 demo. Just Kerbin and the Mun, and a limited set of low-tier parts. Just enough content to dip your toes in before diving into the deep end with the full game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
