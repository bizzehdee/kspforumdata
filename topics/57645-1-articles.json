You would launch rockets from a platform at the top of the elevator. As the elevator got higher, launching would be easier, until it gets to keostationary orbit and you don\u0027t even have to launch anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T00:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, let\u0027s not go overly unrealistic on this. It would be fine to have an \u0027\u0027elevator\u0027\u0027 for launching from greater altitudes, but it should only save you up to 5000 meters. Which is still big.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
