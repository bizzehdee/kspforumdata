And besides loading faster (as one would expect), I have seen two major bugs so far: a disappearing resource panel when I clicked the \u0022stage option thingy\u0022 checkbox in the resource panel (you know the one) and I \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u0027t get it back\u003C/em\u003E. The log shows me trying frantically to no effect. Second, I cloned Jeb. Yes, that\u0027s right, I did in a few minutes what the best kerbal scientists have been unable to do in years. How? I had him EVA and get back in his pod and a clone of him appeared on the outside ladder where he was standing. I then proceeded to kick it around awhile. (Aside: this seems similar to a bug I think KAS or KIS had a while back, or some other mod). To be clear, this is a fresh install, with no mods - I even deleted the entire steam folder. This is the second time running the fresh install (first time didn\u0027t go so well due to stuff and things in the options screen). The \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E change I made is to the launch shortcut which is \u0022%command%_64\u0022 which is left over from my last install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux 64 bit, latest version which I believe is something like 1.1.1:1250 or so (see log).
