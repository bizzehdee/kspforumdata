I already accepted a flyby contract to do so, but I\u0027m struggling to find a way to actually get the encounter in simulations due to the limited ignitions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy booster has ~7.4km/s, second stage has 4km/s and the final kickstage has 2.5km/s, so \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E is not a problem, I just need to time it right. But since Baikonur is at 46\u00B0 inclination to the equator, while the moon is only at 20\u00B0, I struggle with getting into the same plane. A solution I thought off would be to launch just at the right time so my initial trajectory after booster cutoff would intersect the descending node, so I could match the inclination with the second stage burn. But since the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E only appears after liftoff, I can\u0027t seem to find the right timing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there something I\u0027m missing?

Once in low orbit, I wait until the moon is 65-70 degrees behind a relative node, and eject entirely prograde at the previous node in order to meet the moon there. It\u0027s certainly slower in terms of total mission duration, but is more efficient for achieving a flyby than changing inclination during ascent.
