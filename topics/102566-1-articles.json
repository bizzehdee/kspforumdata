Then you start to build down from it. Proper strutting technique makes these systems very stable. When you attach your final stage boosters, you strut from the top to the payload, and create a box at the bottom of the tanks. The tanks below get strutted into the box configuration. On the first stage (i.e. the one that fires on launch) you can then onion out to add more dV. This design is extremely stable on launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use either 2 or 2.5M parts for the outboard boosters. When you use these parts, you can then step down using either the same size parts or put an adaptor on and then strap on the next size up. See the pics for illustrations of what I mean. I have not tested out just how much I can get up into orbit with this configuration, but I have definitely lofted well over 100 tons out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI with some of these, and I can see how it could be possible to go much higher than that... I play contract only so my biggest problem is paying for them... but compared to some of the other designs I\u0027ve seen I can actually afford these... from time to time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to post this because after poking around I haven\u0027t really seen people using this approach to building space craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T15:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like a very practical approach to building lifters.

Work. Yeah, this is something that got me pretty late-stage into the contract game before I went broke trying to create interplanetary missions... and the stability of this design and the low part count are remarkable.
