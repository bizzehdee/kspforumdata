if you\u2019re arriving too late (target in front of you when you get there), you\u2019re leaving too early so best to wait a while before doing the transfer burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat rule is reversed when heading inwards (e.g. Kerbin to Eve, Tylo to Laythe, Minmus to Mun etc.): in that case if you\u2019re arriving early then you\u2019re leaving early and need to wait for the target to catch up, but if you\u2019re arriving late then you\u2019re leaving late and lowering your periapsis will allow you to catch up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-12T15:45:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter briefly trying out the transfer planner I found it does not always give you an efficient transfer. \u00A0In particular, I found that my arrivals at the target CB ended up with a large velocity difference, yielding extremely costly capture burns. \u00A0I\u2019ve stopped using that tool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199902-jimmymcgoochie/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022199902\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199902-jimmymcgoochie/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@jimmymcgoochie\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0noted, the screenshot indicates you should wait \u00A0X days before starting your burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI couldn\u2019t tell from the photo if you\u2019re burning directly from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E or from a Solar orbit. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you\u2019re in solar orbit, drop a maneuver node ahead of you and slide it forward or backward until you find the right burn location.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFrom \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E I usually time warp in small increments to find the best departure time. \u00A0When I start getting close I time warp in 10 day increments, then 5-day increments, to avoid overshooting.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you do overshoot (time warp a little too far, you can usually accommodate this by burning a little longer, allowing the target CB (Duna) to catch up.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-12T16:24:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe alarms in the screenshot were set from the built-in Alarm Clock, which for some reason sets an alarm 20--30 days before the ideal transfer (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/203315-differences-in-interplanetary-transfer-windows-between-112-stock-maneuver-creator-vs-alaram-clock/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethread link\u003C/a\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe online tool at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/#/Kerbin/100/Duna/100/false/optimal/false/1/1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/#/Kerbin/100/Duna/100/false/optimal/false/1/1\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0still works great.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first minimum-delta-V transfer is on day 231, so @terrendos has 40 days to wait, so probably easier to set a new node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeaving at the time in the image, it might cost another 200 m/s from low Kerbin orbit to get into a higher-energy transfer to catch up to Duna.\u00A0 Doing that in a mid-course manuever would cost even more, as you say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-12T16:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will echo what has been said about TWP;
