I want to ensure that these textures are applied properly (as I\u0027m certain if not, I\u0027m just going to have an untextured IVA if I export it to KSP), and I\u0027m going through the steps but this is what happens. And I\u0027m not entirely sure what step i\u0027m missing or where in this process it would even be. Is it a step in blender? Unity? IDK!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEssentially I have these 4 textures that are supposedly UV maps, but when bringing them into unity, they do not behave as such when applied to the objects they\u0027re meant to be applied to.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy gut tells me its something to do with the export into Unity. Perhaps in order to do this the textures need to be applied in blender first, then exported, then I can apply the materials and get teh result I\u0027m looking for?\u00A0 Sounds like it makes sense but of course Blender is about as user friendly as a gold brick to my crotch so I\u0027m not even sure how to accomplish this. I am going to go ahead and try to do this but I wanted to reach out here because this is frustrating me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-15T12:09:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, unity and ksp 1 texture/material per mesh, so your 4 textures needs a minimum of 4 meshes ,\u00A0 although i see you have many many more than that,\u00A0 for each texture create a material, drag the texture on to that, and set up the material shader properties as you want. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre those textures actually mapped to those parts??\u00A0 as you say \u0022supposedly uv maps\u0022\u00A0 as the uv map for pod A will not fit pod B, also if they\u0027ve been converted from dds they will need to be flipped vertically to work correctly as png tga whatever\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you have so many meshes , unless they are grouped onto the texture sheets , it\u0027s going to be a pain to drag drop onto every mesh item.\u00A0 If all those mesh objects are mapped to those four textures , why have all those individual meshes?\u00A0 it would make mores sense, and be better from a performance point of view , to combine all the parts that share a texture into mesh groups if not one complete mesh .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe the adding of the textures , in blender or unity will work, however if you apply them first in blender , it will export to unity ready for use, with textures and materials already sorted .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-16T02:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223354998\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022173914\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221523794155\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002250907\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpannerMonkey(smce)\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, SpannerMonkey(smce) said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, unity and ksp 1 texture/material per mesh, so your 4 textures needs a minimum of 4 meshes ,\u00A0 although i see you have many many more than that,\u00A0 for each texture create a material, drag the texture on to that, and set up the material shader properties as you want. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre those textures actually mapped to those parts??\u00A0 as you say \u0022supposedly uv maps\u0022\u00A0 as the uv map for pod A will not fit pod B, also if they\u0027ve been converted from dds they will need to be flipped vertically to work correctly as png tga whatever\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you have so many meshes , unless they are grouped onto the texture sheets , it\u0027s going to be a pain to drag drop onto every mesh item.\u00A0 If all those mesh objects are mapped to those four textures , why have all those individual meshes?\u00A0 it would make mores sense, and be better from a performance point of view , to combine all the parts that share a texture into mesh groups if not one complete mesh .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe the adding of the textures , in blender or unity will work, however if you apply them first in blender , it will export to unity ready for use, with textures and materials already sorted .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe model isn\u0027t mine, as I agree with you that the way this one was set up is rather...ill advised.
