It sounds ludicrous, but it is not technically impossible- only statistically impossible. First, the molecules vibrating with heat energy in the shattered plate have to mostly vibrate at the same time in the exact same direction to additively combine all their thermal kinetic energy into macroscopic kinetic energy (converting heat directly into motion), which sends the plate shards flying back together, while slightly cooling the shards. (The plate could also extract heat energy from the air molecules bombarding its surface.) Next, as the plate shards all recombine at the exact same time and place to reconstruct the plate, additional heat vibrations have to line up perfectly to reconnect all the molecular bonds that broke when the plate shattered. Finally, the remainder of the heat energy is converted into upward motion, which brings the plate back into your hand. Of course, if you wanted to exactly reverse it, you\u0027d also have to have heat in the air reconstruct the sound of the plate breaking and have that sound all converge down to the plate.\n\nAnyway, it sounds ridiculous, but all it is is a breaking plate played \u0022backwards\u0022 in time. What tells us it is *possible* is that the laws of physics are actually fully reversible- every interaction can happen in either direction without any violation. A broken dinner plate spontaneously reassembling itself is technically *possible*, but so exceedingly unlikely that no one will ever observe such a thing in a billion, billion, billion, etc. lives of the universe. Statistics- thermodynamics, effectively- makes it appear that certain things like to happen in certain directions only. Iron rusts; rust does not un-rust and become iron. Dinner plates do not un-break.\n\n/Opinion:\n\nTo me, that the laws of physics are fully reversible suggests that there is no past or future, there is only rate of change, which is time. We can not travel backward in time because there is nowhere to travel back to, and no way to violate causality. Even when you play the dinner plate breaking in reverse, causality is preserved- but you couldn\u0027t reverse the expansion of the universe, for example, without breaking causality. And we also don\u0027t travel \u0022forward\u0022 in time- we just travel in time. Thermodynamics doesn\u0027t really set the \u0022direction\u0022 in time, it just sets what kind of things are statistically (but not completely) impossible when we travel in time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T04:00:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 04:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T04:55:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I travel through time a lot.
