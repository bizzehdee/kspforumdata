However, I think (I could very well be mistaken) that you want an 85* orbit to correct for the rotation of the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you are completely against mods (for whatever reason) I highly recommend Kerbal Engineer. There\u0027s so much useful information in it, that I feel should really be present in the game.
