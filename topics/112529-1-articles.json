Shouldn\u0027t be too hard to make, as all you really need is a cargo bay that doesn\u0027t open. In fact, I think you could clone a stock cargo bay and just disable the modules it uses to open/close. I might have a look at doing this but I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll be able to as my modding experience consists of creating a very basic and non-functional life support system (then again, it\u0027s easier to kill kerbals with explosions than code).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I was able to make it, I\u0027ll post a thread and a link sometime today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T00:21:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 12:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PortalGunner\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Inqie","CreatedById":142191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T06:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is my release for Stock Hull Sections for 1.0.2: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125169-1-0-2-Stock-Hull-Section-Parts-v1-0-%2812-06-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125169-1-0-2-Stock-Hull-Section-Parts-v1-0-%2812-06-15%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
