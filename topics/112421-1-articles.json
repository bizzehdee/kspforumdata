A prograde equatorial orbit is most efficient to get to because Kerbin\u0027s rotational velocity is all added to your eventual orbital velocity. If you try to get to orbit turning West rather than East you need about 350 extra m/s of orbital velocity relative to Kerbin\u0027s surface.\n\nIt would take the same delta-v to reach the Mun from orbit in any case.

This will let you see where periapsis is. You want to get it as low as possible as soon as possible.\n\nDepending on the adjustments, they should be either right after your initial burn (prograde/retrograde) or halfway to the mun (inclination changes and lowering periapsis via those blue circles).\n\nIf your periapsis isn\u0027t quite where you want it (i.e. you can go lower and expect to live), just burn enough at periapsis to get an orbit at all.\n\n[edit: If your docking skills are up to it and you have unlocked the command chair, switch to your lander (I\u0027m pretty sure no other module is worth it, but if you can live without F5 I \\*think\\* you can stay on just a ladder: there may be other penaties as well (I gave up on it).].\n\n Then adjust your periapsis at apoapsis, and back to periapsis to circularize (according to Obereth, circularizing at periapsis is optimal, but once you get apoapsis below 100k I doubt it makes much difference. At this point you are mostly concerned about finding a landing space).\n\nTo optimize descent, see [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124760-How-to-time-suicide-burns](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124760-How-to-time-suicide-burns) (especially redironcrown\u0027s nifty use of manuever nodes. Or just look at kerbal engineer).\n\nTo optimize acsent, I\u0027m pretty sure an amazingly fast gravity turn is in order. I tend to turn 45 degrees as fast as my craft can turn, and look to be 90 degrees within a few thousand meters. Not sure what is optimal.\n\nOnce you\u0027ve circularized around Mun, set a manuever node that intersects with the trailing side of Mun\u0027s orbit (you will have to zoom out to see it, but it takes a few seconds to fade once you zoom back in). Optimal burn is very close to just barely escape velocity (I give it a touch more while watching periapsis get closer to Kerbin, but I\u0027m not sure that is best. Also actual burn time might be slightly different than on the orbit, but it will be very close). Wait nearly a full orbit to apoapsis and bring periapsis to just under 30,000m (depending on how much you trust your heat shield) [if you have any spare fuel at all, going the extra orbit is likely a silly habit of mine].\n\nBeyond that, I don\u0027t think there is anything you can to optimize a trans munar injection (ignoring capture). For a \u0022flyby the mun\u0022 mission, any burn that leaves apoapsis just inside the mun\u0027s SOI is going to be optimal. The only tricks come in reducing capture/landing costs. You could wait to intersect the Mun at [its own] periapsis, but I think it\u0027s pretty circular. The trick with Minmus is to wait till it is above (or opposite) KSC and then launch in its inclination.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T16:21:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wumpus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T17:00:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That would make sense.

Once you exit the SOI, the vector of the planet\u0027s speed is ADDED back to make the craft\u0027s speed outside the SOI.\n\nFor example, if you enter the Mun\u0027s SOI from the head-on (centre front) your speed inside the Mun\u0027s SOI becomes your original speed plus the Mun\u0027s speed since the Mun is coming towards you (remember that a vector going opposite yours is negative, so when you subtract it you get a positive value). Similarly, when you enter the Mun from behind, the Mun\u0027s speed is subtracted from your speed (a subtraction of a parallel vector takes speed away). When you exit in those positions the reverse happens.\n\nNow, this doesn\u0027t sound very useful since if a craft enters from one side and come out the opposite side, the planet\u0027s speed gets added and then taken away on exit in an equal amount, which is not at all useful.\n\nHowever, whilst inside the Mun\u0027s SOI your trajectory will curve due to gravity (the lower you go the more it curves) and you can help that even further with some well placed manoeuvring. This means your craft will not actually exit in the exact opposite point as it entered, with the end result being that the speed which is added/removed when entering the SOI is not the same as the one removed/added when exiting. This can be used so that the end result is getting or loosing speed between entering and exiting the SOI purely from the change in your craft\u0027s direction under the effect of that planet\u0027s gravity.\n\nFor example, in the extreme (not really possible in reality, just an idealised \u0022what if\u0022), if you managed to enter the Mun\u0027s SOI from the front, turn 180 degrees and exit it exactly were you entered, the following would happen:\n\n- On entering, the Mun is going opposite from you (hence negative to your craft\u0027s speed), so when that negative vector is subtracted away from your craft\u0027s speed it actually makes you craft go 542.5 m/s faster\n\n- On exiting, the Mun is going the same way as your craft. Because on exit from an SOI, that planet\u0027s vector is ADDED, and your craft\u0027s speed vector is exactly parallel, you just got another extra 542.5 m/s of speed.\n\nthe result of this would be an extra 1085 m/s speed, more than enough to get from Mun orbit to, for example, Duna or Eve.\n\nWhilst in reality you can\u0027t do an 180 degree turn around a planet purely from gravity (though two well placed small burns would get you close to it), you can get more than 90 degrees when low \u0026 slow enough near heavy planets. Those 90 degrees would get you from no speed change on entering SOI (if coming from the 90 degrees or 270 degrees in the plane of that planet) to getting the entire orbital speed of the planet added (if exiting via the front) or taken away (if exiting from behind).\n\nYou can play with this purely in the Kerbin system by getting just enough dV for a ship to exit Kerbin\u0027s SOI and then coming back in again (just reverse course) and trying to use the Mun to lower your orbit for a Kerbin aerocapture. \n\nYou can also try to return from Minmus to Kerbin via the Mun\u0027s SOI, using the latter to lower your orbit for a Kerbin aerocapture or in reverse, go up from Low Kerbin Orbit and use the Mun to push your orbit up to Minmus, although these two are harder to get right since Minmus\u0027 orbit is inclined (not to mention not usually worth the time).\n\nIn the big bad world of Kerbol, the dV savings which can be had are much more substantial, though as somebody pointed out above, you will be trading time for dV.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T17:26:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 05:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Acet**\n  \nEdited for grammar correction (duh!) and Kerbol system gravity assist gains comment."},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T18:05:25Z","Content":"Gravity capture is very easy actually, but not with the KSP tools available to you\n\nEnter retrograde and turn counter clock wise so that your exit elipse nearly the same period as the moon.\n\nThen you both do a lap and when you come back the velocity that was added is now subtracted.\n\nNext enter Prograde and turn clock wise and exit in the same manor.

LKO to LMO for 1069m/s. A direct flight would normally be about 860m/s (with course corrections) \u002B271m/s or 1131m/s. But it the trip takes 13 days to save those 62m/s! Note that you can use similar methods to get from LMO (8x8km) back to Kerbin for about 230m/s.\n\nThis sort of stuff has actually been done in the real world! My favorite was a [Japanese moon probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiten) that malfunctioned before completing its trans-Lunar burn and was stranded in a too-low ellipse to get to the Moon directly. They thought it was doomed but an astrodynamcist at JPL figured out how to adjust the orbit\u0027s period so it would get little tugs from the Moon that eventually pulled it all the way up and into a low-energy capture."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T14:21:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but I think that because of the way the sprehers of influence work, the most efficient way to do things may be very different in Kerbal than in real life.\n\u003E To land on the Mun:\n\u003E \n\u003E - Start from lowest circular LKO\n\u003E \n\u003E - Burn prograde at the right time so that your Kerbin Ap barely touches the Mun\u0027s SOI.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Once inside the Mun\u0027s SOI, reduce your horizontal speed to zero (your vertical speed should be close to 0 m/s once inside Mun\u0027s SOI)\n\u003E \n\u003E - Suicide burn to the surface\n\nYou really don\u0027t want to do that-- it pessimizes Oberth effect and will cost you dV.\n\nYou want to do as much of your burns at as low an altitude as possible. Therefore:\n\n1. Start from lowest circular LKO\n\n2. Burn prograde at the right time so that your trajectory passes the Mun at the lowest possible altitude, grazing the surface\n\n3. At Mun periapsis, burn retrograde to circularize into lowest possible LMO\n\n4. When you\u0027re ready to land, lower your periapsis to the surface, then suicide-burn to land.\n\nActually, in principle, it would be slightly more efficient if, instead of steps 3\u00264 above, you made it so that your munar periapsis in step 2 is right at ground level, and you just directly suicide-burn on a near-horizontal trajectory directly to the surface. However, the dV savings over the above scheme would be minimal; it would be trickier to set up; and you\u0027d lose a lot of convenience in terms of being able to choose where your landing site is. Therefore, in my experience it\u0027s not worth the hassle for the minimal extra dV savings."},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T13:39:36Z","Content":"Isn\u0027t the whole point of the suicide burn that it uses the Oberth efect most efficiently?
