I have been playing KSP since 0.8.5. So its been a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can remember the first time Squad introduced the infamous struts system, and i figured it made all the difference inte the World. Game World, that is hehe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm kind of frustrated. Why you might ask. I have managed to build small stations and can put them in any orbit, any height that i want. So that im happy with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat im not happy about is that im not able to dock. No matter how many tutorials I Watch online, not even Scott Manley, and I do love his videos. I still cant learn how to dock. I cant even learn how to get to other planets. I can get to the mun just fine, by brute force. That is, wait until the mun and the space Craft is aligned, launch and see if you got it right. I guess, if I learn how to dock i could learn how to get to other planets. Once I made it to Duma, by mistake, but I dont remember how to do that again. And I was out of fuel, so I had a Lovely crash there. I use the new navsystem, but it doesnt work for me. Still cant dock. Still cant get to other planets. Annoyed. Dont get me wrong, I LOVE KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI initally bought it when Squad first charged Money for it. When Steam was introduced, I transferred KSP to there because i was so sick of the servers going down every time a new release happened. So Steam has this thing that shows how many hours you played a game. It says 69h since download. That is FAR MORE than any other game I own. All the latest shooters (yes bought). They dont have the same \u0022draw me in\u0022 feel like KSP. No other game I have ever played comes remotely Close. And I have been playing computer games since VIC-20 was introduced. So. I hope I one day can learn how to dock...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HGGundamReviews","CreatedById":57099,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T13:41:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re really having that much trouble, well, as much hate as I know I\u0027m about to get for this, you can always install Mechjeb 2.0.7 ...

And then some more patience. This entire game is about patience, except for launch. While I\u0027m still learning how to properly rendezvous with ships I want to dock with, the good old stand-by method of getting into a similar orbit, going slightly higher to let it catch up to you, or slightly lower to catch up to it, time warp until you\u0027re closer, then make your approach always works for me. As for the docking itself, first make sure that your target isn\u0027t rotating. If it is, this compounds the difficulty greatly. As long as it isn\u0027t rotating, select your target docking port, line up your attitude indicator with your target and your prograde vector. When all 3 indicators are lined up on your navball, approach the target at 1/10 the speed of your distance away from it. It takes time and I\u0027m sure other people are much better and quicker than I, but it works every time for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to other planets, well, I\u0027m still refining that process too. I have MechJeb, but only the 1.9.8 or whatever. This does give me phase angle and ejection angle information. Combined with the interplanetary calculator on ksp.olex.biz (i think that\u0027s the link), I can calculate when to burn and how much to burn. After that initial burn, I use the maneuver nodes to fine tune my approach. It\u0027s not easy, but the more I try the better I get, even if it is very slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"khyron42","CreatedById":8551,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T14:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENerfherde - you say \u0022I can\u0027t dock\u0022 but not why.

I would honestly recommend installing it, watch how it does things and then try to do them on your own after you get the feel for what exactly its doing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B 1000 hates for this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.... but I also agree. I have yet to do any docking. All I\u0027ve done so far is land on minmus and mun which are pretty noob achievements.

A better flight planning interface. The tools are nice and intuitive, but there\u0027s some MAJOR issues that make things harder. It\u0027s very difficult to line things up so you can see what the hell you are doing(or see what you want to see), and one mistake can mean a good 15\u002B seconds of tedious work. It doesn\u0027t help that certain things aren\u0027t calculated accurately(aerobraking isn\u0027t accounted for at all, and when you switch into a different gravity well it often has to redo calculations and thus requires adjustments), but from what i\u0027ve seen from mechjeb, the game CAN calculate these things. I\u0027m personally hoping that later we get different levels of computers that combined with actual instrument data(thus giving probes a point) will give us more accurate calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Tutorials for these things. In game and already set up to go. I managed to get to other planets decently quickly(its like the moon, but much much farther) but i had to watch a tutorial to figure out how to equalize my speed with an in orbit object without missing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Let me choose how many stupid conics i want to see in game please. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that said, my advice if you don\u0027t want to mechjeb everything-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Practice using the moon. Get something in orbit and then learn to use the flight planning controls to get caught by it\u0027s gravity. Once you figure out what each marker does(and understand that you can move the entire point) it becomes much easier to plan things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Then shoot for minmus. Again just practice getting the hang of manipulating the stupid thing. It\u0027s especially obnoxious trying to manipulate zooming in an out to see where your predicted path is in relation to the moon/planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Then go for duna. I suggest duna becuase it\u0027s basically the easiest by far. Jool isn\u0027t actually that bad either, and helps you learn aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Optionally, QUICKSAVE. Personally i didn\u0027t even find out about such a feature until long after i\u0027d gotten everything down(and now just don\u0027t use it out of habit) but when you\u0027re trying to learn i see no reason not to abuse the hell out of this. Relaunching rockets is just dead time between practice sessions, so set up a rocket in orbit with plenty of fuel, quick save it, and start practicing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
