The one limit that KSP has is the size of the VAB. Trying clever ways to exceed it has a high chance to irreversibly corrupt the vehicle save file. Just ask Whackjob what the most difficult thing about buuilding large is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal life is more complicated than that. Individual stages are ultimately limited in how much dV they can pull (both in KSP and IRL), so you need to add extra stages in order to be able to lift more and/or fly farther. However, every additional stage you add to the bottom needs to be larger than the entire rest of the rocket above it - and quite a bit larger, too. This results in a rapid exponential growth of stage size and/or mass needed, and at some point the rocket simply ceases to be aerodynamic enough to fly and/or collapses under its own weight (or in the case of KSP, ceases to fit into the VAB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut before you get there, you usually end up running into a different problem: because of the rapidly escalating mass, you\u0027ll eventually run out of thrust-weight-ratio because you don\u0027t have engines powerful enough.

In practice, it is difficult to get the right combo of parts, when the big fuel cans and engines needed, are not available in stock at present. Results are that either there is an overbuild with loss in efficiency, design becomes an issue due to bracing needed to keep things together, or that frame rate suffers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor return to Earth flights with a payload that landed on an airstrip instead of having to be recovered at sea or some remote place on land, the Shuttle was most cost efficient.
