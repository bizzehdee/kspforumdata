And trust me, everything on that shuttle is absolutely necessary for it to be easy to fly, and efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI initially tried to make it look more like a NASA design, but that quickly became an impossibility, as KSP\u0027s fuel flow system and no individual engine control made that absolutely impossible without employing \u003Cem\u003Emassive\u003C/em\u003E gimballing to about 45degs, which is just looks ridiculous. I have employed on both large liquid fuel rocket motors a 10.5deg gimbal, like the real NASA Space Shuttle, and that seems to be \u003Cem\u003Ejuuust\u003C/em\u003E enough to make the shuttle not spin out and explode. Let\u0027s just say the thing, in real life and now KSP, launches on the \u003Cem\u003Eabsolute pinnacle\u003C/em\u003E of feasibility, and constantly is about to spin out and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell here it is...

And just before the SRB\u0027s run out the SAS is almost fully down, when they do run out, the SAS is completely the other. It has a 10.5deg gimbal on the shuttle rocket motor, that provides \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of torque. Also smaller engine on the big orange tank (seen in the orbital insertion image) helps with the balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt flies rather well in air, however it is recommended to burn atleast some fuel before landing, as one has to be very skilled to land it fully fuelled, because it is very heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, and Astraph, you have to go into your KSP folder, into Gamedata, into squad, into parts, into engine, into a part file, into the part.cfg file, and edit the gimbal value within. It doesn\u0027t work for all parts, however I got the novapunch bearcat (the main shuttle engine for my case) to a 10.5deg gimbal. Don\u0027t forget to rename the title of the part, inside the cfg file and the actual name of the file, as it will over-ride the original, and trust me, you don\u0027t want 10.5deg gimbals on normal vertically stacked rockets; it\u0027ll wobble like it\u0027s in disco 1965/break-apart and explode. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.
