Then turn your in-game texture resolution to half-res. Even with the compression (I tried it too) and reduced texture packs, plus nitpicking through larger mods to remove parts I don\u0027t use, the game will still crash. Until Unity updates to support x64, we\u0027re stuck playing in 8 bit mode, basically \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DYJ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DYJ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll have a look at the controlsurfaces CoL indicator code, might have forgotten something there, but all pWings really does is to tell the game their new lift values so the game can place the CoL indicator, after that all you can do is to hope the game puts it where it should be. The mod itself never actually calculates the CoL of the aircraft as that\u0027s something the game should do reliably by itself, which it only sometimes does.\u003Cp\u003EWet wings is planned, but I want to get all-moving controlsurfaces and some of the weirdness fixed before adding more things that can go wrong. This is also something that will have questionable performance in the stock game until the stock flightmodel is updated to be less wrong, as it currently includes part mass in the drag and possibly lift calculations, meaning that an aircraft with wetwings would take off with more lift and drag than it would land with.
