I\u0027ve been working on updating models for the Civilian Population mod. I\u0027ve been getting an irritating texture issue with a couple of the redone parts - a medium and small sized food-growing part. If I add the medium part into the VAB, one of its textures doesn\u0027t display properly - it\u0027s a vent material with a diffuse texture and a normal-map texture. The normal-map shows up properly, but the diffuse is replaced by a dirt texture, which is on another section of the model. This results in part of the model looking like its made of dirt that has vents coming out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is from a previous version of the model, but it shows the same issue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/zji4n6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zji4n6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The small-sized part uses the same vent texture, but doesn\u0027t use the dirt texture. If I add the small-sized part into the editor on its own, it shows-up fine, but if I add in the medium part, then attach the small part to it, the vent texture on the small part also displays the dirt texture instead of the vent diffuse texture. I have been trying to fix this for the past week with no success. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T02:27:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you post the following information?:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The CFG file of the affected parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The texture format (PNG?
