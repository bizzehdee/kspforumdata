I\u0027ve been working on updating models for the Civilian Population mod. I\u0027ve been getting an irritating texture issue with a couple of the redone parts - a medium and small sized food-growing part. If I add the medium part into the VAB, one of its textures doesn\u0027t display properly - it\u0027s a vent material with a diffuse texture and a normal-map texture. The normal-map shows up properly, but the diffuse is replaced by a dirt texture, which is on another section of the model. This results in part of the model looking like its made of dirt that has vents coming out of it.\n\nThis is from a previous version of the model, but it shows the same issue:\n\n![zji4n6.png](http://i61.tinypic.com/zji4n6.png)\n\n The small-sized part uses the same vent texture, but doesn\u0027t use the dirt texture. If I add the small-sized part into the editor on its own, it shows-up fine, but if I add in the medium part, then attach the small part to it, the vent texture on the small part also displays the dirt texture instead of the vent diffuse texture. I have been trying to fix this for the past week with no success. Any help would be appreciated.
