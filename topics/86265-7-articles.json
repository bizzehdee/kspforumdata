The aerodynamics are mega-strange, you need several vertical stabilizers in order for a gr8-working aircraft on Kerbin to be stable on Eve. To my dismay, I suck at building spaceplanes. Thankfully, I already know the rule #1 for this challenge: the smaller, the better. You actually can get into orbit with a spaceplane, too. But you need a crap load of fuel in order to do so. I\u0027ll think of something, but it will definitely be complicated. Maybe put an extra pair of fuel tanks on the sides? I don\u0027t know.

Well, the concept comes from the souposphere itself. It behaves like a dense fluid so why not exploiting it with a \u0022boat\u0022? A sailing ship is the best example of unbiased asimmetry I can recall. So here I have a kind of \u0022keel\u0022 (the reentry module - that I CAN redesign if you can not really stand that lonely clipped nuke) that needs a ballast on the other side. A slightly lighter and longer one (leverage ftw). So here you are with your beautiful command bridge. You just need to remember you must keep your ship with the correct attitude. It behaves like a kind of foil ship during aerobrakes. The lift provided by the crew cabin on the tail, even if really small compared to the total overall mass, keeps it en route w/o tailspinning. Moreover you can always count on the 200\u002B available torque force. Obviously it does not work properly if you snap on it really unbalanced loads, but I managed affordable configs with differences in the order of \u002B/- 5t. I have tons of footage on it, just ask for anything you could be curious about. I designed a small 7t ion SSTO that can fit in the cargoes too cause I\u0027ll go to bother Ziv with my Jool 5 soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit] Now I just miss a good recon of the landing site before the main landing.
