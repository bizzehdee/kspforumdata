This rocket consists of Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tank surrounded by 6 more Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tanks. The 6 outer fuel tanks have two Rockomax BACC Solid Fuel Boosters each on their outward facing sides. Each Fuel Tank has a Rockomax \u0022Mainsail\u0022 Liquid Engine under it. On top of the center fuel tank I will be building the rest of the spacecraft, but it is not there yet. When I go to launch it, the BMFR falls apart under it\u0027s own weight. I am trying to figure out a way to increase the structural integrity of my flying explosion waiting to happen.

As others have said, struts. I would put a pair of struts at each of the top and bottom of the tanks, to hold it to the center tank. Wherever you use a fuel-line, remember that it also acts as a strut. To keep the design balanced (and not introduce rotation), treat the fuel-line as a strut, and put a matching strut on the other side. Struts automatically disconnect if they bridge over a decoupler, so don\u0027t worry, and just add struts anywhere you need to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. As others have said, you can use the more stand-offish radial decouplers to have some breathing room between tanks. You want to use these, and fuel-lines, to do what we call \u0022asparagus staging\u0022. The tanks will feed fuel through each other, so that you can drop them in pairs, until you\u0027re down to just the final, center tank. The fuel crossfeed lets you drop empty tanks, and have all of the other tanks still full when it happens, but make use of all engines simultaneously. This buys you maybe 5-10% more total acceleration when compared to dumping all 6 of the outer engines at once, while letting them use just their own fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Use \u0022Sepratrons\u0022. Those tiny little solid-rocket engines are designed for aiding in separating stages. Use those to push your discarded tanks away from your ship, to reduce the chance of it scraping other parts of your ship off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Stitching. This is a method of using struts to strengthen the connection between engines and fuel tanks, or tanks to other tanks, in a vertical stack. Make a strut that starts near the bottom of a fuel tank, and extends straight down into the engine underneath it, and it makes a little \u0022stitch\u0022 that helps hold it together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Max Grant","CreatedById":3166,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T18:19:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou definitely want to stage, even \u0022regular\u0022 staging will let your rockets go further.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond that.
