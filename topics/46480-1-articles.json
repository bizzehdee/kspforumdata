Capable of 700km\u002B orbit around Kerbin and very stable in flight. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve stalled her once yet. She can carry a crew of six to my HKO research station(also pictured for fun and still under construction). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/cxUF7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

For most of your ascent, keep the nose at 20-30 degrees. Once the intake air starts to get very scarce(below 0.4), level out until you\u0027re draining 0.01 or 0.00 but still climbing slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the engine flames out, Action Group 1 switches engine modes from air-breathing to rocket and closes all air intakes. Thrust with the nose at around 15-20 degrees until you reach your desired apoapsis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are out of the atmosphere, transfer all of the fuel from the two wing-mounted tanks into the two center tanks. DO NOT DO THIS DURING FLIGHT OR A BURN. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen simply warp to AP and raise your PE. Also don\u0027t forget to deploy those solar panels located on the tail with Action Group 3. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction Group 2 toggles the engine on and off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ELANDING\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your mission goals are accomplished, burn retrograde for return. It\u0027s better to undershoot than overshoot KSC as she can glide with no fuel for 50-100km with ease from 12km up and you should have some fuel left over to fly even further powered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are lined up with the runway, feel free to deploy the gear. There are a lot in case your landing isn\u0027t quite perfect. Action Groups 4 and 5 are the two sets of air brakes. I use them more for when I am going to overshoot KSC but they are sometimes useful for landing as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your first landing, I wouldn\u0027t go for the runway. As lovely as H.E.K.O. is, she doesn\u0027t have a great about of yaw control. I also wouldn\u0027t recommend landing at night but there are a ton of lights in case you need to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods Required: AIES, B9, MechJeb2, NovaPunch2, Ferram Aerospace Research, Procedural Wings, and Stretchy Tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ENote: Far is only listed as required because I haven\u0027t tested it in stock.
