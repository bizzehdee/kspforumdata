Yes, their international heroship did cause them to lose out on other flights. the Soviets were actually afraid to send Gagarin on any other flights due to fear of losing their hero. He eventually served as the backup crew for Soyuz 1 which tragically crashed. After the crash of Soyuz 1, Gagarin was permanently banned from training for and participating in further spaceflights. He later died in a routine flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T22:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESenator John Glenn did fly to space again, on STS-95.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe specifically decided to leave the program himself after Mercury to run for political office.
