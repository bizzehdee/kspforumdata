The kerbal fell off the ladder. As the pod was pointing prograde, when he let loose, the kerbal oriented north-south to the pod\u0027s east-west (in other words, the pod was sideways, and the kerbal\u0027s head was pointing at the ladder/hatch). I thought that reorienting the camera would cause the kerbal to reorient to match, but weirdly enough, he wouldn\u0027t in pitch. He could turn (yaw), translate up/down/left/right/forward/back, but not roll or pitch. Am I missing something, or is this a change? (I could have sworn in earlier versions of KSP that the kerbal could do these movements with the RCS pack.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceToast","CreatedById":97389,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T12:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried the \u0022click-drag mouse\u0022 way, but as soon as I touch the rcs controls, the kerbal flips back to his original head/toe orientation.

Reorienting the camera with right-click \u002B drag is SUPPOSED to reorient all EVA movement axes as well, but sometimes it just doesn\u0027t for pitch. Very annoying. I have no idea why, although it might be the EVA version of the same glitch that locks up the controls of a ship sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, when it happens to me, sometimes I can cure the problem by using [ and ] to switch to the ship and then back to the Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 2 precautions you can take to minimize the problems this causes if it happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Before going on EVA, orient the ship so the parts you\u0027ll be dealing with on EVA are all visible so you don\u0027t have to fly around the ship, just move along it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Put a probe core on EVERY ship. That way, if nothing else works, you can switch from the Kerbal to the ship and reorient the ship to bring a ladder into the same orientation as the Kerbal is stuck in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceToast","CreatedById":97389,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T13:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood call on the probe core.

Kerbal\u0027s helmet is always along the axis around which the camera rotates, so in orbital view it\u0027s along the planet\u0027s rotational axis (head North, legs South), and in free view it is legs towards the planet and head away from it. These two directions are the same only when you\u0027re in polar orbit near either of poles. And in that case all you need is to switch to free view and wait a bit till you get further from the pole.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
