If you do buy more ram, or do buy a better GPU, then I would recommend re-installing windows and choosing to make that a 64bit install while you do so you remove the memory ceiling while your at it. until then, leave windows as it is, your not hurting anything. If you reformat for any reason in the near future, you may as well go 64 bit then, there\u0027s pretty much no reason not to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E32bit becomes a problem when your system ram, AND your GPU VRam total more than 4gb. If it does, since 32bit can ONLY address 4gb, then the GPU takes its share, and leaves you whatever addresses are left, so with a GPU that has 3gb of VRam, then your only going to have 1gb for windows and programs, doesn\u0027t matter if you have 4gb in your system or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you buy a new GPU, do not hesitate to move up to 64bit or you could find yourself with less ram to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-31T19:14:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2013 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Amram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
