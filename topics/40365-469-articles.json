Because the thermal rockets were the only thing you could attach directly to the reactor to provide propulsion, they had to be something of a catch-all item that represented a lot of concept. With the introduction of the magnetic nozzles, thermal rockets can go back to what they were originally intended to be - a rocket where the propellant is directly heated by the reactor. That means their specific impulse is constrained by whatever heat transfer mechanism you have in place. That means, in the next update you\u0027ll be seeing many of the specific impulses produced by the fusion reactors going down and thrusts going up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get big specific impulses with the fusion reactors, you\u0027ll be needing to use the new magnetic nozzles. These direct the charged products from the fusion reaction into an expanding magnetic field, they encounter and ionise propellant as they are injected and the charged products are directed out of the magnetic nozzle without ever touching a solid part (which avoids any irritating melting that might otherwise go on with super-high temperature exhaust gases). This suddenly means that the thermal power output of the fusion reactors is much less important if you\u0027re going for an endurance mission - you want lots of charged power instead. The magnetic nozzle is unique in that it requires not only a supply of charged particles to function, it also requires some electrical power to produce the huge magnetic fields required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also significantly changed the performance of the other fusion fuel modes (to make D-He3 and He3 better), I\u0027ve also altered the amount of fusion fuel that the reactors consume - correctly the figures are about 3x too big. So, all in all, there will be a lot of improvements to fusion in the next update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also finally adds a real purpose to the dusty plasma reactor, which suddenly becomes the earliest way to get a ship with the magnetic nozzle and consequently large specific impulse (albeit with unispiring thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rayXQx6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rayXQx6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iG50jw6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iG50jw6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N8xvYwj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022N8xvYwj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/valduNC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022valduNC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T03:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been nosing around this awesome mod lately, and that magnetic nozzle thing might win me over completely.
