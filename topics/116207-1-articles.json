One is all engines and the other is one center engine. To do this I had them have different transforms but I can\u0027t figure out how to add the Launch smoke FX. When I try to add it, it just plays automatically and doesn\u0027t stop. Is it possible to have launch smoke for something like this?"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T03:36:49Z","Content":"Hi there! Yep, this is totally possible. Take a look at the SpaceY \u0022M9\u0022 engine, if you want an example. I did exactly what you\u0027re trying to do.\n\nThe key with the ground effect is that you need two of them, keyed to the correct modules in your config. For example, in the M9 engine, it looks like this:\n\n    \tMODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleSurfaceFX\t\tthrustProviderModuleIndex = 1\t\tfxMax = 0.9\t\tmaxDistance = 50\t\tfalloff = 1.8\t\tthrustTransformName = thrustTransform\t}\tMODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleSurfaceFX\t\tthrustProviderModuleIndex = 2\t\tfxMax = 0.6\t\tmaxDistance = 40\t\tfalloff = 1.8\t\tthrustTransformName = centerTransform\t}\n\nI haven\u0027t done much experimenting (beyond adding it and seeing that it worked on my engines), but it looks like the \u0022thrustProviderModuleIndex \u0022 numbers start counting at \u00221\u0022, referring to the first \u0022ModuleEngines\u0022 or \u0022ModuleEnginesFX\u0022, and incrementing from there.\n\nMake sure they reference the correct thrust transforms. Having them both point to the same transforms, or having only one of these to begin with, will have the \u0022always on\u0022 effect you described."},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T04:53:30Z","Content":"Thank you!
