Instead you should have grouped the helipad model and then layed it on top of the roof to keep the poly not creating additional unnecessary edges:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZueG2K4.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022ZueG2K4.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI solved this problem by erasing the roof plane and making a new poly with just 2 quads /4 tris (I made 2 quads here cause the plane is big and to prevent potential collision problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XH5awvs.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022XH5awvs.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, you created stairs with a lot of detail in the mesh. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is better to make stairs just as one slope with a stair looking texture. but lets keep it this way as you\u0027ve made it and lets focus on making a proper collider for them. As these will be all mesh colliders you certainly won\u0027t be able to walk over these stairs in KSP, cause the polys are too small, and too close together (the back sides of each step). The collision with the Kerbal would just be too buggy, he would fall over, go through stairs or bounce around.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you need to do is make a separate much less poly collision model that will not be rendered:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UD7tue5.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022UD7tue5.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I did here is make 3 simple low poly meshes that cover the stairs (red) and the railings (blue), I will merge them later (just made them separate so you can see), put a mesh collider in Unity and MAKE THEM INVISIBLE, so that you see the original stairs mesh, but you actually \u0022interact\u0022 with the proxy collider. Should be no problems now.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for colliders, they need to be as low poly as possible, but not larger than 200m, cause then Kerbals tend to sink through. Also a lot of collision faces slows down the game and when KC gets more developed it would certainly choke it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Not only that you have merged helipads with the roof poly, but you have merged each step of the stairs to the side.
