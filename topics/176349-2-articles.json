For one, there\u0027s no story. Sequels can serve to continue a story. There is no story to continue. Another thing is that KSP is in continuous development. Many games are developed, have some expansions/DLC developed, and then the developers move on to another game. Eventually the company gets around to making a sequel to change up the formula or do something else like improve the gameplay or squeeze out more cash from the franchise.

Why 2.0 when we can just get it in a DLC and keep our saves and not have to pay again and then we still get updates. Honestly this is like SW battlefront HOW MANY DO WE NEED? I would pay for this stuff but I\u0027m not going to fly around and re-establish All my space stations. We spend a ton of time doing these stuff why do it again for things that can be in DLC.

Why? Because the first game wasn\u0027t successful enough to warrant one. As is the case for KSP, as much as we\u0027d like that not to be the case. Sure, KSP was successful a while back, but the long term development of KSP means the costs are pretty high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSequels are made when they are warranted, and when they will generate profits. KSP2 likely won\u0027t, if a new engine is used to make it. If it\u0027s built on Unity, it may work out, but again, the benefits will be minimal. KSP doesn\u0027t warrant a sequel for many reasons. For one, there\u0027s no story. Sequels can serve to continue a story. There is no story to continue. Another thing is that KSP is in continuous development. Many games are developed, have some expansions/DLC developed, and then the developers move on to another game. Eventually the company gets around to making a sequel to change up the formula or do something else like improve the gameplay or squeeze out more cash from the franchise. A game in continuous development is a different dynamic, and unless KSP is ever finished (officially, that is), then it will never get a sequel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to say I wouldn\u0027t like to see a KSP2, but the likelihood of it happening is so small that we\u0027ll never get it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlenty of games have no story and get sequels: civilization and sim city come to mind. And I don\u0027t think a hypothetical KSP 2 should be in continuos development. TBH, I don\u0027t even understand the business logic of it. I\u0027m not rebuying KSP 1 again, so while I appreciate the continuos develop (and resent the beta status of versions after 1.0), they aren\u0027t getting more money from me.

So if one does get interested in to space and orbital mechanics, everybody with a potato can join the club without needing an initial investment in a \u0027game playing specification\u0027 PC or laptop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat potato computer? Sure, you don\u0027t need a powerful graphic card, but keep throwing parts at it and it becomes Kerbal Slideshow Program unless you have an overclocked i7. And I\u0027m playing it with an overclocked i5-3570k, which is hardly potato. One of the reasons is the engine and the design philosophy: if I have a large ship in orbit, with engines off, or a large base, KSP still runs physics calculation for every part, even if nothing has changed in the vessel. That\u0027s incredibly inefficient. And even in space, the simulation could probably run a check of the effects of the common maneuvers (ie, would fire the engines break the ship or will it hold steady? If it holds, don\u0027t run any calculation while the engines are running). To correct these things, we need KSP 2 instead of keep patching up KSP 1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-03T23:15:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223427315\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176349\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221533333946\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105344\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022juanml82\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, juanml82 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsnip\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI concur with things such as these.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-06T15:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough I think KSP1 lacks significantly and needs a lot more content before it\u0027s abandoned for a sequel-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second T2 entered the picture, in my mind KSP\u0027s fate was sealed.
