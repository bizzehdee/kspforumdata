Example: Kopernicus 1.0.3 was the first version built for KSP 1.1.2, so running that version (or later) of Kopernicus in KSP 1.1.0 will not work. I\u0027m not sure where you can find a KSP 1.1.2 version, but the latest version of NH (v2.0) was built for the (coincidentally numbered) version 1.1.2 of Kopernicus running in KSP 1.1.2."},{"CreatedByName":"ayli","CreatedById":162642,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T21:18:42Z","Content":"Just tried out New Horizons with the latest Kopernicus release.
