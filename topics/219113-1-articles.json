I wanted to do an Apollo-Style mission where my lander is docked to a command module and re-docks after Munar\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003Elanding and ascent.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI couldn\u0027t quite remember how Apollo did it so I ended up placing docking ports on my lander and CM and connecting them up in the builder, so the lander was upside down. I\u0027m not sure how to post a picture since I\u0027m on console and posting here from mobile, but I think you\u0027ll get the picture. Fast forward and I manage to build my biggest and most complicated rocket ever, the launch goes surprisingly well and I\u0027m in low Munar orbit with plenty of delta-v on each craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI messed up the staging as the port was one or two stages up from my CM engine and I didn\u0027t want to risk messing it all up, so I tried to manually undock the ports. It would only let me highlight and bring up the context menu for the CM port. There was no \u0027undock\u0027 option, only a \u0027disable docking node\u0027 or something to that effect so I selected that. Something went wrong as the craft would not seperate and were ocsillating very weirdly (my scientist had transferred over, the lander had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E enable and a probe core on it so control wasn\u0027t the issue, it just moved the CM as well). I reloaded, moved the staged port down below the engine and staged and the same thing happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI reloaded to a quicksave halfway to the Mun and adjusted my trajectory to a free return to Kerbin. When I got there I manually activated the decoupler below my CM so I ended up with the Mk2 command pod and a lander docked above it. Curiously, when I got to about 30km and the rest of the lander had exploded (only a lander can attached) I found that the docking port had an \u0027undock\u0027 option and it worked, thus leaving me with just the command pod and able to activate the chutes, and land safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone give any insight as to why this happened? I assume it\u0027s something funky happening with the fact that they started off docked but I didn\u0027t imagine that should create any issues. I\u0027m going to tweak the whole thing to make it more accurate to Apollo 11, where my lander is stored beneath the CM and I flip the CM, dock to and extract the lander en route to the Mun, but I was just curious where I went wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, any build tips for pulling off the above? I haven\u0027t started yet but can\u0027t quite figure out how I\u0027m going to configure the craft correctly. Do I need to attach the lander to the stage below or will it just sit within the fairing/assembly? How do I make sure I can extract it once the CM is docked? Many thanks and sorry for such a long post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit - think I figured out the lander stuff. Lander is attached by the port to a decoupler attatched to CM engine. Once in orbit decoupler below lander is staged, and the CM and lander decouple via custom action group (just to make the staging abit simpler).\u00A0 From there flip around, dock the two craft, and do Trans-Munar injection burn. Hopefully there won\u0027t be issues with the ports not handling the acceleration? Can\u0027t imagine so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery excited as this is the craziest build I\u0027ve done so far and it seems like it\u0027s going to go well. Never thought I\u0027d get here, up till now the most advanced things I\u0027ve done on my own are returning science from low Munar orbit and rescuing a Kerbal from a pretty crazy inclined Munar orbit. I\u0027d never even used any parts bigger than the 1.25m ones. Now I\u0027ve got a pretty stable 155 ton, 32.5m tall rocket that can comfortably put at least 13tons of payload into a high Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTutorials help of course, big thanks to these forums and Mike Aben over on Youtube.
