Heavy off road vehice does not sound good for any kind of competition and racing because I wanted higher speed cars which should be easy to control.

I dont understand why would be hard to learn the track with marked track? It should be even more easy because all players are forced to go between 2 marked lines, you can do as many laps as you want and then turn on trail when you want to set the time.

I dont have plan to go straight to hill because it is more complicated , specialy climbing and power and some lacks of grip.
