I\u0027m running into some confusing Kerbal measurements that don\u0027t add up in my physics calculations.\n\nT^2^ = 4\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC^2^(Semi-Major Axis)^3^ / (GM\u003Csub\u003EKerbin\u003C/sub\u003E )\n\nSemi Major Axis = 12.7 million Meters (Apoapsis at the moon\u0027s radius, Periapsis about 100km above Kerbin\u0027s surface)\n\nWhen I put the above into the formula, I calculate an orbital period around 155,000 seconds. However, when I actually fly this in Kerbal I get an orbital period around 189,000 seconds. \n\nBig Difference.\n\nDoes anybody here know why? \n\nThank you!"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T04:24:46Z","Content":"SEMI-major axis is only half of the length of the long axis of the ellipse."},{"CreatedByName":"Torsen","CreatedById":140584,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T04:51:10Z","Content":"Thanks Brotoro. There\u0027s one stupid mistake down. \n\nHowever now I\u0027m even farther away from the measured orbital period of roughly 189,000 seconds.\n\nNow I\u0027m looking at 53,500 seconds for a full orbit, which still isn\u0027t correct.\n\n![50f9cad0c149bd3fe30446a17b834884.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/0/f/50f9cad0c149bd3fe30446a17b834884.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T05:01:10Z","Content":"Also...When I just flew that orbit (100 km above Kerbin, out to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s orbit, and back), I measured an orbital period of 53,506 seconds."},{"CreatedByName":"Torsen","CreatedById":140584,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T05:03:06Z","Content":"I\u0027m batting a thousand tonight.
