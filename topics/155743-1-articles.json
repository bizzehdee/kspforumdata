The wiki states I need \u0022100kW\u00A0of cooling\u0022 and 9 panels of \u002212500\u0022 (assuming watts here) equals 112.5kW right? So why is my drill not running at 100%? 3 cooling panels are directly attached to the fuel tank the drill is attached to, the other 6 panels are attached to a round fuselage (is it called that way?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also see my other probe attached, that only had 2 small thermal panels but it also stays as 1,5% (so that is why I launched the 2nd ship)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-29T13:33:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo sorry.

I read the bug report (and have experienced a couple of those problems here and there), but I can\u0027t see the lower-right corner of your screen, so I was wondering if you have an engineer on board. A four-star engineer and 1 thermal control per drill usually does the trick for me.

I tried the \u0022fix\u0022 suggested in the bug report (UseSpecialistBonus = false) and that seems to work.
