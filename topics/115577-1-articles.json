Docking is too easy. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, if you and your target are in simple orbits, all you have to do is make an intercept node, and then null your velocity when you get close. The nav-ball nodes make this incredibly easy, and as long as your Kerbals have their autopilot levels maxed out, it\u0027s super easy. You can pretty much dock completely by the nav-ball in most cases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Antenna are boring.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no need for multiple antenna currently. There\u0027s no incentive to really deck out your vessel with multiple antenna and greeble, as any more than one are redundant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to make classes of parts that enable certain information that would be relevant to a docking scenario tied to different parts you can add to your vessel. All these parts would be different and separate from the stock antennae. Stock antenna would still function only as science transmission antennae. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to model my idea on the the IGLA model of rendezvous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/RvDRadar/RndVradarsP.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022RndVradarsP.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part classes would be these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETracking Antennae:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy default, a vessel\u0027s orbit is visible from the tracking station, but it\u0027s current \u003Cem\u003Eposition\u003C/em\u003E in that orbit is not visible without a tracking antenna. With this antenna, the ground, and other vessels would be able to see a vessel\u0027s position in an orbit. This would be a low-level part available VERY early in the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETelemetry Antennae: Send/Recieve\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo vessels attempting to rendezvous will need sending and receiving capabilities. Depending on which craft is passive, and which craft is on active approach, the need for certain antenna will change, but generally, both parties will need both antennae. This ability allows a vessel to see and target another vessel, and know it\u0027s orbital speed, but not relative speed. In low-tiers, this will be to separate antennae, in higher-tiers, this will be a single, smaller antenna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVessel Range Finder:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis device allows the distance to a vessel to be seen, and it\u0027s relative speed. Range finders do not need to be in pairs. Only the active craft needs one to see distance to target. The docking target MUST be targeted in order for it\u0027s distance from your vessel to be seen. This also is needed to see distance to an asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERadar Altimeter.\u003C/strong\u003E For planetary bodies, a radar altimeter will be required to see distance from he surface in IVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of the information in KSP we take for granted, and I think it\u0027d be a neat immersion thing to really flesh out docking in KSP, and make it fairly immersive. I\u0027m not sure how this would work with probes, or on other planetary bodies. WIP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs hiding certain information, and making select parts enable specific pieces of information in the UI possible? I\u0027ve currently got a VERY small parts add-on that this plugin would support. I\u0027m really new to add-on creation, and I\u0027d love to take a stab at this.
