I have a lander with a tourist \u0026amp; pilot on the north pole of Duna and I am unable to get them to all the way back to orbit to rendezvous with the \u0022go back home\u0022 ship. (My vehicle\u00A0setup is a carbon copy of Apollo configuration; Saturn V rocket stages, with separate CM \u0026amp; LM modules. So right now the LM (or \u0022DM\u0022 in this case!) is sitting nicely at the pole, and the CM is waiting patiently in a polar orbit.\u00A0I had previously already tested this setup on Duna, and it was fine for an equatorial landing and re-ascent to orbit but I\u0027ve found out the hard way that I need much more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to make it back to orbit from the north pole.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned, the lander is based on Apollo\u0027s LM so is made up of a terrier engine descent stage (that still has fuel remaining), separator, and the ascent stage is an MEM with a poodle engine. There is a docking port on the top of the MEM.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the tourist can\u0027t EVA, I can\u0027t land a new ship nearby to pick them up. Neither can I land a rover, drive them elsewhere, and take off from there on a new ship - again because the tourist can\u0027t EVA. So I am stuck with having to somehow physically get the existing LM/DM back to orbit with the tourist inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne potential solution I am thinking of\u00A0is to build a tall \u0022heavy lift\u0022 rover on vertically extendable hydraulic wheels, land it near the LM/DM, park it over it, pick it up by mating a docking port on the underside of the rover with the one on the top of the MEM,\u00A0and then drive it\u00A0to the equator, drop it off so that it can attempt to take off to orbit from there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tested this solution at the space center with the same lander\u00A0and an initial design for the Heavy Lift Rover and\u00A0it seems to work fine in theory on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s runway. But considering I\u0027d have to somehow land this monster rover on Duna, then drive it all the way to the equator seems daunting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s basically it. Am I overthinking this and have overlooked a very basic solution, or is there any other way to solve this one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want to abandon the tourist as he is part of a much larger contract, and also the satisfaction of solving this one would be immense.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-25T09:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199764-halam/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022199764\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199764-halam/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Halam\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve moved your question to gameplay questions.

I\u0027m sure that you cannot get into an equatorial orbit, but if you burn to the azimutal direction of your orbit-prograde vector (which will change during your ascent) you might get into some kind of orbit. (At the poles the rule-of-thumb of burning to 90 deg azimuth is not particularly efficient.) Once you are in any kind of orbit, rescue missions become a lot easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise the simplest solution is probably indeed what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160462-james-kerman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022160462\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160462-james-kerman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@James Kerman\u003C/a\u003E suggested. If there is some ore at the pole, then I\u0027d suggest to make it a mining refueler, i.e. don\u0027t bring the fuel directly, but bring an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E / drill / thermal-management / solar-panel set. It might be actually lighter than bringing the fuel and it has the advantage that newly generated fuel is not limited by the fuel transfer rules that might prevent you from pumping fuel through the Klaw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like your idea of picking up the rocket and driving it to the equator, very Kerbal! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E But probably also quite hard (Aligning two docking ports on the surface isn\u0027t easy!) and tedious (Driving on the surface all the way from the poles to the equator will take a long time.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther solutions would be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDon\u0027t dock a ground-transportation rover to your craft, but a lifting rover that can lift it into orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDock (via the Klaw) a rover with an ascent stage that can get into orbit on its own. Once you are attached via the Klaw, then you can transfer them to the new craft. (Yes, Kerbals can crawl through a Klaw. Don\u0027t ask me how!)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSame as your idea, but use a (solar powered?) plane and not a rover. Flying on Duna is not easy, but can be done. If the plane is radio-controlled (i.e. a probe with no Kerbals in it) you could also use it to give yourself a little bit of extra delta-V by launching from the air and not landing first.
