How it took me from my first attempt at the game and giving up immediately, because it was seemingly too hard, and then to re-try almost a year later and become completely hooked was an absolute revelation. I realize now that it was and still is, down to all of you, Everyone on this forum has contributed to my fascination and enjoyment of this game, because the forum is a constant provider of information and inspiration and I would never have thought that such a seemingly simple game would have the resources of so many great minds of engineers, physicians, aerodynamics, and all things space related and even more things I never even thought about to get a tin can into space, I am indebted to you all for giving an enjoyment of a game I never thought I would give a second chance...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: I have only managed to land on the mun, so the Kerbalverse awaits...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T22:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to KSP Discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand how you feel, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73642-glibbo/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002273642\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73642-glibbo/\u0022\u003E@glibbo\u003C/a\u003E...
