So off i go and install that, but upon loading and getting back into the game still no Mars, Venus or Mercury, and also no new planets etc from Outer Planets Mod (i go no errors and i followed the installation instructions about clearing out ALL of the Cache folder from the Kopernicus Mod). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at this point I figure its the building that needs upgrading so I upgrade that to the next stage and still nothing, i can\u0027t expand it to the next one after that as its 580K, but surely if i can see all the way out to Neptune and far in as the sun i should be able to see Mars, Venus and Mercury, please please PLEASE help what has gone wrong, why are those 3 and the ones from Outer Planets not loading? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso this is a list of other Addon\u0027s which was installed before RSS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (all are the latest version of themselves)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Required: Kopernicus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: Kopernicus Expantion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAstronomer\u0027s Visual Pack - Interstellar V2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActive Texture Management (Aggressive Release)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanet Shine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexture Replacer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistant Object Enhancement (although Since the RSS was installed the icon\u0027s to use this have gone, So i haven\u0027t messed with this mod while RSS has been running)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance for any help you or the community can offer and i REALLY hope it can get resolved as i LOVE this mod (I used it from the get go pre- Version 1.0\u002B)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso am i right in assuming the mods to introduce new systems (Boris, Sentar, Sigma, Trans-Keptunian and Other Worlds mod) work with RSS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E They don\u0027t.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vitavoro","CreatedById":150809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T02:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rabada\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rabada\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is probably what\u0027s causing your problem. do a clean install without these two mods.

But at least with Realism Overhaul, building something small that goes into orbit isn\u0027t particularly hard, and doesn\u0027t require huge parts - real life fuels and engines provide much more delta-v than the parts in the stock game (mostly because the parts in the stock game have been gimped so achieving the measly 3500 dV you need to get into Kerbin orbit is still some sort of a challenge). You can build a multi-stage sounding rocket that manages to bring something Sputnik-like into LEO...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
