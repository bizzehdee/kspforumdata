I believe it is also part of the design to have a second piece also connected by cables that acts as a counterweight, but I might be making things up (seems like a second piece would fall behind in orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, it is perfectly possible to make things move up through a \u0027magical pressure differential\u0027. I invite you to cut a strip of paper, hold one end right under your lips, and blow a stream of air through your lips. The paper will rise up and flutter as it moves in and out of your air stream. The moving air lowers the pressure enough that the air under the paper is able to push it up. You\u0027d be hard pressed to make a plane fly with only this, but it can help. Otherwise we wouldn\u0027t make aircraft with shaped wings, since they create extra drag by increasing the surface area for friction to act on, and create a larger leading edge which requires pushing more air out of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sneakeypete","CreatedById":3989,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-25T03:26:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^ do you think maybe you could just listen to multiple moderators and other people saying that you should discuss that elsewhere, instead of trying to get the last word in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly: I wonder if the interesting 4 engine design on that lander on the new mun textures made possible by the new centre of gravity/centre of thrust indicators?
