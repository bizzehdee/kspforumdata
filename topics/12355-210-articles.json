(and Deadly Reentry plugin, which can kill crew or destroy vehicle parts at very high acceleration, but that\u0027s the point)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf flying manually (without mechjeb), there\u0027s no problem: at around 40 m/s2 I slowly turn down the throttle so the vehicle stays under 5g, until the engine hits 1000 kN and cannot be throttled any lower. After that g-force keeps rising for some time until the stage expires. That\u0027s normal and expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith mechjeb, the throttle goes down normally at first, but near the bottom of throttle gauge, MJ starts to turn the engine on and off very rapidly. This violent shaking, especially with high thrust engines, sometimes can rip the rocket apart, make it uncontrollable, not to mention that real rockets don\u0027t work that way. Checking \u0022smooth throttle\u0022 doesn\u0027t prevent this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, just switch \u0022limit to...\u0022 off? But then Mechjeb won\u0027t throttle back at all, not even to 50%. Manually throttle? I wish I could, Mechjeb won\u0027t allow me while it has control. Right now the only option seems to right-click the engine and use the \u0022thrust limiter\u0022 slider so throttle always stays higher than 50% (in the above example). But that only works if I have one engine, what if I have 5 of them? Another option is to quickly change numbers in \u0022limit to...\u0022 as the acceleration rises, but then it\u0027s actually more hassle than just to fly without Mechjeb at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I miss some option which turns this off? Or if it\u0027s a bug, can I ask very kindly to fix it? It seems that one option would be telling Mechjeb not to limit engines below their minThrust, and the other option is to add a \u0022manual throttle control\u0022 interface button which will allow for, well, manual throttle control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ratzap","CreatedById":75982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T21:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zyglrox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zyglrox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid I miss some option which turns this off?
