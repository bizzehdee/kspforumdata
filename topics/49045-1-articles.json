So, I was landing on Minimus, and naturally I quick saved before I began my decent to the surface. About 3 real hours later, I finally got enough parts and I was going to go to Duna. This time, I forgot to auto-save, and I had a rough touch down. The craft wasn\u0027t flyable anymore, so I reloaded a quick save, forgetting that I forgot (heh). My idiocy isn\u0027t the point of this post. The point is, upon reloading (f9), I was sent back to the quick save on Minimus... I immediately closed down KSP in an hope that it wouldn\u0027t save, but nope. My old save was \u0027poof\u0027 gone, and I was sent 3 hours back, same tech as I did before the Minimus landing. Really quite infuriating. An easy fix would be to have quick saves missions specific. Also I should note that this 3 hours was over the past 15 hours, so I did open and close the game many times before the incident occured. Hope you guys can work something out, and I\u0027ll work on getting those 3 hours back. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T21:46:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay since this isn\u0027t really a bug and more a suggestion, I\u0027ll move this to the development suggestion forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stormy1997","CreatedById":38554,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T22:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI disagree...
