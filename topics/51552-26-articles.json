Especially when you have to swap craft to restore signal. I recall a tracking system from Satcomm School that uses something like five receiver pads arranged in a plus formation that can lock the dish onto even the weakest of signals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about a component that does the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComponent is a low power signal receiver, omnidirectional reception. It\u0027s function is to automatically direct an onboard antenna towards any vessel that \u0027targets it\u0027 with another dish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETargeting rules are simple:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETargeting must be done from a controllable, active vessel Via dish pointing at IT. (That vessel, specifically.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExisting Dish on receiving vehicle must have range, and not be occupied. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the dish is occupied, (Told specifically to target something) it will ignore it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is offline, it will automatically activate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the link is broken by the dish being aimed at it for any reason, the receiver dish returns whatever condition it was in prior to link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part itself is passive, it requires power, but a very small amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What does this part do?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: The part allows an active vessel (such as a player command ship) to point a dish at another vehicle that is not occupied with a connection. Essentially using any unconnected directional antenna as a ready-to-link receiver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: If the part is on board a long range probe, it can be used to \u0027link\u0027 the probe even if you were a dolt and forgot to aim its onboard antenna or turn it on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: It can be used to conserve power by allowing a probe antenna to be shut down until the uplink signal gets picked up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: It allows you to place commsats up in \u0027standby\u0027 by not having the dish aimed at anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What are some Caveats?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: You MUST have an existing vessel aim a DISH type antenna at the receiver. It will not respond to omnidirectional signal noise.(I explain Why*)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: This device must be on the target vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: This device will not help you connect to a vessel that has lost contact but has already been aimed at somewhere else. (Manually selected aim takes priority of an automatic signal call.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: You cannot aim \u0027at a planet\u0027 to call an unoccupied dish. You have to pick a target. (Because you have to beam a very powerful \u0027handshake signal\u0027 to catch the omnidirectional detector.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The receiver is a set of surfaces containing four receiver pads on each surface. The receiver listens for a specific, very basic timing signal on any of these pad groups. When a signal is detected, it identifies the source direction by comparing the signal strength across each pad. Any satellite antenna with automatic tracking contains this setup in the horn for establishing a continuous lock with a target and does not require focusing of the signal from the reflector to operate. It does however, require initial guidance when pointing. However, creating a device with is essentially a sphere covered in these pads can produce the same targeting feature, but with a very large field of view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T07:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother suggestion is you could do like I have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have one long range dish on each of my communications satellites that orbit Kerbin.
