Two, the more IVA\u0027s your parts have, and as a corollary, the more Kerbals you have in your vessel in flight, the more these factors will generate lag.  I\u0027ve encountered both in several mods that I\u0027ve had or still have.  In Lionhead Aerospace, for instance, almost every animated part in that mod generates so much lag that the mod is essentially unusable for me.  Radiators, solar panels, even the iris on the heatshield causes me major problems.  I also get a lot of lag when I use a lot of FusTek Station parts, this time because Sumghai, like this mod, likes to create very detailed IVA\u0027s, and once I get more than 4 or 5 FusTek parts on my craft in the editor, it really starts to chug my PC.\n\nAnyway, I haven\u0027t really had the time to play around with this mod very much because I\u0027ve been focusing on SpacePlane and mapping probe construction lately, but if this mod is causing a lot of lag for certain folks, I\u0027m almost certain that it will be due to the large number of (and the details within) the IVA models and textures that the game has to process and render for every frame, even though we don\u0027t see them at all in the editor, and barely at all even in flight, for most of us.  I don\u0027t think that the texture size has much to do with anything, because active texture management (if you use it, as I do) compresses IVA textures just like any other, unless they\u0027re DDS format, of course, but even then that doesn\u0027t seem to matter.  It boils down to the simple facts:  The more IVA\u0027s you have on your craft, and/or the more animated parts there are, the more lag you will encounter.\n\nI hope this information helps someone.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nLater!  ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"curtquarquesso","CreatedById":42872,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T16:58:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, Mods\\_o\\_joy said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I used The Karmony Module with a hub adapter, \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also i tried running it with Eighth Res Texture\u0027s and No Anti-Al\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ve got the latest build, and I\u0027m not seeing any NullReferenceException spam, and no noticeable FPS hits in the VAB when manipulating the mentioned parts.

When I get around to standardizing the textures across the current parts, I believe I can have all US-based modules (and sleep modules) share the same 2k map. I\u0027ve played around a bit with no normal maps for the parts, but it just looks too flat without them, and I think the normal maps help make the parts look good so that will stay.\n\nRemoving normals from the IVAs was a huge help with reducing the memory footprint as well, but the IVAs still could use a bit of optimizing themselves.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, curtquarquesso said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2K textures could cause performance drops, and if you\u0027re not wanting to run half-res textures, it\u0027d be nice for [@cxg2827](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57380-cxg2827/) to throw some half-res textures out there, but probably not too important at the moment.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ll be reducing the external textures to 1k after the textures are closer to \u0022final\u0022 since testing shows the quality doesn\u0027t take much of a hit with the 1/2 compression.
