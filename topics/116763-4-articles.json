The first time we send astronauts back to the Moon we\u0027ll have a self-replicating factory for them to operate. So what if it takes 50 years to get there? It makes technical and economic sense.

We can send lightweight robot probes to study our solar system in the meantime, and stay in low earth orbit until it makes economic sense to go elsewhere.\u003Cp\u003EA self replicating factory - note there\u0027s intermediate versions of it, basically a roomful of 3d printers and CNC machines that need a constant supply of tiny high end parts like ball bearings and microchips - also makes the rockets to do all this a lot cheaper as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EOk. You win ten lotteries at once and become a billionaire. You look for something that can be manufactured at the Moon. Ideally, something light and valuable. Let\u0027s say (and I don\u0027t know) that manufacturing microchips in the Moon is, from an engineering viewpoint, feasible. You take your newly found fortune, you buy AMD and you move the factories to self replicating factories in the Moon\u0027s South Pole. And you begin to manufacture microchips.\u003Cp\u003ENow, here\u0027s the problem: all your customers are on Earth. A reusable vehicle would have to be able to return to the Moon from the Earth. It\u0027s cheaper to build, at the Moon, a vehicle that would go to Earth and doesn\u0027t return, specially if you also build a space elevator at the Moon.

Consider the mid to long term future. With a population of, say, 50 billion, how the hell do you give everybody a car? Or a house? How about with 500 billion? Do we all live as moles under the ground on closed ecologies to preserve some semblance of biosphere under our heads? So, I don\u0027t care what the costs of setting up in space are, or the technological challenges: either we want to keep growing our population like we have always done since the paleolithic and settle in space, or we stay stagnant on Earth until our eventual extinction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThe world\u0027s population will stabilize by the 2050s or so. It will not reach 50 billion, let alone 500 billion.\u003Cp\u003EThe one economic activity that can take place in space is tourism for billionaires. Maybe, if the sabre engine works, launch costs will drop for light payloads. But that\u0027s about it. Real life isn\u0027t Firefly - space is a terribly hostile environment, extremely expensive to reach and which isn\u0027t commercially viable. Even if someone could make the point of (somehow) manufacturing spaceships in space so they don\u0027t need to get out of the Earth\u0027s gravity well, that still begs the question of who\u0027s buying those ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sorry, no, no NASA. Space agencies work as a way for the State to directly invest in strategic, highly valuable manufacturing which produces a lot of jobs and boosts the countries economies (as well as providing a front for military research and procurement - it\u0027s easier to tell the world that your country is developing a civilian, peaceful, rocket to put satellites in LEO than to announce an ICBM program). Take away the economy boosting effect of space programs by moving manufacturing to places where the country nationals won\u0027t be working, and that space agency has just lost a huge reason to invest that money.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T15:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBe carefull about those population asumptions.
