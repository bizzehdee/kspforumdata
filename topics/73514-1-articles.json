There\u0027s some pretty neat stuff in there. My favorite thing so far is my Space Truck, which is a 10t spaceplane with an articulating, extending arm with a camera and winch on the end. When not in use, the arm folds up nice and neat behind the cockpit, and can be strutted down more securely if the slight wobble bothers you (very slight, even while maneuvering). The winch has a 50m cable, and can be fired like a cannon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my Space Truck\u0027s \u0022docking\u0022 procedure is to fly up to the station, point the winch cannon at the station, and fire. It\u0027s also quite good at rescue missions, easily capturing ships which don\u0027t even have docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
