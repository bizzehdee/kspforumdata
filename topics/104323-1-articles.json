Team combat and positioning can do wonders. For example, I was a flagship that specialized in tanking going with a corvette repair ship against 3 others, 1 long range sniper, 1 mid range artillery destroyer and another flagship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to duck behind asteroids and rocks to approach the sniper out of her view, then blast her from the side - the sniper only has a huge front rail gun and is horrible when being attacked anywhere else than the front, but she is watched by the artillery destroyer. So I have to soak up the damage and kill her, before rushing to the destroyer with afterburner, while the corvette heal me from behind. The covette then disable the destroyer\u0027s ability, so she can\u0027t deploy bombers and missiles to wreck me from afar. I then position myself behind the destroyer where only 1 of the cannon can point at me, and release my barrage of flak cannon. The enemy flagship noticed me killing her teammates and return, but she was unable to stun me with flagship ability since the covette disable her again, while I stun the flagship instead, and fly right under her belly. The flagship has heavy armor almost everywhere, except for an area near the engine where coolants and radiators are exposed - in flagship vs flagship combat, whoever is lower win, since the top one can only hit the reinforced armor, while the one below can hit the exposed spot. So I flak that area away, dealing extra damage and hamper her engine\u0027s performance, and cause her to go boom. 2v3 wins!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brethern","CreatedById":15602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T20:54:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PenguinsMeep\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PenguinsMeep\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, a moba needs SOME depth.
