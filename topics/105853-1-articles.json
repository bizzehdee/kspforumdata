I\u0027m not talking the control-input heavy gravity turns of the past, I mean tipping over at the right time and letting drag and gravity do all of the rest of the work for you for a nice stable ascent into space! This really only became possible in 1.0 due to new aero, though.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukeDUn1venA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal007","CreatedById":92253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:14:09Z","Content":"Thanks for sharing this, my son is really having trouble with the new aerodynamic changes since 1.0"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:01:49Z","Content":"More Tutorial!
