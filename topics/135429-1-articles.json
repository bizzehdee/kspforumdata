all.\u00A0 I noticed a rather strange (and briefly alarming) occurrence during my game Monday night, and wanted to ask for input on what might be going on.\u00A0 Also, please note I am still playing v 1.02 by choice (and always immediately turning off Temperature Gauges to work around the memory leak), simply because I can\u0027t abide the universe\u0027s physics changing mid-game.\u00A0 I realize I am intentionally using Nuclear Engines with a pre-radiator game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had launched my 100\u002B tons Duna lander (w/ 8 Nuc engines) into low Duna orbit, and then let it be while I waited for the transfer window to Kerbin.\u00A0 After ~ 100 days I returned to the ship, finding it on the dark side of Duna.\u00A0 It was obviously on the dark side, because in the dark the WHOLE SHIP was glowing cherry red.\u00A0 Every thermometer on the vessel was reading \u002B900 degrees.\u00A0 I watched the temperature climb, expecting that after an orbit or two it would hit 1000 and just explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, as soon as the ship orbited into Sunlight, the temperature immediately started falling.\u00A0 I was later able to burn out of orbit, and am on my way back home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is, is there some aspect of the ship\u0027s exposure to sunlight that could rationally explain what I witnessed, or is this just an earlier version bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy initial search for a known bug did not yield an obvious hit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I do have pictures, hopefully I will have time to post later this week in the \u0022What did you do Today\u0022

what?\u0022 is a legitimate question.\u00A0 It\u0027s not as if it\u0027s worth reporting, since no one can fix 1.0.2 at this point.\u00A0 If you\u0027re interested and motivated, you could try running that same .sfs file through 1.0.5 and see whether the same problem happens, because then you\u0027ll have something a bit more relevant to what\u0027s currently going on in KSP-land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, even better, try it out in KSP 1.1 as soon as you have it available (now, or when the actual release happens) to see if it\u0027s still reproducible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a lot of the water that has gone under the bridge since 1.0.2 involved fixes to the thermal system, so I\u0027m not at all surprised if you\u0027re seeing some thermal weirdness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GarrisonChisholm","CreatedById":146403,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T23:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a very fair answer, and I appreciate such a swift reply.\u00A0 Yes, I was not so much concerned with finding a bug that needed fixing in an old version of the game, but rather just clarification on
