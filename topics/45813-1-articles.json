There\u0027s a good reason why the Apollo missions were constantly leaving mass behind on their way to and from the moon: delta-V is difficult to come by if you don\u0027t. Indeed, it is patently impossible to come by if you never dispose of anything. What you are asking for is basically a craft with infinite fuel to fly around as though delta-V is not a concern. That\u0027s just not going to happen unless you hit Alt\u002BF12 and activate the cheat for it. The best you can hope for is to improve your piloting skills to better land in a pinpoint fashion, and to improve your driving skills so you can rove from site to site. The actual best solution is to develop a mobile craft that only can land and return to orbit instead of having excessive delta-V, and just refuel it after each trip down. But that, of course, will require skill in quite a number of departments (landing, ascent, interception, and docking to name the key ones).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr: Space is hard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T06:48:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry searching fore it.
