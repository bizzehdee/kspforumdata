I\u0027ve been baffled before by the side boosters often hitting my rocket upon separation, which require the installment of sepratron rocket. For sometimes I couldn\u0027t figure out why. I thought maybe it\u0027s some kind of bug, until one day I decided to build a gravity bomb. Upon release, I switch view to the bomb and notice the decoupler\u0027s stub is messing up the airflow. Is there any way to address this issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-24T02:47:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2019 02:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Fadly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-24T06:35:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, use hardpoints instead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve no idea why these are in the Structural group instead of Coupling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey come in two handy sizes, have lower drag than radial decouplers and leave no stub.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFit them (or radial decouplers for that matter) about 1/3 of the way from the top of the stack being decoupled and the the stack will be thrown clear of the remaining craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fadly","CreatedById":187754,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-25T04:13:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223624262\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185775\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221561358139\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113764\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Foxster\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Foxster said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, use hardpoints instead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve no idea why these are in the Structural group instead of Coupling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey come in two handy sizes, have lower drag than radial decouplers and leave no stub.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFit them (or radial decouplers for that matter) about 1/3 of the way from the top of the stack being decoupled and the the stack will be thrown clear of the remaining craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you misunderstand. What I mean is the stub left behind on the discarded side boosters, not on the center booster. hardpoints also leave stub on the discarded parts as well. I experience this when I attempted to build a\u00A0plane with drop tanks.
