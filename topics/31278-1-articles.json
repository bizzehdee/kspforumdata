Since I\u0027ve never actually seen a single episode of Battlestar Galactica, you can mentally change the title to \u0022that one cool looking ship I saw the guy from HOC Gaming recreate recreation\u0022, but that\u0027d be a bit confusing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the ship can do vertical takeoff/landing, horizontal takeoff/landing, airbraking and general badass aerobatics. You can even vertically land without the gear out if you\u0027re careful. I tried my best to have the fuel be dispersed as evenly as possible (so random sets of maneuver boosters don\u0027t die while others are still half full) but I didn\u0027t quite manage it since the rear ones steal fuel from the two lower engines they\u0027re mounted on, and it already has enough random fuel lines. Since the nose is one huge gas tank, and it drains first, you\u0027ll want to refill it from the engines or the mini center gas tank during flight to avoid the plane getting super dodgy as the center of mass shifts back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42951400/screenshot59.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot59.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42951400/screenshot60.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot60.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42951400/screenshot61.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot61.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you load it up you\u0027ll probably realize a ton of part clipping (those dinky wings can\u0027t actually keep it up, I filled the gas tanks with hidden wings) this wasn\u0027t done with the debug menu, the game just let me do it. due to the angle of the main wing it does fly a bit more stably upside down than right way up, so I filled the rear tanks with wings slanted up the other way to counter that effect, and it does okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying instructions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 activates main engines and closes decorative flaps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 activates downward facing engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 activates forward facing engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eclick the button again to deactivate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eturn off main engines and turn on bottom and front engines for very tight turns\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emost stable under 90 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif it gets really twitchy, transfer as much fuel as possible to the front fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does work well in space, but it can\u0027t get up there on it\u0027s own\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink is below, the 4 is just because it was my 4th major attempt at making something that didn\u0027t suck horribly, so you can just rename it if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42951400/BSG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42951400/BSG Viper 4.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E New improved version below. looks basically the same (fuel lines are less exposed though) but now the fuel balance is perfect and all tanks act as one massive combined tank.
