If I may suggest something: you could start playing with history-focused part packs (FASA, Kosmos) and once you progress beyond that stage in the career mode, delete most or all of them and replace them with futuristic part packs (Near Future, Kethane, Interstellar, Constellation Essentials). This is a very viable solution, because you are unlikely to ever use FASA and Kosmos parts once you progress beyond moon landings, and just as unlikely to use any of the futuristic mods before you reach that stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MathigNihilcehk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MathigNihilcehk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E4: Does it require RealFuels?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure, but why wouldn\u0027t you want to use RealFuels?
