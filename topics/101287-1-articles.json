It could be considered a Space Exploration game, a Space Agency tycoon, an educational game for learning, a space simulator, or an Indie-Sandbox rocket-building game?\n\nWell, for me, I think it\u0027s both a space simulator and a sandbox rocket-building (and planes, too!) game, which is why I like it so much.\n\nWhat about you guys?"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T12:11:54Z","Content":"For me it\u0027s a big, big bag full of explosions, frustration and utter FUN."},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T12:11:59Z","Content":"I think it\u0027s everything too, and that\u0027s why I think it\u0027s innovative, and awesome.\n\n(My opinion so no hitting)\n\nEDIT: Corresponding with the last post, it\u0027s also a literal explosion fest of fun."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T12:13:05Z","Content":"I\u0027m definitely a builder - I spend more time in the SPH than I do flying missions.
