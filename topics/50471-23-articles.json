The Textures for the planet from any low or medium orbit are so blury with this mod. There are 8K texture packs out but kearth still looks blury from low orbit. The problem is the engine won\u0027t accept any textures above 8K. Over at the Universe Replacer texture mod thread they said it might be possible to divide the planet into 4 pieces and use 4 separate textures to get around the 8K limit. Do you have any idea how this could be done? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. kearth is pretty flat.

My upper stage is usually underpowered (the most pathetic example being Atlas V, it\u0027s Centaur upper stage is severly underpowered even in dual-engine configuration and reaches TWR of 1 only after half of its\u0027 fuel is burnt, especially in configuration with solids), so I try to shoot to the upper border of orbital velocity vector and keep above-horizon trim after passing apoapsis. Once TWR exceeds 1, I watch my vertical velocity and try to bring it to zero (which means that I\u0027m at Apoapsis and flying level).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain_Party","CreatedById":59820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T16:35:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AndreyATGB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AndreyATGB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat would be sweet but look how intensive this mod is right now. You need a ton of other mods to make it work (FAR, MF, PF for example) and it already uses 2GB RAM for me on startup, I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be able to reliably make a real solar system AND rockets to take you there without 64bit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that is true.
