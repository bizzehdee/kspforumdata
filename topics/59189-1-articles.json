The craft requires the dropoff at the end of the runway to take off. The craft is stable when taking off, though there might be slight leftward yawing that can easily be countered. Begin a steep ascent immediately, then level off at between 10-15km, depending on the weight of the cargo and whether or not the amount jet fuel has been tweaked. The heavier you are, the sooner you start leveling off, so as to burn as much of that excess jet fuel off (this is what i sometimes do when can\u0027t be bothered to be exact about how much jet fuel i need). Remember to press 4 again. Start throttling down when your intake air approaches 0.1 before you switch over. You should be going around 1600-1750 m/s when you switch over to rockets. then its just a matter of putting your Ap where you want it a circularising. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft has RCS to separate from the cargo once the docking port has decoupled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen coming back down, pump as much liquid fuel from the wing tanks into the middle tanks as possible and the rest \u002B oxidizer into the forward wing tanks. this will balance it out nicely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ECraft file\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft is a subassembly, 97 parts, 23.3 tons, part clipping was not enabled during construction.

Nice fuel balancing. I would clip the wings more and make it look better (IMO, of course), but the suggestion that jumps to mind first is to switch to RAPIERS! Yeah, too much rocket thrust, but if you leave them on automatic switching, the ride to orbit is much more user friendly (no flameout spins). Two might do for the payload you use now, with perhaps a bit less fuel, and you have enough fuel to have four (eyeballing it, it has the same payload potential fuel-wise as my Broadsword, and that is the one that takes 10mT modules using 4 RAPIERs, but would do even better with just two and two turbojets). Intake-wise, it\u0027s not as important as it used to, you have more than enough to milk a couple of RAPIERS at high altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
