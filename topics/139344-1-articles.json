Detach the tug immediately. \u00A0Repeat until the last assemble. \u00A0For the last assembly, attach the vertex last - spoke and ring can go in either order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout further ado Ladies and Gentlekerbs, I present to you a new Era in Low Kerbin Orbit refueling!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/HEK9o/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/CrashTestDanny/Fuel-Ring-Kit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload the craft file from KerbalX\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs always, thanks for checking it out! \u00A0All warranties are void upon ignition except this one: \u00A0This craft is pretty much guarandamteed to flip between 10km and 15km, sometimes twice. \u00A0It is very recoverable if you follow the instructions above. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanny\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T22:36:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow just add a second layer...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashTestDanny","CreatedById":151030,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T04:07:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222569793\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139344\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462747000\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022135127\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Matuchkin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Matuchkin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow just add a second layer...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking about that, but she\u0027s currently 269 parts of pure awesome once assembled on orbit. \u00A0I think double that would really hurt my PC. \u00A0Maybe I\u0027ll try to figure out the fully assembled launch and then pull out all the docking ports used for tinker toying it and then I could probably double it with the same part count... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanny\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heckspress","CreatedById":8020,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T00:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntry maybe making it so that the stationy-bits are below the COM, sorta like the way Rune launches his ring stations\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashTestDanny","CreatedById":151030,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T19:23:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, this one really doesn\u0027t have enough open space for that, but I did manage to make it not flip by pushing the COM much higher. \u00A0I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but that\u0027s usually the best solution if you have to push something heavy up from below...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanny\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the by, this particular ring was severely ravaged by the Kraken once I hit about 80% fuel. \u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanny. \u00A0I hate Krakens!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
