I\u0027m quite new to KSP - in fact I just recently learned about it from a friend, but the entire concept is really great and I\u0027ve found myself having a lot of fun with it. I noticed there\u0027s no music in the game as of now, and since I\u0027m a musician I decided to write something that could play while in orbit or exploring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://soundcloud.com/schmoe222/ksp-exploration\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://soundcloud.com/schmoe222/ksp-exploration\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, let me know what you think!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ddavis425","CreatedById":14725,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-04T01:40:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds really good, might be nice for walking on other planets or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-04T01:41:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Event_Horizon5","CreatedById":16401,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-04T01:42:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was awesome!
