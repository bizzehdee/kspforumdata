I was wondering if you set up a base with Kerbal Attachment System and ran piping from one large section of the base out past the load limit and connected it to another part what would happen? Would it load only which ever part of the base you are focused on?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-07T01:59:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2014 01:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by 7499275\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T01:53:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, once you connect the parts of the base with the tube/ pipe, i\u0027m assuming that\u0027s the part you will use, the game counts that as one vessel. It\u0027s pretty much like easy docking. So, you can click on one of the base part, and name it to base whatever, and then all of the connect modules will be called that. I\u0027m pretty sure the pipes can\u0027t go to far, but i\u0027ve never tried actually. They seem to get okay distance. I\u0027m going to go for a strong guess of no for out of the part load limit though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T01:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, well I was gonna use piping for as far as it would go and connect it to a ground pylon and another pipe to the next pylon and so on still I got past that load limit.

But I\u0027m not sure exactly what would happen to things connected past the load limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d take a look at the welding plugin (Ubizor\u0027s welding, I think). It lets you turn several parts into one part, which greatly reduces the load on your computer. There are some limitations on it, but it can help with some things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T05:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBe careful with pipes in orbit ships, they tend to attract the kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T11:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPart load limit is somewhat 2.25km in all directions, so about 4.5km in total.
