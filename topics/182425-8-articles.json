They can be added by manually coding them in the OseModuleWorkshop module in the part definition but that shouldn\u0027t really be necessary. Those which are hard coded are also not in the same order as in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (presumably a holdover from an earlier version of KSP).\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIt might be worth considering moving the default list to an external file rather than hard coding it in the plugin. That way users can more easily change it and the associated icons if desired across all Workshop parts. (For example, in my own (temporary?) patch I used the icons which were bundled with the mod rather than those which are hard coded, as they correspond much better with those in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E; at the moment they don\u0027t seem to be used so I\u0027m not sure why they\u0027re even there.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe mod doesn\u0027t seem to pay attention to hidden techs. Some stock parts such as the probe cores and the Mk1 Command Pod and Lander Can were changed in various patches, but for compatibility with older save games the old versions of the parts were retained but hidden so they could not be built. This was done by adding \u0022TechHidden = True\u0022 and \u0022category = none\u0022 to the config files; I believe \u0022TechHidden\u0022 is used to hide it from the tech tree while \u0022category = none\u0022 is a sort of hacky way to make it not show up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. (I suspect some mods also do this but I don\u0027t know for sure. Certainly I have done this in some custom versions of mods.) However, when using the search function in the workshop they still show up (so, for example, you get two versions of the Stayputnik). Unfortunately it may not be as simple as just hiding anything with \u0022category = none\u0022 as some mods use that in conjunction with the Community Category Kit (CCK) or similar to make parts only show up in a non-standard category (I know Infernal Robotics does this using its own custom category plugin and I have done this in my personal mods using CCK). I don\u0027t know if there is a good solution to this problem other than adding them to a parts blacklist manually (I assume that\u0027s what the OSE_Blacklist in _OSE_Filters.cfg does).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI also have a few minor nitpicks with the UI\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is a bit of an oddity with the UI: search results do not show up until you click on a category, which is rather odd behaviour. (Presumably clicking on the category forces it to refresh the list.) I think either displaying them upon pressing enter/return or adding a search/go button to display the results would be a better solution. Alternatively you could have it refresh when text is entered/changed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe icons/models for the parts are (in my opinion) a bit too small for their buttons. I have compared some screenshots of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E menu and the Workshop menu and it looks like those in the Workshop should be about 25% larger relative to the button to match those in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Given how small they are it can be quite difficult to distinguish some parts so a slight scale up (if possible) would be welcome. If this is simply due to how KSP handles button generation then it\u0027s not a big deal.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are some other even less significant ones but this post is long enough as it is so I won\u0027t go into them here.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have a few feature/compatibility requests. I understand if these are too much work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWould it be possible to add compatibility for mods which add their own categories, such as CCK and Infernal Robotics? I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s an elegant way to get a list of categories from the game (other than the ones explicitly listed in the part files), but it might be worth manually adding support for some of the more popular ones. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell there\u0027s no way to reference them using the existing system to add them via module manager like you can with the stock categories. (Either they aren\u0027t counted as categories internally or have non-obvious identifiers.) If it is possible to add compatibility it may also be necessary to change how the buttons are drawn, as currently they simply stretch or compress to fill the window, and if too many more are added they will quickly become overly squashed. (I would suggest adding another line of buttons once the number gets high enough, although something like a scroll bar or \u0022pages\u0022 of categories could also work.) Still, the lack of compatibility isn\u0027t game-breaking due to the search function, so if it isn\u0027t possible (or is too much work) it\u0027s not really a problem.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nProbably the most significant incompatibility is that there doesn\u0027t seem to be any way to change the configuration/version of the parts produced (perhaps I\u0027m missing something), so you\u0027re stuck using the defaults. For stock parts that generally isn\u0027t a big deal, although it does mean you cannot produce any parts with stock alternative skins (which I think were added in Making History), the various longer versions of the stock structural tube, or reversed Breaking Ground propeller/rotor blades. More problematic though is the lack of support for B9 part switch variants and other part-switching mods (Firespitter?), which closes off a lot of modded parts (including the materials containers included in this mod). Presumably these would require explicit support to be added for each type of part switching, and possibly an overhaul of the interface, so I recognise it probably isn\u0027t as straightforward as it sounds. As for how to treat it in the UI, my suggestion would be to have a context menu appear when you right click instead of that adding the part to the queue. Once all the values have been set in this menu you\u0027d press an \u0022add to queue\u0022 button. This is just a suggestion though and there\u0027s probably a better/more elegant way to do it, especially if you\u0027re willing to change the UI more significantly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf it can be done fairly easily integration with the Janitor\u0027s Closet mod would very useful, but I suspect that would take a lot of work for relatively little gain so may not be worth the effort.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. Thank you for maintaining this and so many other mods.

The categories are now in a strip down the side of the part list rather than along the top. (The icons used are those distributed with the mod, except the Robotics and Cargo icons which I created myself. The buttons are designed to resemble those in the stock editor interface.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe mockup includes several blank category buttons underneath the stock ones. These would not show up normally, but with CCK compatibility would house custom categories. The up/down buttons at the bottom would only show up if necessary (similar to the next/previous page buttons).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe scale of the category/part buttons and search box are approx. 75% of those in the editors. The space between the part buttons has been reduced to 2px (the space in the editors is about 4px; the mod currently uses spaces of about 5-6px despite the smaller buttons). The part buttons themselves are 50px, similar to those currently used by the mod. The category buttons are 24px and are also 2px apart, so they line up with the part buttons exactly. The part previews are at the same relative size to their button as shown in the editors (i.e. they\u0027re larger than in the current version of the mod.) The part previews are not lit/shaded (as is the case in the editors but not in the current version of the mod; this may be a limitation of the game)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe part list would be sortable by name, mass and size as in the editors.

It is added to the queue using the \u0022add to queue\u0022 button. This allows things like stock variants and B9 switching to be done in the main window.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA new quantity value has been added. This allows the player to quickly choose how many of a part they want and add them all at once rather than repeatedly clicking until the desired number is added. This seems like an obvious addition to the \u0022add to queue\u0022 functionality. The number is a text box so the player can type in it. The \u002B/- buttons could be replaced with up/down arrows.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe part description is designed to be as close as possible to the editors\u0027 part \u0022tooltip\u0022, with the following differences:\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe manufacturer is on one line rather than two (to save space). However, since it is being manufactured in situ this may be renamed (something like \u0022designer\u0022 or \u0022original manufacturer\u0022).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe description box is shorter to make room for the recipe\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe part name has the mod folder appended in brackets/parentheses (Janitor\u0027s Closet integration)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n(I intended to add the scale indicator to the mockup but forgot)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe panel to the right (I don\u0027t know what you\u0027d call it; \u0022modules\u0022 maybe) is placed further to the right. In between it and the rest of the panel is placed the list of variant/B9 switchers, which use the same UI style as the stock variant switchers in the editor right-click menu (which is also used by newer B9 versions). A series of dropdown lists is a possible alternative (user preference?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe afore-mentioned recipe is placed underneath the part description. This also includes the required volume, listed after resources required. Both the volume and the resources also list the total of what is available. For volume this would have to be limited by the max volume of the largest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E container, not just the total. The current queue (and the queues of any other workshops on the craft) would also be taken into account for available resources.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCurrently, the mod does not show any parts which are too large to fit in any of the attached containers. This behaviour would be changed to it being visible but not being able to be added to the queue (possibly a greyed-out \u0022add to queue\u0022 button with a tooltip explaining why. The afore mentioned volume listing could also be changed to red if this is the case.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs seen for the RSC thruster block, parts of the same type can be stacked. These stacks could then be split by right-clicking and selecting a stack-size to split off; this would be to enable players to move around items in the queue without cancelling the whole stack. Parts with different values (e.g. different B9 subtypes) would not stack.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nItems in the queue could be moved around, either by dragging them or by right-clicking and selecting an option to move it up or down in the queue.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is a new production speed mechanic shown at the bottom right. In the mockup this uses buttons; I think a slider would probably be better but couldn\u0027t think of a way to do this while also making higher speeds obviously locked/unavailable (possibly something similar to the Breaking Ground robotic parts\u0027 range limits would work). 1.0x would be \u0022normal\u0022 speed. Slower speeds could be used to reduce energy consumption. (Useful if for example you are using a life support mod and are low on power and so need to build a new solar panel, but running at normal speed would drain the power too quickly.) Faster speeds would have some combination of:\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nHigher energy use overall (e.g. at 1.0x the total cost would be 1200 Ec but at 1.5x the total cost would be 1800 Ec). This would of course be spread out over the course of the production.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMore expensive in terms of materials (i.e. it\u0027s faster but less efficient/more wasteful)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHigher level engineers\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMore engineers (the current Workshop only has space for two Kerbals, but that doesn\u0027t need to be the case; the K\u0026amp;K Workshop has space for three)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMore advanced/upgraded Workshops\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMultiple workshops working together on the same craft.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFaster speeds may be unavailable if the craft is in motion on a body\u0027s surface, experiencing high g-forces etc.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nButtons for settings and the Janitor\u0027s Closet have been placed in the bottom right\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe item progress bar is the same as those used in stock for fuel, electric charge etc. (and so is much smaller)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUnderneath the progress bar is a listing of the total time required to produce the whole queue.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are four buttons next to the progress bar: Cancel item, Cancel all, Pause item and Pause all. These replace the existing play/pause and trash can buttons. If the pause item button is pressed it will be moved back into the queue with a pause icon (probably in the upper left corner) and a progress bar underneath it. The next item in the queue will then begin to be produced. Items of the same type and configuration would also be paused.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll fonts are the same anti-aliased font (regular, bold and black Arial I believe) and the colours correspond with those used in the editors (rather than the less subtle bright green used at the moment).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the backend the basic hard-coded category list would be moved to an config file. Various workshop types could then be defined which use a separate config rather than simply defining it on a per-part basis. These configs could have their own part blacklist. I would also add the ability to define the by exclusion of categories as well as explicit inclusion inclusion (so, for example you could define a type which lists all of the categories except robotic and science parts). This might be complicated by CCK though. Obviously this is not shown on the mockup.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223875305\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221604102454\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022114965\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Idran\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/31/2020 at 12:00 AM, Idran said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick follow-up: I made a dumb mistake, didn\u0027t realize you needed command to use the workshop.

Be aware that some parts will not show up in the Fuel Tanks category (Mk2 fuel tanks, two of the small foiled tanks, a few of the large tanks etc) and some modded parts may not show up there or in the Engines category (there is an explanation of why below.)

You can presumably use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to make a part compatible with the stock inventory (I haven\u0027t checked) but for the workshop to use it requires changing the behaviour of the plugin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect that programmatically it shouldn\u0027t be that hard (or at least no harder than doing it with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E), but as linuxgurugamer alluded to having the mod use both systems is itself a problem in terms of UI etc. If only one part could be produced at a time (no queue) you could just have two separate buttons: \u0022add to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E container\u0022 and \u0022add to Stock container\u0022. Before 1.11 this wasn\u0027t a problem as only the surface science parts could go in the stock inventory and they were barred from being added to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E inventories. Having standard parts able to be carried makes this more complicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do work on this, please touch base with me so we don\u2019t duplicate each other\u2019s work\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
