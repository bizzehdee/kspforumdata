Burning at the ascending/descending node is necessary if you want to match your orbital plane with the target, but it\u0027s not necessary if you just want to make sure you intercept it (and don\u0027t mind coming in on a more polar apprach).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture yourself in an orbit, and imagine a circular disk representing your orbital plane. When you perform a normal burn, the disk will rotate round an axis that passes through its center and through the point on the edge where you perform the burn. This means the part of the disk that moves out-of-plane the furthest will be the point 90 degrees around from where you perform the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, the most efficient place to perform a normal burn in order to get an intercept is 90 (or equivalently, 270) degrees around from your planned intercept point, but with the proviso that if you do this you will approach the target from either above or below it rather than equatorially, and therefore if you circularize you will end up with an orbit shifted towards polar and away from equatorial.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T02:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll say this - transfers to Eeloo, due to its elliptical orbit and inclination, often look about as inefficient as possible.

If you have an intercept with the target, the closest approach is usually going to be very close to either the ascending or descending node for fairly obvious reasons: If you are close enough to the target for an intercept, then your orbital line is probably crossing its orbital line at around the same point. The only time this won\u0027t be true is when you\u0027re already very close to the target\u0027s orbital plane around your whole orbit anyway (difference of 0.0 - 0.1 degrees).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example of this can be seen in the video here from about 1:30\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPSNH8zlmw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnPSNH8zlmw\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T08:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was playing around with a mission to Jool.
