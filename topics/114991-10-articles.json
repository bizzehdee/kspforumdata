Are you talking about an AmpYear setting?  \n\nBecause ESP functions as per the OP. It shuts down and starts up parts, that\u0027s all. I think you are asking for a new feature to be added? To alter the function of a vessel part, for a part that I am not sure is even stock?  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-07T23:32:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2016 11:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Dry","CreatedById":163177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T00:06:33Z","Content":"It\u0027s the reactor called \u0022Non RO - WIP needs input\u0022 that works fine - usually.\n\nI opened the ALT\u002BF12 and cheated \u0022Infinite electricity\u0022 and waited until the battery was full - on time warp because I didn\u0027t magically had a full battery after that cheat but a magic power output.\n\nAfter that I tried to move the power output slider of the reactor - didn\u0027t work.\n\nI tried to start the engine (I shut it down after each maneuver because it uses FusionPellets all the time) - didn\u0027t work.\n\n*The problem is that after the ESP shut down everything (and I managed it to get some EC into the battery afterwards) I was not able to change the power output of the reactor or start the engine, it was locked.*\n\nLog:  \n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/l8m7w1mje7srpko/2016-06-08-1 AmpYear - reactor power output slider issue.7z?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l8m7w1mje7srpko/2016-06-08-1%20AmpYear%20-%20reactor%20power%20output%20slider%20issue.7z?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T00:09:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, Gordon Dry said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s the reactor called \u0022Non RO - WIP needs input\u0022 that works fine - usually.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I opened the ALT\u002BF12 and cheated \u0022Infinite electricity\u0022 and waited until the battery was full - on time warp because I didn\u0027t magically had a full battery after that cheat but a magic power output.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E After that I tried to move the power output slider of the reactor - didn\u0027t work.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I tried to start the engine (I shut it down after each maneuver because it uses FusionPellets all the time) - didn\u0027t work.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *The problem is that after the ESP shut down everything (and I managed it to get some EC into the battery afterwards) I was not able to change the power output of the reactor or start the engine, it was locked.*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Log:  \n\u003E [https://www.dropbox.com/s/l8m7w1mje7srpko/2016-06-08-1 AmpYear - reactor power output slider issue.7z?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l8m7w1mje7srpko/2016-06-08-1%20AmpYear%20-%20reactor%20power%20output%20slider%20issue.7z?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\nWhat mod is this part from? and what is it called?  \n\nSounds like AmpYear shut it down - which it should - but it never got restarted, which could be a bug, but I would probably need to do my own testing (once I know what part it is from what mod).

It actually seems like it might be a bug, since if there isn\u0027t supposed to be ESP support, getting shutdown by ESP is probably not working as intended. Also something to consider is the thermal efficiency of the reactor, which might play a role. Lastly, most of Nertea\u0027s reactors aren\u0027t called \u0022WIP - Need Input\u0022 so maybe RO reworked it (although I have/recognize all the modules on it).
