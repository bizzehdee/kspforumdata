As you all probably know, he\u0027s been gone awhile, so I thought I\u0027d put it here for you guys. My PC simply can\u0027t handle it going into orbit, so for right now I just cheat it there. It has about 700 parts without fighters. The Bay is permanently open, and the hanger has room for 5, albeit a bit cramped. The carrier itself has 8 reloadable self-guided torpedoes. The weight is balanced really well, and it\u0027s got about an orange worth of fuel and 8 nukes. The fighters included are beefed-up mosquitoes, with safety ERPs. [ejection, reentry and parachute] They also include auxiliary solar cells for outer solar system operation. The Carrier has a 4 man bay, a probe core, and a 3 man cockpit. [The Mk. III] Enough to crew all five fighters with 2 extra crew. The bay has full interior lighting, and reaction wheels and power supply for the rest of the ship. In addition to the reaction wheels, it also has a crapload of RCS stuck all around the hull, and many a tank inside the bay. The whole thing is strutted up, and the fuselage is made of entirely armour and wing plates. Even the cockpit is coated, except for the windshield. It has Dv to get to anywhere, except for moho. Also included is docking support for all three types of port, so interchangability is not an issue. The download file includes the carrier, as well as the supply ship that takes up fighters, cargo droids, and ammo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/yieh9261vz67ix7/SW%20-%20Ymir%20Carrier%20Pack.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/yieh9261vz67ix7/SW%20-%20Ymir%20Carrier%20Pack.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPics, or it didn\u0027t happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/1118299879214912829/E1F72CEC7ED2598C07B3395529DCEBCA607DAF93/\u0022 alt=\u0022E1F72CEC7ED2598C07B3395529DCEBCA607DAF93\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/1118299879214907142/D898AB02DE099C249A3E8063F1EACE6C7833993C/\u0022 alt=\u0022D898AB02DE099C249A3E8063F1EACE6C7833993C\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/1119424610369302060/6B8ADF876D6145C7AEF0AE568F5B796DB9464919/\u0022 alt=\u00226B8ADF876D6145C7AEF0AE568F5B796DB9464919\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/1119424610369299348/C09B49F7710E72C38A29EA3CE0C3655F22631A39/\u0022 alt=\u0022C09B49F7710E72C38A29EA3CE0C3655F22631A39\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-16T04:29:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2013 04:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Blacksmith\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed Img Links\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
