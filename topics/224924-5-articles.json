The problem isn\u0027t so much any single piece of code in the base, or any individual trend in the base, but the overarching nature of how its been assembled, based on what Shadowzone is presenting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe starting point for KSP2 is apparently a relatively undocumented rip of the KSP1 source code, with no access to the original developers to explain why certain things went the way they did, which is incredibly important when it comes to just upgrading that codebase and its associated dependencies to newer versions of Unity. Furthermore, the goal at the time was effectively to polish it up, make it handle some newer shinies and features, and call it a day. That screams a light touch in most areas to make the deep investment places work, and with the limited timescale and budget, odds are the joins between the two are duct taped together. This isn\u0027t explicitly \u0027wrong\u0027 or \u0027bad\u0027 so much as it is the nature of the beast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, the great Yoinkening happened, and after the dust settled, they had a handful of original mid and junior developers, and patched the talent with whoever else they could get in on relatively constrained payscales. At the same time, the proposed scope of the project ballooned. Suddenly, this minor upgrade with a few new pieces bodged into place until \u0022It worked well enough\u0022 was expected to deliver on a significantly larger scope of work, including aspects it wasn\u0027t even fundamentally suited for anymore, mainly multiplayer. I cannot stress enough how significant the sudden expectation of multiplayer from the engine was to the codebase - True, no questions asked multiplayer is pretty difficult from the ground up in the best of scenarios, and a heavily physics and simulation driven game is already one of the worst scenarios possible. Trying to retrofit that into the build would require an extremely talented, driven team with a lot of time to do it, and a huge familiarity with the existing codebase. Not to demean anyone from the studio, but they didn\u0027t have any of that - Nor would it be realistic to expect that, in all honesty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite now having a project scope that was about as close to incompatible with the existing code design as you can have while still having the game boot up at all, the mandate was thrown that No, you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0use this, and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it won\u0027t be heavily refactored or majorly rebuilt from the ground up. Combined with the lacking senior leadership (Not any individual on this aspect, the general mix of tech and creative and implementation and QA and the whole nine yards) this sort of stew is all but guaranteed to generate even more spaghetti and quick patch code, and the rapidly approaching deadlines and project bloat mean that spaghetti duct tape is probably poorly documented at best, and undocumented at worst. This lines up with some of the extreme difficult on bugfixing as well - Bugs are a pain in the butt at the best of times, but with an undocumented codebase they\u0027re practically nightmarish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, suddenly and with barely any warning, the entire development team is gone, every piece of knowledge they had with them is out the door too. Stuffs half finished, incomplete, sitting in various staging and testing branches. Trying to collate all relevant information from 70 employees isn\u0027t too hard, trying to collate all relevant information in any sort of organized useable fashion is a complete impossibility, a lot of stuff is probably lost in various documents, now cancelled meeting notes and invites, and generally a lot of incredibly important knowledge about various decisions is likely gone to the wind - if you\u0027re lucky, the final decision itself is documented somewhere, but good luck explaining \u0022why\u0022 for most of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you have an old codebase fit for a completely different scope of project, that has had not one, not two, but three cataclysmic events thrown at it, all while consistently underresourced or unreasonably constrained from achieving what they\u0027re trying to do with it, and then its been ripped outta its last set of safe hands right in the middle of what is likely some major surgery, and want to throw it to what has to be the third explicit, if not fourth in practice team that\u0027ll try and do the same with all the same mistakes and baggage? You\u0027re just gonna get the same result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming Take2 wants to deliver on the KSP2 roadmap as advertised on steam right now, then I am in agreement with LGG that the KSP2 codebase as it exists right now is a massive sunk cost fallacy, and needs to be sent out to die, unless you want to give it literally years of rehabilitation before its fit for purpose, and its still gonna struggle with the scars where its been stretched too far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dprostock","CreatedById":195079,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-25T00:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSilent Hunter III\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSilent Hunter IV\u00A0 Wolves of the Pacific ( aka: Bugs of the Pacific )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSilent Hunter V Battle of the Atlantic ( aka: What\u0027s F....!? )\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#410007;font-size:28px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003EDer Untergang\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miklkit","CreatedById":201493,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-25T01:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWatched ShadowZone\u0027s video and read this thread.\u00A0 The lesson learned is that one cannot build a house on a foundation of sand.\u00A0 It sure was a pretty house, but it has all crumbled into wreckage.\u00A0 At this point it is best to start over with a strong foundation first, or just walk away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strawberry","CreatedById":222150,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-25T01:39:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs some of the regulars on the forums might have noticed, I havent been nearly as involved in the community for several months now. I\u0027ve mostly moved on from ksp2 just because other stuff began catching my focus, and only the whole studio closure debacle has made me pay attention again. Im surprised my \u0022Star theory ksp2 was intended to basically just be a heavily modded ksp1\u0022 theory was correct. Honestly I mostly just feel bad for the people who worked for the game, especially the public facing ones, and I wish they all find greener pastures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis whole story is filled with what could have beens, what if the studio was different, what if they didn\u0027t do the studio swap, what if intercept had X more months, what if middle management was better. Part of me wants to believe that this game could\u0027ve been like no mans sky if things were just slightly different. A public facing head with starry eyes overpromises in spite of technical wisdom, wide whiplash when reality hits, then they internally acknowledge their mistakes and eventually more then make up for them. Intercept did in many ways improve, their organization improved, they were no longer working with a skeleton crew, etc. In spite of all of that though, it wasn\u0027t enough. At the end of the day as far as I can tell, the mandates that made this project such a mess still for the most part remain. Even if the ksp2 team internally acknowledge/acknowledged their mistakes, whatever higher up\u0027s called the shots that made it play out like this very likely won\u0027t.

At this point there\u0027s not much left to be had, even if there\u0027s a studio move, which is increasingly unlikely, nothing will fundamentally change.

I\u0027ve never bookmarked the forums, instead I just press f and click on the first link for the ksp2 forums. This link is for some reason a thread I made nearly 2 years ago speculating about the original scope of ksp2 and I never really put much thought into this because why would I.

Health insurance, unemployment insurance (paid to the state to cover support payment should the employee be terminated), taxes, the overhead of hardware (as you called out), all factor into this. At Amazon, I believe we used an internal number of $300k/year average for the FBC of any \u0022professional\u0022 (non Fulfillment Center) employee, as the median total compensation (salary plus bonuses plus stock) for all employees below VP level was probably $225k/year (I could give breakdowns by role/experience level, but it\u0027s easy to Google or check on Glassdoor). Game engineers (and PMs, and UX folks) tend to be paid about 60-70% of the market rate for the same role in a non-entertainment company, based on my 25 years in software development in and out of games (that is to say, if I were to survey all the game studios at which I\u0027d worked, people made, on average 1/3rd less than they could have made at a non-game company in the same role).\u00A0 In case someone wants to nitpick, at the time Amazon \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E had a salary cap of $160k/year, but salary was a small percentage of total compensation for anyone approaching that cap, as stocks and bonuses could equal multiples of base salary at the Senior or Principal Engineer or Engineering Manager level.

One of the issues I was told existed within Intercept Games was a lack of \u0022okay, that\u0027s good enough\u0022 (and we\u0027ll make it prettier later) attitude.

Let\u0027s take re-entry heating: the mechanics of \u0022part gets hot, part goes boom\u0022 with a simple heat gauge or flashing parts or something could have probably been integrated a lot earlier than what we got with \u0022For Science\u0022 with all the pretty plasma effects etc. Of course it looks cooler, but with the simple \u0022show me just a gauge of what goes wrong\u0022 mechanic you could have tested the math behind it and verify if your assumptions about how which parts will behave under thermal load. The way they did it was that everything had to be \u0022complete\u0022 before shipping it. Also kind of misunderstanding what Early Access should be. I don\u0027t know who made these calls for re-entry heating. But I believe we could have gotten a stripped down version much sooner, same for science and colonies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuild the mechanics, test them, test them with the public, make them prettier on the go.
