This was a moment to be celeberated, as the spacecraft \u003Cem\u003EDuna Five\u003C/em\u003E touched down onto the fourth planet from their star, marking the fifth landing on Duna. The craft was to stay on Duna for a record \u003Cstrong\u003Esix years\u003C/strong\u003E, paving way and manning the small research outpost that had been built. Many expected the best for the mission, and even now as \u003Cem\u003EDuna Five\u003C/em\u003E walked on Duna, many other ships where already there, bringing the total number of crew at the base to ten. Meanwhile, further out, at Jool, transmissions came in from Laythe Station and the Jool-7 vessel exploring Tylo. Kerbalkind was soon becoming a true spacefaring race, and some scientists even suggested going to Lucifer, a star system\u003Cem\u003E11 light years away\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJohannas, the Director of Spaceflight Systems, did not share in this excitement. Tensions where arising, politically. Kerbin was becoming too small to hold all the nations, and the constant arms race between the Provinces and the Union was proof of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe former leader of the Union had been sporty, offering aid to the Provinces and warming up relations between him and former President Madfield. But he had fallen a year ago, by an assasians bullet. The new leader was extreme beyond ones beliefs, and wanted to wipe the Provinces off the map. The fallout center located near the VAB was always near his mind, and he stayed close to the exit. \u003Cem\u003EIn case something happens\u003C/em\u003E, he thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt Military Intelligence, the gathered officers and officials shared his beliefs. They where gathered in the Central Command Chamber, a large underground complex that ran almost all the the military functions for the United Proviences. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OLwvI4J.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OLwvI4J.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022At 0400 hours today, one of our spy planes captured this photo of an Great Union military installation near the mainland of the United Proviences.

Now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe officer sighed, and called the missile launch base. Alarm bells rang, and millions of Kerbals scrambled to their fallout shelters. At mission control, their europhia had turned to utter panic. Wehner, the head Adminstrator of the National Astronautics Agency, grabbed the communication headset and quickly gave some orders for the astronauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Some crap is going on!

Millions fled to fallout shelters around the nation. The militaries where mobilized. The Great Union, realizing it\u0027s strike was detected and a retaliatory strike was on the way, launched each and every last of it\u0027s nuclear missiles. The United Provinces did the same, as hundreds of rockets hurled toward the sky, carrying with the payloads of death and destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uvx1UKL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uvx1UKL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEighty minutes later, the astronauts on Duna watched as the bright blue star of Kerbin erupted in flames.

He pulled out a control dial, and pushed several buttons-the access code for the airlock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E24205\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe heard the airlock pressurizing, and the hatch opened. He stepped in, and it closed after him. It started to depressurize as he secured his helmet. The dial on the control panel turned green, and the hatch swung open to reveal the Dunaian landscape. He jumped out, his boots crunching the regolith beneath him, and started off for the horizon. He walked past the base modules, always staring straight ahead at the horizon, the hills, the beautiful landscape in front of him, as he turned off the radio to base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHow nice.
