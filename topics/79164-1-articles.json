In particular, I\u0027ve found that, if my goal is to make money and advance science, actually going into space, especially when that involves traveling to other planets/moons, is not only unnecessary, but much, much slower than simply doing landed, splashdown, and atmospheric tests on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night I launched my first Mun mission since 0.24. One would think the goal of such a costly and time consuming endeavor would be the scientific or funding boost from such a historic step, but given the uneven rewards given by the procedural contract generator, I gained science much more quickly with the mission that followed the Mun landing: Lobbing an unmanned tank of fuel into the sea, then \u0022testing\u0022 some decouplers, engines, and landing gear that I\u0027d bolted haphazardly onto it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the idea of being paid to test various parts I might not otherwise be using, especially when the testing parameters are challenging to achieve, but currently the rewards are completely out of whack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think it\u0027s a bad idea to offer science as a reward for an endless parade of repeatable quests. Previously, increasing science required you to expand ever outward and explore new worlds. That seemed to perfectly exemplify the spirit of the game, and really should be an inviolate design goal. Currently, we\u0027ve got a system that\u0027s akin to being able to efficiently reach a level cap in an MMO by killing the level 1 pigs in the starting area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the contracts only rewarded currency, they would still have an important purpose in the game, and balancing contracts (for money) and exploration (for science), would be an important aspect of play. Instead of being an either/or proposition, contracts could give you the money you\u0027d need to build ships capable of exploration, which would be necessary to gain science, which would unlock more contracts, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that being said, though, I think that overall, a lot of great work has gone into this game, and the contracts, while currently broken, offer a lot of promise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yarrula","CreatedById":99782,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T16:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that the contract system is broken.
