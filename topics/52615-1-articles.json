But that will destroy some of my saves, which im not really upset about. I want to keep some of the mods though, so i can keep my career mode file with kerbal engineer and crew manifest.

Squad provides a lot of parts and most of them are great, some of them are unnecessary, some of them you just don\u0027t use, and some of them have absurd and pointless file sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a graphical representation of the size of files in /GameData/Squad/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gHL6aTQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gHL6aTQh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gHL6aTQh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(click)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see in the top left section, Squad provides 722.5MB worth of ON DISK assets, it\u0027s difficult to say exactly how much IN RAM that converts to but we can use it for keeping track of reductions vs stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the top right section you can see that 91.5% of that is MBM files, these are a modified bitmap format (modified in that it\u0027s called MBM instead of BMP, and not much more), it\u0027s uncompressed and KSP/Unity does compress it in memory and it is possible to determine exactly* how much space that takes up IN RAM, but not here and it\u0027s not super important to know anyways, just know that texture files are the largest thing, and MBMs take up more ON DISK than they do IN RAM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several key things you can do to open up space, the first is to delete parts, this wholly removes the data associated with the parts. As I said above, Squad provides a lot of parts, many of which you just will not use, eliminating these parts is the cheapest way to open up space as it won\u0027t impact your gameplay at all to not have the parts you don\u0027t use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you look back to the top left section, Parts are only 57% of the ON DISK asset volume, 40% is \u0022Spaces\u0022, these are the IVAs and unfortunately they\u0027re huge. Looking at the big bubbly square map bottom section there\u0027s a stark divide a little right of center where it goes from lots of little blue squares to fewer big blue squares, the right side of that divide is Spaces. If you can bear with it and eliminate IVAs, you open up a lot of space quickly. Particularly the big square four on top, that\u0027s the SmallLanderCan and Cupola, just two IVAs but they\u0027re massive, 5% of the total ON DISK volume each. I will say, it saves a lot but it also disables the IVA view, and makes the kerbal faces in the corner go away, which can really make the experience less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this part is important, if you delete spaces, you MUST go into the cfg files of any command pod that uses that space, and remove the INTERIOR{} block, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0UTb58B.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eor your game will go completely insane\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other folders, Props, Sounds, Flags, Resources, are all functionally insignificant, you can delete flags if you want but they\u0027re not even 0.1% so you might as well not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want maximum Add-On usage, it is entirely possible to do without /GameData/Squad/Parts or /GameData/Squad/Spaces, but stuff in there might be referenced by other mods so take care keep what you need, eliminate INTERIOR{}s as necessary, and keep track of stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA less drastic reduction you can do, is the Squad Texture Reduction pack \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51361-0-21-Squad-Texture-Reduction-Pack-B9-and-KW-Packs-also\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51361-0-21-Squad-Texture-Reduction-Pack-B9-and-KW-Packs-also\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a set of reprocessed texture files that are lower resolution, it will impact your experience but it will also free up a lot of space. It\u0027s important to note that a good number of the Squad assets are unnecessarily high res, or have multiple texture files that aren\u0027t really needed. It\u0027s also important to note that you don\u0027t have to use this set in full, you can pick and choose to apply reduced assets to parts you care less about, or to the absurdly large assets such as the SmallLanderCan interiors, this allows you to keep parts but make them take up less space. According to the thread just applying it will reduce the stock 722MB ON DISK, by more than half. Combined with the above elimination of unneeded parts and spaces you could probably get the stock assets under 200MB ON DISK. It\u0027s further important to note that KSP loads all assets in GameData, not just the ones that are used by things, so if you do eliminate parts and apply the reduction pack, apply the reduction pack first or go through and delete any textures that get added back and won\u0027t be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, KSP starts to misbehave if /GameData/ weighs in over about 2.2GB ON DISK, Squad is by default 0.72GB, meaning you can install about 1.5GB worth of add-ons, and this is not including any plugins that may take up more RAM; ISA in particular takes up loads of memory for various reasons. As an absolute rule, KSP on windows cannot use more than 3.4GB of RAM, again it\u0027s difficult to convert ON DISK into IN RAM volumes, but remember that Squad provides a lot of in game access that are not within our reach, such as the planets, effects, buildings, UI, etc; technically with Universe Replacer you can fiddle with those, but I\u0027ve heard nothing but instability with that mod and it\u0027s surrounded by people making textures that they don\u0027t understand are actually bad for the game (not including the obvious ones that increase fidelity at the cost of performance)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are all rather drastic things to do and quite likely to break a lot of stuff in saves which is why I suggest you start over with a new instance; but proper culling of /GameData/Squad can significantly increase system performance with minimal impact on the experience. Also keep in mind, these same tactics can be applied to most part packs; remove the stuff you don\u0027t use, see if there\u0027s a reduced texture pack for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso don\u0027t use any legacy-mode addons, they\u0027re handled differently and it makes everything break harder (I\u0027m looking at you Touhou). Some of them can be converted to work in GameData but for whatever reason the creator didn\u0027t, some of them can\u0027t because of plugins or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-10T18:22:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2013 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Greys\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T20:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay , thanks guys.
