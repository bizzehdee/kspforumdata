So here\u0027s my story. Skip to the end of the post to see the weird polar caps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I recently installed the new KSP 1.9.1. I usually play with Kopernicus planet packs or with Sigma dimensions as stock game does not seem as challenging as it used to be. I usually play with 5 times the scale and 7 times the distance, but Kopernicus is not updated to 1.9.1 so far, so I decidet to play stock with visual/interface mods and no custom parts. I quickly found myself sending rovers to travel long distances on non-atmospheric bodies, even managed to circumnavigate Minmus and Ike, failing to do so with Dres as terrain is just too rough and the rover kept crashing. So then I decided to go to Laythe...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Xhu4K3x.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Xhu4K3x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I can share the craft file, if this IMOAB-1 craft looks interesting to you.

Before this journey I didn\u0027t even remember if Laythe has them, Scatterer makes it impossible to determine from the map view. But yes, there was solid ground on my way.

Pixelated. And on closer\u00A0inpection it was even weirder. It was very flat, it ended in the ocean abruptly, there was no slope to drive on. I was able to push the boat onto is, I was glad I used the sharp nosecones, not the stubby ones. My polar expedition was on its way from that point, but I knew I just had to send in a rover from Kerbin to take more screenshots and just show everyone how weird this shore is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Fsr46T7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Fsr46T7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cOOgfOe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cOOgfOe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the next picture you can see how this wall just goes down.

Was it unfinished by the developers? Wat it left this way intentionally? Is it one of the easter eggs? Beacuse it\u0027s pretty big for an easter egg, the whole shore is like this. And I have never heard anyone talking about it, never have I seen anyone visit this shore in a YouTube video. Maybe I didn\u0027t look for it to well. To me this place just feels unfinished and weird. Laythe is by far my favourite place in the KSP, and you\u0027ve seen screenshots, you know why I love it. So if anyone has noticed this before, I would like to hear your response and your speculation/information on why this exists the way it is.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-11T13:25:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2020 01:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by vovacat17\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaManiac","CreatedById":176003,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-11T13:51:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s just the way that the game create height.
