The part which really interested me, I guess, was that the reindeer, the sled, and Santa would need to be moving at re-entry speeds to make good time. Which would result in, as Kyle said, plasmafied reindeer. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I wondered if maybe someone would be interested in\u00A0creating a mod which adds\u00A0reindeer which can pull rocket payloads into space.
