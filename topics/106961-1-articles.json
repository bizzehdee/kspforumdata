Maybe not realistic but I do know engines can be tuned to run better at certain temps and atmospheric pressures.

I could be wrong and they intended to focus on planes and rockets equally and jueeded st started with rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have seen from older videos is they did switch to focusing on plane parts a lot more when they saw the players\u0027 demand for it. Adding new plane parts, how jet engines perform more realistically losing thrust as the plane gains altitude and air hogging does not work any more. All of which can make some designs pre 1.0 obsolete or in need of some tweaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some rocket designs that needed to be adjusted after 1.0 simply because of the new aero. I will admit for rockets it is a little easier since a lot of the rockets just required adjusting the TWR or simply adjusting the launch profile. I have a SSTO plane design that I just abandoned since the new aero was intoduced and started a new design which I am still working on, not sure on the weight of the payload I can get to LKO yet, but it performs ok at the moment.
