I\u0027ve also had problems with planes slowly nose-diving and not holding level, even with SAS and assistance. Between the crazy wobbles and the diving, I\u0027m having a hard time controlling these things or building a successful space plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost likely I\u0027m just bad at design and don\u0027t understand some core principles. Can anyone share a few tips or link a guide for building planes with FAR?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T00:15:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwitchiness using SAS is to be expected, since SAS is designed for somewhat low control authority vehicles and with FAR aerodynamic control surfaces can give you a lot of control authority (particularly in roll). If you\u0027re managing to get wobble with FAR\u0027s flight assistance, then you\u0027ve got way too much in the way of control surfaces that can act on that control axis; you may want to use tweakables to reduce their maximum deflection or the axes they act on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your plane isn\u0027t capable of holding level, odds are that you just went from subsonic flight to supersonic flight. The aerodynamic center (CoL, using a more proper term) sits a further back in supersonic flow compared to subsonic flow, so that means that you\u0027ll either need to make the plane less stable or add a lot more control authority to keep it level in supersonic flight. Generally, trying to maintain level flight around Mach 0.95 - Mach 1.1 is not really a good idea, you should go a little bit slower or just go faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wheffle","CreatedById":74893,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T22:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, thanks for the tips!
