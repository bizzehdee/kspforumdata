Tell us the difficulty you played on, any game-play restrictions you imposed on yourself (like never detected in a stealth game, melee weapons only, ect...)\n\nFeel free to post the end game screen or stats as well.\n\nI just completed the Resident Evil HD REmake on the Hard Difficulty. Last summer one of my best friends and I (swapping the controller every so often, and making decisions as a team) played the original RE1 through 3, Code Veronica, Revelations, 5, and 6. Twas a great time yelling \u0022RUN, JUST RUN\u0022 or harassing each other for wasting a single all important magnum bullet. But we didn\u0027t get a hold of the REmake of 1. This weekend he was back in town and I had gotten the HD version recently, so we had a go at it. Not too bad for a first run through.\n\n![GHyqDJi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GHyqDJi.jpg)\n\nSo What you guys complete recently?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T11:30:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 11:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r**"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T08:13:03Z","Content":"hmm....not sure.
