I\u0027m using DRE 6.2.1 and RealChute 1.2.5.3. I\u0027ve barely managed to get a few chutes running, with intensive tweaking of the RealChute part settings. However, drogue don\u0027t work like they should : they instantly snap at high velocities (\u0026gt;700 m/s, it\u0027s a rough estimate since I haven\u0027t had the time to check at other speeds) instead of slowing the craft down a bit. The only reliable solution is to set the chute to partially open at 3km and open at 500m like Taki117 suggested. However, this is sometimes hard to do given the time needed for the deployment to occur, heavier crafts might not like that setting. In addition, the drogue function is completely lost, and I haven\u0027t found a way to properly use a drogue with the new DRE settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT : I just checked the deployment of real chutes in an Apollo reentry configuration and I\u0027m stupid for thinking chutes wouldn\u0027t snap at speeds higher than 700 m/s.
