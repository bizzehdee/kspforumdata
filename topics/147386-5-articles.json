Really hoped to push my lead time back way out over the holiday break but it just didn\u2019t work out that way.

Still barely made it, was coding up the deployment to Jan 2nd and so actually ended up for the first time ever being at a point where reality was \u003Cem\u003Eahead \u003C/em\u003Eof where I was in the game. Yikes. That would be why the building survey took a few additional days, which was a thing I had in my back pocket I was hoping I didn\u2019t have to use, was really looking to resume regular ops on the 2nd but I\u2019ve learned to build escape hatches into the story so I can duck out and recuperate if needed. There was nothing hugely frustrating or worth telling about the final development up to deployment-ready status for the Ops Tracker, it just took longer than I had hoped it would, as such things tend to do. I thought I was done a couple times before remembering \u201Coh yea, I have to do \u003Cem\u003Ethat too\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP update\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second big factor was finally moving up to KSP v1.3.1 from v1.2.2. I\u2019m no stranger to updating so the process wasn\u2019t really hard it was just a lengthy process due to how I have things setup and need to install everything manually and make sure along the way that no serious mod conflicts arise because the more I add the harder it becomes to track down instances where the game just refuses to start or load completely. Only had one major issue there tho that was resolved rather quickly. Again, experience! Still, it took me three days of nothing (except eating and sleeping) but working on installing mods and setting up the environment and porting over various bits of v1.2.2 to reach a point where I could say I\u2019m playing on KSP v1.3.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProgeny launch prep\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting set for the next launch meant I had to go back and add some missing features to the Ops Tracker that I would need to show a newly scheduled launch. I changed a lot of the database structure and the biggest change was planned launches and maneuvers no longer had their own database, instead the AJAX call from the Ops Tracker for this information had to search through all the vessels and pull out the information contained in their database tables to determine if any launches or maneuvers were planned for the future. It\u2019s a bit more work on the coding end but now that it\u2019s done it means a lot less work for me when inputting database information as I only have to record a launch date in one location and it\u2019ll be used for the vessel page and by the events calendar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKuudite details\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a ton of research and decisions I had been putting off for Kuudite that I finally had to dig in and take care of in order to write up the Ascension report and be able to say how it stacked up against batteries and how long the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.

So that needed to be done and I had to choose not just and engine but a tank and fins, controls, how it was going to be transported to the pad (can\u2019t wait to show that off), etc etc. Thankfully the engine choice wasn\u2019t as bad as I feared even with the 200 or more part mods I have the early engines in my 1.25m size only numbered 12 (yea that bit about 12 designs in the Ascension report was accurate, as were the agency names). This is where I actually make use of the Tech Tree in the game, which I don\u2019t unlock with science but based on my own progression. So unlocking just the Basic Rocketry node gave me the engines I could select from. Stuff like fuel tanks and control surfaces and other rocket bits I rely less on Tech Tree placement to decide whether they should be used or not, but still try to keep their spots in the Tree as a general guide as to what part is considered more advanced than another. I actually did spend a good amount of time also on the Kerbin I probe design which is what led to my decision to go with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.

But after a bit of thought I realized that the \u201Cprefab\u201D is the part config file and there must be modules in there that were not in the v1.2.2 config file. So I did a Diff check of the part in the craft file versus the part config file and sure enough there were. I manually inserted the missing modules into the craft save file and that solved that problem but then I also had an issue with missing Kerbal Inventory System items that I had to manually delete from the file. There was also a re-named attachment node for the fuel tanks attached to the engines I had to update.

Various aspects of the aircraft\u2019s flight characteristics were tested so data could be collected to validate modeling done during the design process, be used to extrapolate various ranges of performance limitations and make the full-motion training simulator even more effective. Some of the highlights from the testing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHigh-Altitude Flight\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlike the Civvie the Deuce features a cabin that can be pressurized, allowing for the aircraft to fly higher than 4.5km, where outside pressure drops below 50kPa into a range where kerbals cannot survive for long without supplementary oxygen. The further up you go the faster you die when exposed to the thin air. The Deuce reached an altitude of 6.5km, which offers better fuel economy both from just the engine\u2019s fuel usage reduction combined with less drag on the aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDual-Engine Failure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile performing high-load maneuvers in excess of 5Gs, the Deuce lost power to both engines. Captain Jebediah was flying solo and reacted as he was trained, preparing for an emergency landing (he was too far to make the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway) and then attempting to restart the engines, which thankfully came back to life after a few tries. Both engines were broken down afterwards to determine the cause, which was found to be inadequate fuel pumps allowing the fuel to be pulled back from the engine, causing the failure. Restart attempts were numerous having to overcome the negative pressure that slammed shut fuel valves \u2013 once the Deuce descended from 3km to less than 2km outside pressure was able to help force them open. This is simply an overlooked design shortcoming in the engines, which are a well-used and reliable model for airships that are never put under such high loads. C7 has their own powerplant under development to replace the Deuce\u2019s current engines for more power and have made note of this incident.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESingle-Engine Flight\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final test was to operate the Deuce with only one engine, and it passed with flying colors. Having only one engine produces asymmetric thrust that needs to be countered with rudder and aileron to maintain level flight, thankfully the Deuce has proven it has enough control authority from both to not only still fly straight with one engine but also run that engine at full power! This is a good sign considering the newer engine under design is more powerful. To top it all off Jeb brought it in for a safe landing with the one engine still out. This was a major feature of the Deuce we have been looking forward to exploiting, allowing for much safer trips out over open water, for which the Civvie was mostly restricted from doing in excess of 10km from land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext week Jeb and Val will take the Deuce on its first cross-country flight up to Kravass, where they will spend the week allowing the flight instructors there some hands-on time, followed by passenger flights for several influential local kerbals. From there the following week they will head to the newly-opened airports at Sheltered Rock and Ockr to give more rides, exposing many kerbs to fixed-wing flight for the first time. They\u2019ll be back at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E by the end of the month and in early February C7 expects to put the Deuce into service with us here at the KSA and order a second aircraft. It will still be a few months before the Deuce enters production for public commercial use but C7 is hoping this upcoming PR tour will give them some orders to fill once that happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProgeny Mk5 Block I Launch Delayed\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the final integration checks after stacking the rocket vertically a weakness was exposed in the structural adapter that reduces the width profile from 0.625m to 0.35m connecting the first and second stages.

Thankfully we\u2019ve had a spare adapter sitting around in storage since last October when we ordered all the parts needed for assembling a Block II so the turnaround here is relatively quick with the adapter being swapped out today and final integration checks being performed again on Monday.

In fact this week has gone pretty damn well considering how much flying I\u2019ve had to do. I really enjoy flying \u2013 I\u2019ve been flying virtually since I was like 8 or 9 when Flight Simulator was just a bunch of vector lines on the screen. It\u2019s a very time-consuming thing though for KSA operations because I can\u2019t timewarp any of it, and then afterwards there is a lot of post-op work to do. I certainly couldn\u2019t have done any more than I did this week and would have felt lame doing any less, so it\u2019s been a good week and I\u2019m a day ahead of where I was last week \u2013 but that probably won\u2019t last because\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOps Tracker update\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime constraints forced me to push the Progeny launch back to next week, especially when I realized the majority of this coming weekend would see me away from the computer. The Ops Tracker is still not able to auto-update for new vessel events and now that all the work to initially load and display data has been completed with past events I can get a better sense of how I want to do it with upcoming ones. I\u2019ve outlined how the updates work in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSAMissionCtrl/OpsTracker/issues/3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis Github issue\u003C/a\u003E and it will definitely be at least a two day task to get it all implemented. The upshot however is that it will lay the groundwork for the notification system which would let you leave the Ops Tracker open in a separate tab and it would tell you when things are happening like a crew member starting or finishing a mission, whether a vessel or crew has updated information and what information that is. That\u2019s still a ways down the road though \u2013 for the upcoming launch it will just update the page without notifications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDeuce trials IRL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as I said much flying was done this past week, although initially the aircraft did not want to behave. Last year when KSA announced the Deuce was going to be rebuilt that is literally what I went and did in the editor, and when I took it for a spin everything seemed to be great \u2013 there was no more left roll tendency and the numbers in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E derivatives panel were all green and dandy. Fast forward a few months and after I got the Deuce to load into KSP v1.3.1 I took her up and to my dismay found the same roll issue was present. what. I loaded back to my KSP v1.2.2 save and flew the Deuce to the same results. WTAF. Am I just remembering things wrong? If it still had problems I wouldn\u2019t have set the project aside these past few months, even out of frustration. I also couldn\u2019t get the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E window to give me decent numbers like I thought it did. Rrrggghhhh. But overall the aircraft handled just fine except for the roll, so I just said \u201Clove it\u201D and used the Angle of Attack tweakable in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E control settings to increase one aileron and decrease the other so the aircraft would keep itself upright. This setting doesn\u2019t adjust them visually so everything otherwise appears normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s also a related issue in that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/162504-13-airpark-continued/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAirPark\u003C/a\u003E no longer works as it did in KSP v1.2.2 by allowing me to park a vessel up in the air and load back into it from the Space Center. In KSP v1.3.1 the physics easing kicks in and lowers the aircraft back down to the ground. I\u2019ve submitted a bug report and hopefully it gets resolved soon but until then I have to move back to my KSP v1.2.2 install when I need to take inflight photos, which are already a pain in the ass in and of themselves for a variety of reasons which is why there weren\u2019t all that many this past week.

Thankfully I didn\u2019t lose any large amounts of work but it still was unsettling because I was only running KSP and that usually hasn\u2019t given me any trouble in the past. It\u2019s been mostly giving me shutdowns playing Grand Theft Auto 5 but doing it while in KSP was not good. Then a short while later it shut off without me even playing KSP! In that case however I realized the floor fan blowing at my PC case had been inadvertently unplugged. And in the case of shut down while playing KSP I realized the ambient temperature of my room was approaching 80\u00B0F. I\u2019ve been keeping things around 70\u00B0F since then and haven\u2019t had any issues since.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, last year I was planning to upgrade my HD7970 I bought back in 2013 with a Vega 56 but wanted to wait for the non-reference boards to hit the market, then wanted to wait for any Cyber Monday deals, and then they were all \u003Cem\u003Egone\u003C/em\u003E come December and the ones that weren\u2019t were being sold for ridiculous amounts ranging from $1k to $1.5k.

The flight was a wild success, implementing a further-refined ascent profile and climbing to a height of 546.46km \u2013 just one of several \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?page_id=72\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erecords\u003C/a\u003E that were broken. We almost lost the rocket on re-entry however due to the high 2km/s\u002B speeds at which it slammed back into the atmosphere. The current theory is that the chute either was only able to partially deploy due to the high speeds or did deploy and was ripped apart shortly afterwards. One way or another the rocket was sent into a tumble because it managed to strike the water nose-first, but slow enough that it wasn\u2019t completely obliterated and just wrecking everything down to the probe core. Whatever happened after the chute was triggered, it was violent enough to rip the batteries from their mounts and deny the probe core any power to log the final moments before impact. Another important aspect of note was the fact that radiation levels once again remained elevated throughout the climb to apokee, which continues to be worrisome for our future kerbed spaceflight plans. We\u2019ll have further analysis into this plus more details on the flight next week, primarily in comparison to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=5989\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esecond Block I launch\u003C/a\u003E, which was the previous altitude record-holder and flew a very different ascent profile that placed it just shy of 500km at apokee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKerBalloon Tackles Most Difficult Mission Yet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe highly-logistical mission currently underway involves \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/Tracker/tracker.asp?body=Kerbin-System\u0026amp;loc=13.4033,-113.1152,%3Ccenter%3ESite%200B-RZ%3Cbr%3EKerbodyne%3Cbr%3ELow-Altitude%20Temperature%20Survey%3C/center%3E\u0026amp;loc=2.5049,-104.7656,%3Ccenter%3ESector%20GV-001%3Cbr%3EFlooyd%20Dynamics%20Research%20Lab%3Cbr%3EHigh-Altitude%20Temperature%20Survey%3C/center%3E\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egathering temperature data\u003C/a\u003E in the region of the Great Desert, which will involve all modes of transportation.

Thankfully the upgrade to the update system went rather smoothly and I am extremely pleased with the result, I think it\u2019s pretty damn slick now watching the ascent states change during the flight. I can build directly off this system to serve up notifications if you have the page loaded in a tab, but that\u2019s still a low-priority item at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch itself took 5 attempts, which is one of the reasons I\u2019ve been up since yesterday. These flights are pretty long and I don\u2019t timewarp them so the video logs have data from the screen for the entire time. Plus it takes several minutes to reset everything if I need to make another attempt then several more minutes to set everything back up. The first try was ruined early on the pad when I forgot to set a part tag for kOS to reference and couldn\u2019t get back to a clean state without reverting to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. The second attempt was wrecked after the first stage decoupled and kOS couldn\u2019t find the button in the Part Action Window to trigger the fins to blow up. Turns out when you use the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/163711-13-paws-part-action-window-sorter-outer-10-26072017/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EPart Action Window Sorter-Outer\u003C/a\u003E mod to clean up a PAW and remove stuff it also makes it inaccessible to kOS. Dammit. So I fixed that and the third attempt was the first one that I got all the way through, but then I went and did something extremely stupid by taking just the rocket payload section out to the pad to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37756-0-23-HyperEdit-Teleporter-Orbit-Planet-Editor-More\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EHyperEdit\u003C/a\u003E it into place to satisfy some contracts. Doing this meant the onbard boot script overwrote the entire telemetry data file *sob* and I didn\u2019t even realize this until a little while later while doing my post-flight work. I had to step away from the computer for a while after that one. When I came back the first thing I did was remove that line of code that deletes any previously-existing log file. Then before I launched my 4th attempt I realized the lower fins were set to explode immediately instead of on a 1s delay (I had deleted and attached new ones in the editor earlier this month to adjust their angles) so that\u2019s why it had bumped the 2nd stage on my third attempt instead of separating cleanly. So I actually needed to redo the whole thing anyways. That made me feel a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E better. Still, after a clean stage sep and flight up to apokee on the way back down kOS encountered a file share issue and crashed attempting to write out the log data. excrementsexcrementsexcrementsexcrementsexcrements. Okay \u003Cem\u003Eone more time\u003C/em\u003E and finally on the fifth attempt I got everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third attempt that went all the way through didn\u2019t get quite as high, just over 500km, and actually did survive landing so when the payload was destroyed after its chute failed coming back from near 550km I decided to take a middle-ground approach and have it mostly survive.

Overall the reaction to the Deuce has been lukewarm from the average commuter looking to get from city to city. Although it can travel over 3x faster than airships, it is much louder due to the engines being so close to the cabin and more cramped than a normal airship passenger gondola. The views out the windows don\u2019t show much except wing and engine unless you\u2019re sitting far to the rear. Ultimately the style and comfort of airship travel has seemed to have won out over the speed of aircraft \u2013 but for companies that ship cargo between cities speed is of the essence and comfort is not a concern. C7 has been approached by several interested parties along these lines and although demand for the Deuce looks to be nowhere as high as hoped, purchase orders are still looking like a good possibility in the near future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now the Deuce is back in the Horizontal Assembly Building undergoing a full maintenance checkout to see how it handled the long series of flights these past two weeks.

I don\u2019t feel horrendously tired and overworked but I still managed to get a crapton of work done, so that\u2019s a great thing. 19 images posted this week, and those in-flight photos are no joke \u2013 some of them take me upwards of an hour or more for each shot due to getting things setup and needing multiple layers to composite into the final image. It\u2019s rare that I just snap a screenshot and post it. Generally there\u2019s something that needs to be touched up in some way or another. I don\u2019t really have much to say this week, just want to keep myself moving now that I have good momentum and am working on getting my lead time built back out again. The one thing I wanted to cover was the finance sheet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI spent a good deal of time at the end of last year reorganizing the finance spreadsheet I use not just to track income/expenses for the Agency and its programs but to also keep track of my part inventory, crew status and aircraft status. When I made up the end of year graphics I almost had a tough time coming up with the flight statistics because I never kept things discrete and just lumped totals together. Thankfully the limited amount of operations in 2016 meant that I didn\u2019t have many missions there to go back through and add up distance and stuff that I could subtract from the overall totals I had on record to get numbers for just 2017. Moving forward now each aircraft has its own logbook that totals everything up in a separate sheet so I have a quick reference for totals but can easily go an find out how many kilometers were traveled in a just a given month. I also learned how to link to the 2016-17 workbook to ensure that if there was any reason I had to go back and retcon some finances the changes would carry over automatically to the 2018 workbook. Basic Excel stuff but still a first for me. Because I like people seeing how things are really done, here is a snapshot of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CibCkwOsYq3G9NOjWlWcwSjwBuKpgoQi_xhS8Hv_fx4/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efull financial spreadsheet\u003C/a\u003E up to this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other thing I want to comment on is how the Progenitor Program has progressed. I had indeed originally planned out up to the Mk5 and that was it \u2013 I had no original plans for the Block I or Block II variants and I had no plans for a Mk6 and had also originally planned for this rocket to be a sub-orbital option only so the Mk7 was also not conceived of originally. The fact that the Block II stands as a means to fully explore the radiation around Kerbin was also completely unplanned. Yes I do think out a lot of things but I also just go with how things play out in a lot of cases as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-10T01:51:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Ctable align=\u0022center\u0022 border=\u00220\u0022 cellpadding=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00221\u0022 style=\u0022width:550px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ccaption\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOperations Summary \u2013 Week of 2/5/18\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/caption\u003E\n\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/9B9og\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImages from the Week Gallery\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProgeny Mk5 Retirement Complete, Mk6 Launch Date Set\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the release of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=6728\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efinal flight analysis\u003C/a\u003E report the Mk5 has officially been laid to rest and the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/Tracker/tracker.asp?vessel=progenymk6b1-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efirst Mk6 Block I\u003C/a\u003E is now fully set to make its debut flight just next week on 2/15 @ 21:01 UTC.

Unfortunately it seems the mechanical checkouts were not as thorough as they should have been because a hydraulic leak was not found in the lines that serviced the left-side landing gear. This forced Val and Jeb to perform a rather unusual landing with one engine and only two good wheels. Damage to the aircraft was inevitable but Commander Valentina showed her skill and reduced the impact as much as possible, enough so that the mechanics say they can have everything patched up in just a few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever the event did uncover a serious mechanical issue with the landing gear. The culprit was a very small leak in the hydraulic lines servicing the gear bay, which would have not been a problem if the flight had been shorter. By the time the Deuce returned to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E all the fluid had leaked out, which meant the doors could not be forced open against the air stream. A manual deployment crank is available and was used by co-pilot Captain Jebediah but the gear would not lock. The manual deployment crank is not designed to impart enough force to lock the gear in place, a small independent reservoir of hydraulic fluid is meant to provide additional push at the point of full extension. It was empty, because during the build of the aircraft someone erroneously tied it into the main system that had the leak. A check of the right-side landing gear found the same assembly flaw. In addition to fixing this, a full review will be made of assembly procedures as well as maintenance procedures so such a small leak can be caught in the future and any newly-assembled Deuces are put together properly in this regard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn additional Genesis program news, check out \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=6741\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewhat\u2019s coming next\u003C/a\u003E \u2013 a dedicated cargo hauling aircraft in addition to a new Deuce built with some design changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKerBalloon To See Decline in Mission Cadence\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWrapping up a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=6708\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elow-altitude balloon mission\u003C/a\u003E this past weekend, KerBalloon has a new contract lined up for next week but has informed Head of Finances Mortimer to expect a possible reduction to income given that the missions they plan to execute this coming year will be more far-flung from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and take longer to carry out.

Still, I had hoped to push ahead a bit more but mainly ended up feeling a bit under the weather and burned out so I spent some time watching movies and playing GTA: Online with one of my pals. Also some IRL work related stuff that consumed a greater portion of my time than is normal. So yea, I\u2019m happy to have \u201Cbroken even\u201D and ended up where I was last week. It was a good week to take a break too since not much was happening. Doubt I\u2019ll be able to push ahead much in the next week with all the Ascension and Progeny stuff coming up, plus another long Deuce flight to take care of.

I retracted the gear okay and made another approach but extension on the one gear failed again, so I was forced to come up with a plan to land that would still save the aircraft from being out of service for weeks or months. I have plenty of flight sim experience and watched plenty of air crash investigation shows (I loveing \u003Cem\u003Elove\u003C/em\u003E those) so I know how various emergencies are handled and this is pretty much what you would attempt in the real world when possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what happened? Turns out for some reason the \u201Ccannot deploy while stowed\u201D issue reared its ugly head. I have no idea why because I don\u2019t recall making any changes to the landing gear or engine pods in general, so can\u2019t explain how this issue came about now and not earlier. I also didn\u2019t notice the onscreen message saying the gear couldn\u2019t deploy because it is mostly hidden under all the UI windows I have open in the upper-left corner of my screen. I saw it on review of the flight video. Thankfully this issue has an easy fix in the form of the \u201CDeploy Shielded\u201D option in the Part-Access Window, so I can just enable that and not worry about this anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it was something interesting that was fun to write about at least. It also gave me an excuse to delay the flight on Friday \u2013 if I had flown that I would not be writing this now.

First step was to host all the image tiles myself instead of pulling them from the webarchive.com servers. I had hoped this would be faster and prevent any grey squares from showing up due to loading time outs but unfortunately my shared host has turned out to be not much better, although things do seem to not load less often. I hope sometime this week I\u2019m able to convert over to the recent Leaflet version without breaking too much stuff in the process regarding the dynamic map. If it\u2019s a lot I will have to revert and block out some extended time to really work on it, which won\u2019t be this week for sure.

The fin-less 3rd stage is what changed the visual profile enough to warrant a move to the Mk6 designation. Regardless, everyone was pleased with the flight especially since a new factor was present \u2013 launching 15\u00B0 south. It\u2019s easy to fly a ballistic rocket in the same direction that the planet is spinning, but once you start shooting off-axis you can expect the planet\u2019s rotation to have an effect on the flight. 15\u00B0 did not cause any significant issues and further review of telemetry data is ongoing to spot any effects that could become serious as we continue to increase launch azimuth to further probe the radiation field above the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately despite the success of the flight we appear to have lost the rocket on splashdown. Traveling a record 258km downrange by the time signal was lost over the horizon, MSV Tongjess arrived in the area over 5 hours later and could not detect any locator beacon from the payload (the independent power source for the beacon lasts 10 hours). The rocket was traveling at 2.178km/s when signal was lost and speed was still increasing. Despite our efforts in deploying the chute later and detaching the fairings to induce more drag it seems the speed was just too much. The unfortunate thing about a water landing is that it leaves no trace of impact, so we can\u2019t deduce how fast the payload was traveling when it struck the water. Who knows, maybe we came close to landing intact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs we said, further data analysis is ongoing and a full report is expected early next week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDeuce Science Mission Encounters Radiation Hazard at Northern Polar Region\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother big mission this past week was the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=6811\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDeuce flight\u003C/a\u003E up to the Northern ice Shelf, a region of Kerbin that has not been explored in nearly half a millennium. Yes, some trips have been made to the North and South poles for the sake of fame but interest in the regions never amounted to much scientifically \u2013 they were just frozen wastelands. The Deuce carried a large suit of science instruments in its expansive cabin and Captain Jebediah and Commander Valentina were also tasked with visual observation of the area in addition to gathering data with the instruments. They failed to make it all the way to their objective as the radiation detector started picking up increasing levels of radiation when they flew north over the Tundra and Ice Caps. Originally at more than 6km Jeb turned around and dropped lower to see if levels would increase or decrease. The pair made a few trips into the radiation zone at various altitudes to record data the scientists back at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E could analyze. Jeb and Val received nowhere near dangerous dosages but since this was an unknown factor in the mission they made the decision to terminate and head for their destination at Sheltered Rock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnalysis of the radiation data showed that the lower the Deuce was the less radiation it received, which clearly indicates that the atmosphere is blanketing it out as it falls from space. How this ties into the radiation we\u2019ve detected in our rocket flights over the equator has yet to be determined. We don\u2019t plan to change our launches to northwards to see if we can connect the two regions. It could be that this is just radiation that sits over the poles only, and maybe even just the north pole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe discovery of a radiation region also provides a potential opportunity for future studies and testing involving radiation to be carried out on the surface rather than in space, which is exciting for scientists. We mentioned that previous explorers have traversed the area in a time before radiation was known (you can read more about its discovery \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=4451\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E) and none were known to have died from any kind of radiation sickness, so either the radiation doesn\u2019t get too strong within the region or it doesn\u2019t cover the entire pole. Lead Scientist Cheranne plans to work with Genesis team scientists to plan another polar mission but before then equipping the Deuce with some radiation shielding to allow Jeb and Val to safely push deeper into the region to find out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKerBalloon Heads Far West\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Deuce wasn\u2019t the only mission to go far this past week.

The launch was near the coast to get temperature readings as the balloon passed over land. They then deployed in two Utility Task Vehicles to track it down and recover it. While the launch went off without any delays, recovering the balloon took more effort than planned when the UTVs kept getting stuck in the sand. Eventually they had to give up, take supplies with them and trek on foot to the balloon and drag it back over 30km, which took over a day. Not a day cycle, an entire day. By the time they returned to port in Umbarg it was too late for MSV Lymun to resupply and head back out to recover the Progeny rocket launching shortly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAscension Readying for Engine Testing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fuel tank, same as the one that will be flown on the actual rocket, arrived this week for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to inspect and prepare for the K2-X engine to be mounted to it next week.

The main hold back though has been keeping up with the Winter Games, which I completely forgot to factor in when I was writing about my progress last week. I\u2019m all about the alpine events, mainly downhill since that\u2019s pretty much how I ski on the slopes. Sliding events I mainly stick to bobsleigh but like watching highlights of skeleton and luge. Speed skating is another favorite of mine, mainly short track but time allowing I catch long track too. Halfpipe, snow cross \u2013 good stuff and now they have mass start speed skating! Hands down favorite though is Aerials, because I love trampoline and can do multiple twists and flips on it and love seeing the skiers go up doing that stuff. Crazy! So yea, these next two weeks won\u2019t see much progress is building out a lead time \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk6 launch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhoo hoo, finally nailed a launch on my first try! No repeats! Such satisfaction. Despite being the exact same rocket as the Mk5 that went up last there was some significant variation in the first and second stages of the flight I attribute to the southward launch that I look forward to exploring more in the data analysis and subsequent flights pointed further south.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also figured out why Graphotron was messing up and not recording the start of the launches \u2013 I no longer use the STAGE command in kOS to kick off the launch, I actually ignite the booster and release the clamp programmatically and Graphotron needs a staging event to kick off its run. So now I modify the launch code a bit at launch to use the STAGE command but on Github you\u2019ll still see the code doing it \u201Cproperly\u201D. Also looks like Graphotron uses Electric Charge while it is graphing, which is not a thing it advertises and something I never knew about until now. I made a post on the forum thread about it so the author makes this aspect more prominent on the tin and maybe include an option to disable it. I know I was already factoring in the use of the high data rate logging into the EC draw I set the probe core to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeird thing I noticed in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E was moving the lower stage fins around on the rocket would alter the length/width values shown in the engineer report. This is an issue because I use these numbers to calculate deploy costs. Now that I know it exists, I can keep an eye on it to make sure they are consistent, but not sure what\u2019s going on there. Sticking the larger fin directly underneath the smaller upper fins seems to hide them from the dimensions calculator or something. I dunno didn\u2019t mess with it much, just FYI to anyone else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly I\u2019m starting to only keep video of the rocket ascending to space and descending through the atmosphere, lowering the video size from over 1GB down to around 100MB. Because my ascent script saves the game as soon as I enter space, I can always go back to check on anything that happened from that point on to re-entry. Still, I don\u2019t trust the game to entirely set things up the same way, which is why I still record the re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDeuce mission\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup, long flight \u2013 longest by far. Thankfully by the end of it the game was still running well with around a 60% time fraction meaning time was running 40% slower which did drag things out a bit in real time but not that much. The polar radiation was a real surprise, because I haven\u2019t paid much attention to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/137227-kerbalism/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbalism\u003C/a\u003E\u2018s radiation simulation. I\u2019ve seen the fields made visible around Kerbin a few times before, but forgot about how they are laid out and that they affect the poles. But hey this works out great and the timing couldn\u2019t have been better since Progeny is also probing out radiation regions.

So far none have taken more than 24 hours to complete, with 2-3 being done in a day\u2019s time at most for come combinations of routes. The majority of best results were found well beyond 50 runs, which is a good sign that the search algorithm is really exploring the bounds set on it, which include a 10-year max mission time and coming no closer than 2/3 of Moho\u2019s orbit to the sun \u2013 further away than the original constraint, which was 1/2 of Moho\u2019s orbit. Despite this change, almost half of the results after 500 runs matched the results from 50 runs, greater assurance that an optimal route has been found. Only one planet combination returned a Not Feasible result. Some results were a bit worse in terms of delta-v required but came with a shortened mission time while others came up with lower delta-v requirements but longer mission times \u2013 a few were worse or better overall.

At first it was planned to be built directly into the ground but despite early engineering tests at the location the earthen bowl structure refused to cooperate. After multiple collapses the decision was made to shrink the size of the dish significantly in order to build it above ground. Engineers and astronomers alike however were not happy to have their original grand vision reduced to a mere 86m and threw themselves at the problem, coming up with a radical new support design that could potentially allow for the dish to be 200m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis week the 200m dish was completed and announced to the world! The increase in size and scope of the project was kept under wraps in case of failure but the construction has succeeded and is now moving to install the giant beam collector, steering mechanisms and support columns. Construction remains on track to complete later this year so the observatory can begin its commissioning work to be fully online and ready for observations by mid 2019.

Since then Flight Director Lanalye and her team of controllers have been working with the Ascension project managers to lock in our initial flight plans. For this first series of flight we will be assembling as many as 5 Ascension Mk1s, though whether all of them will be used for testing or not will be dependent upon how the rocket performs. The first launch will carry a 1t test weight that will be integrated with comms, electrical power, a flight computer and data recording instruments.

We do in fact hope to achieve orbit on the first launch, but the flight computer will cut off the engine when the perikee exceeds 60km, placing the rocket in a decaying orbit. This will be done for three reasons, the most important being the fact that our lifter engine, for the sake of simplicity, cannot be re-lit, so if we achieved a stable orbit we would be unable to bring it back down. A second and related reason is even if we could re-light the engine the rocket has no means of re-orienting to face backwards for a de-orbit burn. The third and final reason is we plan to use the orbital decay to further study aerobraking through Kerbin\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on how the test flights go, we may also be able to integrate some cold gas Reaction Thruster Control into the test weight as well as increase its mass to check out different ascent profiles.

Like, March didn\u2019t happen to have a crapton of asteroids just because operations were suspended and I needed stuff to tweet about. I wish there hadn\u2019t been so many I could have pushed my lead time out faster! I did do \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E thing, which was decrease the max spawn count from 4 to 3 \u2013 which has made a difference although I can\u2019t say for sure yet whether the effects are just long or short term. I made this change back at the start of the year and still had a lot in March. I don\u2019t fully understand the spawn system and some days I end up with a lot of new \u2018roids and other days it\u2019s a few or none.

Yea, I knew there was a lot of stuff involved but holy excrements is there a lot of stuff involved. No way this could be the first test and then I just fly it off like a month or so later. I mean, sure the document I read was based upon years of past experience in rocket engine development, which is something my kerbals don\u2019t have yet, but going from first test to first flight in 1-2 months seemed a bit much. Hence, the added backstory above about previous testing done beforehand, with this being the first \u201Cintegrated\u201D test. Legit? I feel like it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately this engine has no emissive texture, so it doesn\u2019t glow hot when its firing. I couldn\u2019t find any reason the engine bell \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u2019t\u003C/em\u003E be glowing red hot so I added the effect in post after snapping the image of it firing. I also had to capture a ton of screens to find some that didn\u2019t have the smoke particles clipping into each other or into the ground. Of course, the addition of the emissive post-effect wasn\u2019t something I could easily achieve in video (well, maybe but I didn\u2019t want to take the time to figure out how), which is why the camera angle is different and not really showing the engine bell at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow\u2019d I do the smoke? Well the original plan was to just use the physics ability of Smokescreen particles which is another reason I designed the flame bucket so well. But then I realized this engine wouldn\u2019t produce any smoke on its own (and in fact the engine particle effects do not include smoke) so instead I just clipped a 0.675m sounding rocket booster into the flame bucket and had it firing off with the plume removed and the smoke particles edited to grow larger as they are spouted out. I think it looked great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did write a kOS script to run the engines for the specified times and throttle settings to get accurate fuel usages to plug into the financial spreadsheet. The script was based off the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSAMissionCtrl/AFCS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAFCS\u003C/a\u003E so I could do data logging to graph stuff out but it wasn\u2019t really an operational script that would be used in a future launch so I\u2019m not sharing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAscension blueprint edits\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forgot to change the price and mass of the K2-X engine before I calculated the specs that went into the Block I and Block II blueprints of the Ascension Mk1. The changes are due to the fact that by default the engine is able to be gimbaled, which is something I removed in order to have the design be more simple. The actuators and hydraulics can take up a good deal of mass \u2013 I couldn\u2019t find any good specs to use for reference but I figured 200kg should be more than enough \u2013 the original engine weights 1.2t and this one weighs just 1t. I also completely screwed up the dry mass of the Block II by forgetting to remove all the fuel before I made note of it. \u003Cem\u003EDUH. \u003C/em\u003EThankfully this was all realized before I actually have reason to use them all over the place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAL59","CreatedById":180784,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-24T00:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223359850\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147386\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221524269445\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103177\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Drew Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/20/2018 at 8:10 PM, Drew Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIS ANYONE READING THIS?!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-24T01:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223362310\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147386\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221524528884\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180784\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DAL59\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n58 minutes ago, DAL59 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngood to know.

Even though I really like simulated flying and was looking forward to getting the Deuce back up in the air when I opened my flight checklist, which contains about 150 items, I was just like \u003Cem\u003Eugh\u003C/em\u003E\u2026\u003Cem\u003Eall this work\u2026\u003C/em\u003E but I eventually took a deep breath and dove back in. It\u2019s better now that I\u2019ve slipped back \u201Cinto the groove\u201D so all the work involved doesn\u2019t seem quite as daunting now. I was actually 2-3 days behind on things, which wasn\u2019t helping my motivation any, luckily I had a week off from IRL stuff so was able to slack around a lot and still catch up \u2013 I remain two days behind but it\u2019s just the weekend, which I can bang out easy in a day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDeuce flying\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was another complete rebuild of the Deuce in the editor from the ground up and things really seem to be great this time around. It really does seem to make a difference how much attention you pay to assembling all the parts together \u2013 take your time! I even thought I fixed the issue of the gear wanting to swerve the aircraft off the runway on the takeoff roll but although it does handle a lot less wobbly on the ground it still has some wheel issues I simply counteract with a kOS script that disables wheel friction above 30m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea so the aircraft is as easy to fly as a Civvie now, no more weird handling issues or having to tweak the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E of the ailerons during the flight to keep the thing balanced. I can point it where I want it to go and let go of the stick \u2013 slight adjustments needed every now and then as it does like to lazily roll in one way or another like the Civvie tends to do but that is natural. I could give the wings some dihedral to help stabilize that but it\u2019s not a huge deal \u2013 the Roll Hold feature of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E can handle it fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk6 launch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course after having no real trouble getting the Deuce flying after coming back to operations after several weeks it couldn\u2019t be the same for rocket flight. I almost went back into a funk again when I took the Mk6 to the pad and saw the nose cone chute trying to deploy itself. I don\u2019t use launch clamps for the Progeny rockets but for testing things I had reason to use them and they would drop the rocket after loading out onto the pad. This is why I keep a running record of the order in which I install mods, because I was able to work back through the recently-updated ones since I last launched to figure out it was KSPIE causing the trouble \u2013 turns out I missed updates to it because the author moved the thread out of the Add-Ons forum where I check for updates and into a support forum. The whole process took me over two hours of testing. Bleaugh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently the first Mk6 launched with a 500km antenna in its nose cone \u2013 whoops. I corrected that for this launch and moving forwards, luckily it doesn\u2019t make a real difference (noticeable, but not huge) in the EC use and no difference at all in the mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough I completed the whole flight on the first try, none of the radiation data was properly logged due to a bug I didn\u2019t notice when I ran my code check straight-up test launch. Thankfully since I auto-save the game as soon as the rocket enters space I was able to re-fly the trajectory and re-log the data afterward. I also fixed the logging bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I should note that I totally did not expect the airbrakes to work. When I tested them during the code check flight, where I launch the rocket straight up off the pad just to ensure there are no obvious runtime errors in the program, they destroyed the rocket promptly upon deploying even to their first minimal setting due to aerodynamic forces. But again, that launch profile was different than the actual launch. Still, I was literally shouting and clapping with glee as I watched the airbrakes deploy, the rocket not blow up, and it splashing down intact. Moments like that make all the hardship worthwhile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo.
