Back in 0.24.2, there was no functioning planet mod. Kopernicus was in it\u0027s infancy, and all RSS could do was modify planets. I decided to combine the two, creating Kopernicus Core, a loosely held together set of configs to allow for adding new planets. Looking back, it was terrible. ScaledSpace didn\u0027t match up with PQS, and there were tons of other bugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite a lot of packs used it, though. OPM, Toliman, and my pack the Stella Expansion were some of the hits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople liked Stella. It wasn\u0027t far from Kerbol, but you still needed a warp drive to get to it. There was also another star in the pack, Serious. (The names are based off the old PFCE star systems). I also dabbled in another star system, Lavinia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to bring back Stella. I plan for full GN compatibility as Barnard\u0027s Star,\u00A0Sirius, and Lalande 21185 analogs respectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the current list of bodies:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStella -\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EA red-brown dwarf and one of the nearest stars to Kerbol/Sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESerious\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E- A relatively close by white star, Serious is too big to be habitable, but it has cool planets regardless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELavinia\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E- One of the nearest stars to Kerbol/Sun, Lavinia is a large red dwarf star with several planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlyke - First planet of Lavinia. Scorched lava planet, only the night side can be landed on. 900 km radius.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMyke - Moon of Glyke. Asteroid only a few km wide and about 300 km from Glyke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIyke - Asteroid in quasi-satellite/resonant orbit with Glyke around Lavinia. Thought to be an escaped moon of Glyke. 60 km radius.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheodenus - Second planet of Lavinia, large gas giant. Only a few close moons due to being a hot Jupiter (Jool).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSelara - Third planet of Lavinia, cool icy planet with water and thin oxygen atmosphere. Has 2 rotations for every orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all for now.
