The Sun can already be seen to rise in the SW from an airliner on a generic mid-day, mid-winter flight from Europe to the NW coast of N. America (i.e. London or Frankfurt to Seattle, Vancouver, etc). Here on Earth you just need to cross more than 15\u00C2\u00B0 of longitude per hour to catch the Sun. Sub-sonic speeds are sufficient for that at high latitudes. I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ve seen it happen many times myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-01T20:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConcorde could do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairly sure I was just going straight west at 260 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"khyron42","CreatedById":8551,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-02T00:06:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations! I\\\u0027m also amused that subsonic speeds are enough to do this, assuming that Kerbin\\\u0027s speed-of-sound is about the same as Earth\\\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to this thread, I researched on wikipedia and learned that the Earth\\\u0027s atmosphere is being dragged along at roughly 1.3 times the speed of sound by inertia and gravity (at the equator, less as latitude increases.) Interesting, a little scary, and something I should have already known from weather patterns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
