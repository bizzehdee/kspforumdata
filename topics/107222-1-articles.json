It gets cold on the edge of this mountain. \n\nOnce a plan is created than this will be completed and reported in the mission reports area of the forum.\n\nThe standard level or normal mode was much too easy and switching to Hard level offered a slight bit harder game play. So what to do now? Being an intermediate level player I was looking for a career challenge that is truly hard and not just grinding. After setting to extreme hard I found it tougher because of the part and facility limitations and was required to think outside the box to complete the earlier missions.\n\nThe initial play was alright by my opinion and has not been that long in my time (only six hours). Traveling to new areas (various places around KSC) and repeating experiments (Bob the scientist has a special purpose), the improved World Records system also reduced that grindy feeling. So continuing on I managed an orbit and now at the point where the Mun is next. The only wall I have found is the launchpad upgraded will cost 750 000 kerbucks and the only reasonable method I have is to grind science from space. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/2jY4Q)\n\nAny other contract method I investigated will involve more player time with low payouts and reduces to why bother doing them (except the launch pad test). \n\n The game play wouldn\u0027t be so clicky-boring if I didn\u0027t also have to play peek a boo with the contracts. Gene\u0027s murmuring does keep me slightly amused when I have to decline contracts to receive a Science from Space contract. Indeed I found the game play a challenge to build a spacecraft that transmits five crew reports and brings home another two to complete seven science from space contracts. For some variety I could bring a space tourist along and increase reputation and have six crew reports. Repeat this same mission around sixty times to get the new launchpad.\n\nSixty missions before getting to the Mun doesn\u0027t sound like that much considering what has occurred with earth based space programs. The conclusion is grinding is boring and the more experienced players are left without a challenge that has a substantial payout. \n\nThe options in the administration building do not have any glint of hope either.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/icAgZ)\n\nHere are some example contracts offered.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/aqXNM)\n\nThe last contract pays a total of 10460 and is reasonably close. Contracts are improving as the reputation increases.\n\n The last launch took 15 minutes was risky and had no battery during re-entry. Eight contracts were completed for another 16 000 kerbucks.\n\n![Kb4komr.png](http://i.imgur.com/Kb4komr.png)\n\nHow to spice up the grind? Some of these suggestions have been developed while grinding, use caution:\n\n- have a tally for science from space and when the contract is completed it is multiplied. This reduces the back and forth to mission control and getting contracts, encouraging the challenge to complete more per mission.\n- bonus for landing space tourist in a specific biome\n- bonus for space tourist ride excitement preference based on G level sustained or highest speed\n- have a tough challenge to complete that has a substantial payout. This could be easy stunts such as do a barrel roll and proceed to more complicated barnstorming (if we only there was a **barn** to storm)\n- visiting a monolith could offer a big bonus to science and reputation. Detection of the monolith area could be the navball spinning.\n\nSixty repetitive mission would be about ten hours. Ten hours would not be so bad if it was going to be different scenes with different challenges.\n\nIs there any other way to earn profit like the 18 000 kerbucks per 7500 kerbuck mission in 15 minutes?\n\nAny other ways to spice up this extreme career mode?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T17:11:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**\n  \nnew obkective"},{"CreatedByName":"Mipe","CreatedById":109421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:29:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Any other ways to spice up this extreme career mode?\n\nSure.

The first VAB grind was not too bad but 4.5 Million to upgrade the science center is a bit on the rough side. Ive got satellites and stations at most of the nearby moons/stations and and basically just using contracts to do science, combining missions to do big money pulls from missions... etc. It makes more sense for me to decline contracts until i find \u0022aquire science at XXX planet missions\u0022 and jump to my already orbiting satellite/lander to perform the science.\n\n The rest of my missions are similar to \u0022build a station supporting a ridiculous amount of kerbals with 6000L of fuel for around 200-400 cash.... and land it on Pol or some planet with atmosphere (ie. you need heat shields \u002B massive stability to survive rentry)\u0022. They\u0027re not impossible missions, but the reward is hardly worth the insane amount of effort ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif). \n\nI do like hard mode, the skill tree is tottaly fine now, and the challenge is welcome, but I think they need to do some playtesting themselves on career hard to get a feel for where these walls are to adjust them. The variety of missions and lack of good paying missions is pretty crummy right now."},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T04:27:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Third, play without any mods at all.\n\nI agree, that is way too much. Kerbal engineer should be stock anyhow.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The key is to look for ways to do multiple missions with one launch.\n\nNo problem, the science contracts vessel can add contract for test parachute, SRB at launchpad or other parts that are part of the vessel but issue is now faced with sixty of the same thing for probably 10 hours. Even tried the survey contract above and gathered some science from space on the way there but the mission took close to 35 minutes to walk to the three survey markers. Now I like to play KSP but I gotta draw the line somewhere.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E getting by without patched conics can be a headache if you\u0027re going to the Mun and Minmus!\n\nThe simulated landing on the Mun without patched conics was successful and while it is difficult the payout is substantially large. The idea is risk comes with reward, greater the risk; greater the reward. That is where barnstorming could help with a large payout. Only problem is that this leaves out other non-pilot players and would ruin their game play. Fixing this would have to be challenges fit for the scientist and engineer. Solve a written calculus problem or read a schematic for example - this needs a whole lot of work here.\n\n\u003E My preferred hardcore difficulty uses the same settings as Hard, but with reduced rewards.\n\nNo matter what the difficulty setting are set at, even if it is normal, intermediate, or hard it all boils down to career is grinding. Don\u0027t get me wrong I really want to play a well balanced career mode (main reason I bought KSP at 0.23 was after reading about the upcoming new career changes in the dev notes) and as do many others but it is not there yet. Maybe new tiers could help but does this just breaks grinding into smaller steps. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E It makes more sense for me to decline contracts until i find \u0022aquire science at XXX planet missions\u0022 and jump to my already orbiting satellite/lander to perform the science.\n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E The variety of missions and lack of good paying missions is pretty crummy right now.\n\nYes and yes. Sometimes while declining contract after contract I have come very close to clicking accept.\n\nAdditionally I don\u0027t mind play testing this out because it is a challenge I put forth to myself.\n\n If sandbox mode is unlimited play and science career mode introduces the plethora of parts then what role does career perform. The developers have quite the task in front of them to find that perfectly balanced career mode. The common theme among veteran players is career is a boring grind but I am still positive that the developers will succeed at improving the career mode. The kerbal way is to fail until you get it right so please don\u0027t give up on career mode."},{"CreatedByName":"Vegesus44","CreatedById":76406,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T09:27:41Z","Content":"I had been trying Hard mode when it first came out but stopped and waited for 1.0.

This was something that made me ponder and was an interesting challenge. Even designing the recovery team was challenge and included fun for all of the team to bring back the science data. After finishing that mission there was a big boost to income and reputation. The time for each mission was short and possible failure was there so this was meeting Kerbal expectations, simply it was fun. But then a Kerbal thing happened when I tried the mission once again.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/Nnn12)\n\nThe most time consuming was retrieving the data, second is declining contracts, then the time to launch and gather the experiments. Build and simulation time is not included but are mentioned because those times were very interesting and wild times. So when literally by accident the recovery time was significantly reduced, the recovery team time is now a back up plan and declining contracts is the main time problem.\n\nThe time spent just planning to climb that massive wall has been well spent. These last few days I have had to sharpen my design skills as well as increasing piloting/navigating and was an interestingly fun challenge. The wall can be climbed in less than five days. To achieve a launch pad upgrade half the time will be spent negotiating with Gene and declining contact after contract. Is it possible to get a mod for  Declining  Preferred Contracts?\n\nThe unplanned disassembly was inspirational and really has made me gaze at the wall with more conviction.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T00:44:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 12:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:42:34Z","Content":"The lure of trying to improve on the last design kept me returning to this challenge.

By the last image there, launch number five is in low Mun orbit basically printing money with Munar survey contracts. Val has plenty of fuel left and flipping between the (still level 0) tracking station, the (level 1) mission control, and her ship, she\u0027s repeatably cranking out the equivalent of a 60-80K contract for ten minutes or so of game play time. Took under an hour of that to raise more than enough funds to upgrade the VAB and tracking center, and she\u0027s got EVAs over every Munar biome to unlock more nodes when she gets home. Now it would be trivial to send ship 6 to go do the same thing even faster at Minmus. \n\nThe major thing I\u0027m exploiting here, I think, is that survey contracts on airless worlds just require a low polar orbit and very minor tweaks to AP/PE. No need anymore to go suborbital and return to orbit. Once you can get to LMO with a bit of fuel and a thermometer you can print money.

I\u0027m gonna go post this as a challenge thread and see if anyone bites.\n\nMaybe this speed run challenge might interest you. \n\n[Forty Two Minute Career Challenge.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120635-The-Forty-Two-Minute-Career-Challenge)"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T19:57:08Z","Content":"I started up my \u0022Hard\u0022 career this weekend and at first went with the default options, but I wasn\u0027t enjoying how much Fund-grinding was necessary just to make the game playable. Ever since the building upgrades were created, I\u0027ve always felt that the patched-conics and maneuver-node unlocks were far too expensive and shouldn\u0027t even be something that is locked-out.\n\nAs such, I modified my hard-mode to give 100% funds and a cash-infusion of 500,000 to get those two things unlocked that should have been way already.\n\nExtreme Hard just seems like Extreme Frustration IMO because the default options are already a major grind in terms of Funds."},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T19:57:40Z","Content":"It doesnt have to be quite as grindy as you made it in the OP. Retrieve Science Data from Space around X does not mean orbit. You can knock those out on suborbital, which you should still manage with a basic pad.\n\nThat said the building unlock funds costs are a poor way to throttle your progression, they get obscene on Hard and make the other two currencies irrelevant except to convert..\n\nAlso while im happy removing flight revert I always keep quicksave. Its not that its a crutch, its more incase stuff glitches. (old habits and all that, not seen enough of 1.0 to know if its so stable that I dont need f5.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T20:02:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by celem**"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:20:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If by very hard you mean more griding\n\nThis idea of grinding contracts might seem improper but it forces you to be more selective in the contracts you choose. What I mean is you could choose to do launchpad test from here to eternity and complete the career that way, or you can try and create a method that does so more streamlined.\n\n Additionally, if you are playing with out reverting then failure has some meaning as you are now faced with even more paperwork to complete a goal.\n\nWhen I am clicking contracts it is as much fun as filing papers. But as I am doing so my level of excitement grows as I get closer to finishing and have the go ahead for launch. Also during this time I am going over my pre-flight checklist and flight plans or thinking forward to the next design or improvements.\n\nMy goal is to land on the Mun and Minmus and any other career options have provided little challenge to me. This challenge has even kept me occupied as I discover different methods of farming funds, I need to change plans accordingly. From this practice attempt it looks as it would be feasible to do in less than three weeks of maybe two hours a night.\n\n I don\u0027t even consider myself a very talented player and I have lots to learn and playing this type of career has indeed taught much. In the earlier days of playing KSP I used to depend on maneuver nodes and patched conics to get to the Mun, now I do not.\n\nKerbal Space Program is in my view very enjoyable, enriching, expansive and encompassing and offers diverse game play.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T17:58:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 05:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Maolagin","CreatedById":129708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:16:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe this speed run challenge might interest you. \n\u003E \n\u003E [Forty Two Minute Career Challenge.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120635-The-Forty-Two-Minute-Career-Challenge)\n\nMeh, I\u0027m not really a fan of speed-run challenges. Most of the challenge and creativity in this game is in puzzling out your design in the VAB, but to be competitive in a speed run you are slapping together designs that you\u0027ve already practiced and refined in the sandbox.

Already the three flights that I am doing during my speed run challenge launches me quite far. Without funding you are just spinning tires in the sand.\n\nMy computer is way too old and doesn\u0027t help me out at all during my speed run. In my opinion a speed run is a challenge where with thorough planing and precise execution creates meaningful enjoyment. I practiced many times slapping my vessel together and with redesigning sometimes there would be a mix up which would result in causing problems in the execution of the flight. Think of it like a circus production and a beefy computer just adds more razzle dazzle. It truly boils down to strategy, click-fu and don\u0027t panic.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T18:20:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"}]}
