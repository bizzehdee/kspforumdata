Not sure what would be breaking the auto-staging. Does it break all auto staging, or just some stages? KCA does not directly affect staging, so no, this is not expected. Something must be breaking inside MechJeb somehow when it encounters my modifications. On an unrelated note, IMO MechJeb needs either an overhaul or a replacement at some point - it should take some tips from real world and simulator control systems to make itself more reliable, useful and easier to use. It should also stop relying so much on statistics gained from the internal data of stock KSP modules and assumptions of how control affects vessels - this restricts its compatibility with unusual designs and plugin-based propulsion or control methods, such as KCA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the additional context information being available at all times, that is expected, and due to augmentations KCA makes to parts at load-time in order to allow KCA enough control access to work. I have previously tried making it so that parts are augmented on-the-fly by the onboard KCA module (so vessels without KCA modules would not be augmented), but it proved too unreliable. These augmentations should not affect stock behaviour other than gimbals, which have been upgraded to correct defective stock gimbal behaviour. Specifically it fixes the issues where stock gimbals work against you when placed above the COM, and they do not react to roll control input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don\u0027t forget to try out the engine balancing modes in KCA.

These engines have a substantial spool-up/spool-down time. As such they probably don\u0027t react quickly enough to the changes in input provided by KCA at high torque sensitivities as the SAS tries to keep the vessel level. My first recommendation is to try decreasing the torque strength significantly in KCA settings so that its inputs to the engines do not vary as much (so the output should more closely match the input, and not oscillate as much). I have had good success with jet VTOLs after decreasing their sensitivities. If that fails, you can replace them with rocket VTOL engines, which do not lag and should provide perfect control, but at the expense of much lower ISP. The ideal solution is to add B9 air-fueled RCS ports, as these approximate real life jet-based VTOL systems. In real life a single engine provides the main body of lift, as well as high pressure air to attitude control nozzles around the craft that can change their output instantly by changing their apertures. The problem with this approach would be that KCA would still preferentially vary engine thrusts instead of using the RCS ports, since it does not yet have any knowledge of the laggy behaviour of jet engines (fixing this is feasible, though I do not have much time to work on this currently).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYour vessel includes a lot of aerodynamic static and dynamic surfaces.

The best you can do is try to get your center of thrust as close on the dot of your center of mass as you can. With B9 engines, it\u0027s easy since the point of thrust is the exact same between forward and VTOL modes. What I do is mark the current CoM, with the turbojets on, with an antenna or something, then take the turbojets off, tune the VTOL engines, and re-place the turbojets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, fuel concerns make rocket VTOLs really impractical for most applications.
