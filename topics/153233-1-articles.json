If so, I am sorry. I don\u0027t usually poke my head up for air. I looked around for a mod similar to what I was thinking of and found none. If perhaps I missed it, then I would certainly love to know about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nQuite frankly, I got sic and tired of carrying cumbersome extraneous \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks. I would rather just carry a few batteries linked to a recharge system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided I wanted a Star Trek style energy based attitude control system. Now, yes I know the Impulse engines in Star Trek were not stabilization and control systems, they were sub-light engines. Well it was the closest analog I could think of for my purposes. I am willing to hear better ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, I attempted to use the skin and specs from the large \u0022Omnilight\u0022 from B9 Aerospace and combine them with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E control function of a standard \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E blister. I replace the mono-propellant cost with a low electric charge cost and rationalized it with a half-assed explanation of some \u0022superconducting magneto-plasmic ceramic alloy\u0022 pseudoscience. Basically, I just wanted better, finer control in space flight without carrying bulky mono-p tanks that inevitably run empty. Plus the blinky lights would be cooler than that little mist spray effect. I wanted the lights to flash yellow or orange when the Retro control \u0022field\u0022 is active, but so far they just shine white constantly and provide no reaction or control at all. Undoubtedly I\u0027ve made numerous errors, but hopefully someone else sees what i was attempting. And hopefully, it\u0027s a viable idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s sloppy and jammed together. Again, I\u0027m sorry. I will not claim to be a programmer or even to understand code. It\u0027s a crude effort, so please forgive my limited abilities. If anyone thinks this might be useful, can be improved upon, corrected, or etc; I would be most interested in hearing feedback. Perhaps you could help in straightening out this little project of mine. Or at least point me in the right direction.

So will apply none because the model you\u0027ve chosen will not have these. Secondly that module you\u0027ve written in the part config is all wrong. I can see where you were going though, it makes logical sense at least \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0but it won\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo\u00A0you are going to need to learn a few new skills to complete this little project, but don\u0027t worry, you are going to be more than capable of getting this working, and i\u0027m going to give you all the help you need to ensure you do! Someone did this for me a few years ago and it\u0027s time i did the same for some one else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all your going to have to make a choice, use a different model, it would need\u00A0to be one that already is an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E block(you CANNOT add these \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E transforms to an existing *.mu model you would need the mod authors original files to do that)\u00A0and will need the number of thrusters you want. So really for your idea you\u0027d want the full 5 axis which does limit you a lot in terms of parts to pick from, but we could easily reskin one so it didn\u0027t look the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr learn to make a new part from scratch and add that to KSP. This is what i am going to \u003Cstrong\u003Estrongly\u003C/strong\u003E suggest you do. It will open up so many doors for you in regards to modding and it is going to be really simply, I promise. We\u0027d start of really simple and just make a square block that works in game as your new Impulse Control System, then if you wanted move onto making a model that is aesthetically pleasing. This would literally take no\u00A0more than an hour on your first go, a bit longer if we have to talk back and forth. But once you\u0027ve done this once you\u0027ll have all the tools you need to make any part you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond your going to learn how part modules and the part config files work in general. Again it\u0027s really simple once explained and there are loads of documents to refer to for specifics when you need them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus you can do all of this with free software.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if that doesn\u0027t interest you\u00A0I\u00A0have some parts that i made that i think you might like and\u00A0i can share them with you if you wanted. I made some parts to reduce part count in regards to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and control systems myself before we got 64x when part count was EVERY thing. I made lots of parts but there are two parts in particular i think you\u0027d be interested in. A small thin mono tank with 4 built in 5 way \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports and one slightly larger mono tank with built built in probe core, batteries, reaction wheels and again 4 5 way \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E blocks, i made 4 sizes of each. So in my rockets i put the bigger one in the middle with the same sized fuel tanks on either side\u00A0and then the smaller ones at the end. This\u00A0reduces part count from 20 parts for the full control system down to only 3 and\u00A0it gives you a perfectly balanced control system with loads of propellant storage. I also spent loads of time balancing these parts against the stock parts so all the weights, volumes, thrust power, reaction wheel strength ect. are all = to the original 20 parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo from this design\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TKOqdOl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TKOqdOl.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo this design\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wJztJO6.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wJztJO6.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-10T01:30:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2016 01:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by dboi88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gyros81","CreatedById":154905,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T04:23:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would definitely prefer to create the part from scratch.
