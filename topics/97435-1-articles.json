I was working on a new launcher doing launch after launch after launch to tune every thing. After a not-so-good modification, I\u0027ve return to the assembly hangar when I\u0027ve noticed I wasn\u0027t able to modify my ship anymore. Also, I can\u0027t launch it in the space. I\u0027ve tried to change ship and then every ship was the same. I\u0027ve rebooted the game a couple of time and this thing was happening every time but there\u0027s one thing I\u0027ve noticed on those test. When I open the game, I can chose any ship from my saved ship and work with it, but when I open THE ship... every single ship will have the bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already explained my problem on the wrong post :\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105651-KSC-Buildings-Lock-Up-Can-t-Click-on-Anything-Firing-Kerbal-Crashes-Game/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105651-KSC-Buildings-Lock-Up-Can-t-Click-on-Anything-Firing-Kerbal-Crashes-Game/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem was looking similar to me but now here\u0027s the new thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the link to my persistent file, the ship craft file AND the output_log;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ofl8ksa9a8x2z1b/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ofl8ksa9a8x2z1b/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/k8vf3kd3nzoghln/Apple-I.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/k8vf3kd3nzoghln/Apple-I.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/6y9ncfzd7s0mfu6/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6y9ncfzd7s0mfu6/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-23T00:10:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2015 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Steve_Mcn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdd link for output_log.txt\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T18:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you read the rules about posting problems for support?
