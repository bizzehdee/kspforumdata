I just use stock docking ports, no KAS struts, no quantum struts, no joint reinforcement mod, no multiple docking ports for the same joint, no nothing. Mostly I use Sr. ports but sometimes standard. Anyway, they always hold perfectly still for me except for 1 time I had bad wobbles. I determined the cause, removed it, and have had no further problems. Ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking ports do not have a motor in them that kicks in and makes your ship wobble for no reason. The reason you see wobbles at docking ports is because the whole ship is wobbling, and this motion is just amplified by the flexible docking port joint. So if you\u0027re getting wobbly ports, it\u0027s because you made a wobbly ship as a whole. If you don\u0027t build wobbly ships, you won\u0027t have wobbly docking ports, so don\u0027t need any of the \u0022solutions\u0022 to the \u0022problem\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of a typical interplanetary ship I build as it is utterly refusing to wobble:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xj9dtJD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Xj9dtJD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ship is entirely stock. The main body of this ship is 3 sections held together with 2 joints of Sr. ports, with the lander on the nose on a standard port. You can see the main joints easily because this was in career mode before I\u0027d unlocked large-diameter probe cores and batteries, so the big ports are sitting on 1.25m parts. As you can see, it\u0027s got a Mobile Lab in the middle so you can tell this is from 0.23. Here it\u0027s aerocapturing at Duna and despite all the joints and their dubious foundations, no wobbles whatsoever, either here or on the way there. In fact, once it got back to Kerbin and I offloaded the Kerbals and science, I lithobraked this ship and it didn\u0027t wobble then, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above is pretty typical of my ships. I don\u0027t tend to make them any bigger than this. If I need more stuff, I just send multiple ships instead of trying to cram everything into 1 ginormous ship. Also note that it\u0027s a pusher, not a puller. I never build pullers because, even though KSP doesn\u0027t model radiant heat, I pretend it\u0027s there. So the pusher/puller issue is moot. Wobbles are caused by something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, here\u0027s the 1 and only time I\u0027ve ever had wobble:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2808/12449962885_538d81b467_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212449962885_538d81b467_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have an SSTO seaplane docked by a standard port to a big, heavy transfer tug on the end of a long I-beam. The SSTO is flying backwards. Under certain conditions, this wobbled so much it snapped the docking port joint. But under other conditions, it didn\u0027t wobble at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI attribute my general lack of wobbliness to several factors that I take pains to maintain during ship constructions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENot building anything insanely huge.

Engine gimbals, especially with high-thrust engines, will make ships wobble even if they don\u0027t have docking ports, because they have no fine control. So they slam back and forth against their stops, constantly over-correcting for the previous overcorrection, and setting up oscillations all through the ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1 wobbly ship I made violated some of these rules. Airplanes in general usually ain\u0027t balanced due to wheels only on 1 side, and it\u0027s worse when you hang big pontoons under them. By careful placement of other parts, I ALMOST balanced this one but not quite enough. Second, the masses on both sides of the docking port were relatively big and relatively far from the joint, so they applied a lot of torque. And this was made worse by the engine gimbals of the LV-Ns. Normally, LV-N gimbals are no big deal because they don\u0027t have much thrust even in groups of 8. However, in this case, when combined with the other problems, it definitely contributed to wobbliness and failure. I locked the gimbals and it reduced, but didn\u0027t quite eliminate, the wobbles. But while this was acceptable in space, it failed in aerobraking. So in the end, I scrapped the separate tug, built a stack decoupler and transfer stage on the back of the SSTO, and launched it with a vertical rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the bottom line is, if you\u0027ve got wobbly docking ports, it\u0027s because you built an imbalanced ship and/or made it insanely big and/or let gimbals go nuts on you.

Wobbling under thrust is a result of the ship as a whole being dynamically unstable due to imbalances. Flexing during reorientation is the result of insufficient strength for the lateral forces and moments applied. A ship that flexes when turning may be wobble-free under thrust, although if it\u0027s going to wobble anyway, the flexibility of its structure may amplify the wobble in the same way that docking ports can. But both issues have the same root cause: design and/or construction deficiencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, a \u0022heavy lander on a standard docking port\u0022. The term \u0022heavy\u0022 is subjective and relative so we have to define it. Let\u0027s assume here it\u0027s built around a 2.5m capsule. If that\u0027s true, then yes, it will flex if sitting on a standard 1.25m docking port, especially if the structure on the other side of the port is also 2.5m. But this should be an obvious outcome. If you have a cylinder of constant diameter except for a narrow neck somewhere in its length, that narrow place is a stress concentration so is where it\u0027s going to bend. Avoid this by using 2.5m docking ports so the whole thing is the same diameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, the resistance of docking ports to flexing during reorientation is scaled to the weights and torques of parts of the same diameter. Sure, you can overload this by making huge assemblies, but as long as you keep things within reason, you\u0027ll have little or no torque.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T17:53:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jouni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jouni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s kind of realistic that the stock docking ports are wobbly.
