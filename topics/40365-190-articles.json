I read that as you saying the radiators get *hotter*, and that the *radiator* efficiency goes to zero. On a second reading of that, it looks more like you meant the *relative heat difference* between the reactor and the radiator is less than with a larger mass of basic radaitors (the upgraded radiators, as they are made of Graphene, should have higher emissivity than the unupgraded reactors- so they should *NOT* get as hot as an EQUIVALENT mass of unupgraded radiators, however- as they will reach equilibrium at a lower temperature due to higher heat emission), and the *generator* efficiency declines as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can get the numbers you asked for (eventually), but like I said- the design worked FINE in space for several *hours*. If inadequate radiator capacity was the problem, that wouldn\u0027t have happened. It was only after several load/unload cycles WasteHeat began accumulating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I think you\u0027re missing *part of* my point about the radiator efficiency entirely...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, the more WasteHeat a craft has, the hotter the radiators should get. Radiator output should increase with increasing levels of WasteHeat (I\u0027ve tested this numerous times- in the game it DOESN\u0027T *at all* on ANY of my vessels, solar OR nuclear-powered. Radiator output is FIXED AND IMMUTABLE with regards to WasteHeat- which is highly inaccurate.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upgraded radiators may have a higher maximum temperature, but what does this really mean? That they will somehow limit themselves from accepting any more heat after they reach that temperature?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, the radiators should get hotter and hotter until they reach the point where they accept and give off heat at the same rate. If they initially do not give off enough heat, the craft should accumulate WasteHeat UNTIL the craft reaches a temperature where it can give the radiators as much heat as it is being produced, and then WasteHeat should STOP accumulating (assuming this temperature isn\u0027t outside the tolerance range of the ship\u0027s components- as represented by its WasteHeat storage limit). The radiator output HAS TO increase accurately with increasing WasteHeat levels for the system to work in anything like a realistic manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radiator temperature should not start off at its maximum when the reactor is first turned on. No matter how many/large, or how few/small the radiators, initially the radiators will be quite cold, and the reactor (once it has warmed up) quite hot. Therefore, the generators should ALWAYS start off at high efficiency, until WasteHeat accumulation has lowered their efficiency ... More importantly, generator efficiency should STEADILY decline as WasteHeat accumulates- but I am observing SUDDEN drops from 20%\u002B to 0.6% efficiency with less than 20% of maximum WasteHeat levels (in my screenshot, WasteHeat was at 66241/404500 - 16.4% of maximum). One moment it\u0027s at over 20% efficiency, the next it\u0027s at less than 1%...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the upgraded radiators aren\u0027t reaching their optimal operating temperature you say, and therefore the reactor/radiator temperature difference is becoming relatively small as WasteHeat accumulates... But the radiators should come closer to their optimal temperature as the vessel accumulates WasteHeat, so the WasteHeat accumulation should at least level off at some point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf their maximum temperature simply represents the maximum temperature the radiators will allow themselves to reach, then they should heat up towards that temperature as the vessel accumulates WasteHeat, and give off more heat as they warm as a result. Over time, the ABSOLUTE difference between reactor and radiator heat should increase, as the radiators give off more and more thermal energy (with the fourth power fo their increasing temperature). What should decline is the RELATIVE difference between radiator and reactor temperature (made-up numbers: 480/800 is a worse ratio than 160/400, even though the absolute difference is greater), and thus the generator efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe generator efficiency will still fall off, but there are several KEY differences here- what is sustaining the continued heating of the craft is the reactors cranking up to higher and higher levels of ThermalPower output to try and meet a fixed power demand on the generators with a lower and lower generator efficiency. However this *should* hit a limit when the reactor reaches maximum output (which it already had, in the craft where I took a screenshot). At that point, the increases in radiator heat giveoff (remember, the radiators are nowhere near maximum temperature- and heat giveoff should climb rapidly) should quickly outpace the continued declines in generator efficiency (the generator is already near 0% efficiency- so any continued decline will make very little difference), and the WasteHeat accumulation should level off and hit an equilibrium fairly quickly...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the space station you saw a snapshot of there, it DIDN\u0027T- the vessel actually reached maximum reactor output at a much lower level (around 20,000 I think) of WasteHeat- but continued to accumulate WasteHeat at an undiminished rate until (and after) I took that screenshot. Right-clicking on the radiators revealed no increase in heat radiation the whole time, and shutting down the generator (which led the reactor to instantly fall from 100% to 0% output- actually 30% at standby according to your earlier post) did not stop the WasteHeat from continuing to accumulate, despite the fact that it should have led to a more than three-fold decrease in WasteHeat production (at 0.6% generator efficiency, 99.4% of maximum reactor output was being converted into WasteHeat. With the generator shut down, 30% of maximum reactor output was being converted to WasteHeat).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upgraded radiator in use was capable of over 170 MW of heat output at maximum temperature. The basic version of that radiator is only capable of about 3 MW of heat output. That\u0027s a more than 50-fold difference! So, if the 40 MW molten-salt reactor only starts off about warm enough to heat the radiator to the maximum temperature of the lower-tier version of the radiator, causing the radiator to only give off a little over 3 MW of heat, it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that the radiator give off more heat as WasteHeat accumulates. The decline in generator efficiency from 24% (when WasteHeat = 0) to 0.6% (when WasteHeat =66,000) represents an increase in Tc/Th of 30.8% (from 0.76 to 0.994), and THAT means a SUBSTANTIAL increase in radiator temperature (a more than 50-fold increase in radiator temperature, according to my calculations. 0.76 is a little more than 3/4. 0.994 is a little more than 150/151).

Unmanned vessels can have reactors turned off by floating near a manned vessel and having a kerbal EVA over and turn it off. However, it being an unmanned vessel, you would have no way to turn it back on once you get to your destination, unless you also have a manned vessel at your destination. At which point you can just use a Kerbal on EVA at departure and destination, thus negating the need to have this option in all but the most rare of occasions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The reactors burn fuel so slowly that even with that unit change from kg to grams, that not even the upgraded 3.75m fission reactor would show anything other than (0.00). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Each the fission reactors burn fuel at different rates and different upgrade levels, Fractal would need to code sixteen different resources, one for each size, upgrade, and type of fuel to be able to display the units in days remaining. It rapidly gets VERY complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Yes, if you have no way to replace or dock a maintenance vessel with your ship, eventually it will need to be replaced. Keep in mind that it typically takes years in game time for a reactor to burn through its fuel. An easy solution is to toss in one of the junior docking nodes somewhere on vessels you want to have operating for very long periods of time and despite advances in technology. Usually by the time you need to replace a fission reactor, you probably have researched better power systems. I typically include a small docking port on all my vessels. It\u0027s one part and push comes to shove, you always have a way to access the plethora of options available by being able to dock another vessel to your ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The reactor being at 30% is because fission reactors have to maintain a minimum amount of reacting in order to sustain the nuclear reaction. If you drop it below that, the reactor can\u0027t sustain fission and would shut down. Also, if you cap out on WasteHeat, the reactor should SCRAM, shutting down and requiring a Kerbal on EVA to turn it on again. Note that turning off a fission reactor the normal way and when it SCRAM\u0027s will still cause it to enter a cool down period of around 3 days in which it will still generate some heat as small amounts of fission is still occurring in daughter products.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you don\u0027t have antimatter in the containment units, the tank doesn\u0027t need a charge. If you have antimatter in the tank and see via the power management pop-up (lightning symbol button) that the tank isn\u0027t drawing a charge, it might be a bug. It\u0027s also possible that Fractal has coded a safety override, so if you have antimatter and try to turn it off, the mod may still provide power for the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Antimatter is defined as a density of 0.000000001. That is in metric tons. Which is 1,000 kg. Which is 1,000,000 grams. Which means that antimatter is 0.001 grams, which is milligrams.
