You go flat to get up to speed, pitch up to 45 degrees at the center of the atmosphere so you climb rapidly, then level out near the top so you an use the remaining air to gain horizontal speed before climbing to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theflyingfish","CreatedById":17741,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T02:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOggula has it right. I remember ascending using that profile on the XR-2 in Orbiter, with the scrams and everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I found that with current KSP engines, this doesn\\\u0027t really work. The \u0027High Altitude\u0027 engines are most efficient at sea-level, and as you gain speed they don\\\u0027t really increase thrust enough to continue accelerating, and in order to really go into space with auxiliary rocket engines you need to get to a speed far higher and faster than what the engines can currently do. I think (and I am not sure about this) that the drag v. speed curves on KSP are all out of whack. There is far too little drag at low speeds and far too much at high speed. IN order for the space planes to be effective, they must be able to reach extremely high speeds at extremely high altitudes, which is impossible with the current engine efficiency curves and drag v. speed curves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\\\u0027t really matter, anyway, because the rumor is that KSP is due for a aerodynamics engine upgrade in the near future that will render anything I say here completely moot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: I\\\u0027ve come close to achieving orbit with a spaceplane turbine/rocket hybrid by modifying some cfg. values, but am currently plagued by staging problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hebdomad","CreatedById":16474,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T04:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHopefully your right on that one. I\\\u0027ve also heard that aerodynamics are in for an overhaul, so for now I\\\u0027m going to stay clear of the Space Plane Hanger until it\\\u0027s fixed.

It seems to me that the drag model is not the issue (other than the way it\\\u0027s always been). The problem is the engine parts are still basically placeholders. The ramjet should be utterly helpless while sitting still on the runway, but it gets full efficiency. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding trajectories: it really depends on engine performance, so everything will change as the new features in version 15 get improved. My strategy for now is to use engines in stages according to their \u0027sweet spot\u0027 or performance envelope. A good example is Oggula\\\u0027s and theflyingfish\\\u0027s experience with Orbiter\\\u0027s Delta Glider XR-2. (In that ship, I would take off horizontally with the rockets. Once the ship reached the scramjet\\\u0027s performance envelope, it would be used for much better efficiency. Then it shuts down and back to the rockets to finish the ascent.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example: just today, I visited Minmus using four ramjet engines as \u003Cem\u003Evertical \u003C/em\u003Efirst stage boosters. (That probably won\\\u0027t work for long.) I launched straight up, then gradually tipped over until nearing the ceiling for those engines. At the end of the performance envelope, I was flying horizontally as high and fast as those engines allow. Ran them out of fuel, then jettisoned and fired the rocket stage to finish the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stevenator1","CreatedById":10892,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T12:50:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed the RAM jet physics are nowhere near complete.
