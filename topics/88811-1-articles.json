But do you consider KSP the greatest video game created as of 2014, or at least in the top 10? I been thinking about it. This past year, I\u0027ve played BF4 (max settings on PC mind you), LoL, Borderlands, I bought a PS4 with a handful of games, and even got a Wii U last month. Out of all these games, out of all these systems, the one game I keep making time for in my life and probably play more than anything else is KSP. Now I am a space enthusiast and this game has a certain niche appeal. However, I think KSP has to be within my top three greatest video games ever made and I\u0027m 24 years old. I grew up with sega genesis, N64, and all those great systems of the 90\u0027s and beyond. This game has probably stuck on me more than any of them. I also put my fair share of time into Minecraft which is also high up there. But I enjoy this game astronomically more (no pun intended) than that game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere really is something about this game. It\u0027s infinite replayability and imagination and ability to teach the basic concepts or orbital physics and so forth. This game is truly a masterpiece. There are a few games I consider absolute masterpieces that will stand the test of time. That list includes Starfox 64, Mortal Kombat II, and a few others. But KSPis moving to the top of the list I believe! I wanted to see how people felt on here about this game, and how you think it stacks up to the bigger picture. I don\u0027t see this highly moddable game ever going out of fashion, at least for another 5-10 years even!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"timsfitz","CreatedById":104387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T23:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on my hours played alone, I would say it\u0027s my favorite game, followed by FTL, Elder Scrolls games, Thief games, and Galactic Civ.

It seems there is no middle ground with this game: you either take interest in space/aeronautics and LOVE it, or its not really your cup of tea and you simply shrug it off. For example, I have, in the past, gotten mission \u0022highs\u0022 wherein I have a lot going on and I feel a buzz when I play. When this happened, I wanted to talk to someone about my goals and accomplishments thus far. I began explaining what was going on to my (older) sister, but found that her attitude was very dismissive. Later, I attempted to get her to build and fly a plane, to which she said \u0022this is the most boring game ever, its not even a game... just a simulator.\u0022 Likewise, my friends had a similar attitude (except they actually enjoyed killing kerbals/wrecking stuff). GTA V was regarded as one of the \u0022best games ever\u0022 because it appeals to a wide variety of people; everyone loves chaos. There are other factors as well, such as lag, PC exclusivity, incompletion, and learning curve which all contribute to holding KSP back. With all of this said, I love the game and these are not suggestions, simply observations. There is no use in saying KSP needs to change to appeal to more people because that would change core values of the game. Its great just as it is (though it could do without lag and bugs!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T00:57:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP is great and I probably played it more than any other game, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_tie_fighter_special_edition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewell except maybe for this\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T01:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStatistically, Minecraft is the best game ever.

No game has held my attention as deeply and for as long as it has. For me, KSP is easily the greatest game ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit to add: My reasons why I find KSP so addictive, posted in an older thread but relevant here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a lot of things going on that make it addictive:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The only limit is your imagination. There\u0027s not a single best way to play KSP, you are totally free to experiment with unusual play styles without much in the way of penalty. Want an all SRB space program? Go ahead. Want to make planes and just fly around Kerbin? Fill your boots. Start a colony on Laythe? Have fun with it. Build replicas of real life rockets? You can do that, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There\u0027s always more to learn. I\u0027ve played for about three years now, and I still learn things all the time that make me better at KSP, as often as not from some new poster here who\u0027s been playing for a month. I don\u0027t know that any other than a very elite few can say they are fully expert at all aspects of KSP with nothing left to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s different. As the investment to create games gets higher and higher, companies are less and less likely to take chances on game genres that aren\u0027t already established. So we get Shoot People in a Slightly Different Way 5, Drive Really Fast in Photorealistic Cars 4, and Endorsement-filled Professional Sports Game 2014. KSP is fresh, and engages parts of the gamer mind that the repetitive other genres do not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s SPACE. I\u0027ve loved space exploration since I was in grade school, a game that lets me be the rocket scientist, mission controller and the astronaut is incredibly appealing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s cerebral. KSP appeals to the intellect in a way most games do not. There is a delay of gratification that makes your accomplishments more satisfying. It takes smarts to do well in KSP, not just the quick reflexes and relentless practice that most other games reward. It doesn\u0027t dumb down difficult concepts to make them easier, it challenges you to figure out those difficult things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s customizable. Don\u0027t like some aspect of KSP\u0027s gameplay or wish there was a certain part in the game? I\u0027d give long odds that some modder has felt the same way and made a mod for it, likely thinking of things you didn\u0027t. Want more data for design and flight? Mods. Want hyper-realism and greater difficulty? Mods. More eye candy? Mods. Beautifully crafted replicas of real rockets? Mods. ISRU or theoretical propulsion systems? Mods. Your mix of mods can make the game just about perfect for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It keeps getting better. Each new release adds more features and bugfixes, and mods keep getting more refined and capable. I took a break from KSP for a few months in late 2012, when I came back to it the game had changed considerably for the better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It has a great community. For all that KSP is mostly a single player game, the level of interaction I\u0027ve experienced in KSP\u0027s community is well above any other game\u0027s community of which I\u0027ve been a part. People are incredibly helpful when a player is trying to get over the initial hump of difficulty or otherwise struggling, they congratulate each other on their accomplishments, and there are tons of high quality tutorials, videos and other community-generated content out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I\u0027m addicted, and I don\u0027t see it changing any time soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-29T10:50:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2014 10:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oafman","CreatedById":110386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T10:30:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027ve never really played video games.
