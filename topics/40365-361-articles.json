I do usually have a set plan for how I intend cover the topic. I\u0027ve done quite a few videos for other games. The complexity makes it hard to not cover certain topics because they are so interrelated. I don\u0027t mind being wrong so much on air so long as I\u0027m able to show the viewer how I find the information that I\u0027m looking for, so that if they run into the same question themselves, they know how to look for it. There is a very slight method to my madness when it comes to my fumbling around. And things that I intend to not cover end up in the video simply because of as I\u0027m speaking I thinking in the mind of the viewer, and I realize that I really should cover it. Case in point, going over radiators and waste heat again because I remembered that I misspoke on my earlier video, and using thermal receivers as power sources for generators simple because I wouldn\u0027t be covering generators again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is just my personal taste, but I like to think my unscripted and unpolished style helps keeps the information (which I\u0027m actually usually covering quite a lot of complicated stuff) from becoming overwhelming. And of course, my slow southern cadence doesn\u0027t sound like a fire hose of information. I actually have high retention rates on my videos, so I have some indication that this tactic works for me, or at least the viewers that watch my videos. I\u0027m not a very good speaker. I\u0027m not a big talker, so I\u0027m actually spending a good portion of the time just making sure that I\u0027m actually saying the word that I\u0027m thinking.

I could have perhaps make each reactor a separate video, but I would still want to cover all about generators and upgrades and waste heat and radiators for each one, and I just wanted to get it done. A bit of laziness on my part, but noone else seems willing to do comprehensive video guides for the mods, so I decided to just go ahead with it.

I\u0027ve snagged three so far. However, it seems that the redesign of the puller-configuration tug from plasma engines to DT Vistas might have been a bad idea, regardless of how much better they are (less electricity, more thrust, and more ISP)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1D5SiC4.png\u0022 alt=\u00221D5SiC4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t even know that was possible.

I do usually have a set plan for how I intend cover the topic. I\u0027ve done quite a few videos for other games. The complexity makes it hard to not cover certain topics because they are so interrelated. I don\u0027t mind being wrong so much on air so long as I\u0027m able to show the viewer how I find the information that I\u0027m looking for, so that if they run into the same question themselves, they know how to look for it. There is a very slight method to my madness when it comes to my fumbling around. And things that I intend to not cover end up in the video simply because of as I\u0027m speaking I thinking in the mind of the viewer, and I realize that I really should cover it. Case in point, going over radiators and waste heat again because I remembered that I misspoke on my earlier video, and using thermal receivers as power sources for generators simple because I wouldn\u0027t be covering generators again.\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is just my personal taste, but I like to think my unscripted and unpolished style helps keeps the information (which I\u0027m actually usually covering quite a lot of complicated stuff) from becoming overwhelming. And of course, my slow southern cadence doesn\u0027t sound like a fire hose of information. I actually have high retention rates on my videos, so I have some indication that this tactic works for me, or at least the viewers that watch my videos. I\u0027m not a very good speaker. I\u0027m not a big talker, so I\u0027m actually spending a good portion of the time just making sure that I\u0027m actually saying the word that I\u0027m thinking. For instance, I\u0027ll often say power instead of heat quite often. It\u0027s my little oral dyslexia if there was a such thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last video, I kept wanting to stop, but as I got into it, I just felt like I would end up breaking the videos up into segments that wouldn\u0027t make sense if someone just linked in from the recommended videos links or a google search. Fortunately, I think that will be the largest video I have to make, and it was just because of all the different parts that have to come together to explain the mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not so say that I don\u0027t think things can\u0027t be improved. They certainly can. The sound was bothering me as I forgot to extract the audio and run a noise filter on it and re import the new track. Plus, my filtering settings seemed a little off on my last video making it harder to hear what I was saying. I could have perhaps make each reactor a separate video, but I would still want to cover all about generators and upgrades and waste heat and radiators for each one, and I just wanted to get it done. A bit of laziness on my part, but noone else seems willing to do comprehensive video guides for the mods, so I decided to just go ahead with it. Not that I thought it was end up taking an hour and 40 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey WaveFunctionP,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a thought here for you.
