The same code works in KSP 1.1.2 and doesn\u0027t in KSP 1.1.3. Since the Unity build remains the same according to logs, I have a strong suspicion that something has been changed in the game\u0027s code for that part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use them in the following manner:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet all available AudioListeners and add an instance of my custom audio filter to each of them. Of course, it extends MonoBehavior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo I need to enable audio filters explicitly somehow or there\u0027s not a chance to get them working in 1.1.3?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use KSP 64 bit for win.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-27T12:07:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2016 12:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ser\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ser","CreatedById":104207,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-05T09:04:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a kind of mystery.
