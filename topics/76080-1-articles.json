I have an issue with flying space planes. Once I get them into the air, they wobble. Unrealistically and comically so. They wobble to the point that sometimes, the wings look like they\u0027re flapping as I pitch up and the parts of the fuselage bend up and down at their joints. Despite the wobbliness, they seem to fly okay (and somehow don\u0027t rip themselves apart), it\u0027s just too unreal to watch. If I strut every part to every other part, this behavior ceases and they fly beautifully. I have Kerbal Joint Reinforcement installed and I would have expected it to help with this, but apparently it does not. The only other mod that I have that I think might have anything to do with this is FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody know what causes this and/or how to fix it permanently?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have said, if your plane is much bigger than a 1-seat scooter, you\u0027re almost certainly going to need to strut the wings to the fuselage to prevent flexing. The reason you sometimes don\u0027t see struts on other people\u0027s planes is because they clip the struts inside the parts or plaster over them with structural panels, for aesthetics, or the struts are all on the bottom and they only show you pics from the top. Folks also use these same techniques to hide fuel lines. I OTOH leave them exposed because I think it\u0027s Kerbalish to have a sleek hypersonic jet with biplane-style bracing wires. All a matter of taste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince 0.23.5, you really don\u0027t need that many wing struts anymore. Certainly not 1 to every part, or to staple adjacent parts together. If you\u0027ve got heavy stuff like fuel tanks and engines out on the wings, then you can just strut from these to the main fuselage and that will solve flexing at the wing roots. Then, depending on how far the wing extends out beyond the engines, and how much control surface area you have out there, you might also have to run a strut from the engine to the wingtip. And maybe on both top and bottom. But that\u0027s usually about it, other than sometimes some staples on the fuselage joints, especially between the fuselage part that the wings attach to and those adjacent to it, or if you\u0027re expecting to make very rough landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several ways to minimize the amount of wing struts you need. One is to get a mod (B9, Procedural Wings, Spaceplanes Expanded, etc.) that has much bigger wing parts than come with stock. The fewer parts in the wing, the fewer joints and the less it flexes. But OTOH, big wing parts often overlap multiple fuselage parts (unless you get big mod parts for the fuselage, too) but only attach to 1 of them. This puts all the torque from the wing control surfaces and engine gimbals on 1 fuselage part, so you\u0027ll probably have to staple that part to its neighbors. So if you use smaller stock-sized wing parts, you can attach them to different fuselage parts instead of just to each other, to spread the wing\u0027s torque over multiple fuselage parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, for aesthetic purposes, you can the Firespitter mod. This contains a strut that\u0027s very thin, hardly noticeable at all. It was intended for use on WW1-style biplanes as a bracing wire, but can of course be used on anything. You can hardly see it at against the background of a spaceplane\u0027s wing panel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T14:35:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EB9 has invisible struts which are handy for making good aircraft that dont flex. The other option is to run them between the parts by \u0022clipping\u0022 them.

There is a weight penalty to making structures stiffer. The bending and flapping is known, and the materials used can withstand the bending.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, there is NO weight penalty for stiffening up structures- just add struts, they don\u0027t add weight to your craft. One method I\u0027ve used is to make \u0027biplanes\u0027, with two wing structures, reinforced by struts. This may seem like a giant leap backwards in technology, but the way KSP handles drag causes no negative effects from creating strutted biplane structures. In fact, you get double the lift if your upper and lower wings are roughly the same!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP practice, if the bending and flapping events are so large that aircraft control or integrity is an issue- then add struts or structures such as biplane wings (truss style with struts). If the only issues are visual only, I generally don\u0027t worry about a little bending and flapping. I generally build smallish spaceplanes, so the flapping is limited and tolerable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next time you take a commercial airline flight, take a look at the wing during flight. It flexes. It\u0027s normal and expected, and thoroughly tested. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, it is certainly possible that large structures could bend and flex to the point where control issues or structural problems (parts falling off..) can become a problem. Add struts or a truss type structure. It isn\u0027t a perfect aerodynamic model- the usefulness of external struts and truss structures went away in the real world about 70 years ago. However, before materials and engineering were able to manufacture full cantilever wing assemblies, trusses or struts were a very effective way to support long wing structures. The penalty was weight and drag, those penalties aren\u0027t evident in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tantalus010","CreatedById":109696,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T04:29:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi everybody,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies so far. I actually have all the mods that you guys have mentioned, but I haven\u0027t ever seen any invisible struts anywhere in my part catalog. I\u0027ll look harder next time. This happens to all my planes - big, small, heavy, light, doesn\u0027t matter. The only things I ever put on wings are airbrakes, wheels, RCS ports, sometimes aviation lights and radial intakes from B9.

Okay, so about the clipping - when I try placing struts in some places, the strut doesn\u0027t connect to the other part I want; it snaps to the origin point. I\u0027ve always assumed that was a failed strut attempt, then I move the origin point somewhere else and try again until I get a strut that crosses the boundary between the two parts.
