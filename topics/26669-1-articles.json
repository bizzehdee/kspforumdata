Have two challenges though - am looking to look multiple orbits in advance - and most of the ideas I have seen are very coarse (or very proc intensive) at that timeframe, and theres a function there already - would be nice to use it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully someone can help out with that other param (or one of the other functions), or I will need to do some maths - which is always fun...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adammada","CreatedById":29884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T09:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was trying to use those functions when I created this plugin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/21111-PLUGIN-0-17-AdamKSP-Show-Phase-and-Ejection-Angle-DRAW-trajectory-on-map-v0-6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/21111-PLUGIN-0-17-AdamKSP-Show-Phase-and-Ejection-Angle-DRAW-trajectory-on-map-v0-6\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd they just seem to not work.
