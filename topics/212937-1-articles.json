Preset configs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a player want a general wing of a specific shape, they can select a premade one before tailoring it to their specific needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example: Big-S main wing, FAT-455\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. more engine types\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.5m nuke, bigger ion drives, hydrolox engines, maybe some nukes that can throw oxidizer at the output to burn it and trade efficiency for thrust...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore engine types would allow for more flexibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. bring back 1.875m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nself explanatory. Add parts in the 1.875m range. Super easy to implement if procedural fuel tanks have been added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. un-nerf large solar panels\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gigantor XL produces half as much power as it used to. I feel like the old rate was better balanced. Maybe bring power output back to its old value, or at least halfway back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuff the XXL array by the same amount, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither that or decrease power used by ion engines. IRL ion powered probes don\u0027t need massive arrays 100x their size to run their engines, only maybe 5x or 10x.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
