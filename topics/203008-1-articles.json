wrapped up, but this is actually in a way INCREDIBLE news!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me explain:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf KSP is getting finished up and if Squad\u0027s KSP team is really is moving to KSP2\u0027s team and\u00A0looking to past examples of video game sequels if KSP is ending then guess what that means?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 is almost (and by almost I mean still at least a half year) ready, my reasoning?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP ending is a telltale sign that Squad/Intercept are ready to move on from the first game and within the next few months they will probably ramp up the promotion for the second game, with a release in early 2022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey wouldn\u0027t just leave this HUGE money making game franchise collecting dust for over a year\u00A0without any new content, that\u0027s just bad marketing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: Also it\u0027s that console updates are coming also in 2022 so either they\u0027re released together or like in KSP1 it\u0027ll be released several months later, and if they\u0027re BOTH coming out in one year then that means SOMETING is coming early on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways those are my thoughts what do you think?\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:valhappy:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

What it sounds like is that they\u0027ll have more hands on deck to fix and polish things, which, hopefully, means less crunch for Intercept and less chance that the release will slip further. Late Summer - Fall \u002722 is still the ETA based on everything I\u0027ve seen.

We\u0027re getting a very different game than what was supposed to ship in early \u002720. Delivering scope of KSP2 we\u0027re actually getting on that time scale and with that size studio was flat out impossible.\u00A0If I had to point a finger at one person, I\u0027d probably \u0022blame\u0022 Nate Simpson for the delay, but I also think we\u0027re getting a much better game as a result, so it was probably the right move. As for Star Theory\u00A0not making that game, well, that one\u0027s harder to place. It was definitely about money and politics more than anything, and I don\u0027t know which side was ultimately unreasonable. T2 did handle communication on it horribly, though. Even if they were forced into a position, the response was crappy and I can guarantee impacted decisions of some smaller studios to work with T2/PD in the future. Somebody clearly was only thinking about cold tactical advantage\u00A0and not how that\u0027s going to look from outside, which is always a mistake if you\u0027re running a public company.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut from perspective of KSP2, fallout from rescoping the game would have been roughly the same. We might have had a bit less delay if things could be worked out with ST, but we\u0027re talking 6 month difference at the most - likely less. And that\u0027s under assumption that there weren\u0027t problems with how ST was managed to begin with, which is purely a benefit of the doubt at this point. It\u0027s entirely possible that ST leadership would have caused same amount of time lost following renegotiation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBottom line, I don\u0027t think 2022 release was avoidable regardless.
