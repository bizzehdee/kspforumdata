Basically, I\u0027m just testing a bunch of mass and parachute area combinations and fitting a formula to it. For some mass:area ratios it works really nicely (within 0.2 m/s or so), but for others its off by nearly 1 m/s (and is neither consistently high, nor consistently low). So I can\u0027t promise that what you see in flight is what SR will predict, but at least the editor calculator will be consistent with SR\u0027s predictions. Basically, if you use the editor calculator to try to figure out how fast something will actually land (like a reentry vessel), add a bit more parachute area just to be safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Toyotawolf","CreatedById":75259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:13:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s the problem I\u0027m working on fixing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are rooting for you dude, we love this mod take your time and don\u0027t feel pressured \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
