A team of developers please provide to a players opportunity to choose what side a navball of active control module is looking at (front/rear/left/right/top/bottom). Also lack of this feature cause trouble to a sytem of subassemblies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr as variant you may create an apropriate command module for rovers (main factors are size, weight and nice IVA).
