You\u0027re reading a bias into my post that was not intended.. I was arguing the contract systems is not that different than NASA missions\u00A0 \u00A0 To use your example: Cassini is but one mission among many for NASA.\u00A0\u0022furthering scientific inquiry\u0022 is a justification, not a plot.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA programs are very much\u00A0like the contract system in this game: launch a rocket, put a man in space, land a man on the moon\u00A0and safely return to earth, put a orbiter around Saturn with xxx scientific experiments, land on Mars, etc.)\u00A0 There is no overall narrative to these missions like some in this thread say is lacking from the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to argue about I\u0027d say it\u0027s too narrow to focus solely\u00A0on NASA as the US space program.\u00A0 Space-X intends\u00A0to colonize Mars. Virgin Galactic is looking at tourism. These are not strictly \u0022furthering scientific inquiry\u0022.\u00A0 To be cynical you could also argue Apollo\u0027s mission was more about politics and would have never happened if it were only about science (beat the Ruskies).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit to add: I hadn\u0027t seen the second half of your post while I was typing this.
