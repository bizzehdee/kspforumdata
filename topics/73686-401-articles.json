This wasn\u0026#39;t an option, so I re-modeled both the node and the docking ports to solve this problem. The node really looks best using the revamped 0.9375m docking ports I worked on. Beale and I are still working on them a bit. He has yet to talk about whether they will completely replace the current 0.9375m docking ports.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/rRHtdKcm.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 It\u0026#39;s actually round on the ends, and was easily UV-mapped. [/B]On Beale\u0026#39;s last iteration, the difficulty of the shape made his unwrap very awkward, and made the nodes misshapen. The process I don\u0026#39;t remember fully, but I was able to keep the ends round, and imply the shape of a sphere when the revamped docking ports are used. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 I made an alternate hollow model for the future. [/B]I never thought it\u0026#39;d be practical, but after Squad released that hollow structural tube, I think it could actually be really neat. Naturally, it\u0026#39;s all up to Beale, but I\u0026#39;d be willing to put a little time into making a hollow six-way node a reality. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/t3Ii9uXm.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]@Sticky32[/B] managed to make a really great hollow version of the standard Rock-O-Max six way hub. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/mhw7hRUm.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt definitely can be done. Just involved using a bunch of small primitive colliders in order to get it to behave correctly in-game.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI assumed that there would be two different configs for the hubs, one with scaling for 0.9375m ports, and one for scaling for 0.625m ports. It\u0026#39;s really easily done. Could have slipped Beale\u0026#39;s mind to include it, or he has other plans. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/spoiler]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]@Beale,[/B] one thing I have noticed about the hub, is that its texture does not play nice with the docking ports. Its texture isn\u0026#39;t similar enough to the docking ports, so it doesn\u0026#39;t blend well. The textures for my revamped ports are fairly placeholder anyways, so the correct course of action is up to you. :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/4yyFy1z.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027Beale\u0027]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]New Salyut WIP...[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://puu.sh/lvYPW/5de2d9ba11.jpg[/url][/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooking great!
