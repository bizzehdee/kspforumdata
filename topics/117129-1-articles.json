I do suspect it is the name list at play, which is frustrating. The game shouldn\u0027t need to check the name for gender, when there\u0027s the separate gender variable. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EPlus, why must the police kerbal naming? It\u0027s gender discrimination that is! *goes of into rant*\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I found two tricks worked to an extent. Changing the name very slightly had the best result (I suspect that this might be because it takes it out of the lists) . Changing the name of an already female kerbal, and duplicating the kerbal, then changing the gender, and removing the original by in-game means were less effective, and wouldn\u0027t work reliably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I suggest finding a name that\u0027s very close, and changing it very slightly. Adding extra spaces between [name] and Kerman also worked, though of course, it may take a few goes if you want to conserve specialisation. Remember to change every other instance of that kerbals name in the file too, so they appear in the right spots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EAnd update the name in other places.
