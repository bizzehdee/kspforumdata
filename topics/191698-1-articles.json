and 1.6.1, been through the sounding rocket era at least a dozen times before starting over (usually due to either bankruptcy or approaching 1970 without yet so much as a Lunar flyby).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never understood why, if you\u0027re not using Scrapyard and its companion Oh Scrap!, which handle reuse of recovered parts or assemblies, there\u0027s still a refund of parts costs when parts are recovered.\u00A0 As far as I understand it, reflying used parts was never a thing in rocketry before the Shuttle era.\u00A0 Yes, there were concepts that \u003Cem\u003Eintended\u003C/em\u003E to treat rockets like airplanes, but even today, most rocketry follows the \u0022artillery\u0022 model -- launch it and then sweep up the resulting scrap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the reasons SpaceX is able to offer launch services at prices other companies can\u0027t match is that they\u0027re the only ones recovering \u003Cem\u003Eand reusing\u003C/em\u003E even a significant fraction of their launch vehicle since the Shuttle was retired (and unlike the Shuttle, they can refly a booster in mere weeks, instead of almost a year).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet, even without a mod that lets me reuse recovered parts, if I put (correctly configured) parachutes on my sounding rockets, I get most of the cost of the (significantly more expensive and slower to build) rocket back (even for discarded stages, thanks to Stage Recovery).\u00A0 This makes no sense.\u00A0 A WAC Corporal engine has a limited burn time, and the technology of its manufacture would make it cheaper to build a new one than to try to refurbish one to original specifications.\u00A0 Landing under parachute doesn\u0027t generally return a ready-to-fly airframe, either -- flight weight tanks and fins are made of the lightest material that will do the job, and once the tank is depressurized, it\u0027ll be prone to buckle under high, off-axis end loads (as with a parachute landing), not to mention the crumpling of the skin where it protrudes past the actual tank domes.\u00A0 Fins, likewise, are prone to take loads from different directions during landing than what they were built to take in flight, and building them to survive that makes them heavier than they\u0027d otherwise need to be -- which is bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, bottom line: sounding rocket era vehicles \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E be practically reflown after recovery, other than possibly the instrument packages.\u00A0 This is very much true of ICBM-derived launchers, as well -- picture trying to reuse an Atlas balloon tank.\u00A0 Running the engine until the tank is dry results in loss of the internal pressure that\u0027s critical to supporting the tank\u0027s own weight, never mind whatever it\u0027s supposed to carry as payload or upper stages.\u00A0 Even if you shut down with, say, 1% propellants remaining, to keep the pressure, there is no way this tank is going to take landing shocks without buckling the tank wall -- picture a \u003Cem\u003Efull\u003C/em\u003E can of beer that gets dropped, and what happens to the cylindrical sides of the can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe entire vehicle, then, has to be \u003Cem\u003Edesigned\u003C/em\u003E for reuse before recovery gains you anything other than data about the flight -- and we get that in the form of the rapidly diminishing \u0022access to a vehicle that survived X\u0022 science award after recovery (which, IMO, shouldn\u0027t drop off nearly as quickly as it does -- NASA was still learning about reentry in the Shuttle era, learned some after each and every Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo mission, and SpaceX is preparing to learn things no one else has ever known with the thermal management system and swinging fins of Starship).\u00A0 Until the vessel is actually designed and built in a way that allows reflight, we shouldn\u0027t get any kind of refund for the parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
