My name is Seth. I\u0027m running KSP 0.23, I haven\u0027t upgraded to ARM yet. I enthusiastically support KSP and everything it\u0027s trying to accomplish, but a few particular bugs really...bug me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst there\u0027s the general floppiness of large craft, which everybody seems to complain about and nobody seems to have reliably fixed yet without resorting to the debug panel. I do want realism, but you\u0027d think I was flying an ornithopter! If I\u0027m wrong about there being no fixes, please \u003Cem\u003Eplease \u003C/em\u003Edo tell!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes parts that should go together just don\u0027t want to. I often find that if I click enough times and at the right angle (I have found no pattern by which to predict a workable camera angle for a difficult attachment) I can cajole the computer into doing what I want it to, but I don\u0027t enjoy spending up to ten minutes trying to connect things. It\u0027s even worse when trying to fill a B9 cargo bay, which seems only to accept long chains of Mk1-2 Command Pods with one docking port at the front of the first pod. I assume/hope I\u0027m overlooking something incredibly simple here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned I\u0027ve installed B9 Aerospace, and naturally I love it. Perhaps the biggest problem, though, is my SABREs are constantly overheating. Precoolers or no, struts and trusses or no, after about 45 seconds of vertical flight at full throttle they explode. They last a bit longer horizontally - sometimes even up to five minutes if I play the throttle just right, but any lower and I wouldn\u0027t have a shot at space anyhow. Spacing the engines out sometimes works, but sometimes exacerbates the problem. Each flight is different - sometimes the proximal engines fail first, sometimes the distal ones. I tried installing a B9 fix from here \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66020-B9-0-23-fixes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66020-B9-0-23-fixes\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand tried following the instructions here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1we7r2/psa_how_to_get_sabre_engines_b9_aerospace_working/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1we7r2/psa_how_to_get_sabre_engines_b9_aerospace_working/\u003C/a\u003E, but to no avail. I\u0027m really down on my knees about this one - at my stage of familiarity with the game I really prefer a single type of engine on my airplanes so I can focus on fuel management and ascent profiles. RAPIERs are okay, but nothing beats a few SABRE Ms! Until they explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also understand that using B9 engines renders the COM ball invisible or something... is there a fix?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPenultimately, is there a decent mod for building spaceports on other planets? Launching from the Mun, or even Duna would be a godsend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I\u0027m quite eager for any tips on landing gear placement so as to avoid tail scraping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance to everyone who\u0027s going to help me get my aeronautical act together!
