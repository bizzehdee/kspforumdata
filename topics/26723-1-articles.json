Having been a member of the forums for at least a year, I finally decided to stop hiding in the shadows. I started playing KSP back in the 0.13.3 days, and have been hooked ever since. The game has taught me many things, from orbital mechanics to the science of spaceflight, that I currently put to use in my classes. For my physics class, I had to do a project involving something to better society and science, and I chose to use KSP to simulate a large-scale mission to Mars. All in all, I love the game so far, even with its technical issues. Squad has done a great job, and it keeps getting better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T21:02:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community Razor235 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore and more we see KSP used in the classroom, so you might be interested to know that\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/faq.php#MI2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E Squad will work with educators to get KSP into schools\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust think of how much work your class could get done if they had access to KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking about it though, probably not much actual work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razor235","CreatedById":16436,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T21:49:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of my school is already into it.
