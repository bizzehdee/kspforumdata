These compressed\\* textures save both memory and loading time as they can be sent without decompression directly to GPU memory. All of the textures and effects that Squad includes with KSP are now distributed as DDS (if you noticed that 1.0 loads much faster than 0.9, now you know why). Given the numerous benefits that textures in this format provide to players, I encourage all part mod authors to distribute their mods with DDS textures.\n\n**Tools for converting textures to DDS:**\n\n[**Lilleman\u0027s converter**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672)\n\nIntended for end users, but the default settings will usually generate textures that work fine for distribution\n\n[**Photoshop plugin**](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop)\n\nA plugin for Adobe Photoshop which allows it to read and write DDS textures.\n\n[**NVIDIA Texture Tools**](https://developer.nvidia.com/legacy-texture-tools)\n\nCommand line utilities for working with DDS textures.\n\n[**Paint.net**](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html)\n\nFree image editing software for Windows\n\n[**Gimp DDS plugin**](https://code.google.com/p/gimp-dds/)\n\nA DDS plugin for GIMP.\n\n[**img2dds**](https://github.com/ducakar/img2dds)\n\nCross-platform python script for converting contents of GameData to DDS. Might need some modification to work with individual folders.\n\n**What not to convert**:\n\nIcons and any textures that need to have their data accessed directly by a plugin.\n\n**Conversion settings to use**:\n\nFor KSP, textures need to be flipped vertically - The NVIDIA texture tools and Photoshop plugins have settings to do this for you, and Lilleman\u0027s converter does it automatically.\n\nThe textures also need to be in the right format:\n\n**Texture Formats**:\n\n**DXT1**\n\nUse this for anything without an alpha channel.\n\n**DXT5**\n\nUse this for anything with an alpha channel. This includes combined diffuse/shine maps.\n\n**DXT5nm**\n\nUse this format for normal maps.\n\n\\*DDS also supports various uncompressed formats.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T22:20:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blowfish**\n  \nclarity"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:42:52Z","Content":"Note: the only exception is if you need read/write access to the texture ingame (as in, for example, EVE\u0027s cloud mask, where access to pixels is needed to determine where to spawn clouds).
