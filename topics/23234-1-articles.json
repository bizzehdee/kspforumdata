As soon as i decouple, control is reverted back to the module and i cant go back to the rocket. i cant seem to figure out what im doing wrong, or even if im able to do the procedure i want in the current game state. do i need machjeb? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*note: im using docking ports as my coupling at that junction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eheres a pic to help \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LUyST7ys.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/LUyST7ys.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*apologies if this double posts. i had an internet hiccup when posting the thread and i figured it didnt post, so i re-did it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-21T02:09:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2013 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by banded1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UNSC","CreatedById":31653,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T02:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPress \u0022[ or ]\u0022 to switch vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UNSC","CreatedById":31653,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T02:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happened to the original post?!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"banded1","CreatedById":59096,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T02:15:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks. i thought id tried that but evidently not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei have no idea... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei had an internet issue when posting this and i might have reposted it causing an issue\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UNSC","CreatedById":31653,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T02:16:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that was strange...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas your problem fixed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"banded1","CreatedById":59096,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T02:23:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyea issue solved. that was the last thing left in my testing so now i cant actually get a station going without a ton of junk and the vehicle will work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UNSC","CreatedById":31653,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T02:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright then, have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
