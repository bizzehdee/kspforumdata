Waiting too long to start your gravity turn wastes fuel, and if you turn late and don\u0027t turn aggressively, leaves you overshooting your apoapsis or seriously undershooting orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a balancing act. Turn too aggressively too soon and you waste fuel fighting atmospheric drag. Play around with it and find what works best for you and your rocket designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
