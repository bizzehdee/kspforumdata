On one of my ships specifically, the parts menu seems to not properly show as well. I\u0027ve tried verifying game cache on steam as well as a reinstall but to no avail. \n\n[Here is what the VAB screen looks like on the most broken ship.](http://gyazo.com/23ef6eb9d2cb5061fdaaeeddd12ff6d4)\n\nThe launch button seems to freeze the game and the exit button doesn\u0027t work. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: The ship in the picture turned out to have become corrupted. Deleting the ship seems to have fixed the problem for the other ships as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-28T22:17:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2015 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HaloMan27**"},{"CreatedByName":"HaloMan27","CreatedById":140088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T22:15:15Z","Content":"As it would turn out, the file for that ship seems to have become corrupted.
