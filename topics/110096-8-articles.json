KSP physics preclude using many of the more useful satellite placement schemes from the real world so you just have to brute-force it with way more satellites than you really should need, which costs money and eats time. Further, for this and numerous other reasons, it\u0027s not at all career-friendly. Probes are wasteful for gathering science to begin with, their only attraction being they\u0027re cheap so can grab some quick cash and science in a pinch. RT takes this away by vastly increasing the cost and hassle of doing probes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Never been too interested in RT but I could go for a mod that takes transmission time into account...\n\nI\u0027ve played with that and the kOS scripting thing that you use to deal with the signal delay (and has other uses as shown by damerell\u0027s crewed rovers). That was fun in a nostalgic sort of way (seriously, I learned to program with punch cards). But once I got over that, I realized I was just chasing my tail. There are 2 ways to look at stock probes (no RT). RT chooses to assume that probes are total marionettes, needing somebody at KSC constantly controlling their every action, from which comes the need for all the commsats to provide uninterrupted links all over the place. And from that comes signal delay, and thus kOS to provide a very limited amount of autonomy (1960s-style) to the probes in compensation. OTOH, you can choose to view probes as 21st Century autonomous vehicles needing only periodic general orders from KSC and are able to figure out and execute the necessary fine details themselves. Looked at this way, there\u0027s no need for much of a comms network and signal delay isn\u0027t an issue. Given that I do futuristic stuff like invading other planets, I figure the latter is more \u0022realistic\u0022 for my game world than using antique stuff ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T21:46:04Z","Content":"Once again, brilliant work.\n\nThat panel with the heat gauges is **classic!** ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T22:45:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ouch.

It\u0027s a new experience for me to make that connection personally and in something like real time. Also, in many ways fanfiction is a LOT easier than a purely original story. I can just throw in a minor character like Walt or Mort for a gag, and everyone who plays the game instantly knows who it is and gets the joke. No backstory to slow things down. And of course as long as I stay true to the fanon-accepted personalities of the major players, everyone will be familiar with them and care about what\u0027s happening to them.\n\nNow, fill up three ships with a bunch of \u0022no-name whitesuits\u0022, as Walt puts it, and that character-to-reader connection gets a bit harder.
