This only seems to happen in high time warp. All visuals for Kerbin vanish and your left with an open starfield and the Kerbal sun being the only celestial bodies visible in flight map. Orbital map shows a location far from the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second issue that arises along with the vanishing of Kerbin from the flight map is that time freezes at the point of collision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if the flight is reverted to launch from this point, the craft spontaneously disassembles on the launch pad, with no time warp or explosions. The parts simply fall apart like a house of cards and drop into a pile on the pad. Reverting to the VAB, then relaunching, allows the launch to be retried with no issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:18:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy any chance, do your nephew\u0027s name is Danny2462? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:33:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOL, sorry but no. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027s just really good at \u0022breaking\u0022 games. aka: he\u0027s a good accidental bug tester.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CivilizKerbolz","CreatedById":140882,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis your nephew danny? anyway:D, Because the first man who found that bug is danny2462, Squad still trying to fix this. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:02:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehe very well could be...
