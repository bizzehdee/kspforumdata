Really like the idea of both together, would maybe even give the rovers a chance to map things/document things, would be cool if there are different points for how close you are when transmitting data\u002Bthe qaulity of data, being, a sample is always good unless you find a rich zone, photos of things work better during the day and reward more points or maybe if you land closer to a \u0022targeted\u0022 area for science, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike all those ideas though dude. Hopefully the stock game lets you see (without going to map mode) your current height off terrain \u002B Ap/Pe when applicable, so you can descend with greater ease, naming things would be awesome too, maybe extra points for returning Jeb to his very own crater or some such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompletely missed the .22 preview, wonder how the new science parts are going to work. Like the distortion from that Mars Rover game Scott Manley did on Youtube, when with less gear/power video/audio becomes distorted and ruined, would be nice if similar things happen to the data/transmissions. As well as something similar to the \u0022Warp drive\u0022 mod in regards to beaming power and such, maybe not the warp drive/anti matter collector (which is awesome) but the ability to send energy from a sat to another, but within a distance, so you make relays/sats which you can upgrade the range of, or even \u0022turbo charge\u0022 it using more power, for a little range, if you want to control something unmanned that\u0027s a bit too far away, would increase the difficulty factor, whilst also, allowing for greater ease into the game, because you couldn\u0027t (Well you could, but a lot of people wouldn\u0027t) willy nilly shoot for Jool or Duna, without it even appearing on your orbital area, let alone having such a terrible signal, you would either gather science until you were able to upgrade your range to make it easier, or deploy some sats between you and said planet in some form of grid to be able to see/do things with ease and have all the numbers available. You probably wouldn\u0027t even be able to see the thing unless you were looking for it.
