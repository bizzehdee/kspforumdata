It\u0027s that the parts don\u0027t weld in the correct orientation. The part that comes out of the plugin has them all wonky. It\u0027s possible that it could be due to the large variety of attachment possibilities of the LLL parts, since they can be attached radially, or on the surface, or via the nodes, and in all sorts of complex ways (which is part of why I like them). But, again, I know nothing of how this stuff actually works in the guts of things.

So, they built up advanced technologies in a race to \u003Cbr\u003Ewipe their enemies out, but never got to explore their solar system because anything would always \u003Cbr\u003Eget shot down, break apart, or get blown up somehow.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThen, one day, some crazy nut named Jebediah is looking out at the night sky to stare at Minmus \u003Cbr\u003Ebecause he was hungry, and thought it looked tasty, and he thought he saw a glinting semi-metallic \u003Cbr\u003Eobject circling it.  He checked to make sure it wasn\u0027t some sort of metal shaving on his lens again, \u003Cbr\u003Eand was surprised, and a little weirded out, to find that it wasn\u0027t.  After getting together some more\u003Cbr\u003Eof his comrades, they determined that what they saw wasn\u0027t owned by any of the other sects, and \u003Cbr\u003Ewasn\u0027t anything Kerbal-made.  That could only mean it was extraterrestrial in origin, which was \u003Cbr\u003Ecompounded when they turned a radio telescope to face it and started picking up faint signals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESo, Jeb called a meeting with the other Kerbal sects, and got them talking about the thing.  It was\u003Cbr\u003Edecided that a mission would be sent to the \u0022Unidentified Alien Craft\u0022 to examine it.  The KSA was \u003Cbr\u003Eformed (Kerbal Space Agency), and all this powerful weapons technology, computers, propulsion,\u003Cbr\u003Esensors, cameras, antimatter etc. was put on a probe and sent to intercept the UAC, which they\u003Cbr\u003Elearned was actually orbiting Kerbin just outside of Minmus\u0027 orbit.  After all, maybe the ship was\u003Cbr\u003Ehostile and wanted to blow up the planet like in those movies where the pink-skinned creatures\u003Cbr\u003Einvaded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESo the probe gets there, homing in on the signal.  It gets pictures, takes readings, and learns\u003Cbr\u003Eas much as it can about the strange craft (in case you\u0027re wondering, I used the USS Enterprise\u003Cbr\u003Emod to stand in for the alien ship).  It is determined that the only way to learn more is to send a \u003Cbr\u003Emanned mission.  Jeb and his buddies Bill and Bob stayed behind to develop and run the KSA, and\u003Cbr\u003EMilcal Kerman is selected to lead the charge in the KSS Genesis Zero spacecraft.  It has a power core\u003Cbr\u003Eusing matter and anti-matter to fuel a rocket-like engine.  Once used to blow things up, the \u003Cbr\u003Etechnology was being used to create a new future for Kerbalkind.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESo, Milcal pilots the ship and becomes the first Kerbal to ever go so far beyond the bounds of Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003EHe arrives and disembarks for the UAC via EVA.  He finds what appears to be a doorway inside. Against\u003Cbr\u003Ea stream of shouts and warnings, Milcal enters the alien vessel and finds his way to the command \u003Cbr\u003Ecenter.  Most everything is shut down, but after some true Kerbal-style fiddling, Milcal activates the \u003Cbr\u003Eship, and after some trial and error, somehow manages to fly it, not just in a straight line, but back\u003Cbr\u003Eto Kerbin.  Also amazingly, he lands safely.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMilcal returns a hero for all Kerbalkind, and the KSA goes to work deconstructing and learning from \u003Cbr\u003Ethe alien ship.  They then find something called a \u0022Warp Drive\u0022 and find that it can run off of the same\u003Cbr\u003Epower source as Genesis Zero did.  A mockup of the technology was created, and Jebediah himself\u003Cbr\u003Emakes the first faster-than-light flight in Kerbal History.\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that was the initial basis of my little sandbox. From there they built orbital stations to make ships in orbit, and were going to go about exploring every body in the solar system. I never got that far because of constant crashes with large vessels and memory limits, but I was working on it, slowly. It\u0027s still lots of fun. Course I\u0027ll have to start over when .22 comes along since all the mods will probably be invalidated somehow. But, hey, it\u0027s a neat idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T07:25:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ahd1601\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ahd1601\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EParts with RCS thrusters don\u0027t work...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the RCS thruster is the impossibility to use them as rotation if they are welded together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bezzier\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bezzier\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey Ubio, I know you\u0027re not supporting mods, but I wanted to make a note.
