I have noticed that leaving the area and going off to do other things like launch rockets and closing out the game has cleaned up my messy attachment done with a Kerbal on site.

That would seem to be a KSP thing and not a mod thing. This is all at the north pole of Kerbin with cleaned up attachment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a very specific example of falling and being unable to get up, which is likely a KSP/Kerbal thing and not your mod but I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/15xssbo.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i41.tinypic.com/15xssbo.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis Kerman was walking down the tunnel on the left and going to the \u0022nt 4x side\u0022 piece when he fell over. wasd did nothing.

His RCS jetpack works better now. He can actually float a little and rotate on any axis on Kerbin with atmosphere.
