Note that it isn\u0027t fully Ion-powered, and that the Ion engines should be used as a boost to get into orbit. It is 100% stock.

Once the air intake amount reaches about 0.10, press 3 to increase intake air amount.\n\nAlso, this is one of my first attempts at an SSTO since I have focused mainly on rockets.\n\nDownload Here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/c9u73r9nbq1ppvu/Ion%20SSTO.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c9u73r9nbq1ppvu/Ion%20SSTO.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T13:17:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JackDugan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakuzi","CreatedById":85181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T02:20:13Z","Content":"Looking good Jack, great first post, great first ssto and welcome to the forums! Fantastic job getting your first ssto into orbit with ion power. Any idea how much further it can go or how much delta V it has at LKO?"},{"CreatedByName":"JackDugan","CreatedById":139522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T21:14:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Looking good Jack, great first post, great first ssto and welcome to the forums! Fantastic job getting your first ssto into orbit with ion power. Any idea how much further it can go or how much delta V it has at LKO?\n\nThanks! At LKO it has about 5400 m/s of Delta-V. It may be about \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1500 of that number depending on just how good of a pilot you are. It isn\u0027t a lot, but it is probably enough to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI and return, although it is certainly not enough to attempt an interplanetary transfer."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T00:27:52Z","Content":"Nice SSTO; it has really clean lines."},{"CreatedByName":"JackDugan","CreatedById":139522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T21:18:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nice SSTO; it has really clean lines.\n\nThanks!"}]}
