At LKO it has about 5400 m/s of Delta-V. It may be about \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1500 of that number depending on just how good of a pilot you are. It isn\u0027t a lot, but it is probably enough to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI and return, although it is certainly not enough to attempt an interplanetary transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T00:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice SSTO; it has really clean lines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JackDugan","CreatedById":139522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T21:18:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mad Rocket Scientist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mad Rocket Scientist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENice SSTO; it has really clean lines.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
