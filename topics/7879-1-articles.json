After learning that the variable I could edit in the .cfg had to do with initial position, not final, I took it upon myself to try and modify the model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly I have no idea what the hell I\\\u0027m doing. The model does load fine, and it shows up in the parts menu, but I can\\\u0027t actually attach it to the ship, and it doesn\\\u0027t show up normally, either. I feel like I might have screwed up the coordinates in the .dae somehow, but I can\\\u0027t image how.
