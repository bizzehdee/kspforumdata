I will make up a scenario. A 250 km rubble pile. A nuclear bomb of 50 MT power would throw off a large amount of fragments. Those fragments, however, would likely not leave orbit due to said objects gravitational influence. Now, a 250 km differentiated rock with a consolidated surface and interior. It has a Crust, mantle and core. It is of much higher density than said rubble pile. A 50 megaton bomb will create a nice crater, but nothing much will be thrown out of orbit, if at all.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E250 km rocky object would probably have a partially differentiated interior.

However, there are some completely differentiated asteroids(4 Vesta). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 250 km rock would have likely undergone internal heating early in its history. Most of the large rocky asteroids and planetesimals(Over 250 km) must have undergone some degree of internal heating and partial differentiation. Some asteroids have undergone more or less full differentiation(4 Vesta). Vesta is also unique as it has had magmatism early in its history. It is pretty close to a terrestrial planet in composition and internal structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut back to the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t destroy a 250 km rock by blasting off material.
