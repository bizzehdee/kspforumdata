Doing 3500m/s ejection burns at Moho never caused any problem, even before nuke heat nerfing and radiators.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHad a shuttle that couldn\u0026#39;t reenter anymore in 1.0.4 due to heat: it did nothing but explode. Well, I dropped that shuttle and used rockets for putting things to orbit while I designed a new one suited for reentry.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMost of the time, some very quick tweaks are more than enough to make my crafts adapted to a new release.

I made countless improvements to this rocket, kept working on it for weeks, and so it was my first actual rocket that I ever [I]loved[/I] in KSP. Then 1.0 came out and it was not able to take off anymore, and the core stage exploded half the times after I corrected that first issue.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was a little disappointed at the beginning, but I built a new one from nothing and it still works perfectly. Even removed 500t on the pad compared to the old one!

I want 1.1 to break stuff widely for most people, as long as every breakage is due to an improved or refined feature (or an unfortunate side effect of Unity 5\u0026#39;s behaviour just making it unreasonable to maintain some old behaviour).

Yes the game is in a \u0022released status\u0022. But why should that mean Squad has to conserve your gamesaves every time? Im confused. How are they supposed to innovate and try new things if they have to keep the old stuff working with it? It just doesn\u0026#39;t make sense to me in a progressive standpoint. And even so... why is this a problem? Whats keeping people from just not updating? Finish up what your doing on your current version before you update to the new one why is that so hard? If not then maybe its a bad idea to launch a grand tour mission the day 1.1 goes into experimentals.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso make sure you guys understand this is Kerbal Space Program. A game not like any other. So dont compare KSPs/Squads update process to other companies and their games. Thats just silly. Other devs have a much larger budget and staff. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n*insert crappy analogy*\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd besides its not like Squad just springs these updates on us.
