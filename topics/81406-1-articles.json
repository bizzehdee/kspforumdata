There\u0027s lots of ways to make this happen, including scripts you can attach and run in Unity. I paid $5 for one. Optimising a model in your modelling package before-hand is still advised. And even with scripts it still takes a lot of time to properly optimise a complex model. Be careful of over-optimisation - you may b0rk your meshes and colliders. Back-up before any optimisation. \u0022Measure twice, cut once.\u0022 Check the integrity of your model. Roll back if you b0rk it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMERGING MODELS IN A UNITY SCENE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is fiddly because of the lack of flat terrain on Kerbin but it is a really good way of creating a \u0027base\u0027 with more than one model. It will also make optimising even more effective. Try as much as possible to merge models into a single Unity scene. Flick back and forth between using KerbTown in KSP and Unity. Create some single material low-poly \u0027foundations\u0027 to mount your models on to help with merging into terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETEXTURING\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike with part models, you don\u0027t need to use UV maps for \u0027statics\u0027. You can if you want to. You can use texture atlases if you want to. The more materials you have the more likely you\u0027ll want to use a UV map or atlas. You can, however, use a single texture per material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do, however, want to try and re-use the textures I\u0027ve already used in Kerbin-Side. I\u0027ll happy accept up to three new textures with each submission. There\u0027s no limit on how many UV maps and atlases I\u0027ll accept, as long as there\u0027s an actual benefit to them over individual material textures used in Kerbin-Side. If you use texture atlases, try sharing them over all your models as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUV maps and texture atlases can be up to 1024x1024. Individual material textures shouldn\u0027t really be more than 128x128 unless they have a lot of important detail on them. Then 256x256 is fine. Just don\u0027t have too many of these. One 512x512 texture per model is a good limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently switching over a lot of the textures used in Kerbin-Side to more \u0027Squad/Stock\u0027 -alike looking textures.

Make sure there are no graphical issues, that your geometry is sound and stable and very importantly, your colliders ALL WORK. Long edges will result in holes in the colliders. Cut the model up more. Open geometry colliders (flat ones with only two dimensions) will rarely work correctly. Close your geometry. That usually means nearly 4x more polys in your model where your faces have to be given a \u0027depth\u0027 but that\u0027s not such an issue with performance as you\u0027d think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESUBMISSION FORMAT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInclude the following in a zip in a folder structure mirroring that of your development environment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUnity Scene.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMaterials.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETextures.
