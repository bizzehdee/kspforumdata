I read somewhere that Harvester was against random planets because he wanted the community to have a common experience, which makes a lot of sense. I want to apply this thinking to career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe contract system would have several tiers requiring a player to unlock a tier to get to the next (like I said, more game-y). Each tier would require X reputation points to advance to the next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach tier will have a set number of contracts that are \u003Cem\u003Ealways the same. \u003C/em\u003EThese are the only contracts that give rep and allow advancement. But, these contracts also act as challenges- each contract would have 3-4 difficulty levels, ranging from easy to Jeb mode, giving more rep as they get harder. Many factors can be involved, eg. craft cost, tech level, part count, dV, time, and other limiting factors. So, for example one could do 5 contracts on easy difficulty or 2 on Jeb mode to unlock the next tier. Other notes: The permanent contracts will always be available as challenges, but once a tier is unlocked no more rep is gained from doing lower tier challenges. Also, there will still be random contracts, but these are for money only. Doing things that are beyond the scope of the current available contracts will act just like a sandbox mode, so World Firsts and Science still apply but nothing else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPros: Offers a choice for an easier game for beginners but also difficult challenges for pros, plus a common experience for all players to brag about/compare notes/help out others on. This can also increase playability by allowing players to retry missions later on at a harder level, and can add an actual end game to shoot for. This would add more of a puzzle solving aspect for those of us who like to have some hard limits imposed to solve problems. It would also add a more coherent structure to career mode in that the set contracts can cross into multiple tiers, eg. adding to a station, refueling from a specific base, etc. Above all, there would be the fun of insanely hard challenges built into the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCons: Would take quite a bit of time to create/balance. Players who want a lot of freedom would get even more annoyed with career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there it is, some will like it, some will hate it, and it will never happen anyway \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-15T03:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo something akin to the stsrter contracts for every tech/rep milestone...
