Air temperature says almost nothing about your hardware temperature.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C or less: Normal desktop use, light/medium gaming.

Most modern (desktop) processors have a maximum recommended temperature of somewhere around 60-70 degrees Celsius. Anything beyond that is becoming dangerous, and also important, you likely lose performance due to thermal throttling. The chips tries to protect itself by cutting calculations and lowering temperature that way.\n\nI would say anything over 80 degrees Celsius is reason to either reduce workload or increase cooling. Though that is a terribly rough generalisation. It really depends on the chip.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E GPU tend to run close to 90 degrees, had one where the fan stopped working and it shut down at 110.\n\nGPU\u0027s can generally take more of a beating, though they have their limits. CPU\u0027s are much more sensitive to temperature.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T18:21:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 06:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T17:46:36Z","Content":"a good fan is a really good investment, especially if you have a good CPU.

Current pc has 3 inn fans and two out fans, this generates an over pressure who is nice to keep dust out, out fans also cools the radiator. \n\nOne think to watch is hard drives, no they have no issues with 50 degree, however loosing one can be bad even if you have backup it takes a one day to get an pc up and running at task specified behavior. 2-3 days for all software weeks for all the games and minor settings."},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T19:43:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 38.9 isn\u0027t too hot for a PC, so long as the cooling systems are working.
