I park in a 105km orbit, dock the mothership and lander, so far so good. I\u0027m not in an ideal spot to launch so I timewarp to the Jool transfer window, but halfway through the warp it stops because I have entered Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.

For extra safety I stop the warp halfway to check my orbital height and what do you know, my orbit has changed from a stable 130 to 85km periapsis and 160km or so apo.
