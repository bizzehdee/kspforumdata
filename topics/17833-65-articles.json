It may help to split up your delta-v budget into the delta-V that your booster and transfer vehicle needs to get into orbit around wherever you\u0027re going and the delta-V that your probes need to land (that\u0027s how I did it for my lander -- so much delta-V for the landing, so much for the return, and so much to get the whole stack to the destination). Then, you can design your probe to meet its delta-V requirement, turn it into a subassembly, and tack it onto your main vessel, and make sure that the booster/transfer vehicle has enough delta-V to get everything to the planet you\u0027re exploring. Alternatively, you can choose your various probe cores as the root and see what the new \u0022top stage\u0022 has for delta-V, if you want to design everything at once (although you will still have to watch the staging order, and be especially careful if the probe is in the middle of the stack or if the rocket is intended to re-arrange itself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor changing the root, as ObsessedWithKSP suggests, there\u0027s an addon for that: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43208-0-24-Jul18-SelectRoot-Set-a-new-root-part-0-24-new-UI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESelectRoot\u003C/a\u003E. The short version is that, with this mod installed, you can LeftCtrl\u002BLeftShift\u002BClick a part, as long as it has nodes for stack connection, and make it the new root part, allowing you to prune off anything else and make it into a subassembly. For example, build a probe, then tack a rootable part onto the part where the probe will touch the mothership, make it the new root, and then make a subassembly out of the probe. It seems Squad will make this a stock feature in 0.90, so get ready to make the HypeProbeCarrier!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to think of ways for Kerbal Engineer to do this accounting, and my idea basically involves making trees starting from any potential control source and tracing out which rockets can accelerate which core, but that still depends a lot on when various parts get released. How is KER supposed to know if a probe gets released when the fuel tank of its carrier stage is only half-empty? That will affect the true delta-V of the whole stack below it. All of this depends on staging order, and more importantly, mission architecture, which is probably not possible to automatically store, compute, or evaluate in a reasonable way -- if it were, there wouldn\u0027t be much need for us aerospace engineers. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mystique","CreatedById":95628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T18:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it a spot in my knowledge of how rockets fly or KER is calculating stage delta-v in a strange way: I have SRB and LFE as booster stage.
