How long that fuel will last depends entirely on which engines are burning it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T17:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPecan is correct. The amount of fuel is of course proportional to the potential burn time, but different types and numbers of engines will burn that fuel for different actual spans.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T17:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmount of fuel consumed also depends on atmospheric pressure. Most engines have different (higher) fuel consumption at higher atmospheric pressures.
