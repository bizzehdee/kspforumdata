The latter means you grind through the same mission over and over again to increase your rooster. How about if there were contracts to rescue abandoned pods which contain multiple kerbals? It increases your rooster, it\u0027s less grind and it may or may not require to recover the pod, increasing the difficulty a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-15T12:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a bad idea at all!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo avoid it being over powered they should tend to be in more complicated orbits, that are either polar, or highly elliptical, etc...
