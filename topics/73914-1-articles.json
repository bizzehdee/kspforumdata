This means I could save quite a bit of weight on my long-range spaceplanes by replacing the insertion burn engines (normally aerospikes) by LVN nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not too comfortable igniting nuclear engines in atmosphere. (yes I know there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no in-game consequence, but the idea just rubs me the wrong way.) I have no problem igniting them the second I get to space since I figure at that point the magnetosphere and the amount of atmosphere between the exhaust and the surface will diffuse/redirect the radioactive particles to such a degree that they are no longer harmful. So I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m wondering: you guys think that igniting at 25-30km up is high enough to avoid any noticeable nuclear fallout below or should I always aim for orbital insertion first, then LVN\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s once I go above about 75 km?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve actually been toying around with the idea of a spaceplane with LVN engines and a separate stage for orbital insertion. Once it gets to orbit, it parks the orbital insertion stage (possibly on a refuel station or just letting it float in orbit) and goes off on the interplanetary journey. Once it comes back, we redock and take the whole thing back down to KSC. Could use that as an alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts on this? Is it a good idea? Will it work? Do you have any other, better suggestions? If so, do share!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T14:12:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it the LVN is a closed cycle nuclear reactor, the only radiation comes from the engine it\u0027s self.
