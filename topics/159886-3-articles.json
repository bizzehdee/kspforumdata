Remember that these same contractors are still making hardware for keeping things like the B-52 flying (in service since 1955!).

Which can easily add tens of billions to total project cost. Not to mention the nightmares of having just a launch per year, if not less. There\u0027s a reason I said \u0022could\u0022, and that\u0027s because it \u0022can\u0027t\u0022, at least not in the 551 version. The 552 version might be able to put more up there. Heck, the Atlas V has had a pretty significant cost reduction in recent years, not to mention its high reliability. I\u0027d rather rely on\u00A0a launcher with very few failures than one with no launches. Basically, if a parasite launch vehicle shows up, expect an increase in program cost by many billions of dollars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, there are more chances for something to go wrong. But you\u0027re trading an increase in the occurrence of failures for an increase in redundancy for those failures. More things will go wrong, but the system as a whole is more capable of handling those events than a heavy lift architecture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe arguments you make are true, yes, but there\u0027s a reason I didn\u0027t take that into account. Because the small increase in cost\u00A0from those concerns is\u00A0still less than the cost of developing and then launching six SLS\u00A0rockets. Far, far less. And considering that most of the engineering and cost will be for the final assembled spacecraft, launch costs are unimportant. A few billion is less than NASA\u0027s annual budget, what\u0027s going to be the vast majority is developing the spacecraft and the cost of the spacecraft itself. In any case, it should be similar in cost to the ISS, except that it can actually go to Mars. And it may cost even less, considering that most of the mass is propellant, and that no Shuttle flights would be involved. We wouldn\u0027t really know until we do a detailed analysis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point I\u0027m making here is that the effort spent to develop SLS would\u0027ve been\u00A0far better suited to developing a spacecraft using many smaller launchers. But instead we had to wait for a heavy lifter when it\u0027s totally unnecessary. Sure, you may get reduced costs with an already existing heavy launcher, but we don\u0027t have one. Heck, we technically had one for 30 years, but it had to waste 80% of its payload capacity. While there are plenty of added complications to EOR, they are possible to overcome. Heavy lift is not necessary for Mars. Even the Moon. What is necessary is money.
