Sequential missions\u003C/strong\u003E - completing a mission from start to finish, thus focusing their attention. The downside of this is warping through time and pushing the clock years in the future. This is especially bad for multiplayer and space races.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Parallel missions\u003C/strong\u003E - launching, setting up maneuver nodes and alarms but not time warping. This maximizes the amount of missions you can do with a particular tech level in a certain time window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI propose a third:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Parallel-sequential missions.\u003C/strong\u003E A good way to play I think would be to finish a whole mission then go back in time and continue with other missions from the moment you launched. Recorded mission milestones would be added to the main timeline. And the science points would come in the future, thus respecting the timeline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this would be useful for space races also, because I\u0027m that case the timeline is very important and you can\u0027t really time warp because you\u0027re losing opportunities to launch more missions. So there\u0027s a lot of freedom to be gained by being able to go back in time. But from a gameplay perspective it\u0027s also very useful for the flow of the game to be able to focus on a single mission and finish it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis system allows for massive gameplay expansion.. like stage recovery, having single player space races against an AI controlled agency and rocket construction time passing in the stock game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to mention multiplayer (see multiplayer thread)!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XeuPrYtf2SVE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002253.99\u0022 height=\u0022528\u0022 width=\u0022978\u0022 src=\u0022https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/XeuPrYtf2SVE.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELater edit: \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteraction with the craft could be feasable without resetting the recorded events timeline from that point onward if we have mechjeb-like automated control using milestones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft (or capable subassembly in case of separation) would just try to adapt and continue with the mission even if crippled or modified.

Sequential missions\u003C/strong\u003E - completing a mission from start to finish, thus focusing their attention. The downside of this is warping through time and pushing the clock years in the future. This is especially bad for multiplayer and space races.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Parallel missions\u003C/strong\u003E - launching, setting up maneuver nodes and alarms but not time warping. This maximizes the amount of missions you can do with a particular tech level in a certain time window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI propose a third:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Parallel-sequential missions.\u003C/strong\u003E A good way to play I think would be to finish a whole mission then go back in time and continue with other missions from the moment you launched. Recorded mission milestones would be added to the main timeline. And the science points would come in the future, thus respecting the timeline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this would be useful for space races also, because I\u0027m that case the timeline is very important and you can\u0027t really time warp because you\u0027re losing opportunities to launch more missions. So there\u0027s a lot of freedom to be gained by being able to go back in time. But from a gameplay perspective it\u0027s also very useful for the flow of the game to be able to focus on a single mission and finish it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis system allows for massive gameplay expansion.. like having single player space races against an AI controlled agency.
