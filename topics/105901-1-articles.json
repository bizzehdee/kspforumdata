Your fins are in the middle front. That would take real effort to get that to fly. Think of an arrow, the heavy bit is in the front and the feathers are in the back. You have the feathers in the front and the heavy bit in the back.\n\nActually if you fly right you don\u0027t need fins at all. You just have to stay inside the circle that is the prograde vector.\n\nLike so, just ignore the commentary at the end.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZF-12RavF4Y?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:59:25Z","Content":"Leszek is correct about the fins but I still want to add two minor pieces of advice: Use SAS and a pilot!\n\nYou might think \u0027What do you mean?

Also, put some nosecones on the bottom tanks, they matter for aerodynamics now. Because rocket engines are now less efficient than before, something that small probably won\u0027t reach orbit. Build bigger and with multiple stages.\n\nIf you do get to orbit, you might want a heatshield and decoupler below your pod if you want to make it back down in one piece."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:00:36Z","Content":"As others have stated, you need to make your rocket aerodynamically stable.

I think that it is also a bit off, you should have a starting TWR of 1.2 - 1.5 or so. This TWR makes it easier to complete your turn before you are blasted out of the atmosphere and also prevents you from going too fast in the lower part of it. I normally start with 1.25 and I will thrust limit engines to makes sure I get it."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:01:09Z","Content":"The most important reason you should moderate your speed is drag. With the new, more realistic atmosphere drag increases exponentially when speed increases. And only the tip of your rocket experiences all this drag making your rocket extra unstable and hypersonic speed."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:19:14Z","Content":"Drag does not increase exponentially. Drag increases by the square of velocity, and it always has done so in KSP. You\u0027re correct that it\u0027s now the case that orientation and part placement matters regarding drag, but even in a purely straight-on orientation, not all the drag is being caused by the nose.

Maybe even with something simpler, but that\u0027s my best.\n\nHowever, the technique to flying a successful orbital launch well is more involved in 1.0 than it was in the past. You may want to blast upward a bit further than the old \u0027tilt to 45 degrees at 10km\u0027, and you definitely want to drop your nose to orbital prograde at lower altitudes than before, since the upper atmosphere has so little drag.\n\nI\u0027d recommend designing and flying so that you don\u0027t need tail fins rather than using them. They\u0027ll increase stability if they\u0027re in the right place, but SAS alone is more than sufficient to keep you pointing where you need to without the extra cost, weight, and drag."},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:51:19Z","Content":"You should have no problem designing a 2 stage liquid fueled rocket to do your first orbit without the need to upgrade the pad.
