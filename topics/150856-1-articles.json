So for example a Jool relay sat would need a 88-88 to talk to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and then an RA-2 to cover the Joolian system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne way I thought I could do this was with ModuleProbeControlPoint, with minimumCrew = 0, but that just enables control even if the main relay sat has no connection to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Is there a way to enable that module after checking \u003Cspan\u003EVesselControlState\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E, just in a part cfg file?
