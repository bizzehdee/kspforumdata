I\\\u0027ve wanted a game like this for so long. Even though I\\\u0027d prefer 3d, having a 2d interface keeps it nice and simple. See how they can set how the laser sweeps the enemy for example. Or how they need to fight on board fires while working the controls. A sick bar for crew too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis kind of interactivity would be great mixed with KSPs type of ship building.
