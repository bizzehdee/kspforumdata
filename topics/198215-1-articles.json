Right now, there\u0027s still an opportunity to release a major update with a DLC for KSP and it will sell. Once KSP2 is out, it will be far more profitable to work on DLC for KSP2, and so they\u0027ll probably wind down KSP support. But some small bug fixes might still happen from time to time, especially, since Squad still owns work on KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-20T22:46:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad has stated that development of the two games will continue separately.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DihydrogenMonoxide","CreatedById":207533,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-22T02:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. Squad and Private Division work\u00A0on their own game separately.
