Only you can save kerbalkind. The minimum viable population is around 3-6 thousand for most vertebrates. So you need to launch at least 3 thousand kerbins into an escape trajectory. And even then, they\\\u0027ll be facing some inbred 4-thumbed kiddies after a few generations on alpha kerbtauri.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is made vaguely possible by the development of Cryogenic freezing. Let\\\u0027s say a frozen human takes up 2 cubic meters of space each (giving enough space for refrigeration, maintenance tunnels, pressure seals, luggage, etc. Scaled to the 1/4-scale kerbins, that\\\u0027s 32 kerbins per cubic meter. This works out pretty nicely: standard 1m habitation mods will store 40 frozen kerbins each, and my 2-meter by 2-meter hab mods will store 200.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo ideally, you\\\u0027d want to launch at least 15 big hab mods, or 75 lesser mods, or some combination of the two. Get them out of the solar system. Even if you can\\\u0027t manage that many, species have been known to occasionally survive surprisingly-tight genetic bottlenecks, if they\\\u0027re lucky. Genetics is anything but dependable. Also: maybe they can bring along a few tons of frozen kerbo-sperm, to add to the genetic diversity (though where, exactly, one would GET a ton of kerbo-sperm is best left to the imagination). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the bottom line is thus: the more Kerbsicles you send, the more likely they are to survive.

My most recent designs have 3 layers, a ring of solid boosters, a ring of 2m liquid fuel rocket stages (with the hab mods at the top), and the central liquid 3m stages. I fire all the bottom-level stages on liftoff, and drop them off as they run out (starting with the solids, then the 1st stage outer liquids, then the 1st stage inner liquid, then the 2nd outer liquid, etc.), and immediately firing the exposed stage beneath. The gimballing keeps the ship on target (using asas, no RCS until you get into orbit). It\\\u0027s also important to keep making your stages lighter, smaller, and more efficient, as you rise, since up there you need more delta V out of each stage, but you don\\\u0027t need it to happen as quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw: the Kebylon lauchpad is part of the black sun pack.
