I did some looking around and noticed that camera controls are in the \u0027do not suggest\u0027 thread, so I won\u0027t post this as a suggestion- more as feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe camera, when combined with the ship controls, are breaking this game for me in a serious way. Especially with symmetrical ships, it\u0027s almost impossible to know which side is up without making it asymmetrical in some way (which I\u0027d rather not do, anyways). It\u0027s awkward and somewhat silly that the game has no way of letting the controls be relevant to the player\u0027s viewpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be solved in two seemingly simple ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Allow the camera to rotate with the ship such that up would always be camera up. I would give an arm and a leg to have this as a function. You\u0027d still be able to zoom in and out, but the rotation would match ship rotation. This would go SO far in making this game playable for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Allow a checkbox that would tie the controls to the camera, such that no matter which way the ship was, pressing \u0022w\u0022 would make your nose point towards the top of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just seems so silly not to have this as an option. This game is already great and looks like it has fantastic potential, but as long as the controls are this bad there\u0027s no way I\u0027m going to be able to dedicate any serious time to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure many of you will pipe up and say \u0022oh you can get used to it if you sink enough time into it\u0022 and that may well be true. But logically speaking, that is not an argument against having functional and intuitive controls, especially with the masses of newer people trying the game now that it\u0027s on Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading, and I look forward to feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T01:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust place some lights at the front \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Or bottom if it\u0027s a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T02:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rathlord\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rathlord\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAllow the camera to rotate with the ship such that up would always be camera up.
