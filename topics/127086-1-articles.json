I play stock, i never have this problem. I don\u0027t think you have to select the port as target, etc. so maybe there\u0027s a mod thing at work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T14:50:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can sometimes happen. One or both of the docking ports think that they are in a different state than they should be (like already connected). You will probably have to correct them manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo to your persistent.sfs file (KSP/saves/name_of_the_save/persistent.sfs), open in text editor, find the vessels in question, find the docking port parts and check whether they are \u0022state = Ready\u0022 under the MODULE section. If they are not, change them to \u0022state = Ready\u0022, save, and reload your game. Should ifx the issue, just be careful as to not change the state of a different docking port (seems like you have at least 2 of them... all of the not connected ones should be state = Ready).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Oh well, didn\u0027t see you already solved the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-05T14:51:14Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2015 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deutherius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
