IE impact-detonated warheads that stay connected to the craft, for tactical strikes or long-range, high-power cruise missiles. You could have aerodynamic pointed-tip warheads and inline warheads, so you could launch a cluster of MIRV warheads, then fly the leftovers somewhere else. Just an idea, I don\u0027t know how possible it is but it\u0027s be a useful addition \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RRFroste","CreatedById":136964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T10:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022harpwner\u0022 data-cite=\u0022harpwner\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas for the bigger tsar, it\u0027s blast radius was increased to 30km\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E30km!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Combatsmithen","CreatedById":146407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T13:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewait. if you are making a BAE railgun.
