I\u0027ve done Duna landings before (the nuclear engines worked very well for me during both landing and ascent); the reason I\u0027m having trouble now is that the ship I\u0027m working on isn\u0027t really a lander, but rather an interplanetary cargo shuttle that can carry payloads on the back. I was originally going to send it to Duna with a lander attached, but then I thought it would be cool to actually land the whole thing on the surface with a lab and some scientific instruments. You know, something worthy of Jebediah. The design has about 9,000 delta-v, so I\u0027m not worried at all in that area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking of putting some additional high-power rockets on the side that can be used during the Duna ascent and then ditched once in orbit.
