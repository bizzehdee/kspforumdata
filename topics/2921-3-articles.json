I\\\u0027ve got waaaaay too much mass on my lander, though; mostly this is because I wanted to attempt an Apollo-like flight profile, leaving the descent stage behind, and also because I find it helpful to have both SAS and RCS on my landers. The result is a rather large and wobbly configuration at launch, which can be a bit annoying to fly, but is also lots of fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, If I wasn\\\u0027t using modded parts I would need far more stages. KSP silisko edition is sweet, but would still require far more parts than I have currently. Also, I think I mentioned it in the first few posts but I\\\u0027m still iffy about getting back to kerbin. I\\\u0027m not sure if I have anywhere near enough DV on the lander to descend, ascend and then return home. If it turns out I don\\\u0027t, then I\\\u0027ll adding more mass to the to the lander stage that might equate to at least one more SRB, or another liquid stage.
