The smaller, Jet-only version (the -D) only has two engines, and the original version of this did too, but it was too sluggish so I stuck a third on. I can\u0027t figure out anywhere else to put more intakes that doesn\u0027t look like crap, and I \\*do\\* care how it looks, other than putting a couple of outboard tanks on...which is what the -G does. It also carries more fuel which mostly negates its ability to go higher and faster.\n\nPutting an aerospike on the center might work, but breaks the fuel segregation, opening the possibility of the Turbojets eating liquidfuel meant for the rockets. Unless the entire thing is rebuilt with LFO fuel tanks in the center instead of jet-fuel-only tanks. But that\u0027d be a COMPLETE rebuild, and it\u0027d be a Ravenspear Derived something-Else. You don\u0027t need to rebuild it you can cross-route the fuel, but with ALL the engines mounted on the wrong tanks that makes the fuel routing distinctly tricky. You\u0027d basically have to to use strict tank lockouts (to prevent the turbojets leaving you with an excess of oxidizer), and only use one engine type at a time (or you\u0027ll confuse the fuel flow logic).\n\nTrust me, I\u0027ve thought of all that, I just can\u0027t think of any way to really make it work well without basically using a completely different design. And the existing one already gets 1000 delta-V to orbit, and has jet fuel to spare.\n\nIf there were some way to block fuel crossflow to the engines and force them to use fuel lines, it could work. But I\u0027ve already got another (rocket) design that\u0027s stuck because of that very problem. Why the heck did they suddenly decide to make EVERYTHING crossfeed?!\n\nEdit:\n\nThere\u0027s also the Uprated -G Version that carries more fuel, and has capability to carry a rover. It\u0027s been to DUNA without refueling, but would have to refuel to get back.\n\nI\u0027ve posted a few shots of it before, but here\u0027s a SPH Shot of the current, rover carrying GR variant: \n\n![90189BF2A0984FD843FC4ABCFFD64960A7535471](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/594754812321721539/90189BF2A0984FD843FC4ABCFFD64960A7535471/)\n\nEdit2:\n\nJust for fun, I tried swapping the Aerospikes for LV-Ns.

I have not had a single reliability problem with my design and its easier to fly then more traditional designs. Most people cant maintain cg or get the drag fare back enough to make it stable.\n\nGood ssto sould maintain cg at all times, easily done with parallel tanks only.\n\nLots of lift, easy to get with a flying body. Reduces the need for lots of engines and fuel. Wings have almost no drag sense drag is proportional to mass so they give high rate off climb with out introducing much drag at high speed and altitude.\n\nIntakes should be behind cg to maintain stability. Common fault for instability when reentering.\n\nLots of intakes. Intakes are fubar in the game any way. Real problem is not the amount of air for a real craft but geting the air speed down to sub sonic speeds and secondly is that past mach 3 the air gets to hot for most jet designes. At mach 5.5 the air hits a 1000C entering a jet engine. Theres no jet engine that can take this. A heat exchanger is needed. Saber engine design will have one. The part exist in ksp but do not work.\n\nSo untill intakes are made realistic so we dont need a ton of them but rater a heat exchanger for high speeds intake abuse is the most efficient way and gets one closer to the real speed of tomorrows real space planes. \n\nBut if you dont like good advice thats fine, you dont seem to take advice very well any way.\n\nBtw jets have in practice about 20k isp in ksp due to the fact that thy get there oxidizer from the air so its not 1200 or 2000, its a lot more. Rockets have nothing that comes close. So its fare more efficient throttling down to avoid flame out and use rockets to maintain accalaration and climb then using just rocket power.\n\nBut you will figure that out in time and much more.\n\nBut Im not going to give you any more advice sense you dont seem to like that.\n\nSome one else migth find it useful.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-18T01:25:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2013 01:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T01:28:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But if you dont like good advice thats fine, you dont seem to take advice very well any way.\n\nBecause it\u0027s not a \u0027I need help getting my SSTO to work\u0027 thread, or a \u0027I need help making my SSTO better\u0027, thread, it\u0027s a \u0027Show off your SSTO\u0027 thread.\n\nI didn\u0027t \\*ask\\* for advice, and frankly most of the advice you give is condescending and belittling.

So 80 parts or 800 parts makes no difference to me.\n\n1200 is pushing it but another tip is not to focus on parts but what parts are used. Engines are a lot more demanding on physics and frame rate then say intakes or the 1kg girders. I have a max budget of 14 jet engines and thats because 1200 part space plane with 14 jets runs at 30-40 fps while a 1000 part one with 20 runs a 4-5 fps. Not all parts are equally demanding.

So my lates [40\u002B tons lifter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35997-20-FatNose-FatBob-SSTO-lifter-project) has just 170 parts and just 8 structs.\n\u003E \n\u003E Conceptually I think that use an SSTO is good to lift things in orbit, not to bring that things around the kerbol system that is good for a challenge not for a planned colonize program. I do lift in orbit SSTO using a SST0.

So the Kerbin SSTO will be different from the Duna SSTO and the interplanetary shuttle designed to never land on a planet but very effective to transport.\n\nI completely agree. I have been working on a SSTO that have space for a booster stage to and a jumbo tank at least. IRL it would be to costly to send an SSTO on a 3 year mission sens it at the most would do 10 missions in it life time if there is a fast turn around. But it gets routine to manage a single craft so I find it relabel from a gaming perspective and also the challenge to build the craft. Plus you have good precision so you can land spot on and also the payload requires little to no modification to fit. No need for lander stage etc. Also saves space in the SSTO. So theres plus and minuses but in KSP time realy dont mater atm. For career mode LKO missions makes the most sense. I have not tried it but in theory one could lift a payload from another planet to if needed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How do you exactly save that much? Because I get flame-outs at 27 000m altitude no matter what I do: decreasing engine throttle, adding MOAR intakes, increasing number of turbojets up to 20...\n\u003E I am working on a 200 ton SSTO too btw, able to carry a payload of 40 tons. Gets to orbit burning two orange fuel tanks almost to 0. Consists of only 400 parts though, anything more than that starts to lag badly.\n\u003E \n\u003E I am impatient though, if your method is waiting for 10\u002B minutes while the weak-ass jets accelerate the damn thing then I would prefer assembling more efficient interplanetary craft in orbit.\n\nI cut engines of in pairs so I run on two engines the last bit then I have 10 intakes per engine but its a bit overkill sens the gains drop off then I throttle down to. I also find that mounting the jets on 1kg girders on the big girders or I beams seems to reduce the flame out threshold even down ti 0.01. Do not seem to work as soon as one engine is mounted to a fuel tank, maybe not even rocket engines because it wont work on my Jumbo atm but did at least on older crafts in 0.18. But I also run until I get fluctuations on the intakes sens a big SSTO wont spin out of control if you press the key as soon as it indicates insufficient air on the resource bar plus I have LOTS of rudder control. Thats an important feature for stability. My crafts cant fly with out it at all because there more or less pure delta wing design. I have run engines at up to 56Km I think but that is at 2Kn or so trust but enough to often maintain the orbit while its doing the suborbital jump so to speak where there still is drag.\n\nAlso if possible mount the last jet in the center. And run the last jets and rockets at the same time that saves fuel sens jets are more efficient.\n\nWhen I started to fly my jumbo I used like 1500L of oxidizer for LKO. Now Im down to 600L so practice saves fuel.\n\nI have achieved over 2100 delta V with jets alone so with nukes even close to 200 tons wont take much oxidizer. That was with two jet engines the last way to but it tends to slow down a bit before I got rockets.\n\nSpeed is also important to get air intake. I write down flame out numbers and also a diagram where I do changes in angle as I climb. Climb to fast and you wont get enough speed and actually drop again. Climb to slow and you burn to much fuel. I dont use mechjeb so took me a howl day of try and error to get a useful preliminary chart for my Jumbo. But once one gets more confortable I have a chart with more or less exact flame out numbers so I cant be ready to hit the action key asap.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-18T23:16:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2013 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983**"},{"CreatedByName":"kepicness","CreatedById":29074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T22:03:45Z","Content":"Would you mind posting an image of that chart?

Any more intakes is just adding drag, so close them until you get higher."}]}
