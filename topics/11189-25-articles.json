The smaller, Jet-only version (the -D) only has two engines, and the original version of this did too, but it was too sluggish so I stuck a third on. I can\u0027t figure out anywhere else to put more intakes that doesn\u0027t look like crap, and I *do* care how it looks, other than putting a couple of outboard tanks on...which is what the -G does. It also carries more fuel which mostly negates its ability to go higher and faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting an aerospike on the center might work, but breaks the fuel segregation, opening the possibility of the Turbojets eating liquidfuel meant for the rockets. Unless the entire thing is rebuilt with LFO fuel tanks in the center instead of jet-fuel-only tanks. But that\u0027d be a COMPLETE rebuild, and it\u0027d be a Ravenspear Derived something-Else. You don\u0027t need to rebuild it you can cross-route the fuel, but with ALL the engines mounted on the wrong tanks that makes the fuel routing distinctly tricky. You\u0027d basically have to to use strict tank lockouts (to prevent the turbojets leaving you with an excess of oxidizer), and only use one engine type at a time (or you\u0027ll confuse the fuel flow logic).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrust me, I\u0027ve thought of all that, I just can\u0027t think of any way to really make it work well without basically using a completely different design.

But I\u0027ve already got another (rocket) design that\u0027s stuck because of that very problem.

IRL it would be to costly to send an SSTO on a 3 year mission sens it at the most would do 10 missions in it life time if there is a fast turn around. But it gets routine to manage a single craft so I find it relabel from a gaming perspective and also the challenge to build the craft. Plus you have good precision so you can land spot on and also the payload requires little to no modification to fit. No need for lander stage etc. Also saves space in the SSTO.

I also find that mounting the jets on 1kg girders on the big girders or I beams seems to reduce the flame out threshold even down ti 0.01. Do not seem to work as soon as one engine is mounted to a fuel tank, maybe not even rocket engines because it wont work on my Jumbo atm but did at least on older crafts in 0.18. But I also run until I get fluctuations on the intakes sens a big SSTO wont spin out of control if you press the key as soon as it indicates insufficient air on the resource bar plus I have LOTS of rudder control. Thats an important feature for stability. My crafts cant fly with out it at all because there more or less pure delta wing design.

Now Im down to 600L so practice saves fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have achieved over 2100 delta V with jets alone so with nukes even close to 200 tons wont take much oxidizer. That was with two jet engines the last way to but it tends to slow down a bit before I got rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed is also important to get air intake. I write down flame out numbers and also a diagram where I do changes in angle as I climb. Climb to fast and you wont get enough speed and actually drop again. Climb to slow and you burn to much fuel. I dont use mechjeb so took me a howl day of try and error to get a useful preliminary chart for my Jumbo. But once one gets more confortable I have a chart with more or less exact flame out numbers so I cant be ready to hit the action key asap.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-18T23:16:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2013 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kepicness","CreatedById":29074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T22:03:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould you mind posting an image of that chart?

Any more intakes is just adding drag, so close them until you get higher.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
