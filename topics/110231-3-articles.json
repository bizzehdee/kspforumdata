At 300K of typical Earth life, you need pretty strong bonds in things like DNA and complex proteins to hold them together against thermal excitations. And to break these apart, you need a strong, polar solvent. Water is by far the best option, and the only available one that\u0027s naturally abundant. So at terrestrial temperature ranges, life means water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In contrast, if you are at less than 100K, such as on Titan, hydrogen bonds are frozen solid. Your complex molecules will be held together by van der Waals forces. A polar solvent would ript that stuff to shreds, and no life would be possible. Fortunately, there are non-polar solvents, such as liquid methane. So if we are talking cryogenic life, life means liquid methane. And that makes Titan a perfect place to look for cryogenic life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Granted, life at high temperatures has huge number of advantages. There are more potential energy sources, all of the processes are faster, and you can dump excess entropy way easier. Which means life will be more complex and far further evolved on Earth than it could ever be on Titan. I would not expect anything past simplest bacteria there. Something similar to Earth\u0027s Archaea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So finding life on Titan would tell us two things. First, that our definition of \u0022habitable\u0022 is a bit too narrow. Second, that two planets within a single star system have developed completely different life independently. And while former has very limited impact, because planets/moons like Titan are unlikely to ever produce complex life, that second statement is extremely powerful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E We live on Earth. Which means odds of us finding life on Earth are 100% ab initio. There is no way any species could ever find itself in a barren star system. Which means that us knowing that there is a habitable planet here is absolutely useless. Even if there is just one in all of the universe, we\u0027d be on it. But two planets? Odds there being very few habitable planets out there, yet there being two, so vastly different, in our star system are minimal. If we find life on Mars or Europa, we\u0027d still have to figure out if it had the same origin as life on Earth. For all we know, it did. Panspermia isn\u0027t very appealing on global scale, but within confines of a single star system, it\u0027s quite plausible. But if we find life on Titan, we know it didn\u0027t come from Earth. We know it\u0027s not contamination from one of the probes. Life on Titan cannot exist in water, and life from Earth cannot exist on Titan. Simple as.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If we find life on Titan, that\u0027s two data points from which we extrapolate a very simple fact. When you look up into the sky and look at the stars, more of the stars you see probably have life than don\u0027t. There is nothing we can find on Mars or Europa that would be anywhere close to this impact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife on titan, indeed, would be a greater discovery than on mars or Europa.
