The wheels don\u0027t take the weight very well and the max height of them is actually shorter than the large stock landing gear.\n\nAre there any other similar mods for landing gear, or at least just any landing gear?"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:27:03Z","Content":"[KAX](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76668) has a landing gear but it\u0027s smaller.\n\nBut in my opinion adjustable landig gear is the best there is. If they can\u0027t support the weight of your plane, add more of them!\n\nAnd I don\u0027t think they are too small, they have a scale slider. On max scale they are giantic!\n\n![yquqZ8S.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yquqZ8S.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:34:21Z","Content":"Problem isn\u0027t that they are small in scale, but that their legs are short. Hung under the wings, they sometimes only barely clear the the belly of large planes.\n\nIf I scale them, the top part that holds them when they are raised gets ridiculously huge."},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:46:47Z","Content":"If you remove the top part you can see the wheels clipping through your wings. There is no other way to hide that.\n\nAnd if you don\u0027t have enough clearance below your plane you put the gears in the wrong places. It\u0027s a bad idea to attach them to the wing because the heavy fuselage will usually sag. It put too much stress on the plane which is especially bad when landing a heavy plane.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T19:48:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by \\*Aqua\\***"}]}
