I was wondering if you could play KSP in windowed fullscreen (since i have 2 screens and dont want the game to minimize when i go onto my other screen) can there be anything changed so i can play in windowed fullscreen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T19:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if this is exactly what you want, but there is a way to play in a borderless windowed full screen mode. The method is a bit different depending on if you launch the game through Steam or if you bought it from the store.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Steam: \u00A0Open the game, go to the video settings, and turn off full screen. Then quit. Right click on KSP, select properties, and in the general tab under launch options type in \u0022-popupwindow\u0022 but\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Ewithout\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0the quotes. Then launch the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the store: Go to the main KSP folder and right click on the KSP.exe executable (what you would double click the play the game, NOT the launcher). Create a shortcut. Right click on the shortcut you just made, and click on properties. In the \u0022Target\u0022 box, after all the stuff that\u0027s in quotes, and add \u0022-popupwindow\u0022\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Ewithout\u003C/u\u003E quotes. Then double click the shortcut to launch the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
