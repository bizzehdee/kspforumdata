Some other people may have the same reaction as me, limiting your user base. But Kethane is a well established mod and it would make an interesting mission pack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESplitting your mission packs by addon dependencies is a smart solution to problem #2, letting people use the packs for which they have mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPeople play this game the way they want\u003C/strong\u003E, but personally, I don\u0027t like KSP reminding me too much of our real tragic life. So, while I will not scream, I would not play it because it\u0027s not my definition of \u0027fun\u0027. For me, it\u0027s a game about sending cartoon guys to space, not re-creating \u0027weapons of vengeance\u0027. \u003Cbr\u003EYou may avoid this problem by defining missions that are structurally the same as our RL military funded space program (first rockets, atmosphere studies, etc) but with a different context. The mail rocket idea smartly proposed by Ph34rb0t is an excellent example : technically, it would mimic the V-2 studies, while avoiding hurting people feelings...\u003Cbr\u003ESo a good solution would be some kind of common trunk to the civilian and military mission packs, where you study the high atmosphere, liquid engines and guidance systems (ie techs that were developed during WWII and the early 50\u0027s). Once people have completed this part, they may switch to the space program they prefer. Either \u0022civilian\u0022, i.e. probes to other planets, manned flights to the Mun, space stations or \u0022military\u0022, i.e. missile tests, precise re-entries and spy satellites for example.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my 0.02...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T14:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew Version .16 \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Pretty Sure I squashed the flight Test Bugs that were introduced the last few versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChanges in .16\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Also Fixed Auto Recycle working in Test Flight Mode. You can no longer recycle vessels while in test flight mode.. The New System.. Or the old system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

New Window Introduced. Starting to introduce a new window called the Finance Window. Right now it holds your bank loans when you go in the red. And a new.. But old Option called Passive Mission. Passive missions have been around for some time now.. But not many mission designers use the option.. A passive mission will pay you per day for (Place amount of Time) until that time runs out. The finance window is now the major holder of this information. Check the Civilian Space Program mission pack to see how to do passive missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

So ya for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso Im stating work on bringing back hard mode. But since I like to be different going to call it hardcore mode.. The old system use a multiplier of 1.5 on parts to make them more expensive.. We don\u0027t want to do this anymore. So the hardcore mode is going to work similar to what happens when you go into debt. But instead of 25% reduction to Payouts. Hardcore Mode will be 40% reduction.. Hence... Hardcore...
