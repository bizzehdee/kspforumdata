You just need to get close enough to the seat to right-click and board... though if you can\u0027t get close enough without climbing onto the platform, try adding a ladder?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigDog","CreatedById":72704,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T20:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks that more or less answered my question. I thought the Kerbal had to be standing on the seat to board. Actually at first I thought if I got him on the seat he would automatically board. So there I am with Bill lying on the seat like a limp jelly fish until I searched and found the right click board command. I think this rover is small enough they should be able to board standing next to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T22:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELadders are your friend for bigger rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skillfulljoe1012","CreatedById":148766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T16:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigDog\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BigDog\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe answer is probably something simple, but how do I get my Kerbal on to a rover?
