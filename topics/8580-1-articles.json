About two months ago, I started sorting all my Lego into bags to allow me to find certain parts better. Needless to say, that project never got finished. I\\\u0027ve just now started getting back into, and quite frankly, it\\\u0027s boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I have decided to create this \u0027competition\u0027 to see who can help me produce the best brick sorter. I\\\u0027d like to base it off the one shown in this video: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/6lZ9rSZwDzE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I do not have access to a cheap webcam.

The person who built the robot in the video is using a parts database he set up for this specific project. From what I can tell, it\\\u0027s able to tell what kind of brick is in the sorting tray by its size and shape. He\\\u0027s also got a scale set up underneath the sorting area to weigh the brick, and LEDs to \u0027flatten\u0027 the background for better images.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we can bypass the issue of a webcam by setting up a point-and-shoot digital camera to take the pictures with. We can then run a wired connection from that camera to the computer, where the actual image processing is done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketscienist","CreatedById":12576,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-05T11:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt works. wow.
