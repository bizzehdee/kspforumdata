That\u0027s true for airline pilots too, the ground is an optical illusion and you simply can\u0027t trust your eyes. Occasionally when landing you may use some visual cues such as lights or your shadow but overall watch the navball, not the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, when landing on a surface, especially on an atmosphere-less body, find the hatch on your command pod, it will be at the back (S key) on everything except the Mk1-2 which is still mostly at the back but slightly off to the side. You can do this by either turning the camera or the ship. This assumes your point of control is from that command pod of course. With probes, you don\u0027t have the same fortune, most of them don\u0027t have a indicator of where the back is on the model. I usually use this trick so I can use my reaction wheel after touchdown to ensure all the legs are firmly on the ground. If the craft were backward from the keys I might tip it over instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use a 3-leg lander you can design your lander in the VAB to give you a visual cue to the orientation of the craft, even with a probe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T16:22:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 04:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T21:08:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main screen is for making pretty pictures.
