The game wasn\u0027t giving me any errors telling me the ship was invalid, like too big for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or anything, the launch button was green and made a sound when clicked, it just... didn\u0027t do anything.\u00A0 I removed the wings from that craft and added them back on, and it magically worked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen today I ran into the same issue, but on a tiny craft that didn\u0027t even have wings. It was literally just a test craft, a pod, decoupler, and solid booster.\u00A0 It occurred with every craft I tried to launch so I figured the whole save must be broken. So I exited to main menu and tried to create a new campaign. I was able to set the name flag, etc, but then the begin campaign button did the same thing. It would make the click sound but nothing happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI began to suspect something like the save getting too big so I located it in AppData\\LocalLow\\Intercept Games\\Kerbal Space Program 2\\Saves\\SinglePlayer\\ and moved it into a backup and deleted it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis did seem to resolve the issue. I was able to create a new campaign and launch crafts with no problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt kind of feels like I ran out of hard drive space, except that the save file was only 10mb, and I have 200\u002BGB storage available on that drive.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
