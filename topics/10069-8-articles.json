And if possible, Minmus, too?\n\nSadly, the map is simply a cleaned-up version of the \u0027kerbinsites.jpg\u0027 togfox posted on the previous page. It was easy to do because everything at sea-level on Kerbin is... well... sea and there is a very distinct difference between land and sea. \n\nA Minmus map in the same style would be the next easiest one to make, but there is such a little difference between the frozen lakes and the surrounding land that I can\\\u0027t accurately judge what is land and what isn\\\u0027t.\n\nThe Mun\\\u0027s craters are next, and that\\\u0027s the hardest because, being craters, they slope upwards and I can\\\u0027t call a definite edge.\n\nI\\\u0027m going to look out for other resources to make those maps, but I can\\\u0027t do it tonight.

Islands are easy - they have natural borders. Mountain rangers are distinct - they start somewhere and stop somewhere. Craters can be picked out from a map and spotted from orbit.\n\nI\\\u0027m worried that the naming of continents will become an arbitrary exercise with no clear guidance on where the borders are. Can I suggest you start another thread in this fan forum (so you have poll control), tag it with [invention] and see what the community thinks. If you can get community acceptance of your idea\\\u0027s/methods then the KGSS will recognise any outcome that was determined fairly.\n\nI suggest another thread because there are a lot of continents (presumably) and there is enough creative idea\\\u0027s to support a whole thread."},{"CreatedByName":"HOC","CreatedById":4374,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T23:53:39Z","Content":"Ah, great idea.
