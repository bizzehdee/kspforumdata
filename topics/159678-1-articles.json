One not of complaint, inquiry or demand, but rather of praise and appreciation. I may not be a game developer, but I can rationalize the struggle, the hopes and sleepless amount of effort that goes into games, especially ones like Kerbal Space Program. I just want to share my adventure that came with Kerbal Space Program. I know of the strain the developers are under and I\u0027m hoping this honest heart felt story will help let the developers know that there are members of this community who don\u0027t like what Squad is doing for us, but are happy, appreciative but are truly made better as people in this world because of their silly game of green men conquering their solar system in death traps we call \u0022rockets\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4 years ago, I was a freshman in a brand new high school (2013). Life was changing, expectations rising and I struggled to find a place to fit into. My interests were at the time, video games, temporal physics and space. In Feburary of the following year, I was stuck in study hall thinking about how interesting it would be to have a game where you could snap rocket fuel tanks together and be able to test them out. Then I discovered a game called \u0022\u003Cem\u003EKerbal Space Program\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 through YouTube, it had been what I had wanted and exactly how I imagined it, and somehow even better than my imagination could show.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game not only was a whole solar system of wonder and excitement to explore, but also mentally challenged and created the desire to not only learn about the physics required for the tasks I was undertaking but also looking back to space history. I knew of the space program (having lived only a couple hours drive from it my entire life). I had watched several space shuttle missions launch into orbit and occasionally heard them return from orbit (horrifying to those who didn\u0027t live in Florida) through their iconic sonic booms (I actually miss those), however it wasn\u0027t until I started playing Kerbal Space Program that I had a proper appreciation for the space program. I didn\u0027t have a true scope of challenge they had to manage when it came to space travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNearly a year after buying the game, I decided to join this forum around the game to ask for technical support for a mod. Once I did that, I couldn\u0027t help but notice the other amenities that the forum offered, for showing off crafts, general discussions, and sharing of stories and experiences around Kerbal Space Program. So I decided to share a few of my builds with another user who was sharing his crafts which were replicas of real life rockets. Soon after he told me to branch out and post my own thread, and that thread helped root me into this amazing community. From there I have run several groups around mission control simulation and large collaborative projects and even run my own fan fiction series.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCome the beginning of 2016. It was another year. Finishing school, yet continuing the evolution train that is Kerbal Space Program. The game had just past release status by this point and I was hyped seeing all the new content and more importantly, seeing the community return and gain more life from the update. Despite the good news, life outside of the forum and outside of Kerbal Space Program was rough. I was reeling after a rather hard relationship and was also left struggling as to what to do with myself career wise seeing as I struggled with mathematics and all engineering based jobs in space required strong math skills, so I was left defeated. However I continued on, searching for something to do with myself and the answer seemed to be that I would go into flight school to become an airline pilot as that was both a mixture of my interests but was also an occupation that would work to my strengths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil December of 2016 when I\u0027m filtering through a friend\u0027s Steam friend\u0027s list and I happen to see this person I know from the forums, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/136353-tristonwilson12/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022136353\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/136353-tristonwilson12/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Tristonwilson12\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0amongst others I found. Shortly after he accepted my friend request, he greeted me and I said hello back. From there I learned that he was working on his company website, and being a person who takes interest in those I talk to, I asked what company that was and that\u0027s when he told me that he was running his own aerospace company and it had just gotten started. So I asked for details and he sent me the website and some information about it and a day later, I sent him my resume and it wasn\u0027t shortly after that he accepted me as \u003Cem\u003EFlight Director\u003C/em\u003E for his company. A role which the training for is long and thorough and is the peak of most people\u0027s careers and I had it at 19.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 4 years, I went from clueless, aimless and without any refined hobbies or interests, to having a job that I hope to continue to be a part of for many, many years to come and will enjoy working on and am proud to wake up to every morning. That job, was made possible because a bunch of people in Mexico decided to work together and make a game about little green men exploring their creative solar system. This game gave me a purpose, a community to call my own, a hope, a focus, a desire to learn, a desire to improve, a desire succeed and so much more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a someone once said, \u0022it can be hard doing your trade, especially when you don\u0027t see results of your work\u0022.

I think 2 years ago now. I specifically remember the day, because it was one of the worst in my life. I woke up, and realized; It was still dark out. Why was I up before the sun? Did I lose track of the days and it was time for\u00A0school? Then my mom comes upstairs and delivers the worst news I could think of. My grandpa had just died. I was shocked. Everything went sort of dull. I don\u0027t remember much, but the next thing I remember I was on the couch, crying my eyes out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember grabbing the computer for some comfort, about to get onto YouTube. Then, when the page finally loads up, I see a video about this cool new game that was taking over the YouTube pages-\u00A0KSP or something like that- by some dude I\u0027d never heard of before. But hey; it had like 1 million views in a day; had to be good, right? So I load up, and then I get absolutely deafened by a high-five and an Irish accent. Yeah, I stumbled into the jacksepticeye realm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know whether it was the infectious joy of Jacks voice or the absolute stupidity of the game, but on that day, in the midst of all the sadness, KSP and Jack made me smile. And so on that day, 2 memories stuck with me: Jack laughing at the insane explosions, and KSP creating them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now we go to about 6 months later. I had gotten a steam account and was ready to purchase my first game. Prison Architect? Kerbal Space Program? Choices choices. Just as I was about to make my decision, though, my mind flashed back to that day. Knowing that KSP had managed to make me smile-\u00A0even laugh a little bit- during that day,\u00A0it made me feel inspired. And so I bought the game.

There are mods that allow you to blow things up. There are mods that let you play multi-player games, and there are ways, through emailing a persistent file between several players where you can make KSP a turn-based multiplayer game. If you do not like the mods that are out there, then learn how to create your own mods.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSquad created a fairly simple platform that allows for us to alter game play through mods.
