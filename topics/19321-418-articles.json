When the change happens, that then makes that ships engine gimbal react badly to far but the \u0022change\u0022 only seems to occur upon leaving and returning to the ship in any way, including returning to space center then comming back to it via the tracking station as well as quick-save/load, they both do the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Removing only the FerramAerospaceResearch folder alone does not stop the \u0022changed\u0022 ship wigging out after restarting the game, returning to it and re-running the Standard test outlined earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut removing only the ModularFlightIntegrator folder and leaving the FerramAerospaceResearch folder in place DOES stop the gimbal bug happening, so the issue may have a connection to the ModularFlightIntegrator folders contained functions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres the notes I jotted down detailing each step and wave of testing and test results up to these conclusions in case theres anything that might give a clue to the cause of the problem to more knowledgable minds than my own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew save and new FAR, Test Result: bug doesn\u0027t happen 1st time again but after quickload it happens every time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame save, but new far, Test Result: bug happens 1st time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew save and same Far, Test Result: Bug does not happen 1st time but happens after quickload\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking away ModularFlightIntegrator folder, Result: stops bug, far breaks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{{{Taking away FerramAerospaceResearch folder, Interesting Result! only breaks FAR, or atleast it\u0027s Icon is not showing up. But the bug remains in testing, So it\u0027s something to do with ModularFlightIntegrator folder perhaps? }}}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{{{ Download fresh new KSP without installing FAR or Dependencies, Run game and make save, launch test ship into 150k Orbit, QuickSave and Load then exit game THEN Add far And then restart game, switch to test ship from tracking station and run experiment again.. Test result: Bug happens first time! }}}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: Far is not making the Change, the change, whatever it is, that causes the gimbal bug every time in the presence of far even occurs when FAR is not present, Perhaps quicksaving or quick loading causes the change and the change then gives gimbals their FAR allergy... Which then only flares up when FAR is present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee what happens if Quicksave is deleted, Result: Bug still happens\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if another test ship is launched after the first has been quicksaved, loaded and bugged out? does it also bug out first time? Test Result: It does not bug out First time! Its per ship rather than per save!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk now if after first test of new craft and no bug out, what if return to space center to in order to discard changes and restore to starting position WITHOUT using quick-load, and then returned to via tracking station does it bug out ala as if it had been quickloaded? Test result: Yes it still wigs out, it had been quicksaved, but not quickloaded....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: Quickload is not directly causing the change to the in flight craft that breaks it\u0027s gimbal at certain speeds in the presence of FAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if again but no quick-load OR quicksave? Test result: Gimbal works just fine from launch to test ending in one take without leaving craft and returning via quick load or tracking station , but once left to space center without saving and reloaded and test run again it wigs out under 750ms, Confirmed 2x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: Quicksave and quickload are not alone in causing the change. Leaving the craft and reloading at all causes the change... Do not know if it is the leaving or the returning that causes the change that then causes gimbal\u0027s issue with far. But cannot test if leaving is the sole cause because would have to load back in to test theory so both conditions would be met on any test. Perhaps examining The ship in save file previous to leaving, then comparing again after leaving ship in game and looking for changes... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, the apparent frequency at which we\u0027d find ourselves dumpster-diving was a big part of why.
