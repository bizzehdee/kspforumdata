It\u0027s got 18 of the largest engines at the same height so with the joint reinforcement it\u0027s completely sturdy. It can work without any SAS but it\u0027s a bit unwieldy; it has 100 RCS but only 6 ports on the payload decoupler (so right in the middle of the whole ship, pretty much the worst place). But you can always throttle up the engine on low to change heading, and the RCS will stop you from drifting off that heading. I also got 640t to orbit with it just barely, so that breaks 5t per part (if I removed the \u0027unnecessary\u0027 parts) and 16% payload fraction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried the KR-2L but it doesn\u0027t work well for my ship.
