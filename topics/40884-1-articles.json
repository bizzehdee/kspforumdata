Second is having enough prograde velocity relative to Mun\u0027s orbit that you stay out front as Mun catches up from behind. You have to stay out in front long enough to cross Mun\u0027s orbit, after which Mun\u0027s gravity whips you around the far side. If you don\u0027t have enough prograde velocity, then Mun will suck you into a prograde orbit (cislunar) behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to a conventional Munar approach, the difference in encounter phasing is free (in theory). That\u0027s because you can get it simply by moving your maneuver node forward along your orbit back at Kerbin (that is, burning after instead of at Munrise). However, because the stock game doesn\u0027t give you any angular readouts, doing this consistently is quite difficult. Thus, you usually need to add some radial velocity to your ejection burn. Thus, in practice, the phasing usually costs you a bit extre delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real source of extra delta-V for such an orbit is the need for the higher velocity at the encounter. First off, you have to burn enough prograde to cross Mun\u0027s orbit, whereas with a conventional approach you don\u0027t quite need to get out to the orbit, relying on Mun\u0027s gravity after SOI change to take you the rest of the way. Secondly, you have to arrive with a fair amount of prograde velocity relative to Mun\u0027s orbit so you can stay out in front long enough. This usually means you have to add a noticeable amount of inward radial velocity, which you don\u0027t need at all with a conventional approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the retrograde circumlunar free return requires more delta-V to get captured out of. This is because you\u0027re moving faster than normal at encounter, and have a pretty low Munar periapsis to point you right back into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, which pulls you in closer and thus increases your speed at Mun. If you didn\u0027t do an Apollo 13 so no longer need the free return, you\u0027ve got a lot of braking to do now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hour Hero Yes","CreatedById":76830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T16:16:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if you use Mechjeb or have ever played with the Conics setting in the config file, but different settings change the way your projected orbit looks after changing SOI\u0027s.

So here\u0027s a better explanation, and also an easier way to set it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, an example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pQZUjYR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pQZUjYR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, this burn requires 899.1 m/s. For this, you get a 116km circumlunar retrograde periapsis followed by a 50km Kerbin periapsis, which will eventually bring you to the surface although you have to wait several long orbits nearly back out to Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELowering the Kerbin periapsis into the atmosphere like this has 2 effects. First, it increases the amount of delta-V required. Second, it increases the Munar periapsis, so if you like to land low and shallow (which I recommend in 0.21 so you can see all the small craters and no land in them), then you have to do a fairly large burn not only to capture but then to come down. If you want a lower Munar periapsis, you might not get back into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere for free, but it won\u0027t be much of a de-orbit burn. Perhaps if you have severe OCD and tweak the node enough, you might find a sweet spot where you get a close Munar periapsis and a re-entering Kerbin periapsis, but trying to do this exceeded my patience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, 899.1m/s is not too much more than the standard 860m/s shown on the Wiki delta-V map as needed for Munar intercept.

It\u0027s a lot easier to use the outward radial gizmo. Place the node a bit AFTER Munrise and pull the prograde out until you can reach Mun\u0027s orbit. Then slide the node around Kerbin until you get an encounter. At this point, start pulling the outward radial gizmo.

(Given the simplicity of the SPS engine, with only four moving parts--two ball valves and two gimbal actuators--and the ability to make the burn successfully even with the gimbal actuators failed, it was felt that if it lit the first time, it would light for both Lunar Orbit Insertion burns and Trans-Earth Injection.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically, the Apollo 13 mission wasn\u0027t actually a free-return trajectory; the tank explosion occurred AFTER the course-correction, and thus required some fancy footwork by the crew and Mission Control to get back onto a return trajectory, including the use of the LM\u0027s main engine in two separate burns, one at \u0022pericynthion\u0022 (lunar periapsis) to basically do the TEI burn without ever actually entering lunar orbit, and one at PC\u002B2 hours to further accelerate the return trajectory above normal and thus help with the issue of finding enough consumables to get back to Earth alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard Apollo mission did the course-correction burn about a day out from the Moon, to drop down to the planned periapsis, then did LOI1 at periapsis to drop into a nominal 60 x 160 nautical mile orbit, then did LOI2 the next time around to circularize the orbit at 60 miles. They then stayed for a day before undocking the LM and doing the landing; after the LM returned, the CSM would remain in orbit for another day or so before making the Trans-Earth Injection burn to return home.

The most extreme case you exit the Mun with exactly zero orbital velocity relative to Kerbin and fall straight down on a degenerate (collapsed) orbit. What you\u0027re basically doing on free return is doing a no-assist gravity assist. You\u0027ll find that some Mun SOI interactions are gravity assist increasing the size of your orbit and others are gravity brakes decreasing them. A free return is finding a path through the Mun\u0027s SOI such that you are neither assisted nor braked and return to the orbital energy you had on interaction. In reality you want the slightest braking to take your original Pe down to something suitable for aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disagree with using radial component on the maneuver node as with different timing there is an entirely prograde solution for the same impulse vector and will be more efficient. When I do it (usually to dispose of the TMI stage) I set up a Hohmann to intersect Mun CoM and then increase prograde until I arrive ahead of the Mun which sets up a gravity brake. I shuffle the node location and reduce prograde dV until I get the minimum deltaV that produces the desired resultant orbit. You\u0027ll find if you \u0022cheapskate\u0022 on deltaV you will not be able to both clear the Munar surface and brake enough to lower your resultant Pe. In this case more dV is called for to lower your resultant dV somewhat unintuitively.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T13:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETime out for a second...these free return trajectories put you back at Kerbin at the same Kerbin-relative altitude as when you left?

You start from say a 100km orbit, but when you get back you want a periapsis far enough down in the atmosphere to make you land without ever having to burn again after you eject. That\u0027s a truly \u0022free\u0022 return (provided, of course, you don\u0027t stop at Mun, just coast through 1 retrograde orbit and escape it again). If you have to do a deorbit burn back at Kerbin, then it\u0027s not a \u0022free\u0022 return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just takes some OCD fiddling with the node, both its position along your Kerbin orbit and how much you\u0027re burning in the various directions, to set this up. There are several different methods to set it up. I outlined a simple but somewhat inefficient method above, Frederf explains a different method that\u0027s more efficient but requires a bit more on the OCD side I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much point in going to all this trouble except for the specific purpose of recreating an Apollo mission as accurately as possible. This is because, unless your rocket explodes right at the end of the ejection burn and all you have left is a capsule heading away from Kerbin, a free return trajectory does you no good. I mean, you\u0027re doubtless going to Mun specifically to land there, not just do a fly-by, and landing on Mun takes you off the free return trajectory. Because the scenario where a free return trajectory actually does you some good is quite unlikely, you end up doing all this OCD fiddling for nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the basic concept can be useful in other ways, although they\u0027re not \u0022free\u0022. For example, suppose you\u0027ve built a big interplanetary ship in orbit out of multiple parts and you plan on aerobraking it where you\u0027re going, but you want to make sure it can stand the stress before your launch window. So set up an orbit to whip you out around Mun and back, then tweak your Kerbin periapsis on the way back to aerobrake at different altitudes to see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T16:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne benefit of free return maneuvers is that you can ditch any empty stages. While you perform your capture burn around the Mun, they\u0027ll keep on going and deorbit around Kerbin rather than causing debris.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
