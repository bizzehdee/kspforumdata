Catastrophic failures on two tests (from other reasons - overpower \u0026amp; oversteering) had me testing the chutes again unexpectedly. Twice in a row, I got the same resulting problem ... only this time it was just one of the chutes which failed to deploy. I was even mindful this time to mount the chutes higher up on the Mk1 pod too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI exited out and prepared my screenshot and files for a bug report, but then remembered the suggestion of opening up the Service Bay and trying to deploy the chute then. So, I reentered the game to give it a go. Lo and behold, after three launch tests, all the chutes deployed without a problem. Exiting the game and then reentering it somehow magically solved the issue(?). I\u0027m still going to post it as a potential bug report.
