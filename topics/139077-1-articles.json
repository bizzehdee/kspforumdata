My big question is, what should my goal after my manned Mun landing be? Should I look towards building a space station around Kerbin, which I\u0027ve never done before? Or maybe build a Minmus/Mun base? Or start trying to send a probe to Duna and Ike?

Preference, preference, preference. It\u0027ll be up to you to de ide what sounds the most enjoyable. You can even choose to do all three of those things essentia at the same time if you want, although it sounds like you don\u0027t dedicate a whole lot of time to KSP, so maybe start with one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally what I do after my first Mun or Minmus landing is more Minmus and Mun landings.

It\u0027s a heavy craft but you can use it to land on both Ike and Duna and still take a research lab with you. You need to know how to dock to be successful with such a design though.
