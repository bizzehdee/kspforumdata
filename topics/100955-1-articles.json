Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it.**[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nThis we recognize as essentially Galileo\u0027s concept of inertia, and this is often termed simply the \u0022Law of Inertia\u0022.\n\n[h=3]Newton\u0027s Second Law of Motion:[/h][TABLE=width: 450]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]**II. The relationship between an object\u0027s mass** ***m*****, its acceleration** **a**, and the applied force ***F*** is ***F*** *= m****a***. Acceleration and force are vectors (as indicated by their symbols being displayed in slant bold font); in this law the direction of the force vector is the same as the direction of the acceleration vector.[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nThis is the most powerful of Newton\u0027s three Laws, because it allows quantitative calculations of dynamics: how do velocities change when forces are applied. Notice the fundamental difference between Newton\u0027s 2nd Law and the dynamics of Aristotle: according to Newton, a force causes only a *change in velocity* (an acceleration); it does not maintain the velocity as Aristotle held.\n\nThis is sometimes summarized by saying that under Newton, *F = ma*, but under Aristotle *F = mv*, where *v* is the velocity. Thus, according to Aristotle there is only a velocity if there is a force, but according to Newton an object with a certain velocity maintains that velocity *unless* a force acts on it to cause an acceleration (that is, a change in the velocity). As we have noted earlier in conjunction with the discussion of Galileo, Aristotle\u0027s view seems to be more in accord with common sense, but that is because of a failure to appreciate the role played by frictional forces. Once account is taken of *all* forces acting in a given situation it is the dynamics of Galileo and Newton, not of Aristotle, that are found to be in accord with the observations.\n\n[h=3]Newton\u0027s Third Law of Motion:[/h][TABLE=width: 450]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]**III.
