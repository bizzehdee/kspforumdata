So here is the story, I run KSP from steam, and have done so since .21 came out. The game became super unstable at 1.1.0 and has crashed an entirely unacceptable amount of times, something around 15-20 times since then. The short of it is, I just removed KSP completely from my machine save for 2 save files which I have NOT YET re-integrated or even re-integrated my mods yet, so, I am for the moment unmodded.

Well, I want to run my resolution back up to that as I got used to it. BUT, I can select 1920 X 1080, I hit apply then accept and go back to check, and its stuck at 1680 X 1050.
