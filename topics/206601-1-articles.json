It\u0027s going to be pretty complicated, though, because it depends on the exact shape of the vehicle and the properties of air change pretty drastically over the wide range of speeds and air temperatures the rocket goes through.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-26T07:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStart the gravity turn as soon as possible.
