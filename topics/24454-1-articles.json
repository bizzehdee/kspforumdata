It makes those successful flights all the sweeter though! Congrats on the successful probe launches, especially the one around the Mun! That\u0027s good going for day 1. Not sure about joystick support - I think the answer is yes but I don\u0027t have a stick myself so I havn\u0027t tried it out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot going to spoiler this thread but I have a design for a very compact (unmanned) Mun lander if you want to try it. It doesn\u0027t do much when you get there but it flies very well and makes a nice practice lander. Also it\u0027s very light - if you can get a probe into orbit around the Mun you can definitely get this to the Mun too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbActual","CreatedById":61747,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T21:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty awesome.
