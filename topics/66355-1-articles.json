I\u0027ve been making solar-powered ion shuttles for several months now and in order to land an asteroid... it would be nearly impossible. It\u0027s not the thrust of the engine or amount needed that\u0027s the obstacle, it\u0027s the electric charge needed that is. To make a plane that can take off and achieve very high altitude Kerbin flight, I\u0027ve had to plaster the entire wing span with solar panels for the 9 thrusters installed in order to keep them at maximum thrust.
