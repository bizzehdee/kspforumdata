As an intermediate in organic synthesis, it is used widely in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, explosives, fibers, and coatings.\u0022 there is the one big problem which s that if it\u0027s used as a solvent, storing it will be harder, and also if it\u0027s \u0022slightly viscous\u0022 the flow rates would drop preventing large amount of it to be burned quickly, so maybe as an upper stage but a first stage engine would require too much of it to store and keep flowing. On the other hand, it requires less oxidizer (can be used as a monop and is already used for rocket/engine applications so storing and pumping must already be figured out. There was a combustion velocity measured at .5 m/x vs lox/lh2 at 2,435 m/s, but I don\u0027t think they are measuring the same thing, and carbon monoxide is produced through nitromethane\u0027s combustion, which is a poison that can lead to harmful testing at full rocket capacity. Also it\u0027s a high explosive, meaning that it\u0027s dangerous to transport.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T16:01:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor nitromethane or metallic hydrogen\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T16:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMetallic hydrogen hasn\u0027t been made yet, and we don\u0027t know if it exhibits metastability that may make it usable as a rocket fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it turns out to exist and be usable as a rocket fuel, it\u0027s energy density and pure hydrogen exhaust give it an isp high enough to completely change spaceflight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENitromethane is just another of thousands of chemicals that could be used as rocket fuel but dont have any advantages over existing fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T18:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENitromethane was a reasonable suggestion, if not that useful in practice compared to other fuels.
