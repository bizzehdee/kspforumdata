That way you\u0027ll stay on the equator. Then circularize the orbit by burning at apoapsis or periapsis (to lower or raise the other side of the orbit). It\u0027s not too hard to get an orbit that\u0027s circular to within \u002B/- 1000m or less, with careful burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all available elsewhere, but... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo raise your periapsis, burn prograde (with the direction of travel, yellow circle on the navball) at apoapsis.
