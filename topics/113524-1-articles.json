You can specify a time-to-live for the message as one of the PostScreenMessage\u0027s param. If it is small enough (say 0.01s) then you can flood your memory and cause a crash.\n\nAs a different way I can suggest GUI.Label method. Just an alternative, not known by me to be quicker, nor safer, nor simpler as you have to use it in a method attached to a PostDrawingQueue, but you can specify a text color."},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T14:40:28Z","Content":"ScreenMessageStyle.UPPER\\_LEFT, or something like that will put the message in that corner, like stock messages.\n\nThe problem with using a GUI.Label is that it won\u0027t respect other screen messages. The stock function adds each message on a new line. A GUI label will just draw it on top of any other messages. There might be some way of figuring out if other messages are being displayed, how many there are, and how far down you have to move your own label, but that seems like too much trouble. Though I suppose you could just draw your message somewhere else on the screen so that it won\u0027t overlap."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T03:27:52Z","Content":"You can color screenmessages too."}]}
