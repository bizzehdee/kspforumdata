Basically, what I want at the least is an SSTO capable of putting a 16 kerbal cabin in LKO along which includes a docking port so I can dock it with a nuclear tug and take it from there. Yes, it\u0027s likely to be easier with vertically launched rockets, but I\u0027d like to be able to do it with HOTOL SSTOs. At best, I\u0027d like to add a long MK3 cargo bay with cargo (say, a jumbo tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after adding the stuff, I end with something in the 80-100 tons range, so I\u0027m trying to go with 8 rapiers.

I\u0027ve tried placing the rapiers at the back of the fuselage using the MRS 3.5 to 7 1.15 m adapter, I\u0027ve tried placing them radially around the center tanks, I\u0027ve tried in clusters of four behind wing mounted 2.5 m tanks, I\u0027ve tried wing mounted stuck to Mk1 fuel tanks either hanging from the wings or along the wings. I\u0027ve tried the largish wet wings, I\u0027ve tried the shuttle like wet wings, I\u0027ve tried Mk2 wings.
