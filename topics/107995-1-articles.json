Basically, what I want at the least is an SSTO capable of putting a 16 kerbal cabin in LKO along which includes a docking port so I can dock it with a nuclear tug and take it from there. Yes, it\u0027s likely to be easier with vertically launched rockets, but I\u0027d like to be able to do it with HOTOL SSTOs. At best, I\u0027d like to add a long MK3 cargo bay with cargo (say, a jumbo tank).\n\nSo, after adding the stuff, I end with something in the 80-100 tons range, so I\u0027m trying to go with 8 rapiers. I may need a bit more, though. The problems are:\n\nThe aircraft turns over at take off: just a few presses of the S key and the aircraft flips over\n\nI make a design able to take off, and which begins to pierce the sound barrier at around 8-10 km altitude. But I loose horizontal control. Is asymmetrical flameout/thrust still a thing?\n\nI make a design able to take off, but I loose control at about 10,000 meters, even before reaching the speed of sound.\n\nI make sure the CoL is behind the CoM and the DCoM - I also usually stick the CoM and DCoM as close as possible. I\u0027ve tried placing the rapiers at the back of the fuselage using the MRS 3.5 to 7 1.15 m adapter, I\u0027ve tried placing them radially around the center tanks, I\u0027ve tried in clusters of four behind wing mounted 2.5 m tanks, I\u0027ve tried wing mounted stuck to Mk1 fuel tanks either hanging from the wings or along the wings. I\u0027ve tried the largish wet wings, I\u0027ve tried the shuttle like wet wings, I\u0027ve tried Mk2 wings. I\u0027ve tried canards, I\u0027ve tried no canards.\n\nHere are some pics of different designs I\u0027ve tried\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I don\u0027t know the numbers exactly (I prefer making my space planes MKII).\n\nNow, you\u0027ve said you \u0022lose control\u0022 at around 10k meters. That can mean a LOT of things and your images really don\u0027t help to show exactly what is happening (you go from 10k to 200m in the span of one image jump). What do you mean you lose control, exactly? Are you starting to flip? Unable to pull the nose up? Something else completely?\n\nOne thing I\u0027ve heard is you should have 1 rapier per 13 or 14 tons of spacecraft minimum. It doesn\u0027t LOOK like that is your problem, however you may want to give that a check anyway. RAPIERS only really start to kick in their thrust after you break a speed threshold so if you have trouble getting yourself to break Mach 1 then you never have a chance to see their full power."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T06:44:14Z","Content":"In thrust we trust\n\n![11205152_10103548408288173_5405657931943816741_n.jpg?oh=671e5c9de0015e93937d253eb139b57c\u0026oe=55E14F5D\u0026__gda__=1440838886_34aea1d9d7230c416499035265a71b60](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11205152_10103548408288173_5405657931943816741_n.jpg?oh=671e5c9de0015e93937d253eb139b57c\u0026oe=55E14F5D\u0026__gda__=1440838886_34aea1d9d7230c416499035265a71b60)\n\nThat was in 1.0, and had 12 rapiers...
