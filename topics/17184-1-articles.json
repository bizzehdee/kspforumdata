I wanted to build something that would give me a lot of freedom to reach other Spheres of Influence. I saw that patch .17 was going to include other planets and I wanted something I think can give me the freedom to reach some of those (maybe without a return), but can be used for my fuel burning noob attempts at landing on the Mun and Minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1: Large rockets and smaller rockets fire to push the heavy weight up all the way out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 2: The large tank rockets should have about half a tank of fuel left, I use this to circularize my orbit between 100k and 140k. I guess it is a little wasteful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 3: You have 4 tanks and a much lighter weight that I planned for use to do the transfer to your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 4: The lander stage. I haven\u0027t successfully landed it yet, but I\u0027m 100% sure you can at least land on the Mun with half a tank left. I think the landing stage may need to be modified with extra tanks for a longer trip\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH]31435[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a Mechjeb autopilot, for those who like that kind of thing. I\u0027ve used it once to examine how I\u0027m messing up landings and it got me to the moon with a TON of fuel. This makes me think this design could be used for interplanetary travel, though likely one way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH]31434[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T10:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow did you manage to connect the four large fuel stacks to the center stack with 2 radial decouplers each?

I reversed them and now my third stage is completely topped off when separation happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I got that fixed I do indeed have much more fuel once I get to orbit. In fact I almost have an entire tank of the huge fuel tanks left to boost into an orbit, and maybe into a transfer. This extends the range of my craft immensely. My only problem now is to counteract a spin I\u0027m getting until I hit my third stage. This implies, to me, that my fuel lines aren\u0027t symmetrical and are adding spin to my in atmosphere flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH]31467[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moustachauve","CreatedById":41337,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-19T04:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you try to add winglet?
