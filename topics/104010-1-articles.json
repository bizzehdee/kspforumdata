It actually amazes me that events such as Roswell get so much attention when it seems so much easier to debunk as a genuine alien craft incident. Still intriguing as a cover-up story, but not as an \u0022X-File.\u0022 In all the U.F.O. paraphernalia I read in my teens, I never came across this story - only stumbling upon it by accident on the web one day last year.\n\n![battle%20of%20la%20nonretouched.jpg](http://whanethewhip.wdfiles.com/local--files/article%3Abattle-of-l-a/battle%20of%20la%20nonretouched.jpg)\n\nGranted, this happened in 1942 just after America entered WWII, so it\u0027s likely that this would be from an enemy nation and not from space. But then consider the fact that over 1000 shells were fired at the darned thing, for over 30 minutes, and it just sat there and grinned back at the pitiful weaponry. The entire city saw this happening. The cannons destroyed no target, though managed to accidentally kill a few people on the ground, along with causing some considerable property damage.\n\nOne of the explanations is laughable - always the classic go-to explanation for any U.F.O. \u0022Weather Balloon.\u0022 Goodness, that\u0027s one tough weather balloon. Alien or not, it survived a barrage that would have taken out a bomber in under than a minute. One of the most basic \u0022UFO mistakes,\u0022 being that it could be a star, satellite (even though none existed yet), or other object much higher than it seemed, can\u0027t apply here. With so many search lights converging on it, its true altitude would have been very easy to determine.\n\nAny thoughts on what else it could be?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T00:49:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 12:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vger**"},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T00:46:25Z","Content":"Maybe a time travelling human starship from 3000?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T00:49:00Z","Content":"Never heard the story, but it could bee some kind of classified military training exercise.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe a time travelling human starship from 3000?\n\nHaha perfect ref!"},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T00:59:34Z","Content":"Well it\u0027s possible... i saw activity the moment i promised myself I would travel back in time to if it existed."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T01:06:36Z","Content":"It looks like a small cloud, to be honest.

Case closed.\n\nIn reality I can\u0027t see anything from that picture. But Americans in WWII were known to be quick on the trigger. Latter in the day after Pearl Harbor, American defenses shot at American Navy planes. In the battle over Europe, US fighter pilots escorting US bombers learned to stay away, once things started heating up American Bombers were notorious for shooting at their own fighter cover. During D-Day, the Allies used the P-38 lightning almost exclusively over the beach landings because the shape was so distinctive. They made sure every gunner in the fleet knew what one looked like. They painted the planes with \u0022D-Day\u0022 stripes that were conspicuous. They still lost planes to friendly fire.\n\nWhen war broke out people reported German periscopes all over the place in areas a uboat just wont go. By the time the first 5 German Uboats arrived in operation Drum Beat, US intelligence was swamped with hundreds of false reports every day. (They also had reliable reports but chose to ignore those. Long story.)\n\nIn this environment, it is not hard to imagine that something as simple as a cloud (mentioned above) or a flock of birds would set the guns a blazen.\n\nDisclaimer, I am not bashing Americans here, ALL the combatants during WWII were known for some not so flattering stuff. The British for example liked to bomb their own submarines. At least some of those P-38\u0027s during D-Day were probably not shot down by American Friendly fire but someone else\u0027s friendly fire. My point is however that Americans where known to be trigger happy, more so than others."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T02:00:09Z","Content":"To add to the above, the \u0027battle\u0027 took place when invasion paranoia on the west coast was in full swing, a day after a Japanese submarine had shelled a Californian oil installation.
