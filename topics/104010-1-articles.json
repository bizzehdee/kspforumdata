Latter in the day after Pearl Harbor, American defenses shot at American Navy planes. In the battle over Europe, US fighter pilots escorting US bombers learned to stay away, once things started heating up American Bombers were notorious for shooting at their own fighter cover. During D-Day, the Allies used the P-38 lightning almost exclusively over the beach landings because the shape was so distinctive. They made sure every gunner in the fleet knew what one looked like.
