periapps of about 55km and finally brought it home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 3rd had more tourists but without enough fuel to return but more than a month of life support, so had to unlock ISRU for a rescue-refueler mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSent off a fuel tanker to Mun orbit for a fourth Mun lander without enough fuel(sending out several versions of a new ship in rapid succession tuned out to be unwise).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot scanning and ISRU unlocked(mostly from a mission to Minmus that visited most of the biomes using an \u0027experimental\u0027 nerva)\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot a mini-fueler on the Mun to klaw the stranded tourists and used the new ISRU parts(along with a couple normal sized drills, just in case) and managed to give them enough fuel to get home.(refueler drone is now fully fueled and sitting on the Mun)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSent off probes to Mun, Minmus, and finally Kerbin to scan for ore(and those other USI resources)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunched a couple training/tourist ships with ISRU to run around the Kerbin system for fun and profit.(~7 Kerbal years of life-support each)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(mk3 passenger, Mk3 cockpit, science lab each for a total capacity of 22 \u002B front mounted klaw on the cockpit)\u003Cbr\u003E\nDid a lot of hopping around on the Mun to visit unfamiliar biomes, Tourists seemed to enjoy it.\u00A0 Then stopped on Minmus and realized I had already visited almost all the biomes, so I stopped by the poles and the highlands and headed out to Kerbol.(with a number of rescued kerbals on board and a klawed pod for return)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunched a couple \u0027tourist return\u0027 pods(Mk3 cockpit, Mk3 passenger, Klaw \u002B LFO engine) to return 25 tourists and several rescuees, as well as bringing up a few parts for KIS(the first ship did not have landing lights, Extra lights were later delivered to the Minmus automated base) and some extra snacks to partially replenish what was used.\u00A0 Loaded as much of the collected science as I could in the cockpit and passenger module, letting me unlock most of the populated nodes of the Community tech tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeployed then later expanded a Kerbin fuel base for refueling ships in Kerbin orbit (using UKS Logistics.\u00A0 Currently has ~ 30 drills, 10K ore capacity and ~ 400K LFO capacity, 3 full sized ISRU and a 3 star engineer so that the drills can both supply the ISRU and fill the ore tank at the same time.\u00A0 That huge 300K FLO tank was quite a challenge to get connected, so I finally gave up, got it close, then used the klaw on the original fuel base to grab it)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSent out a Minmus fuel base, the poles turned out to have all UKS resources except uranium, so I put on some extra-large solar panels and landed it near the pole, managing to get close enough to always have sunlight(as opposed to some places on Minmus where you cannot see the sun but your panels still work)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile waiting for the tourist ships to return, I launched an expansion for the Minmus base with UKS refining and manufacturing capability, and since I had half a dozen tourists and lots of empty seats, I sent those up as well.\u00A0 Unfortunately both tourist ships return from Kerbol in retrograde orbits and could not dock, so I used the Kerbin Fuel depot to refuel the last part of the launch stage for the trip to Minmus.(there was no transfer stage as it was intended for one of the Tourist ships to push it to Minmus)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they were both retrograde and I had a rescue in LKO I sent both ships to the Mun, but a simulation showed that they could not land, so I sent them to the fuel tanker drone still in orbit from earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen on the way back, they each stopped at the tanker to refuel it with their onboard ore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first ship grabbed the orbiting rescuee and then landed on Kerbin to have plenty of orange suits available for the planned Duna mission.\u00A0 Earlier I had sent out a Scanner probe intended to scan Duna/Ike for resources and biomes.\u00A0 It refueled in orbit of Minmus using UKS Logistics on the Minmus base then set out for Duna(\u0026gt; 200 day trip)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second tourist ship headed up to Minmus to collect the tourists from the automated manufacturing portion of the future Minmus base and perform any connecting that would be needed to the Fuel station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe manufacturing drone managed a good landing near the fuel station, then through a combination of RCS, Skidding on landing legs, very brief thrusts from the Mammoth, and finally reaction wheels, managed to tap the still-attached launch-stage fuel tanks to the armed Klaw of the refueling station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen using the over-sized solar panels of the refueling station, started drilling for non-ore resources and manufacturing Machinery(and once I fill that up, rocket parts).\u00A0 Those fuel tanks roughly tripled the fuel capacity of the Minmus Fuel station, so all that extra effort was worth it(the RCS and reaction wheels weer balanced for not having the launch stage still attached, so keeping that on was a challenge while maneuvering)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the Duna ScannSat off, an Ike Refueling station was launched.\u00A0 The original plan was to use the up-scaled nerva(2.5M seems to be ~ 5.5 normal nerva) to transit to Minmus, refuel \u002B top off Ore and head off to Duna, but the launch stage still had fuel after making orbit, so I used the Kerbin fuel base to send up lots of ore and fuel so I could use the launch stage for the initial ejection burn from Kerbin.\u00A0 Once there was enough fuel to land on Minmus, headed out to Minmus to top everything off before leaving for Duna.\u00A0 As the Minmus base has no engineers, it was slow going, so I landed the Ike fuel base on Minmus to use it\u0027s onboard drills to assist in refueling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAround this time Tourist 2 got to the Minmus Automated base, linked up to transfer tourists/speed up refueling and sent out an engineer or two to unpack a number of storage bins that had been packed in the landing gear(KIS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also discovered that tourists without food do not seem to count as far as reaching destinations(how else would tourists get to Minmus without orbital or suborbital flight on Kerbin?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the engineers on Tourist 2 were beefing up production on the Minus Automated Base, the Ike refueling station finally topped off all tanks on the launch(now transit) stage, the ore tanks(for refueling the LF tanks on the way to Duna), and the Monoprop that had been unloaded to make launch lighter(launched with 100 of 3000 possible units).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsed RCS to get the Ike fuel base up to a 45 degree angle and took it to Minmus orbit for a final fuel shipment before heading off to Duna.(The launch stage which was ~0.9 twr on Kerbin without boosters was more than adequate to get off Minmus).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile waiting for the fuel ferry to arrive for the Ike base, Tourist 2 undocked form the Minmus station and headed down to an equatorial orbit to catch a rescue\u002Bpod orbiting Minmus, then went for a quick visit to Kerbol and started back towards Kerbin for more rescues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile Tourist 2 was heading towards the edge of the Kerbin SOI, the Ike fuel station started out towards Duna, scheduled to arrive a couple months after the scansat, to give it time to find a good place to put it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTonight I am hoping to collect several rescuees in Kerbin orbit, trade them out for Tourists, and finally launch my Kerbaled Duna mission(only 4 of the 8 seats will be occupied to cut down on life-support needs as well as elbow-room for a mission likely to take about a kerbin year.\u00A0 Probably Bill, Bob, Val \u002B
