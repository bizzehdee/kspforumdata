I almost fainted when I goo the call. Growing up I looked up at the pioneers of Kerbin\u0027s space exploration. Through their eyes, we saw the islands of Laythe, the cold wastes of Eeloo, and the hot hellscape that is Moho. We developed more and more wonderful technologies from the knowledge and resources they brought back. Thought they are no longer with us, their legacy will stand forever in Kerbin\u0027s memory. Watching their first launches in tiny capsules made me appreciate how courageous these 4 were. From Jeb laughing maniacally at every point, to Val being the steady hand even while Bill and Bob were worrying about the ship systems and scientific equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere I am today, walking in their footsteps (and hopefully not falling).

It is extremely big and heavy, but only seats 1 person. It seems the bulk of the vehicle is propulsion systems and power generation. One of the other recruits says it is powered by 2 atomic jets and never needs refueling.

This might be what is being built in one of the cordoned-off hangars, I have been hearing very loud engine noises from there. I wonder when we will get to test it. We will be commencing testing of the rover in a few weeks and I have been chosen to pilot the rover across the sea to the old island airfield to test its seaworthiness.

I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m excited or scared, or both. Our mission (I think there will be 10 of us) will be to go to every solid body that the orbital telescopes can find. It seems that there was a secret mission that the public did not know about where there were probes sent to map every place that had been found. They found much, much more than they thought the system contained. And they are not done. The bright areas in the sky we tend to see at night are actually stars, actual stars close enough to travel to. We don\u0027t yet know if they have planets around them, the probes have not yet reached their destinations. We will not wait though, we will start out for the places we know in the hope that by the time we are ready for the other places, they will be mapped enough for exploration.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWe have seen the vehicle that will take us to the stars. I have to say, at first, I didn\u0027t have much respect for it. For one, that name, iMvubu. Why would they name it that? This is supposed to go where none have gone before. The name \u0022Hippo\u0022 certainly doesn\u0027t convey that. Hopefully it grows on me.
