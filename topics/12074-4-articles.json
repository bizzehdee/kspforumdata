It is a way of \\\u0027talking\\\u0027 about the game, and short online movies are the best medium for this kind of situation. It reminds me a lot about minecraft, that game also grew a lot because of all that was on youtube. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can encourage the making by such movies by organizing contests or official weekly challenges where the conteders have to post their submission on youtube. You don\\\u0027t have to ask anyone to post those youtube-links around the whole internet, merely asking players to upload to youtube is enough in the long run. Some of the best movies will then start to live their own life and people who like what they see will follow the trail back to this game and try it out. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"roarke","CreatedById":27433,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-18T05:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/deAcVKv5_2I?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember Angry Birds Space, being presented by NASA astronaut Donald Pettit in the International Space Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENASA states that such collaboration with Rovio Mobile may share the excitement of space with the Angry Birds community, educate users on NASA\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s programs, and create interactive educational experiences for the public.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E So, Nasa will be interested on Kerbal Space Program 8), if given the chance.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds_Space#Reception\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seanoog","CreatedById":8599,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-18T23:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeen actively promoting Kerbal.Space Program too friends an family.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad my cusions playing it (Demo Version) over the weekend on my Mac.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey loved been able too build an crash there rockets...
