The only thing I can think of that could be causing this is CONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE in your settings.cfg file, but it shouldn\u0027t remove orbits completely, and reinstalling should overwrite your settings.cfg file. Otherwise, perhaps a graphical bug?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, have you seen correctly drawn trajectories before (that is, is this not your first time playing?)
