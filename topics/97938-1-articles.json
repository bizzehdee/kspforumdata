Near the end of his transfer orbit, Jeb noticed that he has less electric power than he expected, and it was draining at a rate of less than 0.01 units per second. Seeing as the wonderful engineers back in the VAB saw fit not to include any solar panels on his craft (\u0022we couldn\u0027t include any more parts!\u0022 they claimed), Jeb grumbled and continued with his mission, fully expecting to spend a little longer than planned on the surface of Minmus. After a significanly abbreviated visit to the surface, Jeb packed up his ground samples, stowed his EVA reports, and blasted back into space, hoping he could get home. Power continued to drain at an gradually increasing rate, now slightly more than 0.01 units per second. Burning to escape Minmus\u0027 SOI, Jeb realized he woud not have any power left for his next maneuver to return to Kerbin. As soon as his escape burn was completed, Jeb used what little power remained to aim himself in what he thought would be roughly retrograde once he left Minmus\u0027 SOI, and hoped the engines would still fire when he needed them. By a stroke of luck, he was pointed in nearly the right direction, completed a hard retrograde burn which would bring him into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere on his return orbit. Jeb decided there would be a few... discussions... between him, Gene, and the engineers about this rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo folks, I have no idea what would cause a 0.01 unit per second drain on power. I was not using SAS, the reaction wheels were idle. There was no power drain early in the mission unless I was making a maneuver. Any ideas as to what might be the culprit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer rocket was very simple:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EChute \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECommand pod \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDecoupler \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFL-T800 tank \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELV-909 engine \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E2Hot thermometer \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPresmat barometer \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux parts \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the science instruments drain continuous power, even if they are not being used?

The same buttons that you use for stopping flow for other fuels like liquid fuel and oxidizer are there to use for electric charge too. So if you know you\u0027re going to drift through space for a while, then you can manually shut everything down and guarantee no drain at all.
