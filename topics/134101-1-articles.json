Yes, really. Well, not completely, but if I put the full first here, you\u0027ll not be able to pronounce it, so let\u0027s stick with \u0027Dash\u0027. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0I\u0027d like to say it\u0027s nice to meet you all, as it\u0027s my first time on the KSP forums. I hope it\u0027s true, too.\u00A0By occupation I\u0027m a writer, and I\u0027ve never coded any mods for anything in the past, so it\u0027s a touch beyond passing strange that my first post to the KSP forums is here, in the \u0022help \u0026amp; support\u0022 section of the \u0022Add-on Development\u0022 subforum. But I do think it\u0027s appropriate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI come to you today to ask for your assistance with something I call \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EExodus\u003C/strong\u003E.\u0022 Now, before I get into it, I\u0027d like to describe what\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EExodus\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eis and why I need some assistance, but also to make some notes regarding parts of it that aren\u0027t mine. This is because Exodus isn\u0027t a mod, though the part I\u0027m writing most certainly is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExodus is a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Emodpack\u003C/strong\u003E. Now, this means I\u0027m expecting the player\u00A0to be using mods that I didn\u0027t write and don\u0027t own. Because of the variety of mods and specifically the various licenses used, I cannot make\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EExodus\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eavailable as a single download. I can\u0027t host download links. That\u0027s ok. Now, this is a long shot (and not why I\u0027m writing this post), but if you are an author of a mod on my list, feel free to talk to me about your feelings on your mod being used in\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EExodus\u003C/strong\u003E. If you\u0027re cool with it, and so is everyone else, I may at some point be able to use one service or another to put together a modpack download for ease of access by the player. That\u0027d be nice. However, if you don\u0027t want your mod being used, while I would hope that would never happen, I\u0027ll respect that, remove your mod from the list.\u00A0and try to find, or create, an alternative. Currently, as I\u0027m simply providing a list of mod titles to the player, all of which are publicly available, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going against any licenses, but your feelings as a mod author are more important to me than what license you chose. I will ask you to please read the full description of, and understand,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EExodus\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eas an idea before you make that call. I think that\u0027s reasonable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can find the readme (that includes the full modpack description) at the github repo for the modpack:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/captainveidt/Exodus-Contract-Pack\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EExodus Contract Pack GitHub Repo\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich brings me nicely around to the \u0022help \u0026amp; support\u0022 I\u0027m hoping for, on the\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EExodus Contract Pack\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eitself. As I mentioned, I am not a developer or coder by any means, but I believe that challenging oneself is very important, arguably vital. In other words, \u003Cem\u003EI am very, very new at this. Please don\u0027t assume I know anything.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EMy current challenge to myself is to get\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EExodus\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eup and running. Right now, I have the very beginnings of the contract pack put together. Getting this far has presented a few questions to me. I\u0027m afraid I simply don\u0027t have the knowledge to answer them myself, though I\u0027ve been trying. P\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFirst, and most importantly, as I\u0027m trying to make everything run on a progression, am I using Contract Configurator\u0027s Persistent Data Storage correctly?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow can I make having certain science (e.g. crew report, EVA report, gravioli experiment report) goals for a contract mission? I haven\u0027t found anything regarding to science in CC\u0027s wiki.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow can I make sure that experiment-adding mods play nice with CC when I add one of their experiments to the question immediately above?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDoes OuterSystemPlanets play nicely with CC?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSome more general questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWhere \u0026amp; how would I go about learning to create a small mod that would do things like require launch clamps, implement a custom tech tree?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIs there a mod that allows one to move the KSC? In Exodus\u0027 late game I\u0027ll want to give the player to make it part of the KSS, due to the (light) story I\u0027ve put together. If not, refer to first question?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWould anyone be willing to donate some artwork? I\u0027m no artist, and I think one self-push project at a time is probably enough. I really only need a \u00A0few logo pieces.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone wants to assist on the project more generally, that\u0027s fine too. Just talk to me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly I\u0027d like to mention that everything I\u0027m doing on this project is MIT licensed. This is because\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EI don\u0027t want any monetary profit from this.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThis project is about pushing myself, it\u0027s about giving back to the community that\u0027s supported one of my favorite games of all time (truth!), it\u0027s about offering a challenge. It\u0027s not about profit or money. I would go copyleft, but I\u0027m a touch selfish about keeping my handle attached to the idea.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-13T23:21:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking mod packs of others mods can be a sensitive subject and has set off some heated discussions previously as they can create problems for the original mod author.
