Hope it goes to good use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, since building my first successful space plane (and getting really good at building planes in general -- only took 160-some playing hours) I\u0027ve developed a fascination with VTOLs. There have been a few VTOL challenges (most similar one \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/29165-Calling-all-VTOL-pilots%21-The-Cupcake-Challenge-Cup-Is-Here?highlight=vtol\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E) but they can become very frustrating very quickly. I wanted to design one that was possible, and possibly even easy. You get vastly more points the more you challenge yourself, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- - -The Challenge- - -\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing any VTOL (design your own or use the one I\u0027ve included below), take off vertically from the starting point on the runway, pick up an item at the VAB launcher (using docking ports OR the KAS magnet (recommended)), place it at the opposite end of the runway, then land back where you started. For \u0022the item,\u0022 an Mk1-2 command pod is strongly suggested, but not required (it\u0027s a fair weight, robust, nothing to break).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra points are given for those who only touch the ground twice -- once at takeoff and once at landing. However, this is not required. You are certainly allowed to, say, take off, land, wheel over to the object, pick it up, wheel over to the runway, drop it off, wheel down the runway, then take off and land again. Heck, you can build a car that uses separatrons to get off the ground for a second or two.
