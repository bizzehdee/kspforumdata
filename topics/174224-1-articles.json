Duna\u0027s atmosphere is 10% as thick as Kerbin\u0027s so it\u0027s not as thin as like Mar\u0027s atmosphere is (0.6% of Earth\u0027s), you can\u0027t completely ignore it in terms of drag, you CAN ignore it in terms of engine \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, vacuum engines work fine just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo putting aside Fairings and generalizing the question:\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EShould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you streamline a Duna Lander? I say no. Make it draggy. That way it\u0027ll easily bleed off velocity when landing which, in my opinion, is worth more than the deltaV savings when ascending. If you want to get tricky you can try making a cone-shaped lander which descends tail first which is high drag, and ascends nose first which is low drag, though that is tricky and Duna deltaV requirements are low anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
