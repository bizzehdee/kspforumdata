From the local weather news that gathered its data from satellites, to the HD television with the weatherman on it. All the way to the ingenious machines in the hospital to cure your illness. Technology has made our lives better and better. And continue doing so every day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut nowadays people seem to have a fear for technology (whilst still using it). Recently there was a news article abut a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.c4st.org/news/item/what-s-happening-around-the-world/danish-students-attract-international-attention-with-cress-and-wifi-experiment.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Estudy\u003C/a\u003E performed by a few young Danish girls about the efffects of Wi-Fi on Cress. For me as a Computer network architect this is a direct insult. I do share the conclusion that young girls with an Iphone close to bed have trouble sleeping. I do agree that the suspect is radiation, but not the Wi-Fi / GSM / GPRS signals. but the Light radiating the Facebook app into their eyes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe WHO hasn\u0027t found a single cellphone related cancer yet. And we use cellphones quite a lot. Yet I do not understand why people have this big fear / hatred towards a force for good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the same hatred / fear that uor beloved space organisations have to deal with. People get upset when they read how much money we spend on the ISS or Curiosity or whatever cool space toy they build. When I think of Apollo my heart skips a beat, not just because of the beautiful images I see inside my head but also because Apollo was a huge technology boost. Without Apollo I wouldn\u0027t have the chance to type this! Yet still people whine \u0022What did Neil ever do for us!!!\u0022, \u0022Why spend so much money on space when there are people starving here on Earth...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is your opinion as technology as a scapegoat.

If you can freely modify such things, beautiful things can be done. Regarding the concern of hacking, ID theft, etc., you should look at the number of viruses for linux. There are virtually none.
