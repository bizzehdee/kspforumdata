That is WRONG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter re-watching the scene carefully every time you will notice when she tries tugging, the ropes come loose more and they always kept sliding off since the very beginning. We get a wide shot of the whole thing and then, if you pay attention, they are both still moving. She never stopped Kowalski fully, she just slowed him down a bit and was still being pulled by him. The scene actually turned out to be accurate, despite my first impression. Well, seeing it 3 times actually helped study it more!
