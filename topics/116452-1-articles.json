Also, mainly focusing on the F-22, and the PAK FA, as they encompass fifth generation designs philosophies. They both show the different ways of thinking for each country. They are very similar aircraft, however the F-22 is a much more western designs. Stealth focused, meant to be the first to strike, with maneuverability important, but not the main concern. And the PAK FA, a very Russian design. Extremely maneuverable, meant to avoid missiles, and get into a WVR dogfight.\n\nThe time being, the PAK FA looks much more promising. BVR missiles have an atrocious hit rate, single digit percentages. With countermeasures and a decently maneuverable plane, there\u0027s no hope in hell it\u0027ll get hit. So currently, the PAK FA has the advantage.\n\nHowever...\n\nThe Russian are developing a new missile; the K-77M. Now this missile supposedly has an AESA radar fitted to the nose, and should have a near 360 degree view of the battlefield. Modern missiles are easy to evade if the aircraft being fired upon maneuvers at the last second, out of the missiles field of view. With this new radar, the missile should supposedly never miss.\n\nNow this may sound good for Russia, however Western countries will likely be close behind in developing a similar missile...\n\nAnd suddenly the PAK FA\u0027s only defense is gone. No longer can it outmaneuver an opponents missiles.\n\nBut there\u0027s another factor. Radar jamming. While the F-22 may hide from radar, the PAK FA may just get rid of their opponents radar altogether.\n\nSo yeah, I just wanted to let my thoughts out. What do you guys think? Do you think the multibillion dollar F-22 will hold up in the future, or is the PAK FA\u0027s more contemporary approach better for the long run?\n\nOh, and here. Have a completely unrelated picture of the sexiest plane to see the face of this earth.\n\n![Su-35.jpg](http://joemiller.us/wp-content/uploads/Su-35.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Flymetothemun","CreatedById":17689,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T00:55:02Z","Content":"Russia\u0027s New Missile!?

And I think that it\u0027ll grow from our current drones to having a mirror of our current system of aircraft where you\u0027ll have bombing drones, fighting drones, etc. I certainly do think that there will be combat airplanes with a man in the cockpit for as long as there are airplanes, but their use will decrease and eventually they\u0027ll only be used in large-scale operations, as a relief if the drones aren\u0027t cutting it, or in experimental situation or situations where a drone would be out of range or in too much danger of being shot down and the enemy finding it and reverse-engineering it."},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T00:55:04Z","Content":"Lies.
