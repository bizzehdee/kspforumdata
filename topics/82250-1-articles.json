Usually when I landed at Minmus and tried to come back. I would also have an issue when I went EVA and my kerbals would freeze. Then the issue started all the time. I started taking out mods, start a new game, jump in a ship and splash down by the control center. Every single time I tried to recover, this issue would happen. I would go back to the main screen, but no rep, no science, no funds added. Then you go into the commsat station and try to recover there, nothing happens and that same page pops up after a finished mission, but again, no rep, science, etc. I just did a fresh install, downloaded the mods I dont want to live without lol (went from like 60 files to like 30), and so far so good\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dtoxic","CreatedById":103573,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T23:06:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit seem then some mod or plug-in is messing with it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplease do post if you find out what mod might be causing this behavior\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"southernrock","CreatedById":116010,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T01:31:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I do not know what caused it. I had to clear everything out and start over with the bare min main mods, that was the best way. With so many mods, there could have been one that over wrote another, and some mods have more than 1 main folder, so it was impossible for me to take out each and every one... sorry, but hey, my game is working good now lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dtoxic","CreatedById":103573,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T01:51:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell i found a workaround for the problem when recovering a vessel fails go to tracking station and select the vessel not from the list but from the map view and then recover it for me it works every single time\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"southernrock","CreatedById":116010,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T15:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dtoxic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dtoxic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewell i found a workaround for the problem when recovering a vessel fails go to tracking station and select the vessel not from the list but from the map view and then recover it for me it works every single time\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm glad it worked for you.
