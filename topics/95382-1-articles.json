Is this sort of a slow \u0022wobble, wobble\u0022 buildup before it comes apart? Or is it pretty quick, within seconds, \u0022wobble-\u0026gt;shakes like crazy-\u0026gt;BOOM\u0022 sort of thing? The faster one is usually a clipping problem while the first one is sometimes a different problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t say for certain what causes it, but the usual culprit is clipping (at least in the fast case). And it\u0027s usually when clipping a bunch of physicsless parts together. It\u0027s hard to tell from the picture if you have any of that going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also seen ships, similar in design to your station with girders and orange tanks, that exhibit the same sort of behavior. In that case, I was able to stop the wobbling by transferring some of the fuel around out of one of the orange tanks to change the mass distribution of the ship. Ultimately that orange tank (and it\u0027s mirror image) were undocked from the ship and sent adrift to prevent the problem completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee if any of that helps.

It performed perfectly all the way there but as soon as I decoupled the drive section that transported it there the wobble started and the station blew itself apart about a minute later. I fixed it by adding a few struts in key areas where the wobble had started (after reloading and watching a few times to try and see where the problem lay). I did eventually get the original version stable but the extra struts seemed to sort out the problem out on re-launches of the same basic design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck and welcome to the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wibou","CreatedById":134135,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T20:13:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I did experiment the \u0022wobble-\u0026gt;shakes like crazy-\u0026gt;BOOM\u0022 case, it\u0027s mostly a \u0022slow wobble build up\u0022 case. It usually needs about 10-15 seconds to break apart once I notice the initial wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I spend two hours experimenting with various configuration and putting the tank farther from each other (i.e. 2 on the central hub docks, 1 on the very top dock and 3 on the struts docks) make it become somewhat stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt still gets into \u0022stupid wobble mode\u0022, just less often.

A few struts to tie the boosters together at the top and bottom always fixes it so I would suggest that\u0027s what is happening with your station too...
