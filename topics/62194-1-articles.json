We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got a lot to accomplish but we feel like this will be a great way to kick off a big 2014 for \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;KSP\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; Anyhow\u2026\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; These are our main goals for \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;0.24\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;u\u0026gt;Contracts\u0026lt;/u\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; The first iteration of the contracts mechanic is coming up. At the Mission Control Facility, you\u2019ll be able to take on contracts from a list of offers. Each contract will give you a set of objectives to fulfill, possibly with added requirements, and a deadline. These contracts are going to be dynamically generated off a number of different basic mission templates, and filled out with detail based on how far you\u2019ve advanced in your Career. A feature this large is most likely not going to be complete in a single update, but we feel like we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re off to a very good start with our initial plan. \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;u\u0026gt;New Mission Control Screen\u0026lt;/u\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; It\u2019s been there for a while, but so far no Kerbal has dared enter that mysterious building at the space center. Oh, plus the fact it didn\u2019t have an inside also made it extra difficult. We\u2019re adding a new Mission Control Screen, accessible through the already-there Mission Control Facility, which will present you with a UI where you\u2019ll be able to pick out contracts and decide whether to accept them or pass them by.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;u\u0026gt;Improved Part-to-Part Joints\u0026lt;/u\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; There is one unassuming line in the Unity 4.3 changelog that made a world of difference to us. I\u2019ll quote it here in fact: \u201CPhysics.\u201D Joints can now have separate anchor points configured for both connected rigidbodies. What this means is that the era of rockets \u2018dancing\u2019 on top of their engines is coming (finally) to an end. We are completely re-doing the joints, to have much more control over how they link together, and not least, how much we want them to be bendy and wobbly. We\u2019re not eliminating the wobble altogether, as that would actually be removing a lot of what makes failures fun. We\u2019re aiming to have better control over it, so we can have wobbly bits where we want them to wobble, and more rigid connections where things are supposed to be firmly attached.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;u\u0026gt;Multiplayer\u2019s First Steps\u0026lt;/u\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; This isn\u2019t so much a feature at this point, but it\u2019s worth mentioning in any case. We\u2019re starting work on the core components of multiplayer now, so by the time we\u2019re about done with Career Mode, we\u2019ll already have a solid platform to start building multiplayer features on top of it. Right now, the primary goal is to write the server backend that will run things. There won\u2019t be much to show of this for a while, but we\u2019ll keep everyone posted about the progress being made.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;u\u0026gt;Tutorials Revisited\u0026lt;/u\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a long time since we did the in-game tutorials now. They harken back to ye olden times of version 0.17, and when you consider that 0.18 was when we added maneuver nodes and docking, you start to get a sense of just how much has changed in the game since the tutorials were written. Needless to say then, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in dire need of a revision, and that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s what we plan to do on this update, and if time allows, also add a couple of new ones. \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; And as always, the usual batch of small tweaks and bug fixes that we do as we go along.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; And we can\u2019t say this enough, this list \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;isn\u2019t\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; a preview of the changelog for the next update. \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;These are our ambitions, not promises.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Some of this might not make it in, while at the same time other things not on this list might be included as well, so the bottom line is, don\u2019t take this as if it was written in stone. \u0026lt;span\u0026gt;(It was, in fact, written on \u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66906-Our-Logitech-Rocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66906-Our-Logitech-Rocket\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u0026gt;my sweet new G19s keyboard, which the kind folks at Logitech sent to us.\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; And no, they didn\u2019t make me say this).\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; Anyhow, that\u2019s all the news for now, stay tuned for more as it develops.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; Cheers!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T22:47:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHoly crap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERigid ships and contracts, WOOHOO!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you Unity 4.3!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Man","CreatedById":32075,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T22:57:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting take on the MP category though I wouldn\u0027t classify it as being high-priority.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neutrinovore","CreatedById":72520,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T23:20:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it looks like the sandbox single player gets the short end of the stick again, from a standpoint of added content/playability.
