Does it really make sense to take the car\u0027s speed relative to the conveyor, and the conveyor\u0027s speed relative to some other spot? They are both variables in the problem, they should both be measured against something else, and not to themselves. If we did that, we would find that both the car/plane and conveyor MUST move to satisfy your conditions. This artificial requirement of the belt existing soley to stop the car/plane is neither stated in this thread\u0027s nor in your own requirement above. \n\nIt just kind of materializes on its own, I imagine from the niche function that treadmills have found at gyms."},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T09:53:52Z","Content":"\\*sigh\n\nThis is pointless."},{"CreatedByName":"FungusForge","CreatedById":148313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T11:22:26Z","Content":"A **car** moves by having its propulsion interact directly with the **ground**.

Simple as that.\n\nThis is like asking if a car going 80mph without brakes will stop before that very dangerous-looking cliff ahead. Spoiler: it won\u0027t.

How can this even be a question?\n\nIf the airstream created by forward movement and propulsion is strong enough to allow the lifting surfaces to lift the plane, then it\u0027ll take off.\n\nThe conveyor belt only speeds up the rotation of the wheels, so they roll faster and create a bit more friction. But technically you\u0027ll never actually be able to completely stop a plane with functional wheels. If you\u0027d be able to stop a plane, then it won\u0027t lift off, because most planes won\u0027t just fly in the air when being stationary (or by propeller/etc-airstream alone). Duh.\n\nIdk.
