I\u0027ve watched vids of this and it seems tedious to me but that\u0027s just me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll admit, I\u0027m a noob as spaceplanes go. I\u0027ve done it a few times, but only proof of concept craft. Nothing big enough to be worth the effort. And I\u0027ve yet to be able to land one intact, let alone land one at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I realize this has nothing to do with SSTO\u0027s but my preference for an SSTO is likely always going to be a rocket for these reasons. If I\u0027m throwing away 90% of my mass, that is okay. It\u0027s just fuel. In real rocketry, the fuel isn\u0027t even 10% of the cost of the rocket. Well, since I can land the orbit stage(s) back at KSC then I\u0027m recovering 90% of my investment. Would be cheaper to refurb rocket parts in real life vs. the maintenance on a spaceplane, now there is a good question.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T01:34:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn suborbital system has obvious military use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis right here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the US Army\u0027s 82nd Airborne has a 24hour deployment ability. That means ANYWHERE in the world in 24hours. Imagine being able to cut that down to 12, or even 4 hours. Things like the attack on the Isreali Olympic team back in the 70s near impossible, or the ability to capture a high profile target without them having time to evade. Or the projection of force that would give you as a nation. This is what would fuel the SSTO market, more than the civilian market. While they would help they would not be the primary supporters. They would benefit from the technological gains but at first it would be for only the wealthy jet setters.

The SSTO is essentially the age-old idea that a free man rides his own horse wherever he wants. It\u0027s a nice idea, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be that much in touch with reality.\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX also tries to achieve cheap spaceflight, but instead of listening to sci-fi authors and test pilots, it\u0027s listening to engineers. Reaching orbit is a demanding and highly specialized task that requires a lot of expensive hardware. After reaching orbit, that hardware becomes dead weight, making the ship much worse in everything else. It makes much more sense to drop that hardware before reaching orbit, and to reuse it in the next launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the aero gear being \u0022dead weight\u0022 upon reaching LKO.
