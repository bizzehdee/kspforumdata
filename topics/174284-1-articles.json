It works like a charm in Atmo. I\u0027ve gotten up to Mach 3, which is beautiful. But when the air thins, I\u0027m having trouble. I know should be able to switch propellants, but I can\u0027t find the right tank to hold any of the fuel options. I even tried a simple \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tank and I couldn\u0027t get the engine to draw from it. Clearly, I\u0027m missing something. but I\u0027m not sure what it is. It could be fuel crossfeed or part adjacency or simply not using the right tank for the job. If someone can point me to right part or let me know what the problem us, I\u0027d really appreciate it. Additionally, if there\u0027s about which fuels are the most efficient to use in a vacuum, that would also be very handy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks in advance,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAndrew\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-26T17:32:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2018 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by soifua\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadding mod\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barar","CreatedById":184076,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-26T20:20:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t use the mod but does the WIKI help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/sswelm/KSP-Interstellar-Extended/wiki/Thermal-Ramjet-Nozzle-and-Thermal-Turbojet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/sswelm/KSP-Interstellar-Extended/wiki/Thermal-Ramjet-Nozzle-and-Thermal-Turbojet\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeen some Youtube videos but they are from 2014, so not sure if they are accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soifua","CreatedById":131991,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-26T20:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot specifically with the issue I\u0027m having.
