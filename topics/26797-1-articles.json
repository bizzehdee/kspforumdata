Given the size of the rockets I\u0027ve constructed to reach the Mun and back, and with most of that rocket being used to simply get into orbit of Kerbin onto a path to the Mun, I was wondering if it might simplify construction and require a far smaller sized rocket, design the rocket in individual stages, launch those stages into Kerbin orbit and then assemble the parts with the docking ports. The only thing I can\u0027t see working is how would you control such a rocket once it\u0027s all docketed together? Is there a way to control multiple docked ships as one craft and not as different parts each requiring independent control?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MRab2","CreatedById":22875,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T11:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShort answer is yes.

The mothership can contain most of the fuel and the engines for the transfer, along with power generation and Kerbal storage. The best best is to launch it into low Kerbin orbit, launch and dock your smaller crafts then refuel them all. Your landers can be made with the minimum delta v required to land and take off from your target world and can be disposed of if you wish once they\u0027ve accomplished their mission (better not to drag any dead weight back to Kerbin at the end).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example I recently went to collect a whole load of stranded Kerbals on Duna. I had a large carrier ship with a lander, a manned rover and 2 satellites in tow. The rover was depployed to go and round up the Kerbals and bring them to the lander, which made several trips to ferry them all back to the mothership (refueling from the mothership each time). The rover was left abandoned when the last man left and the lander was also ditched in orbit once they\u0027d all returned. The satellites were launched to Duna and Ike polar orbits. The mothership then returned them all to a Kerbin space station where they all boarded a space plane to return them to KSC. The mothership was again refueled and was ready for it\u0027s next cargo and mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klajan","CreatedById":64866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T12:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, docking large crafts in orbit is one of the best aproches to interplanetary travel. I am currently building a interplanetary spacecraft, capable of traveling to every planet in the Kerbol System. I have to shoot 7 different part into orbit and dock them, but this way I have enough fuel and thrust to easily get to laythe and back. If my memory is correct, it should consist out of ~700 parts and has a total weight of around 300-400t. My \u0022Mothership\u0022 consists out of fueltanks and a bit of RCS fuel and other things, then I have an enginearray with 9 Nuclear engines docked to the back and in the front I have and large Habitant module.
