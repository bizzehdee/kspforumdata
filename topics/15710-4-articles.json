It\\\u0027s important to remember that there can be other things keeping us from building a gigantic nuclear rocket, other than environmentalists and NIMBYs and other bogeymen.

Strictly speaking, and speaking as a fan of exotic propulsion, I don\\\u0027t know of a lot of reasons to have a giant rocket even if it boasts a potentially very low per-kilo launch cost. In order to be worth the while of developing a high-power high-efficiency but untried and only somewhat-tested technology, much less an entire massive launch platform built around the thing, there needs to be significant demand for heavy launches.
