the large size actually makes its use more niche.\u00A0 If you need to store that many snacks, you\u0027re really at a point where configurable containers are the way to go.\u00A0 The only really solid application I have for it is early space stations.\u00A0 If you read the posts in this thread, people are clearly struggling with knowing how much of what kind of stuff to bring.\u00A0 The base loadout of this part is meant to fix that problem; it consists of tier-4 snacks and fertilizer, in roughly the proportion that you\u0027d use in a station using early hydroponics.\u00A0 Beyond that, the only application I can imagine\u00A0would be a simple desire to have container parts that look the part.\u00A0 That is, you just want your snack storage module to look like it stores snacks.\u00A0 For that case, there are loadouts for purely T0-T4 snacks.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother need, which I haven\u0027t addressed yet, is for a small container for fertilizer for early-game.\u00A0 The Orbital Pantry might just take care of that requirement;

You also need at least one antenna of any type for each satellite you have in orbit in order to utilize it.

For scanning, it seems consistent enough that I\u0027ve gotten used to it. I recall that early on, I finished scanning at tier 0 and then sent up a tier 1 scanner only to discover that was pointless as tier 1 was also silently completed for whichever moon that was. For scanning of interplanetary destinations, I tend to just send a single one of the larger scanners and upgrade it on the spot.

It was excruciatingly painful to try to land on Duna a base like the one in the tutorial. Easy enough on the airless moons, but required exquisite care in balancing to keep things under control while landing on Duna. I finally settled on landing just a minimal core with enough rocket parts to bootstrap building (using simple construction) a scrounger and rocket parts factory. That worked ...well, better... once I got past the fact that the stage separator was ripping off the adjustable base frame that I thought had fit nicely inside of it. (Prelighting the engines in the nest stage before separation seemed to help pull it out fast enough to solve that.) Then I hit some sort of input locking bug where I couldn\u0027t click on most things - even if I tested starting a brand new test career. Only solved that by installing a new copy of the game (and all the mods I\u0027m using) and copying my save game over. Argh. Then I finally got my base core landed, but it was a bit too tall and it toppled over. Spent lots of time trying to rectify that, including an almost successful ploy of building add-ons to the side port that was now on top and using solar panel extension to lift enough to swing it all upright. That sort of worked... until I found that the gravity ease-in toppled it back over when I left and later returned focus there. Well, I could still sort of awkwardly build some basics even with the base toppled over. Sure was glad that it looks like I\u0027ll be able to skip adding tier 1 stuff to it before landing a more permanent base for tier 2 and up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah.

I\u0027ve made some progress unlocking research and so I did some math for the hydroponics, for Tier 0 -\u0026gt; Tier 1. Thought that I would share the results here because I don\u0027t see this type of information already written down anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hydroponics module produces 2 units of \u003Cem\u003EAgroponic \u003C/em\u003Esnacks per day (not listed as an output because it\u0027s eat it or loose it). If you had a single Kerbal doing all hydroponics research by themselves it would take 6816 Kerbal days to reach Tier 1 (16 Kerbal years). This also requires a large amount of Tier 4 snacks shipped in. You need 5453 Tier 4 snacks. Rounding up, that means you need the equivalent of 16 orbital pantries costing 100 thousand credits and weighing about 20 tons. The hydroponics unit will also require 8 electricity per second and a total of 1364 Tier 0 fertilizer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor tier 0 -\u0026gt; tier 1, you can have up to 10 Kerbals eating the produce from one hydroponics unit.

This means you can potentially cut the need for Tier 4 snacks way down. For instance your kerbals in space could eat a diet of 20% hydroponic tier 0 snacks \u002B 40% greenhouse tier 0 snacks \u002B 40% kerbin tier 4 snacks. In this example the need for tier 4 snacks is cut in half.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-25T00:46:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2020 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by pand1024\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xxendurancexx","CreatedById":175806,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-04T01:00:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s really cool.
