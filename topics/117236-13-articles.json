Anyone else can also only speculate what is going on without log files, screenshots and reproducing steps how to recreate bug, if it is bug and not some kind of oversight in craft design. It also can help to reproduce same issue with minimum number of mods installed and then add mod one by one until you found mod that breaks things.
