One will be in a low, polar orbit above Moho. It will act as a rendezvous point and refueling station, and it will house two small landers for ferrying crew and supplies to the surface and back. More details about the second station will be forthcoming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- A series of mostly reusable tugs will be used to ferry station and base components from my Minmus orbital station to Moho, where they will be assembled in orbit or on the surface. Another vehicle will be designed to ferry crew from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to Moho orbit and back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- To facilitate the launching of so many components, and to preserve my sanity, I\u0027ll also be building a series of standard launch vehicles. These will be designed to carry payloads from 1 to 50 tons into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started by designing all of the launch vehicles. Not all of them will be used for this mission, but they should be nice to have in the future. This first series, from left to right, shows my 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 ton launchers. There are two versions of the 10 ton vehicle, for 1.25 and 2.5 meter payloads. All of these are capable of getting their respective payloads into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with around 50 - 200 m/s of delta-v to spare. And all of them are designed for use with fairings, without those an additional 10-20% can be added to the mass of the payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221to15ton.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Moho/1to15ton.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis next series is my 20, 30, 40, and 50 ton launchers. There are two versions of the 30 ton launcher, for 2.5 and 3.75 meter payloads. I tried to reuse components for each vehicle. The 5 to 20 ton launchers all use essentially the same booster rockets, just more of them. And the 40 and 50 ton launchers are basically the same, I just added a 3rd pair of boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220to50ton.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Moho/20to50ton.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll end this initial post with the launch of the probe pack using my 30 ton vehicle.

Normally the ideal window for a transit is when Moho leads Kerbin by about 107\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E in its orbit, and the burn is conducted retrograde to Kerbin\u0027s orbit around the sun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing at Minmus complicates matters though; it takes about two days after burning at Minmus to fall back to around 100km above Kerbin. Kerbin moves around the sun about 3.4\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E/day, while Moho moves about 14.1\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E/day, meaning that Moho advances about 10.7\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E/day with respect to Kerbin\u0027s position. Therefore, the burn at Minmus has to occur when Moho is only about 85\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E ahead of Kerbin. And this has to take place while Minmus is at the right position, about 1/3 of its orbit seems suitable for this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo further complicate matters you have the inclination change. Correcting for this can take over 700 m/s of delta-v if you wait until you are in orbit around the sun to do it. Being at Minmus allows for a nearly free inclination change though. If you wait until Kerbin is near an ascending or descending node with respect to Moho, then a small normal or anti-normal burn near Minmus can correct for most of the change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, waiting for all of these factors to line up would take forever, so I just waited until I was at a node and didn\u0027t really worry about the position of Moho. With a change at Minmus I was able to decrease my inclination relative to Moho to about 1.5\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E instead of 7\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E. Once in orbit around the sun only about 200 m/s was required for the rest of the change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are both tugs burning near Kerbin after returning from Minmus. I got nervous during all of this time playing with maneuver nodes, so I sent up an additional fuel tank for the Talaria tug. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Moho/day%202/Mohostationburn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mohostationburn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause this burn didn\u0027t really get me on course for an encounter with Moho I just treated it more like an orbital rendezvous rather than an interplanetary transfer. I partially matched Moho\u0027s orbit, then waited for the right time to set up an encounter. The final burn near Moho was about 500 m/s for one tug and 750 m/s for the other tug. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Moho/day%202/Mohostationcapture.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mohostationcapture.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe delta-v counts shown hear started recording when I left Minmus Orbital. Talaria made it with about 4800 m/s, not too bad, but it came in almost bone dry on fuel. Hermes had plenty of fuel since it was carrying the extra tank, but it took just over 5400 m/s to get there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Moho/day%202/Mohostationstats.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mohostationstats.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit the first matter was to dock the fuel tank to the central node. I\u0027m trying out a new detachable docking component method here. The large docking port used for transit is attached to the fuel tank with decoupler. Once this is blown separatrons fire, carrying away the docking port, RCS thrusters and their tank. This kicked back the fuel tank a little more than I expected, but it worked pretty well, and now I don\u0027t have to keep all those extraneous RCS thrusters on the final station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Moho/day%202/Mohostationfueldock.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mohostationfueldock.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the central station node complete Hermes was docked to the large port on the docking node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Moho/day%202/Mohostationcore.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mohostationcore.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis next part was fun.

From LKO I can usually get into orbit and rendezvous with the Moho station with about 5000 - 5500 m/s of delta-v. My best from LKO was just under 4500 m/s, but that was with launching into a 20\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E inclined orbit, and a lucky encounter that required no further inclination change. From Minmus orbit I can usually get there with about 4500 m/s, I think my best is around 4200 or 4300 m/s, but starting at Minmus complicates things and I wouldn\u0027t recommend it. The only major advantage of starting from Minmus, is that you can really easily take care of the inclination change. A 20-50 m/s burn at Minmus can make a significant change in your Kerbin inclination, and if you time your burn near a node with Moho, that can take care of most or all of the inclination change. You can do the same by launching into an inclined orbit, but that doesn\u0027t help if you\u0027re already in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly I don\u0027t bother with trying to get an ideal Hohmann transfer. I just do it like an orbital rendezvous, burning once or twice near periapsis and waiting for a good encounter. This adds to the total delta-v, but not by much, and I think it\u0027s much easier than trying to time everything perfectly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting back, at least, is really easy. It pretty regularly takes about 2300 m/s to get into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. And that\u0027s starting from a polar orbit around Moho, which makes it a little trickier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
