I\u0027ve done lots of optimization to my craft, got the payload mass to around 5.7 tons and around 3450 vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E at launch. To be fair, the final launch vehicle ended up looking a lot like the acolyte\u0027s submission, but there\u0027s simply no other way of going around it (and I did try to build my ship around 2.5m fuel tanks and even attempted to make an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, but it sadly didn\u0027t work), his concept seems to be already very optimized, and the fact that I actually managed to scrape a bit more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E at launch while having heavier payload than him is already impressive in my book lmao\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s only one issue though: I can\u0027t reach orbit. I\u0027ve been battling with this for the whole night. I tried various launch profiles, tried to go shallower or steeper at different points of ascent and yet every time I am about 200 m/s short of orbit (at best). I can\u0027t add fuel to the vessel because I go over the recovery limit set by the challenge, and there isn\u0027t really any place I can noticeably reduce dry mass of my ship. Besides, judging by the screenshots, acolyte reached orbit comfortably with enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to spare to deorbit, so at this point I am just confused. What\u0027s the optimal launch profile for the Kerbin takeoff? Anyone can lend me a hand here? Because if I crack this dilemma the record will (hopefully) be mine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-02T07:22:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2022 07:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by OJT\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
