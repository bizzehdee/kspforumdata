guess from playing with these things 30 some years ago.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Quick definitions here: Spinning: rotation around the users hand, on the end of the rope.\u00A0 Rotation: the spinning along the long axis of the foil.\u00A0\u00A0 Otherwise the following statements are going to be mighty confusing)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it\u0027s spinning around the rope, it\u0027s creating a bit of lift, vectored on one edge of the foil, inline with the direction of axial rotation.\u00A0 This causes it to continue to rotate in that direction, twisting up the cord some.\u00A0 The trailing edge of the foil causes a bit of a vacuum, and this cavitation causes the sound, from the collapsing of the vacuum behind the foil.\u00A0 The minuscule amount of lift it creates, (since there will probably be opposing lift vectors as it rotates, but the one vector will be slightly more than the other, given angles of attack and such)will eventually be overcome by the force of the twisted string, which shows how little lift force there actually is. \u00A0 The string will eventually cause it stop rotating, leading to a slight pause in the sound, and then start rotating it in the opposite direction.\u00A0 This will make the previous \u0022trailing edge\u0022 into the new \u0022leading edge\u0022, and the whole process starts over. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as your initial rotational speed is enough to create enough lift to overcome the most stable neutral position it wants to settle to, it will roar. \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0If you don\u0027t rotate the roarer before spinning it, it will often not produce a noise louder than a soft whoosh.\u00A0 As it spins, tensions in the rope (as you are holding onto it in a fixed position, not letting the rope rotate in your fingers) and probably a bit of precession will often cause the rope to start the airfoil spinning. \u00A0 I think that is why, if you use a flat board, you can sometimes get a soft roar out of it too.\u00A0 The rotation is causing cavitation and a sound. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had always used symmetrical airfoils, so the sound was the same in both directions of rotation.\u00A0 But I would guess that if you used a more asymmetric NACA style airfoil, you could probably get two different tones, maybe even be tunable based on the speed of spin.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Possibly, also using an elastic style string would allow it to build up more rotational energy in the string before being reversed, causing it to rotate faster each time it reversed.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022

spin speed, rotational speed, and the amount of cavitation.\u00A0 I posit that you could design a multi tone roarer, with a few section sof different sized (width and thickness) airfoil to create different tones.\u00A0\u00A0 With a little R\u0026amp;D, these tones could produce harmonics that would greatly increase the volume, and ergo audible range, of the roarer.\u00A0 Since the spin speed is what gives the roarer it\u0027s energy, the actual tones and ergo the harmonic, would be very dependent on the users ability to maintain a fixed spin speed.\u00A0 Even then, the rotational energy being stored/dissipated in the rope will affect the rotational speed, altering the tones.\u00A0\u00A0 So, with a properly harmonic bull roarer, you would get an oscillating wave.\u00A0 A normal roar

generation of the bullroarer can be demonstrated easily enough.\u00A0 Take a piece of flat balsa (like one wing from a dime store glider), hold it level, and just release it a little forward.\u00A0 You\u0027ll see it spin rapidly, with the leading edge rising.\u00A0 This occurs because the center of lift of a flat plate is well ahead of the center of the plate (where the center of mass resides).\u00A0 The plate builds enough momentum to continue to flip through the stalled regime, until it starts to develop lift again with the other side up -- which supplies more lift ahead of the mass, and continues or increases the rotation (you could also see the plate as flying through a very tight loop, with its air-relative velocity always generally toward the leading edge, so that it never stalls).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t understand how a bullroarer can reverse its rotation and still lift upward, however -- by the time the rotation has built up some speed, the Magnus effect contributes substantially to the total lift, and reversing the rotation ought to drive the paddle into the ground.\u00A0 Perhaps if the second view of the lift (flying through tight loops very rapidly) is correct, the loops can reverse and produce near-zero net lift, so the force of the cord holds the thing up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe noise comes from pressure excursions as the airflow over the plate changes rapidly -- sometimes the pressure is very high on one side, and very low on the other; other times, it\u0027s nearly the same.\u00A0 This will cyclically alter the pressure (which is the definition of sound), and since this is happening only a few tens of times per second, the pitch of the resulting sound is quite low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-06T23:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

behaves essentially as a thin airfoil. The important things to note are that if a thin airfoil travels at an angle to the incoming airflow, it will generate lift, and therefore, a pressure difference. That pressure difference depends on the angle to the flow. Secondly, the center of pressure is not at the center of the airfoil. It\u0027s one quarter from the leading edge. Since bullroarer is attached near the central axis, the pressure causes an instability. With no other forces present, that instability would cause the airfoil to bob back and forward, but once it is already spinning, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMagnus Effect\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0tips the balance, and the instability keeps increasing the rotation speed until the twist in the chord is sufficient to overcome it.
