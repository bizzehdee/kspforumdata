The accepted answer for a Kerbin launch requires 4500 m/s so the gravity turn will require 3000 m/s = 4500 m/s - 1500 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you\u0027re still around you\u0027ll probably be interested in specifics about the methodology. Obviously, this is pretty easy. Design a single stage ship with just enough fuel to get it past the 12km lower atmospheres bar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/kD8ngkv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[RESIZE=720]\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kD8ngkv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kD8ngkv.png\u0022\u003E[/RESIZE]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecipe: 6x OX-STAT solar panels (top and bottom) above a Stayputnik pod. Below that we add 3x Z-200 battery rings. Below that a TR-18A decoupler. Below that a FL-T100 fuel tank with Lv-909 engine. The atmosphere Isp for the LV-909 is 300 s. Then add another 6x Z-100 batteries. The total mass is 1.28 and the dry mass is 0.78. The stage delta-v is 1450 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI happened to conduct this research before I saw Scott Manley\u0027s adjustment video for gravity turn tutorials and learned that my target of waiting for barometric pressure to drop to 10% at 11.7 km for starting a gravity turn is too late. I did more testing and discovered that 1200 m/s gets you up to 8 km and it is possible to complete a lazy (did not move prograde fast enough) gravity turn into a circular 75 km orbit with only 3100 m/s in the second stage. 3000 m/s is enough to put you mostly in orbit and yet keep your second stage from turning into space junk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
