The more up-to-date the distro, the better. Intel drivers are a combo of Xorg, Mesa, and Kernel parts, so all three need to be as up-to-date as possible for the best performance. For example, with Ubuntu 14.04 and my AMD R7 GPU, I had to use the FGLRX proprietary driver because I didn\u0027t have good success with the Radeon open source driver. Earlier this week I changed to Manjaro which has near bleeding-edge stuff; now I can use the Radeon driver with no issues and it\u0027s just as fast as my previous Ubuntu setup (ahem, technically Mint) with a proprietary driver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of what ya do, those HD4000\u0027s aren\u0027t know to be the best on Linux, but with some reduced graphics settings and updating Xorg, Mesa, and Kernel as much as you can, you might get some better performance.

I decided to add Ubuntu to my Windows 8.1 box (finished as of this morning), and while I am 99% sure I finally got it all patched together using Bumblebee and Primus, the terrain still seems very rough, which as far as I can tell, is because there\u0027s no anti-aliasing. I\u0027ve even gotten to NVIDIA settings (using optirun nvidia-settings -c :8, because regular nvidia-settings breaks Bumblebee) and set 4xSS, 2xMS, and 4x anisotropic filtering. The only two possibilities I can think of are that those over-ride settings aren\u0027t getting properly read, or I\u0027m not properly setting OpenGL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteam launch options: %LD_PRELOAD=\u0022libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1\u0022 __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 ./KSP.x86_64% \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bPoKCCw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bPoKCCw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-18T21:40:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2014 09:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMostly fixed own issue.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skeevy","CreatedById":110477,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T15:58:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Starman4308 AND \u003Cstrong\u003ESTEAM LINUX USERS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the problems with running KSP through Steam is you\u0027re forced to use old Ubuntu 12.xx libraries. Running KSP directly, with a script, or in a way that doesn\u0027t involve starting it with Steam will force KSP to use your system libraries which are more up-to-date than the ones shipped with Steam. Some Linux distros like Manjaro have a steam-native package that tweaks Steam so all Steam games use your system libraries instead of the ones packaged with Steam (they also have a Steam compatibility mode allowing you to run Steam using its libraries for the tiny amount of games that like Steam libraries...it\u0027s like 2 or 3 games from what I\u0027ve seen, KSP isn\u0027t one of them). \u003Cem\u003EI suspect this right here is why Linux Steam users seem to have a lot more issues than Linux KSP Store users\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically for Starman4308 and/or Nvidia Optimus users\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooked up that Nvidia Optimus/Bumblebee stuff.

I\u0027ve modified my KSP start script to do this for ya. Just make a file in the ksp directory called \u0022ksp.sh\u0022, copy/paste the below into it, and set it to be executable (either in the right click properties menu or in a terminal with \u0022chmod \u002Bx /path/to/ksp.sh\u0022).

If you\u0027re not bothered by the terminal or having to learn a bit, Manjaro Linux is a good way to get a very up-to-date desktop going. It\u0027s a little rough around the edges and requires a few terminal fixes from time to time, but it is fast, comes with Steam, has a steam-native package (highly recommended), and you\u0027ll be able to use the Arch Linux Wiki as your guide book (Arch Linux Wiki is one of the best sources of Linux information there is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also read that Nvidia Optimus can have issues when dynamically switching from Intel to Nvidia. One method of fixing those is to completely disable the Intel GPU and run it as straight Nvidia, though you will lose some power savings (if that matters to you); reread your post and that\u0027s what you did...Look into Arch Linux or Manjaro if you want to take advantage of Prime/Bumblebee/Optimus.
