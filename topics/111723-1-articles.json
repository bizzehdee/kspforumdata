I had just launched a capsule and returned it and had splashed down, when i noticed some **odd lights**.\n\nNormally the lights I see are PlanetShine flares, and the Skybox, but this was slightly odder.\n\nThe lights were *rotating* like people dancing around a campfire. It was in a triangular formation and was rotating about *20rpm*. It was odd as i never noticed it that way. Usually planets dont line up that way. The first thought that came into my mind was ; I had time acceleration on.\n\nI checked and the *time acceleration was 1x*. I even checked if there were any planets that i might have been seeing. To my disbelief, *there were no planets, except Eeloo*, in my way. (I had flares for eeloo turned down all the way so it was really hard to spot it.)\n\nI went into IVA to zoom in, and **i found a dark triangle rotating. Yes, a dark triangle.** \n\nI am not even slightly joking with you.\n\nI noticed that it was somewhere in the sky, about 20km high up, so I used the camera angles to try and get as close as possible.I zoomed out as much as possible and eventually got \u0022close\u0022\n\nto this object. My computer usually handles KSP very well, but it got so laggy when viewing the object from the angle.\n\nMy computer crashed when i tried to zoom in even further. I had not encountered it since yesterday.\n\n**I did not have a crash log as my computer went blue screen.**\n\n**Here is the image album.**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/yI4OC)\n\n**Here\u0027s a little backstory.** **(Sorry if i get slightly inaccurate with science)**\n\nI have heard, in many \u0022crazy\u0022 sources on the internet, some from UFO Hunters, that several species of aliens can manupilate magnetic fields. Most of our chips use silicon transitors to store and calculate data. Our batteries have transformers which uses magnetic fields to generate ac current. The ac current can be easily changed to a certain voltage. With the correct precision change, each individual electron can be directed to the transistors.\n\nSome species such as the greys have been known to manupilate stored data using their craft, without direct contact. I know it is ironic that greys are manupilating a game with talking green men, but it is a slight possibility.\n\nHas anyone encountered what i have encountered? I hope the devs made this an easter egg, because i don\u0027t want to play KSP with a possibility of an alien invasion.(which may be unlikely).\n\nAgain the fact that i have played KSP for 4 years and only encountered this yesterday scares me. **If anyone knows what the problem is, please help me out.**"},{"CreatedByName":"Akinesis","CreatedById":71042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T11:19:33Z","Content":"\\*Grabs tinfoil hat and sits in a closet\\*\n\nI believe...\n\nSeriously, though. I see light artifacts all the time. I have the exact three mods that you mentioned installed, too. The usual one I get is a cluster of dancing lights following my vessel and then they will eventually vanish.\n\nI think I can very safely say that this is NOT SQUAD, AVP or planet shine. So it could be a DOE easter-eggy bit-o-fun. Or it could be a glitch.
