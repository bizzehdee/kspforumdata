An engine is just a matter of a few numbers: fuel consumption, mass flow rate, total temperature and total pressure (later 2 are just magic numbers for a given combustion and shouldn\u0027t change based on engine shape, they are only influenced by the materials and how well the burn process occurs)\u00A0and mechanical nozzle shape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose determine the effective exhaust velocity (= specific impulse * 9.81) at different places in the atmosphere)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv_e = v_actual_exhaust\u00A0 \u002B (p_e - p_a) * A_e / (m_flow)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\np_a the atmospheric pressure (here we notice why an engine performs worse at sea level than in space) and A_e the exit area of the nozzle bell (and m_flow the total mass flow). - Oh and obviously the total weight (larger bell = more material etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwith p_e the pressure at nozzle exit, and v_actual_exhaust the actual velocity at nozzle exit. For supersonic nozzles (all engines except juno I think?) this is quite easy: You have two areas of importance, A_e (exit area) and A* (critical area, smallest area, here the flow reaches the speed of sound, before mach 1 a nozzle that becomes smaller increases flow velocity, after mach 1 increasing the size increases velocity but for ksp one could consider the mach 1 point as magical and only design the rest of the bell procedural).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose last two are a bit finecky to calculate, as those depend on the exit mach number.
