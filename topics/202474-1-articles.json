This works perfectly, the first picture is an image of what it looks like starting a new sandbox save (im using some other mods too, also screenshotted). However when in a new science mode or sandbox mod save, the screen is completely black as shown in my second picture. Going into any building like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or Tracking Station is fine, but when I back out again its broken still.\u003Cbr\u003E\nhttps://imgur.com/a/fbp4ovh\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is the files for my mod.\u003Cbr\u003E\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ckus0eleem0y5u7/PikaEnhancements.7z?dl=0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I was trying to change the science values but it wasn\u0027t working. Do I need to put splashed down data values even if the planet doesnt have oceans?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
