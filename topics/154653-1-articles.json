If I\u0027m in orbit and set a maneuver node over the point of impact, when I drag retrograde the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t hit the surface. Wherever the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E started in the orbit, it winds up directly over the point of impact, but will never touch the surface. My \u0022orbit\u0022 would drop straight down onto the surface when my retrograde burn exactly matches my orbital velocity. But that doesn\u0027t seem like a safe landing since it\u0027s not leaving anything to cancel the speed gained by falling. What am I missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-07T22:16:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe\u0027s talking about one step further than you are already -- after you have burned some to get out of orbit:\u00A0when you are already suborbital, with your impact point at your selected landing site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen when you are creating\u00A0the maneuver node, you have\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Aps.

Not that I\u0027m autolanding my crafts, but I let mechjeb do\u00A0the calculations. In a custom made screen I can readout the time of impact and how many seconds before or after the suicide burn is completed. When the suicide burn gives me 30 seconds, it means I\u0027ll hover over the certain planet about 30 seconds before impact, when it says -5 seconds, it means my suicide burn is completed after touchdown. So it will be a rough landing or a crash.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis method is very useful when you have a very limited delta-v or limited ignitions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you\u0027re against mechjeb \u0027because you think it\u0027s to cheaty\u0027, you can make it as cheaty as you want. Personally I never use the autolander or other autopilots.
