I\u0027m currently developing a mod, but i\u0027m still struggling to find the appropiate License, i suppose that a CC-BY-NC-ND License will make it much more restrict to any community patch? but a CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 will make things like that happen, but it will risk my textures use on other mods. Which one is apropiate for my Planet Pack and my Visual Mod?\n\u003E \n\nDo you want to restrict derivative works, or not? The \u0022ND\u0022 license means that nobody can use parts of your mod for another mod. The \u0022SA\u0022 license means that they can, but that if they do, they have to use the same license.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 minutes ago, Venusian Explorer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1.

It\u0027s the right thing to do, and is the best way to *\u003Cu\u003Ehelp\u003C/u\u003E* them.  Reporting them doesn\u0027t \u0022get them in trouble\u0022.\n\nRemember, folks:  **Filing a report on a post is not *\u003Cu\u003Epejorative\u003C/u\u003E*.**  A report does not mean \u0022this is bad\u0022 or \u0022this person is doing evil\u0022.  It simply means \u0022hey moderators, take a look at this, please\u0022.  A newbie who is clueless about the rules is an excellent example of someone who *\u003Cu\u003Eneeds some help\u003C/u\u003E*, and so reporting is absolutely the right thing to do.  It\u0027s no different from calling 911 if you see a kid who\u0027s stuck up in a tree.\n\n\u0022Clueless newbie colors outside the lines\u0022 is a thing that happens *\u003Cu\u003Eall the time\u003C/u\u003E*.  It always has, and it\u0027s no big deal.  We moderators know this, and remember, we\u0027re here to *\u003Cu\u003Ehelp\u003C/u\u003E*.  It\u0027s why we signed up for the job.  Users don\u0027t get in trouble for making an innocent mistake-- anyone can goof, we understand this.\n\nSo in a case like this, typically what happens is:\n\n1. we see the report\n2. we go tidy up the problem in question\n3. we drop the person a friendly note along the lines of \u0022hi, welcome to the forum, by the way we see that you did X over here, we understand you mean well but the [rules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/guidelines/) say not to so please don\u0027t do that; please don\u0027t worry, you\u0027re not in any trouble, hope you have fun here\u0022\n\n(Someone who *\u003Cu\u003Erepeatedly\u003C/u\u003E* does the same out-of-bounds things despite being told not to would be a different matter, of course, but most of the time that doesn\u0027t come up.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2/23/2022 at 7:12 PM, ColdJ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Are there regular sweeps through the pages by moderators to catch these sort of posts?\n\u003E \n\nNot really, no.  There are only a small handful of us, we\u0027re part-time volunteers who have IRL stuff to deal with and do this only as a hobby.  We simply don\u0027t have the bandwidth to *\u003Cu\u003Emonitor\u003C/u\u003E* the forums-- we never have, and we don\u0027t even try, for the most part.\n\nWe *\u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E* notice stuff on our own from time to time, but only because we\u0027re forum users too, just like you.  If I\u0027m browsing the forums and I just happen to notice something amiss, I file a report (to share it with the team) and then we move from there, sure.  But for the most part, we\u0027re heavily dependent on reports from users.  You good folks have several orders of magnitude more eyeballs than we do, and there\u0027s simply no way we can compare to that.\n\nIn short:  if you don\u0027t report it, there\u0027s a pretty good chance we won\u0027t see it.  Which means the person will probably keep repeating that behavior because they don\u0027t know any better.  Which will annoy people, more and more, until people start angrily lashing out at the clueless person, and then everyone loses and the newbie feels bad.  It becomes a whole sorry mess that could have been easily and amicably avoided if the newbie had gotten a friendly helping hand right at the start.\n\nSo, yes, please report.  It helps the person you\u0027re reporting, it helps the moderator team, and (indirectly) it helps everyone else in the forums."},{"CreatedByName":"Piatzin","CreatedById":166940,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-04T20:53:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2/23/2022 at 5:18 PM, AtomicTech said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The question we all want answered, Why is [@Vanamonde](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/)\u0027s profile picture an overly saturated banana?\n\u003E \n\nI still see it as a regular yellow banana, never got used to this new deep fried scary movie banana"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-05T14:54:40Z","Content":"why\u0027re a number of post/topics missing?"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-05T14:59:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 minutes ago, Random-E said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E why\u0027re a number of post/topics missing?\n\u003E \n\nYou need to be more specific.
