Also the Hi/Low/Surface altitudes could be shown in the same cell for that experimet (separated by colours). You should be able to customize the view by add or remove a body or a hardware from the view to make it fit the single screen (also fully pupulated view over single screen should be possible by using vertical/horizontal slider). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that after mission control implementaton there could be a missions history archive whith posibilities to name a misson and save record stats for that mission (when you end the flight the button save a report to archive could be present for those who would like) notably how much science and from which locations were accomplished but maybe some extended data like how much weight was put to orbit, what was the mision duration and maximum Gforce etc. If the science is brought back from manned missions the kerbal heroes could achive a medal (if he is a bada55 :-)) and be recorded to personal kerbal statistic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that in the future there can be an online chart of top achievments and you could compare your play skill to different players.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
