It\u0027s part of a whole system that the community managers have to filter out spammers, trolls, and other ne\u0027er-do-wells. Once you\u0027ve posted around a bit and the mods lift your restrictions, you\u0027ll be able to upload your avatar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if you need any help with any of the harder bits of the game, or if you just want to sharpen your skills, I\u0027d highly recommend you check out the Drawing Board (link in my sig), which has a number of tutorials and other useful links. You can also ask questions in the How To forums, where many knowledgeable people should be able to provide the answers you need. Just have a look around, and jump into any conversation that interests you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hatsune_Neko","CreatedById":67460,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T08:15:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eahh\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell dankies for the update then =(^.^)=\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand yep trying to figure out the new update,, seams to have broken most of my mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI lost all my heavy lifters!!
