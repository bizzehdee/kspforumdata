Be sure to set your struts (specifically EAS-4 Strut connectors) to run from what you\u0027re decoupling to what you\u0027ve coupled them to, or else the struts won\u0027t vanish when you hit the decoupler and you might wind up with a catastrophic mission failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond question: possible to stack solid rocket boosters so they act as one? Yes - use stack decouplers before you put on the second set. Is it advisable to build a rocket this way? Not really. With SRBs you get the most bang for your buck right at launch - they help get the rest of your rocket going. After you\u0027re airborne, liquid fuel stages are more efficient. They also have throttle control; adjusting the throttle is how you get a good fuel-optimal ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T22:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStruts break automatically when you decouple/undock in exactly the way that you would want them to. I\u0027ve never had any trouble with them not disconnecting in the way that capi3101 describes (because of the direction of the strut install, that is.) The best reason to install from the child object to the parent is that the strut part is lost when the child decouples. This helps keep your part count down with very large vehicles and in the long run can help the game run more smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
