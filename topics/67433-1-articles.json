(\u0022Why not use an EVA pack?\u0022 I did. When I finished rolling, I was 30 kilometers away.)

At the minimum, there would be a button that makes the Kerbal walk in a straight line (as though \u0027w\u0027 was being held down), but the ability to set in coordinates or--better yet--a target for the kerbal to walk to would be nice.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EDoes anyone with sufficient programming knowledge feel like attempting this?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T16:27:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be useful (I just have a walk on the mountains, don\u0027t want to use timewarp to avoid a potential kerbal \u0022auto-explosion\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GavinZac","CreatedById":68719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T04:34:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like a click-to-move for Kerbals on the surface.
