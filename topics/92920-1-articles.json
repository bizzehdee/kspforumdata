Just thought it might be a handy little thing to have. Any ideas on how someone might make one? I\u0027m just now learning how to get the parts I created into the game but I am still learning how to make config files. I assume it would be a lot like the KAS winches with a little grappling hook on the end to attach to things. Any ideas on where to start?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T14:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStart with the Kerbal flying away from whatever you aimed the grappling gun at....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Sorry, HAD to.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how to help beyond suggesting you\u0027d probably wind up using KAS for both the gun and for the grappling logic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut don\u0027t forget Newton when you design it--my admittedly flippant comment has more than a grain of truth in it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
