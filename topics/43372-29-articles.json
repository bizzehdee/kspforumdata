Its to big of a leap. I know coming from a massive space enthusiast, and someone who almost applied himself, and still may in the future if some success is seen, it is still to ambitious. I agree that NASA, with its government funding has been going to slow with this mission, but jumping straight to a colonial mission from the get go, sending people to never return, is a little out there. They could just as easily develop a Mars Direct style mission to go along with their current goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A non return mission. I hit a little bit of this on my first point. But I feel that the most important part of having a mars mission, is the return, not for the glory, or fame, but for science, and for those doing the mission. Although as we have seen that there are several people willing to spend the rest of their lives on Mars, I do not see them lasting as long as they hope to under the current mission plan. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Not having secured a launcher\u002Bdate. This is a big one. There are only so many launch vehicles capable of sending their payloads to Mars, and you can only Launch at a certain time to get there. Not having either pre set up \u003Cstrong\u003Ebefore\u003C/strong\u003E selecting crew is a risking move. And as anyone who plays KSP knows, risks are apparent in space travel, but never should you risk it on a launch vehicle, or date before you select your crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The kind of people this attracts. Specifically for the astronaut selection. Two kinds of people have come out of the woodwork. Failed astronauts, or people who dreamed of space travel, but due to physical, mental, or psychological reasons, where unable to. To clarify, when I say mental reasons, I mean they didn\u0027t have the grades. It also brings out fame seekers. Those who just want it for the glory of having their name remembered. Now, based on this list, who is most likely to get selected. Fame seekers are. They are not gonna be the people, who really want to die on Mars. It was a in the moment decision to sign up, and if selected, they have until that rocket leaves the ground to change their mind. Which they won\u0027t do because of all the media attention. They are going to be proud, gloating and seem all ready to go, but under the pressure of the real thing, will break the easiest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Self Sustainability. An important part of developing a colony is having self sustainable life support, food, water and electricity. Most of which are not possible on a large enough scale that Mars one is proposing. It may seem small. but once again, they have no launch vehicle and no launch date. I remember nasa had announced the launch of Orion on an \u003Cstrong\u003Eorbital\u003C/strong\u003E mission over one year ahead of the launch. I now the launch date for curiosity was selected long before construction even began. So since it is obvious the crew has to have supply, not only does the mission not have how they are going to deliver supplies to the crew, but they have no time plan from when certain supplies are going. Now they may say they are going to use the Falcon heavy. If they are, than they need to begin developing the supply drops at the \u003Cstrong\u003Esame time\u003C/strong\u003E as they are developing the manned missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall right now the plan seems to have been developed based on the SpaceX dragon promotional video showing the Dragon as capable of landing on Mars with it\u0027s draco engines. Then the rest of the mission designed around it. While it is a good plan, it is incomplete, especially with the time frame they have set up. So in conclusion. No I don\u0027t think its a scam. I just don\u0027t have absolute confidence in them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T05:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Albert VDS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Albert VDS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECuriosity already has a self driving capability.

I do think the idea of one way trips to mars are in fact something we should consider. Britain for example sent one way colonies to the Americas, many of which failed. Back then the value of human life was cheap and people had little concern with losing whole colonies of dozens of people for conquest/progress.
