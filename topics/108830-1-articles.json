I haven\u0027t tested this enough, nor have I had enough time to test this out or get that far in career mode myself.\n\nI would argue that picking up the science data manually with say a plane is a whole another mission in itself. And time wise I would rather dock with a station around Kerbin to deal with the data there. But that might not be possible as it takes more planning and Delta-V to rendezvous with the station in orbit. \n\nI also am curious as to how the Science Per day is affected in general. Its one of those new features that is more or less shrouded in mystery with little talk on how it really works."},{"CreatedByName":"Kevin Wing","CreatedById":143784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T23:05:41Z","Content":"The value an experiment has as data in a science lab depends on where it is converted into data.\n\nSo, by steps:\n\nStep 1, do experiment\n\nStep 2, move experiment to lab\n\nStep 3, convert experiment into lab data using the green bubbly flask icon\n\nStep 4, do science (aka wait/warp)\n\nStep 5, transmit science home.\n\nKey bits:\n\nIn Step 3, when you click that flask the Data value of the experiment depends on what planet you are on when you click it. If it is on Kerbin it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s tiny, other places have more value. Also if the experiment is processed on the planet it was taken on it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s worth more data. And, if the MPL is on the surface it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s worth more data than if it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s processed in orbit (except on Kerbin, the opposite there).\n\nAlso, the lab can only hold 500 data at a time, so you may hold experiments to process at a later date. Since you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t convert all the science to data at once I let it sit on the ship for a long time. So it is ready when I need it. Usually by then I can have the data back home and end up never transmitting the experiment.\n\nWhat I do is land a MPL, and a separate ship that does science, doing two of every experiment, then sending one of them to the MPL and returning the other home. I do this with an extra pod on the lander, so I can store two copies of everything.\n\nWhat I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to test but have not tested yet, is if you process an experiment on one MPL then transfer it to another, can you process it again for data?\n\nHope that helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Xaver","CreatedById":46640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T23:16:39Z","Content":"I had read in the wiki that you get higher values when the lab is on the surface of a celestial body except kerbin.
