My name is Jack Raiden(Anonymously). It\u0027s Japanese for \u0022Thunder And Lightning\u0022. It describes my personality, pretty much. Fast, and with one strike. I am an administrator on the extremely popular Garry\u0027s Mod DarkRP server KDGaming(server #1). It was a long journey to administrator, but I made it after a lot of hard work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started playing KSP a while ago. I saw jacksepticeye play it and I was mind-blown. I wanted a game like this when I was 5 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E but I bought it, version 0.23.5 and had a lot of fun. I then got bored, and found out about MODS! :DDDD so then I started experimenting with so much stuff, and was amazed by the community\u0027s insight. I mean, theoretically, I thought of an inertial fusion engine, but it\u0027s pretty cool to see it in action. The factor of neutron radiation was factored in as well, and I was amazed. This was only the interstellar one, and the surface was unscratched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never updated because I never felt like it. Couldn\u0027t be bothered re-installing my addons(when I got more). But then, just this Christmas, I decided to buy 0.90 because it was in the sale. I was yet again, amazed. I soon, again, got a bit bored and thus downloaded mods. These just frustrated me but when I got them to work I had a lot of fun. And that\u0027s the story so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to join KDGaming, check out \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kdgaming.org\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETHIS\u003C/a\u003E link to the website/forums. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kdgaming.org/profile/11687376\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHERE\u003C/a\u003E is my forum account.
