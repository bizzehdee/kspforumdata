They live in small Hitchhiker, they like view for an ocean, long sandy beach, but they cant fully enjoy it. Normally they are best friends, but if they are living in the same room for a longer period of time, they start to yell on each other for no reason. Jebediah is eating all the snacks, Bill is farting all the time and Bob is watching his favourite soap opera. Last time Bill tried to kill Jeb by slapping him with a chocolate bar. Soooo situation is really bad as you see.... If they could just have a little bigger house with you know... a TV, a fridge with some cold beer inside, and huge cozy sofa in the middle of that. What do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS.
