With the Whiplash and some basic rockets you can get very far, as others already pointed out. The trick is to make the rest of your aircraft as efficient as possible, as well as the flight trajectory.\u003Cp\u003EThis one is now my main workhorse. It\u0027s ideal for rescue missions, space station missions, or missions involving some small probe. The craft is very stable, and easy to fly. In a 90x90 orbit I have mostly around 400 m/s left, which is enough for most LKO maneuvers. With a refuel from a space station, this plane gets you anywhere in the Kerbin system. Note: you can easily turn this into a cargo plane by swapping out the passenger cabin and docking port for a cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hf0wQIx.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/hf0wQIx.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is how you do it\u0022 DaMaster.
