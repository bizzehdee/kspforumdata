Players seemed to have gobbled up the new content and I wonder if they are now just waiting for the next little bit to be released or for their bugs to be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this because KSP2 no longer feels like a sandbox, and the mission system actually causes play to stop when the final missions have been completed? Or is it because for us in early access we have been playing with KSP2 now for nearly a year and there is only so much anyone can do over that time before it is repetitive, especially with the limited toys to play with and the mission based system in place. In my opinion, KSP2 seems a lot \u0027easier\u0027 than KSP1 and for someone who barely left Kerbin and certainly never visited the Jool moons, in KSP2 I have been to all planets and most moons. Yes I could farm every biome but that seems like a chore rather than a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking even longer term, when the official final release is here, those with EA may simply play the little bit of new content, maybe have a full run through again, and then stop playing. Will this have a negative impact on player numbers and if the final release doesn\u0027t do well because of this, will that have a knock on effect with KSP2 long long term?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully things start to get released quicker and quicker as bugs are ironed out and the amount of work left gets less which will stop the above happening.
