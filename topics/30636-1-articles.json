I have finally have hed some time to play KSP so I did the rescue mission tonight. I though of documenting and sharing for posterity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is Jeb who seems happy they are finally coming to get him out of there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Iv2zaeM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Iv2zaeM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the LMK1 (launcher mark one) collapsed on itself starting with the central commend pod I fixed it a little so here is My lander Mark3 (has mark one and two had the obvious problem Jeb encountered when the engine exploded upon landing) with its launcher. Its a 2 man crew with some space to spare for Jeb in case he needs to come back with this, but I am planning something else, you will see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1CBFywe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221CBFywe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting that baby into orbit is a charm and I bet its very overkill for a trip to the Mun. But that\u0027s a good thing it turns out, more on that later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I transfer to Mun and put myself on the same orbit then Jeb Re-entry pod still waiting in orbit and I notice its still very high on fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am very proud of landing barely 400m from Jeb\u0027s spot without Mechjeb or any mod that was not easy for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FxmPqUh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FxmPqUh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce Jeb is back into orbit with Edrim, they go and dock with Richgan who stayed behind in the crewmodule in orbit. Its then, looking at all the spare fuel I had left I got an idea. I docked with the dead shuttle left for Jeb\u0027s re-entry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WZjkkp0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WZjkkp0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfered most of its fuel onto the newly dubbed Odysseus and sent Jeb back home.
