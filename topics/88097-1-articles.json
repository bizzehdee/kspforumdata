It happened 3 or 4 times while landing a spaceplane just now (luckily had a quicksave), and eventually I gave up and put it down in the grass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1dyRsp0.png\u0022 alt=\u00221dyRsp0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZLa4ssS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZLa4ssS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c5XWHw1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c5XWHw1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T16:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWeiiiiiird.
