It is capable of achieving 4.6K dV in orbit, with the proper ascent profile. Designed as a stealth fighter, it is designed with a sleek small hard to spot profile, and it carries all weapons in an internal bomb bay that is only opened when firing, usually too late for anyone to react even if they detect it deploying weapons. As for weapons, it is normally geared to engage targets in space, and has 2 KDrone-M kinetic kill drones, accurate and potentially reuseable ordinance. It can always be fitted with atmospheric missiles, bombs, cannons, or whatever else fits inside the bomb bay alongside its fuel supplies. It also has just enough armor to protect against weaker ordinance, and it can often take some hits from non 80m/s impact missiles and survive with minor if any damage. These craft are available in some numbers to AKS, since they were very popular during the battle for Minmus, and their stealth technology allowed most of them to survive the battle, since B-Corp, AKS\u0027s rival had neither the technology to detect them from anything but point blank range, nor teh resources to try and hunt them down the old fashioned way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SK-CRV-Ig3 (middle):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of AKS\u0027s smaller mainstream combat vessels, it was developed as an alternate option to the SK-CRV-III geared more towards the anti-fighter role. Like its predecessor, the class-III, the class-I shares a very similar hull, but is shorter, simpler, and has weapons designed to deal with multiple smaller vessels, compared to the class-III and its Tripedoes that were specifically designed for the anti-capital ship role. Its weapons consist of 12 forward firing rail-cannons, very effective weapons against anything that does not posses heavy armor. Secondary weapons are 4 bays filled with either 1 1.2m weapon, or 4 0.6m weapons, that normally are equipped with KDrone-M and KDrone-S missiles, but can be rearmed with more powerful weapons if the need to fight capital ships arises. Armor is enough to stop most weak weapons, but it will fail against capital ship weapons, with continuous bombardment or a lucky shot capable of sawing the entire ship in half. The hull, while effective in the past, has seen its days, and this craft is only still in service due to the very low resources AKS has available after the 1st battle for Minmus, where B-Corp, although unsuccessful in wiping out the AKS fleet from orbit, B-Corp managed to take out all ground installations and mining facilities, limiting AKS\u0027s deployment of any new craft considerably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SK-CRV-Ig4 (left bottom):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA similar design to the older 3rd gen class-I corvette, this model features a slightly better hull layout that is simpler, cheaper, and has stronger armor, at the cost of loosing some of its firepower. It only has 6 forward firing rail-guns, alongside the usual secondary weapon options. It is considered to be superior to the older model, and even superior to the SK-CRV-III 3rd generation in protection (despite being smaller and having less redundancy). That said, while a great ship, very few of these are availeable, since AKS\u0027s enemies more or less destroyed the vast majority of production facilities, and the only ones that are available were those created during the last stages of the war for Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe VK-CV-I with 4 FK-100 micro-fighters (topmost craft):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small micro-carrier, that was developed by AKS as a sort of disposable carrier or fighter deployment ship, and that could always double up as a supply ship when the fighters were replaced by ammo and fuel. It is small, very simple, very cheap, and has 4 fighters (FK-100s), with 2 micro rail-guns each, and 4 KDrone-M kinetic kill drones as either its own weapons, reloads for a friendly ship that is low on anti-fighter munition, or whatever. As for the FK-100, it is an extremely primitive and simple craft that was created by copying a pirate designed vessel, and then modified to suit AKS\u0027s carriers and weapons. Its standard weapons consist of 2 micro rail-guns, are only effective against low-medium armor, and are completely useless against capital ships. More of a spammable fighter that was designed to be cheap, and overwhelm the enemy through numerical superiority rather then being superior one on one. The carriers are currently available in some numbers, and the fighters are also common enough and very quick to produce even with limited resources. This is about teh only ship AKS has access to reliably produce in its current state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, if you\u0027d like any of these in your movie, AKS is essentially sentient AI that would side with HKA, although pirates have obtained the plans for all vessels but the HK-201 and the SK-CRV-Ig4 (the 4th generation as there are very few of them). SK-CRV-Ig3 and the carrier/fighter thing can be availeabel on both sides as well, those were so common during the war on Minmus between AKS and B-Corp that pirates managed to steal some damaged ones, and repair them to near factory specs. SInce AKS is allied with SAP-C, and they are HKA side, AKS would also be allied there, but would have severely limited resources aside from their ability to hack near anything (including long range missiles given enough time), and the majority of their smaller craft have full or partial stealth capabilities. HK-201 and similar craft have full stealth making them only detectable at very close ranges (within 10km or so at a absolute max), and the VK-CV-I is partially stealthed, making is impossible to detect at say a low orbit if your scanning vessel is at a higher orbit or on the other side of planet or ect. All else would be normally detectable by conventional scanners.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways,m if you even implement AKS or any of their ships, only the carrier (and its fighters) or the SK-CRV-Ig3 is available in large amounts, the SK-CRV-Ig4 would be exclusive to AKS since they are very rare now, and the HK-201 would be availeable in some quantities, although it would only be sold to HKA in smallish amounts (like no more then 5-6 or so, although those few would be HKA craft and use HKA flags/pilots).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese craft can be obtained by going to my repository and into AKS Craft Here folder, and they all come with a launch stage that can get it to LKO at a bare minimum. Also, any craft that is either in the outdated folder, or in the Non-AKS Craft Here folder can be used in any amount by any side (as these are nolonger used by AKS, or werent ever used by AKS and can be bought on black market or even legally).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red- the Engineer","CreatedById":123304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T00:43:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo... all my submissions are now defunct with the no BD in space rule.

Only issue i have with stock weapons is that there are some that you just cannot defend against (if you want a guaranteed kill, ill upload my Tripedo-S/H missile, which is GUARANTEED to split anything it hist if you aim well). That said, its always fun to run around with nothing but ibeams and try to surgically remove the engines/weapons/critical components of a ship without outright vaporizing it (it seems that there were alot of quick easy kills in your last episode, perhaps consider using a little bit less of the super competitive missiles).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you would like any particular ship, i would be glad to do requests (say class of ship, relative armor protection, ect).
