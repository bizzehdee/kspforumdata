I have been playing KSP for a few months off and on. I have played with the demos for a while and got a good feel for it. I finally broke down and bought the game the other day. I was overwhelmed with how much more parts you get I about felt the same as I did when I first played the demo.

Safety is the upmost importance with my Space program and i will never send a kerbal to another planet unless i know he can come back again.
