Any idea what the heck happened? I was about to click \u0022jump to ship\u0022 via Kerbal Alarm Clock. The conics all disappeared and all of my ships disappeared and everything was reading 0000000000000.... etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI close out of my game clicking the X and now everything is back to normal. Well, save for the contracts, and my contract archives. All of which have completely vanished! Gone! I even had a tourism mission and now I have a bunch of useless tourists sitting in my crew roster (anyway on how to just remove them from the game without killing them, lest I lose a bunch of rep?). I have built several mission craft, most of which are generally useless. Please help me understand this. I hope I am not the only one who has been struck by this. I managed to \u0022save\u0022 some of my contracts via debug menu by replicating similar contracts I had (the explore contracts, namely), but still a little confused. At the same time, I am kind of happy I don\u0027t need to do some of the certain contracts... but still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-04T08:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s another thread already where multiple people have reported this.

You just have to copy and paste the contract information from when everything was okay to your most recent save. Having a program like Notepad\u002B\u002B makes this a great deal easier. Open the save with the contracts intact find the contracts section (Ctrl \u002B F, of course). In order to collapse the stuff inside the curly brackets go Language \u0026gt; C\u002B\u002B and then click on the minus symbol shown in the screenshot below. Save as a new file called \u0022attempted contract fix.sfs\u0022 and load it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vC9NdQ3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vC9NdQ3.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228DFGAXb.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8DFGAXb.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-04T09:14:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2016 09:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
