Anyway, couldn\u0027t it be viable to synchronize players relative to the body which they are influenced by? Time warp is a big issue, that has been established. If a player is to warp time, the planets on that client will be unsynchronized with the other clients\u0027 planets, right? However, the planet itself does not ever change. We could treat each planet as a \u0027room\u0027 with the boundaries determined by its sphere of influence, for example. The player(s) who enter the sphere of influence of that planet (or within a certain distance of it) will be synchronized with other players, and should they timewarp whilst in this \u0027room\u0027, it will just look like they are moving faster, like in the video. Their position would be stored local to the planet to make things simpler to synch. Obviously things such as time of day etc will not be synchronized, though the idea of playing with friends etc could still be achieved. I didn\u0027t spend long thinking about this so it might be flawed... It\u0027s just an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Not sure if I made this clear, but it would not matter if the planets\u0027 positions were not synchronized. If each planet is treated as a room, someone sitting on that planet would just be able to see other players entering that room. I find it hard to describe this. Let\u0027s say a player creates a ship and heads towards the Mun. He flies close enough to have an encounter with the Mun. His client will then tell the server that he is joining the \u0027Mun Room\u0027 and so the server will send him information about any other players who are also in the \u0027Mun Room\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-29T14:51:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2013 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by luckruns0ut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CARROTSAREAWSOME","CreatedById":61645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T14:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dimmy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dimmy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, as i read, you almost understand what i mean. =)\u003Cp\u003EBut i mean something other: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Imagine that you using xenon engine (too slow for speeding up) and JUST starting warp to play to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Imaging that you left 1 minute of fling to Duna (it needs 20 minutes more to go to Duna in warp mode)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I created my ship at the time you decided to warp, but with a lot of liquid engines for fast speed up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I set my orbit to intercept your ship while it is in warp!
