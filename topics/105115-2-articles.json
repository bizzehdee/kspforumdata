I see nothing in this release to make it fundamentally different than any previous. Sure, there may be more features than average, but that makes it bigger rather than different. Since there is no real difference in the process, I expect no more than I did from previous releases. The longstanding bugs will remain (ie the ones we are so used to we don\u0027t notice anymore). Some recent bugs will have been squashed, but there will also be new ones. There will be no \u0027balanced\u0027 gameplay, nor will the aero physics deserve to be called aerodynamics. It\u0027s just another features update.\u003Cp\u003EFrom watching the view numbers on Youtube and other social media, I don\u0027t think I am alone in this opinion.

How someone can cram that many bugs into one game is, and will remain a mystery. Still, it hit the shelves and even today it is being played (not bad at all for a game that old that buggy).

How someone can cram that many bugs into one game is, and will remain a mystery. Still, it hit the shelves and even today it is being played (not bad at all for a game that old that buggy). Ok so DF is at one extreme end of the scale but which major game was ever released totally bug free, which would be the other extreme end of the scale? I can\u0027t think of one. I just think it\u0027s ludicrous to judge a game (or the developers) by whether or not it\u0027s bug free. Instead, what matters is, will they fix the bugs when they surface? So far everything points to yes, they will.

Even patching bugs often leads to new ones. The best possible action for them to take is to release the game and then patch any major bugs as soon as possible - in other words, do what every other developer does with their games today.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T09:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, am I happy with the product as it has been portrayed and what will be available in 1.0? The answer is an easy yes. I feel I\u0027ve already gotten my moneys worth out of the game several times over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I feel that 1.0 is as good as it can be? The answer is no. Not enough places to explore, lack of clouds, lack of unity 5 and 64 bit. Granted mods can fix some of these things that I consider lacking from the game but overall, I get the impression that there is things that they wanted to add to the \u0022final\u0022 game but are not going to make the cut when it releases later. The fact that big things are being added later kind of shows that it isn\u0027t a finished product.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
