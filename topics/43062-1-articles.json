Outside its SoI you can still feel the gravitational force from that body, it is just less than the gravitational force from the body in whose SoI you are. A body\u0027s gravitational field goes out to infinity, it just decreases in intensity with distance. For example, some satellites in Earth orbit have to take into account Jupiter\u0027s gravitational influence for long term stability, even though they\u0027re nowhere near Jupiter\u0027s SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe formula for the size of a body\u0027s SoI is r_SOI = a * ( m / M ) ^ (2/5), where a is the semimajor axis of that body, m is the mass of the body, and M is the mass of whatever it\u0027s orbiting.

I expected to see some small orbital perturbations out past the edge of the moon\u0027s SOI, but I kept seeing it change my perigee all the way out until I was 80% of the way back to Earth. My perigee started at something like -160km at the moon\u0027s SOI and ended up at about \u002B200km by the time I got very close to Earth. Some of this, I\u0027m sure was because my return trajectory was in a prograde direction relative to the Earth, so the moon was sort of \u0022following\u0022 my vessel as I returned, but it still sort of shocked me that its influence was felt so far out. The Hill sphere of the moon has a radius of about 58,000 km, but I was seeing noticeable effects (e.g. missing instead of hitting the Earth) at 300,000 km away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I guess my point is that \u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022 is a term of art that simply means the body\u0027s gravity is dominant within. In KSP, the SOI is precise: not only does the primary body\u0027s gravity dominate, but it is the only gravity that has any influence at all. Lunar transfer, in particular (because the moon is so large and close relative to its primary), really shows the limits of the approximation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T16:40:49Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 04:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T17:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn a related note, I found an interesting essay titled \u003Ca href=\u0022http://history.nasa.gov/afj/launchwindow/lw1.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EApollo lunar landing launch window: The controlling factors and constraints\u003C/a\u003E on the NASA History Program Office\u0027s website.

In a 100 km low lunar orbit, the Moon\u0027s gravity is 1.45 m/s^2 and the Earth\u0027s gravity is 0.003 m/s^2, so the Moon is about 500 times more powerful than the Earth. At 60,000 km from the Moon and 320,000 km from the Earth, the Moon\u0027s gravity is 1.36 mm/s^2 and the Earth\u0027s gravity is 3.89 mm/s^2, so the Earth is about 2.9 times more powerful than the Moon.
