Larger bubble means larger volume of space that has to be filled with the right amount of energy to form the bubble. I don\u0027t know if scaling is actually going to be as bad as surface area.

But I\u0027m not 100% sure that it follows Alcubierre\u0027s scheme. I really should sit down and run through the math on the sub-light warp. But even with FTL warp, there is no proof that negative energy is required. It is a requirement of every known scheme, however, so it might actually be a fundamental requirement, but we don\u0027t know for sure yet. (Same deal with traversable wormholes, by the way.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, even if negative energy is a requirement, you really just have to have energy lower than vacuum energy. And you can achieve that by excluding field harmonics. Casimir Effect, etc. Think of it like a bubble in a liquid. It has positive mass, but lower than that of surrounding fluid, so it rises up, against gravity, as if it had negative mass. There are a whole lot of open questions there, but in principle, this should give us a loophole for building FTL warp drives and making wormholes traversable. There are a whole lot of new challenges with this approach, but at least we aren\u0027t dealing with total fiction here. We do have physics that describes \u0022negative\u0022 energy we need, and we do have physics that tells us how to arrange that energy to form a warp bubble. So, to some degree, it is an engineering problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, it\u0027s the sort of engineering problem that dwarfs pretty much every other technological challenge we are facing, but it\u0027s nice to know that FTL is at least not impossible. Kind of lets you hope for a better future than being stuck in this star system until extinction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that said, FTL Warp is way, way out of our league right now. Hydrogen fusion (the slow, controlled kind), sub-light warp, and even some limited gravity manipulation are a short list of techs we\u0027d have to hit long before we even seriously consider it. But limited experiments with sub-light could be done in our life-time. Not as a self-sustaining ship, but as tiny probes launched by enormous machines that will generate a warp bubble externally. I don\u0027t know about you, but for me, even a quantum dot moving along a particle accelerator beam at a turtle\u0027s pace, but under warp, without ever having to have undergone acceleration, would be an absolutely phenomenal achievement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically, we\u0027re further along with Quantum Teleportation than warp, but because of how the former scales, my money would still be on practical sub-light warp coming about first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T01:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry about the double-post, but in case anyone is still interested, I did run the numbers for sub-light Alcubierre drive. You end up with regions of negative energy density either way. However, the total amount of energy required scales with speed. So a \u0022slow\u0022 moving warp bubble is going to be much easier to organize than an FTL one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen a lot of literature mentioning that negative energy is only strictly required for FTL, though. I\u0027ll try to see if I can find a scheme that doesn\u0027t rely on negative energy for sub-light. There are a lot of parameters to play with. Perhaps, something as simple as a different shape for the bubble boundary could do it. And even if energy limits the top speed, the fact that ship experiences no acceleration as bubble accelerates still makes it worth investing research into.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
