All you need to tell it is how much space you want Linux to have, and it shrinks your windows partition down and creates the linux ones automagically. Gone are the early days of Linux where everything you wanted to do was command-line, and compiling programs yourself etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kamuchi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kamuchi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThen you have to install linux, doing it the easy way by letting it create it\u0060s own partitions, it will most likely whipe the windows partition (it\u0060s even a confirmed \u0022bug\u0022 again with the ubuntu installer).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny, I\u0027ve been using Linux for 20 years and I\u0027ve never had it wipe the windows partition unless I purposely did it myself. Can\u0027t confirm for sure that it\u0027s a false statement about Ubuntu because I use Kubuntu. But Kubuntu is pretty much the same as Ubuntu at the core of it, but it uses a GUI that I like much better. IMO Kubuntu using the KDE gui is more like Windows and Ubuntu using the Gnome gui is more like a Mac. I prefer the former.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpecTRe-X","CreatedById":126052,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T18:45:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo after a bit of experimenting this is what I\u0027ve come up with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERunning KSP in a VM linux resulted in usual CPU usage across 4 available cores, usual gfx card usage, good ram usage, and poor overall fps performance.
