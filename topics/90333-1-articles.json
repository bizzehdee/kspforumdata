Overnight I went from struggling with spaceplane design (a dozen or more flights into the drink or off to the side of the runway) to consistently successful designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I finally decided to go ahead and use the principles discussed in the guide to lift a payload. I had a probe design already - the Moneymaker 7 - which I was launching conventionally to fulfill FinePrint contracts; the probe is 12.21 tonnes. I\u0027ve learned that 25% is a good low-end payload fraction for a transporter spaceplane, so I set about designing one using DocMoriarty\u0027s principles for a plane that weighed 48.84 tonnes (i.e. four times the mass of the payload.

There are a total of twenty Delta Wing/Wing Connector As plus a Cargo Bay - looking at that just now the design apparently is a little light on lift (the numbers say 22). 6 ailerons, 6 elevons, 6 elevators, 5 rudders and a pair of canards. Five Reaction Stabilizers in the cargo bay. Fuel requirements in the side tanks are as close as I can get them. The plane was reasonably balanced (.06 meters difference upwards) prior to the addition of the forward tri-couplers and the last six Ram Intakes - with those additions the CoM moves forward .1 meter. From the screenshots you can see the final design is actually slightly less than 48 tonnes, so it manages a better than 25% payload fraction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I\u0027ve got - and this has been consistent for a couple of flights now - is that the plane doesn\u0027t get much above 27k and 1500 m/s before it switches over. Further, once switchover occurs, the RAPIERs have a tendency to overheat to the point of exploding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Guide says this design should work, so at this point I\u0027m open for suggestions. Anybody have any ideas why I\u0027m getting such lousy performance from the plane? For reference, I\u0027m flying stock with aerodynamics.
