But I miss something, all challenges and designs for a mini SSTO rocket are for older versions of KSP like the monopropellant and ion minirockets wich could go to Mun and back. But because the new version I want to challenge everyone to build the smallest SSTO. I\u0027m just very curious wich other designs you guys have got.\n\nAnd by smallest I mean measured by weight. (Part count doesnt matter)\n\n5 rules:\n\n- challenge is only for the 0.90 version \n\n- no mods (and cheats)\n\n- it has to orbit Kerbin\n\n- weight has to be in three decimals precisely\n\n- total weight has to include the given weight of \u0027massless\u0027 parts (shown in the VAB or SPH)\n\nMy smallest design is 2.1-something tons, I will post evidence (pics) of that later on. \n\nNo points or something, the smallest design wins.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T07:05:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 07:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ferdoni**\n  \nupdating rules"},{"CreatedByName":"Rfmeijboom","CreatedById":91078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T13:45:43Z","Content":"Do you measure the weight as shown in the VAB or in the vessel info in the map view?\n\nThese values can differ depending on the physicsless part used.\n\nEdit:\n\nAnd also, should the rocket be manned?\n\nAnd if so, are command seats allowed?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T13:54:54Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know if there is a lot of difference in those values in v 0.90.
