When I\u0027m orbiting, I realize that the jet engine fuel tanks are carrying a lot of oxidizer. I\u0027m guessing that this is because they don\u0027t use it when burning in the atmo. So essentially it\u0027s a waste because my rocket engine has the right fuel/oxidizer ratio in its own tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to a) bring less oxidizer so that when my jets are done burning there is no extra weight in oxidizer going into orbit or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E dump the oxidizer at that point? It seems like a waste to dump it; I could have carried extra jet fuel instead of oxidizer for the jet engines. It sounds like we might need a jet engine fuel tank that only carries fuel and no oxidizer...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T21:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are several; the Mk1, Mk2, and Mk3 fuselages, and adapters between them, are exactly what you seek.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T21:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ones that have oxidizer are ROCKET fuel tanks.
