I just tried, again, to replace the stock GenericSpace in the Mk5 with the great S2 interior and now I can actually see outside, rather than just a cockpit inside the model with no way to see out. I don\u0027t know if anything changed to allow that between 2.1 and 2.5, but I\u0027m happy now\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
