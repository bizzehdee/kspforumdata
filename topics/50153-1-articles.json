I have landed on pretty much all the bodies and have come back from most of them (no Tylo, Moho or Eve returns yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was working on a different lander. Something nuke powered that could hop to a lot of different moon biomes (aiming for 6000\u002B DV for lots of hops) plus do some slightly higher no atmosphere bodies. Anyways I was incorporating something nice and compact around the nuke engines and came across the age old problem of having to figure out ladders when a thought struck me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not put the lander can at the bottom of the lander (not the top)? It allows me to make a perfectly square block of lander without anything sticking out the top wrecking the balance (I can store 6 materials bays up there for samples). Also no pesky ladders and no need for Jeb jet packing either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody ever try this? My Launchpad tests seem to show it working fine (Jeb has a door right at ground level) but I am wondering about how the landers take the forces etc. Really so far my biggest hang-up with the design has been tat its esthetically horrible (which doesn\u0027t bother me too much) and ethically questionable (the lander can is squished between 2 nuke engine exhausts). Otherwise so far its seems viable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T05:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an interesting idea.
