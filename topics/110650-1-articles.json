EVA two or more kerbals so they are floating.\n\nClarification: Ocean means that\u0027s water, at least 50 km from any land. Kerbals can swim to a craft that\u0027s within let\u0027s say 500m of them.\n\nThe challenge: Construct a craft and then use only that craft to retrieve the kerbals out of the water and then deliver them to a nearby base. KSC or any base in KerbinSide if you happen to use that.\n\nRestrictions: Rescued kerbals must travel back to a base IVA inside an IVA capable pod or cabin. You can scoop with cargo bays but that kerbal needs to be transfered inside an IVA capable pod on the craft for transport.\n\nBonus points: The lower the technology the more points you\u0027ll get. The more kerbals you rescue in one flight, the more points you get. The greater the range achieved to the kerbals and to a base the more points you get. I\u0027ll post up a scoring sheet shortly.\n\nGood luck with this one. No, I haven\u0027t managed it yet myself.\n\nScoring:\n\nMaximum Tech Tier Used is 1: 100\n\nMaximum Tech Tier Used is 2: 95\n\nMaximum Tech Tier Used is 3: 90\n\nMaximum Tech Tier Used is 4: 70\n\nMaximum Tech Tier Used is 5: 60\n\nMaximum Tech Tier Used is 6: 50\n\nMaximum Tech Tier Used is 7: 40\n\nMaximum Tech Tier Used is 8: 20\n\nMaximum Tech Tier Used is 9: 5\n\nKerbals pulled from the drink and taken safely to a base by first flight: 10 points each\n\nKerbals pulled from the drink and taken safely to a base by any subsequent flight: 5 points each\n\nNote if you try for more than one flight this must be the same craft and must not be refueled at all. Otherwise it\u0027s disqualified.\n\nDistance from launch base of rescue craft to kerbals: 1 point per FULL 10 km\n\nDistance from kerbals to rescue base: 1 point per FULL 25 km\n\nScores for ranges flown only apply to the first flight in either direction. Range is point to point, so no clever stuff trying to score for orbits ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nPARTICIPATING AND/OR FAILING IS STILL FUN.\n\nPOST YOUR FAILS FOR OTHERS TO LEARN FROM.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T20:18:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 08:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AlphaAsh**"},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T10:11:14Z","Content":"this sounds like a fun challenge, since I am undertaking the Elcano challenge over the next few days and am taking 18 kerbals with me I\u0027ll drop two of them off while I\u0027m travelling over water at some point and see if I can rescue them using only up to tech level 3 or 4 (4 sounds more feasable since then i\u0027d have the jet)"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T10:17:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E this sounds like a fun challenge, since I am undertaking the Elcano challenge over the next few days and am taking 18 kerbals with me I\u0027ll drop two of them off while I\u0027m travelling over water at some point and see if I can rescue them using only up to tech level 3 or 4 (4 sounds more feasable since then i\u0027d have the jet)\n\nI\u0027d be careful restricting yourself initially.

I\u0027ll have to reload but that\u0027ll mess up my f3 window so proving my distance will be hard unless i take the distance returning and use that as distance out htere was well since i am leaving and returning to the KSC\n\nEdit again: nope i found them, they glitched 900m below the surface of the water....\n\n![tumblr_noxc2vrI8n1r0o48lo1_1280.png](https://40.media.tumblr.com/4002f2715ece8744b9f9f7a6f98c36c1/tumblr_noxc2vrI8n1r0o48lo1_1280.png)\n\nthankfully moving upwards, unfortunately only at 75cm/s so Ihave some waiting to do, not going to use physical time warp because who knows what mayhem that will cause\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T21:10:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T11:45:18Z","Content":"Don\u0027t use time warp if at all possible.
