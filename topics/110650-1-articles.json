EVA two or more kerbals so they are floating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClarification: Ocean means that\u0027s water, at least 50 km from any land. Kerbals can swim to a craft that\u0027s within let\u0027s say 500m of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge: Construct a craft and then use only that craft to retrieve the kerbals out of the water and then deliver them to a nearby base. KSC or any base in KerbinSide if you happen to use that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERestrictions: Rescued kerbals must travel back to a base IVA inside an IVA capable pod or cabin. You can scoop with cargo bays but that kerbal needs to be transfered inside an IVA capable pod on the craft for transport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus points: The lower the technology the more points you\u0027ll get. The more kerbals you rescue in one flight, the more points you get. The greater the range achieved to the kerbals and to a base the more points you get.
