The short version of my results is that, using both the oxygen extractor and water recycler, a mission that is running the recyclers at maximum capacity will make back the recyclers\u0027 cost in about ten (Kerbal Solar System) years. They are mass-effective a bit earlier, at six years. I say this in years and not Kerbal-years because each set of recyclers can only support so many Kerbals (which puts the large recyclers the slightest bit ahead of small ones, because they can service 12.5% more Kerbals for 8.5% more funds).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a round-trip mission to Duna, it\u0027s best to just slap a few big life-support stockpiles onto the stack and be done with it, but recyclers start to become the better option for large round-trip missions to the outer planets, and they really get to shine for permanent installations like cyclers, space stations, and bases (especially where water is available to replace losses).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also did a similar calculation for MKS/OKS, assuming that there are enough Kerbals involved that we can pay attention only to the per-Kerbal costs of additional habitation and agriculture modules, and got that they become mass- and cost-effective within a few years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have only done this analysis for \u0022stock TAC-LS\u0022 and even then only for the Carbon Extrator and Water Purifier, because they have straightforward efficiency multipliers. I haven\u0027t touched the Water Splitter, Sabatier Recycler, or any of the third-party greenhouses (e.g. Munseeker Mk1) besides MKS/OKS, because calculating their efficiency is somewhat harder (though I bet if I made a transition matrix out of the whole system and, I don\u0027t know, took the inverse of the determinant, I could come up with a reasonable estimate). I doubt they would push recycling to be cost- and mass-effective too much earlier. On the one hand, they would have a multiplying effect on food -- even with a factor of 10 multiplication on water and 7.6 on oxygen, the new optimum point for the modular container didn\u0027t even double the number of Kerbal-days per container compared to the starting point. However, they would also increase the start-up cost to be overcome. Still, it would be interesting to see if recyclers become cost-effective as well as mass-effective for missions to Jool, so I\u0027ll work some on that in my spare time going forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy calculations are in a modification of your spreadsheet (starting at J240 and then to the right and down): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/Misc-KSP-files/raw/master/Life%20support%20resource%20amounts%20with%20Kerbas_ad_astra\u0026amp;apos;s%20recycler%20calculations.ods\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/Misc-KSP-files/raw/master/Life support resource amounts with Kerbas_ad_astra\u0027s recycler calculations.ods\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-21T23:38:30Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2016 11:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbas_ad_astra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERe-hosted from MF.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fieel","CreatedById":110958,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T17:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInstalling it for a new realism career.
