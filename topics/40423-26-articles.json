There are some bugs with the 64-bit version, but at this time I don\u0027t know if they\u0027re Unity/KSP bugs or ones specifically caused by DPAI. I\u0027m not doing anything particularly non-standard in terms of plugin use-case, so I doubt they\u0027re related to my code. But I will look into it, certainly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease use the latest ModuleManager. Always and forever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do intend to remove auto-targeting. Instead, with a vessel targeted (and within 2.5km), the DPAI gauge will display a button that allows you to target the vessel\u0027s docking ports. An \u0022Acquire Docking Signal\u0022-esque button. Also, the DPAI will no longer auto pop-up or auto-hide - you\u0027ll have to manually toggle it using the stock toolbar (see next point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ragzilla - I\u0027ll definitely be integrating DPAI with the stock toolbar. Thank you for the patch! Note to anyone not using Blizzy\u0027s toolbar: my \u0027custom toolbar icon\u0027 code has a bug in it - it won\u0027t save the position of the button, so even if you drag it away from the center of your screen, it\u0027ll pop back there after every launch. Hopefully stock toolbar integration will allow me to remove that custom button altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Apollo13, LostOblivion - There will be a mismatch between DPAI\u0027s target and KSP\u0027s (Navball) target outside of 2.5km. This is because, outside of 2.5km, KSP refuses to target individual parts - it will only target the root node of a vessel. I have to \u0027fake\u0027 DPAI\u0027s information outside of that range, and I can\u0027t directly control the Navball. Sorry. Inside of 2.5km, however, DPAI and the Navball should always align. If this is not the case, please post a screenshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll also integrate the mod with the KSP-AVC plugin. Great stuff!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see RPM integration, but there\u0027s a large(ish) hurdle in the way: when you switch to an IVA view, KSP automatically sets the command module as the transform reference (e.g. the \u0022Control From Here\u0022 point). So, unless your docking port is directly on top of your command module, the displayed information is useless. Until I can figure that one out, RPM is on hold. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m considering moving the project to a GitHub repo, to allow folks to more easily make pull requests. Is there enough interest in this by fellow plugin developers to warrant the setup cost?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-09T00:47:43Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2014 12:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NavyFish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
