Plenty available, but the amount used is a grand zero. The neighborhood is producing though, ore trucks are going in and out all day long. But it\u0027s not registering for some reason.\n\nHow long has your ore industry been operating before you looked?\n\nThe industries only mine the spot directly below them ... this also means that the spot is rapidly exhausted.\n\nAfterwards (i.e. when the ore in the sport they are standing on is exhausted) the companies switch to working with imported ore (i.e. if you have no active mines in your city, with ore that comes from other cities)\n\nSame goes for the oil industry (also meaning that, in order to totally mine an ore deposit/oil field, you always have to switch and zone new industries (at spots that still have ore/oil).\n\nSomething I definitely dislike about C:S\n\nAddendum:\n\nAlso, have you painted a new district above the ore deposit and gave it the specialization ore mining?\n\nIf you haven\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t, then the industries you build there will just be normal industries with no connction to mining (same goes for farming, forestry and oil)"},{"CreatedByName":"kookoo_gr","CreatedById":57720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T12:26:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Played around with the map editor.

It looks like this intersection could be optimised a lot in that sense without adding much road surface.\n\nAs much as anything I got the sharp angles because it\u0027s hard to place curving roads symmetrically, and I was generally struggling to place the pillars on the slip ramps.\nOf course all that was moot as I had to scratch build in my city and the version there is a bit different. A bit messier and it too has some sharp curves. The bus drivers at least seem to take them like they\u0027re Sandra Bullock in *Speed*, but so far the interchange is vastly underused.\n\nI also had a big issue with my busway. It\u0027s separated from the frontage road by one zone square, and it seems like that one-square gap can\u0027t be crossed by a footpath, I ended up having to add unwanted roads for the passengers to walk round.\n\nOn the ore district PTNLemay, it does look like a mineout actually."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T12:47:56Z","Content":"I started a new series on my YouTube channel, if anybody\u0027s interested.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1rjrtkxla4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nSorry about the sound levels, they\u0027ll be fixed in episode 2."},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T13:35:09Z","Content":"So, a simple question: Is this game worth getting?

On the legality of that I will not comment, you would have to ask Valve about that. Do note that achievements will obviously not work on the offline computer.
