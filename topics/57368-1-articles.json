Establish a large orbital construction facility and put my first service vehicle in to orbit. Designing was well under way for my Calladrius Space Station, Mark 5. Capable of holding 71 kerbals, two service pods, and several open docking ports, I figured it would have more than enough crew in orbit to begin construction of larger projects if so needed.

Though lacking anything in the way of personal transportation, mining, or engineering capability, the SLUMs each carry 24 kerbals to their new home, giving the SLUM Lord the capacity to transport 96 kerbals (plus 3 pilots) off-world in a single vessel, with ~9k delta-V fully loaded and fueled.

TBH, I would focus on laythe more than duna and dres (Still work on those though, they can be vital and incredibly useful if you use them right.). In the long run, it may prove to be the safest and most habitable of all of the bodies, and it would be very hard to hit, considering it\u0027s tiny gravity well, it would be much more shielded from radiation than duna, due to the thicker atmosphere, and water and oxygen are readily available on the surface, which means that there would be much less maintanence needed for scrubbers and purifiers, and if radiation shielding was needed, then the colony could be built under the water, or into the sides of the highlands. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I do understand the challenge is to get as many kerbals off of kerbin as possible, as quickly as possible, to as many places as possible. I just think that laythe and duna (Maybe dres as-well, though bop pol vall and tylo may serve you better for construction purposes) should be the core of your galnat.

It has way more of everything than it needed, but it was fun and I wanted it to be my pretty floating space station with a game-breaking number of kerbals (seriously, if you used the fill vessel button on crew manifest it would end up duplicating a name and for some reason not allow quicksave once in orbit, that was a pain).
