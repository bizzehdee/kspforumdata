Tall rockets have a high moment of inertia in the pitch and yaw axis. If you pitch/yaw too quickly, you won\\\u0027t be able to stop it before overshooting your wanted pitch/heading. The SAS unit will greatly help to recover the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-28T20:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe pitch problem I usually avoid with vectoring engines, or occasionally with winglets, and most of my designs are likely going to suffer a bit with proper drag, hopefully we\\\u0027ll at least get aerodynamic nosecones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find one of the worst types of craft for unwanted pitch is a spaceplane, for some reason KSP hates having wings or vectoring engines mounted above the center of gravity of the rocket and I lose control with that kind of craft more than with any other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really wish the VAB had a CG indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
