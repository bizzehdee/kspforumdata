Thanks for all the hard work. Been building out my microwave power satellite network and labs for a couple weeks now. Unfortunately, I am seeing some issues with new vehicles created after 0.22 and 0.7. Some components are not generating resources/waste correctly and show empty fields in their right-click menus.\u003Cp\u003EReproduction steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Play on OS X, clean install through Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Install only Intersteller Mod 0.7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Start a new game in sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Open VAB and create the following simple vehicle, from top down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERC-001S Remote Guidance Unit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.5m Inline Radiator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.5m Nuclear Reactor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.5m Electric Generator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience Laboratory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

Right click on the radiator and note that the temp is 3500K and power radiated and power convected are blank. They do not change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB. Right click the reactor and notice that it\u0027s generating power, but not waste heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC. Right click the generator and notice it\u0027s generating MJ and EC, but the current power, max power, and efficiency are blank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED. Right click the science lab and notice that no Science resource line is displayed\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you try re-downloading and reinstalling the mod? Before you do, go into your GameData folder and delete the WarpPlugin folder to make sure that the reinstall is completely clean. I just created a new sandbox and built the ship you described, everything works fine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OqLCWko.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OqLCWko.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this doesn\u0027t help, please send me a copy of your KSP.log file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Oloros\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Oloros\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE. Expand the resources tab in the upper right corner and notice there is no Science resource\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried this same set with the 1.25m reactor and generator; same problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I cracked open the save file and noticed there was no RESOURCE section in PART section for the science lab. Added it from a 0.21.1/0.61 save game and restarted. The Science resource line then appeared in the right click menu for the science lab and in the vehicle resources tab, but no further science was generated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid all this again with a computer core module and all was the same. No RESOURCE section, no generated science, etc. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp! I need my Interstellar mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis part is not surprising. I can\u0027t really have two science systems going on, so I removed the science resource in 0.7 in order to integrate with the stock science system. That means, in sandbox mode, all parts will upgrade automatically to their best possible state. Only career mode will feature the basic parts and unlocking new technologies will unlock the upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T22:31:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sanoj688\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sanoj688\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks Fractal_UK!\u003Cp\u003EAnother question then, while I\u0027m at it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time I just tried putting a nuclear reactor, an electric power generator and a science bay (and heat radiators) on a vessel and tried it out. It worked, the science bay got powered up but it seemed as if it wasn\u0027t really draining power. I let the reactor and generator run untill it stopped by itself (guess it was full) and then i disabled tritium breeding (or whatever it says) and I expected my megajoules to go down as the science bay should be usign power. But it didn\u0027t, all my resources stayed the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry turning the generator off, you will see the Megajoules go down then. With the reactor on and generator on, it will simply be generating them faster than the science lab is using them up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairan","CreatedById":85361,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T23:37:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a question I might have overlooked the answer to, but does the lab module produce science in the background (ie. while it does not have the focus and is not the active vessel) ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
