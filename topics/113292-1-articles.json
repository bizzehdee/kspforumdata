He did set ... I think it was jool as a target, pointed towards it and then upon activating the telescope he could zoom enough to actually see the planet.\n\nI have installed Distant Object Enhancement as it is probably required, but I can not be sure which of the part mods it was.\n\nI remember he had a contract to take a picture of ... let\u0027s say jool. So he had to turn the satellite, zoom in and take a pic.\n\nI have installed cacteye, but had not the chance to try it.\n\nI would like to station a Hubble like satellite and look around for asteroids and such."},{"CreatedByName":"sapienza","CreatedById":141805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T06:20:03Z","Content":"Google the words \u0027kerbal telescope addon\u0027 and this is the first hit.
