Appologies for not doing my research on my own, but time spent looking up mods takes away from my precious little time to play KSP! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am playing in Science Sandbox, and have been for a while (started version 0.23, currently 0.24.2). I have not finished researching the full tree (by quite a bit), but I am having a good time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI currently have the science stations mod, engineers redoux, and enhanced navball. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking for mods which add parts to build colonies and bases. I saw the kolonized mod, but it depends on the TAC mod which I do not wish to use at this time. I will probably do so when I decide to start playing a new game on full career mode, which I will mod up a lot to keep it different. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other mods with good space station and base parts? Like decent living quarters besides the hitchhikers pod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, I ahve seen images of atmospheric ships with a blimp. Which if the many mods has the cool-ass blimping capacity? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elastly, I have seen images of ships looking very nice with what appears to be toroids in them. I only saw one mod on curse with this, which was the biodome mod, and not exactly what I was looking for. My preference would be a spinning toroid which would serve as living space for a long-range mission with some artificial gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually tried once putting 4 hitchhiker pods on radial arms and rotating them using RCS around a central axis, but even with SAS off the rotation stopped when I went back to the ship after it was in space (unattended) for a while : p but how can we expect to keep our kerbals healthy in zero G for a 2 year interplanetary mission? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any advice!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T21:41:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best place to check is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECommunity Mods and Plugins Library\u003C/a\u003E.
