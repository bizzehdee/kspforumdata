Spent too much fuel on landing, now do not have enough to get back to Kerbin. Actually, I don\u0027t even have enough to get into orbit around Mun again, but it\u0027s very close. I\u0027m about 300 d/V short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I know I could send up a rescue mission. I have KAS an could land a fuel trucker near the lander and refuel him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander has a lot of stuff on it - bunch of science experiments from DMOrbital, eight Materials Labs (I shrunk them to half size using Tweakscale) . . . I was thinking if there was a way to remove some of this stuff I could reduce my overall mass to a point where the fuel I do have would get me home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlas, the only way I know of to do so would be to edit the .craft file, which I am not inclined to do. So I am looking for a mod that would allow removing parts in-game but out-of-VAB. Does such a thing exist?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for this particular mission, I will probably go with the rescue mission - it will be a good challenge to try to land another a ship within 20m of the lander. But I thought I\u0027d ask the question - is there such a mod? and are there other solutions to this problem I haven\u0027t thought of?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-12T20:16:26Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2014 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Meta Jonez\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T17:58:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot enough to get in to orbit is a pain, I\u0027ve had to send a tanker out to Mun orbit to refuel but never tried it on the ground, I\u0027m guessing you\u0027ll need a rover a Klaw on it?
