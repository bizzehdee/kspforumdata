Not pizza as in leftovers, but pizza as in he\u0027s actually making homemade pizza because ever since it had started getting REAL cold, Pizza Hut was out of service, so Bob had to make his own pizza.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd while Bob is cooking pizza, let me tell you the basic layout of their hou- er... bunker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s 8 rooms total, and the largest is the living room, which has 1 three cushion couch and two chairs next to it at a roughly 45 degree angle. They have a T.V. which connects to an internet box underneath the T.V. setup. The second-largest room is the kitchen, which has a full counter, drawers, cabinets, an oven, a microwave, a fridge and the like. Next is their bedrooms, all of very similar sizes, which is just enough to fit 1 bed. Oh, and there\u0027s four of em\u0027. The second-last room is the laundry room, with your average washer and dryer, but it also includes the dishwasher. The very last room is the computer room. It has four computers and four moniters and four desks and chairs. It\u0027s really that simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey Bob, you done with that pizza yet?\u0022 Val asked, very tired because she just woke up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not yet, though it is going to be done pretty soon.\u0022 Bob replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022These potato chips are gonna be all gone if you don\u0027t hurry up with that pizza!\u0022 Jeb shouted, suddenly eating chips from a bag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, Jeb?

That happened like ten minutes ago.\u0022 Jeb replied, slightly annoyed that Bob thought he would forget \u00A0so quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, well, it would actually be impossible to make that snowman, because since it\u0027s so cold outside, not only has the snow frozen into ice, that ice is frozen rock solid.\u0022 Bob explained to Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh...\u0022 Jeb replied, amazed and saddened that he couldn\u0027t make a snowman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey guys! the pizza\u0027s done!\u0022 Bob suddenly shouted at the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen they all proceeded to grab a plate, take two slices of pizza, and then sit down on the couch to watch some T.V., which was Cartoon Network, that\u0027s what they always watched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey Bob, this pizza tastes great! It\u0027s almost as great as Pizza Hut was back in 2043!\u0022 Val exclaimed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks, Val!

Normally I\u0027m the last one to wake up, but for some reason I guess tonight was an exception.\u0022 He told himself, wondering how and why he got up so early.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked outside, and saw a cold, sunless wasteland as always, but then looked at their blocked off door, and realized that it was slightly ajar. And then he remembered how cold it was outside and the effects that extreme cold had on kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh dang!\u0022 He thought to himself as he ran to the door and slammed it shut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I should probably check on the others, just to see if they\u0027re okay.\u0022 He thought after closing the door and having a fresh cup of coffee, knowing he would never get back to sleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen he checked on his friends in this order: Bill, Val, and Bob. All of them were fine, though they were a little cold. Not too cold to be dead, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter his sigh of relief that his friends weren\u0027t dead, he decided to grab some cold pizza left over from last night and head over to play his computer and watch some YouTube. It seemed not many people uploaded a whole lot anymore, though, so he just watched some older videos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter awhile, he heard the others get up and get some coffee or soda and then he heard Bob come over to his room to see if he was okay and saw he was gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey Jeb, where are you?\u0022 Bob yelled, bewildered that he was out of bed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Watching some YouTube on my computer.\u0022 Jeb replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why did you get up so early, Jeb? You\u0027re usually the last one to wake up!\u0022 Bob asked Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The door was open, so I closed it and made sure you guys weren\u0027t dead.\u0022 Jeb replied, Bob having a very shocked and surprised look on his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey guys!

At best we\u0027ll have a periapsis of about 250 AU and an apoapsis of about 1100 AU, and at worst we\u0027ll have a periapsis of 10 AU and an apoapsis of 3500 AU.\u0022 Bob replied as best as he could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Should we tell the others?\u0022 Val asked Bob.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think it would be best to tell them, even if it worries them.\u0022 Bob admitted to Val.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I guess that is true\u0022 Val thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe and Bob then walked over to the rooms of Bill and Jeb, and woke them up.
