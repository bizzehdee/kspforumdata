Jr to the top node and launch to pad or runway.\u00A0 EVA your kerbal and enjoy!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is easy enough to reproduce, if anyone wants to confirm I can send a bug report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T02:04:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEVA, Kerbal gets out on top, falls off. No Krakens or weird behavior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T07:51:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hatch should be blocked, but isn\u0027t. So the kerbal is allowed to eva and the helmet collides with the sci jr.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one was a rough one to balance. There needed to be enough freedom to allow kerbals to eva, without making the hatch check excessive. Unfortunately that means kerbals can sometimes EVA when an part is partially in the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T08:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, please don\u0027t make the hatch check excessive. The only strange thing about it to me is that on exit the kerbal\u0027s helmet collides with the SciJr, but when he reverses the problem and tries to grab the ladder and board, there is no visible collision issue. So I don\u0027t quite see why grabbing the ladder works better than being placed on the ladder. Seems like it should be the same process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T21:29:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is obviously a pretty minor issue, basically I discovered it by making a low level science roller. As far as rocker design goes I imagine most people wouldn\u0027t do it, and if they did they deserve the results \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
