I would like to be able to start a new save game and have all research completed, all buildings upgraded, and infinite funds. \n\nCurrently, I have to start a new career save, go into persistent.sfs, give myself 11098 Science and 1000000000 (1 billion is close enough to \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE, right?) Funds, load up the save, upgrade all the buildings, and research the whole tech tree.\n\nDoes anybody want to make a mod that achieves the same goal as my save editing, or know of a mod for this?\n\nThanks,\n\n*--Quietsamurai98*"},{"CreatedByName":"xxjetterxx","CreatedById":37766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T01:50:16Z","Content":"Sandbox does all those things already."},{"CreatedByName":"quietsamurai98","CreatedById":69270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T01:52:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The science system and related parts do not function.
