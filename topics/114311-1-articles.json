Early in this career game (with heat turned down to 10%), I had 3 rescue contracts I dediced to do in 1 go. It worked great so I decided to post this in case anybody finds it useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, the ship used looked like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/vcpga1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/546/19163366286_6c57c58a9e_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219163366286_6c57c58a9e_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/uXgbci\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/328/19003357759_453ba048cc_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219003357759_453ba048cc_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe salient feature is the use of a 2.5m adaptor and box girders to create a homemade \u0022quad-coupler\u0022. I had not yet unlocked any stock multi-couplers. I used a similar kludge in a previous 1.0.4 game (with 100% heat) to make a big booster for a multi-seat Mun lander and it had no trouble getting up through the air even with some flames, so I\u0027m pretty sure it would work on reentry as well (assuming the OTHER problems with 1.0.4 heat don\u0027t kill you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, all 3 rescue targets were conveniently lined up close together at about 90km so I went up to 150km and let them catch up with me. The plan was to take them from front to rear.
