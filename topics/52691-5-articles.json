In both of the videos you referenced, there is no curvature of the ground taken into consideration. We, discussing orbital mechanics, have no such luxury of assuming the ground is actually flat. If Adam has a gun capable of firing a bullet at a whopping ~7,900 m/s (and there was no atmosphere or buildings/mountains/etc in the way), he\u0027d shoot himself in the back, and the bullet, unobstructed, would NEVER hit the ground ever again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re talking about distances and velocities relevant to planetary scales, everything you\u0027ve demonstrated that you know is woefully inadequate.

This means that you will hit the surface at the same time. The angle at which you are going in the parabolic arc is equal opposite on both sides and it can\u0027t be any other way. This means that you would angle your craft in the equal opposite direction to your velocity to the surface. Which is... guess what, shown on the nav ball. This means that by coming into an object rotating, you would angle your craft and burn to zero the velocity which is the same in both cases because V = gt The rotation speed of the planet is it\u0027s angular velocity, which is the same on all points along the equator of a planet. Angular velocities are either equal at the poles or equal opposites. That means that it takes the equal opposite amount of fuel to decelerate and land given the rotational direction and the angle of approach. This is because angular velocity is a pseudovector.
