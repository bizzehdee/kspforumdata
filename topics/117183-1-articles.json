It\u0027s not hard to imagine someone who accidentally unlocks or activates a system a little too early when operating a complicated piece of machinery in a busy situation. The reason for unlocking the feather \u0022braking\u0022 system at Mach 1.4 is due to the fact that aerodynamic forces are strong enough to keep it down. If the system doesn\u0027t unlock , then they abort the remainder of the rocket burn, dump oxidizer and land. If they wait to unlock the feather system once they are \u0022in space\u0022 and find out it won\u0027t unlock, then they\u0027ll just break-up on re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ninja\u0027ed by PakledHostage\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T17:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy wasn\u0027t the feather release automated?
