I backed up my entire .19 folder so I think I can recover, but .2 does some strange things with parts. I know there is a new part file structure, but parts that are in the folder tree, don\u0027t show up in game. For example, I don\u0027t have any aero or science parts at all, and no mainsail engine under propulsion. I do have mods, and those folders are in the .2 folder scheme, but I can\u0027t load any saved ship, not even the \u0022stock\u0022 ships that I haven\u0027t touched. Do I need to copy parts from my backup over to the new file structure manually? Any help at all will be appreciated. Thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
