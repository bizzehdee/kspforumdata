I say this because there are a number of staged engines that do not specify a specific icon and still show up in staging controls. There may not be any way around the part showing up in the staging system without a plugin to force it to ignore your part. If there is a way to turn off staging in the stock system, you may need to grab a managed assembly decompiler and dig around in the stock modules to find it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T22:10:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did try not using stagingIcon, but it defaulted to the icon for a liquid rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T22:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMay I ask why?

Ordinarily, by adding to the config a line with \u0022staged = false\u0022 i would think you would eliminate it from the staging; however, because the variable defaults to false, doing so would not actually do anything that the default setting isn\u0027t already doing.
