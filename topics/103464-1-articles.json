I say this because there are a number of staged engines that do not specify a specific icon and still show up in staging controls. There may not be any way around the part showing up in the staging system without a plugin to force it to ignore your part. If there is a way to turn off staging in the stock system, you may need to grab a managed assembly decompiler and dig around in the stock modules to find it."},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T22:10:22Z","Content":"I did try not using stagingIcon, but it defaulted to the icon for a liquid rocket."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T22:21:27Z","Content":"May I ask why?

I found this in both ModuleEngines and ModuleEnginesFX: \n\n    [COLOR=#0000ff][B]public[/B][/COLOR] [COLOR=#ff0000][B]bool[/B][/COLOR] staged;\n\nThis is set up as a persistent field in both modules, and defaults to false as evident by the lack of an initialized value in the code. Ordinarily, by adding to the config a line with \u0022staged = false\u0022 i would think you would eliminate it from the staging; however, because the variable defaults to false, doing so would not actually do anything that the default setting isn\u0027t already doing. So... back to the drawing board I guess. Perhaps the staging toggles available in TweakableEverything\u0027s staging toggle plugin might produce more helpful information."},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T12:02:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E May I ask why?
