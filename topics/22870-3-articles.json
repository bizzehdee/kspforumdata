If you use a really complex collision mesh it can add a lot of load on an already heavily taxed CPU. However, adding polygons (which is what this mod does instead of using heavy textures) is mostly landing on the GPU I believe. So basically you have a situation where the models are higher detailed, but it is not a good idea to use nearly that complex a model for the collision, so you end up with a basic bounding box instead.\u003Cp\u003EFor the extremes of quality, every one of these models could be made with a customized collision mesh to make the collisions work flawlessly like you\u0027d expect.
