In truth MechJeb is nothing at all new and is in no way new to rocketry. The grans majority of rocketry was controlled by computer being it mechanical or digital (Yes there are mechanical computers...there are also mechanical calculators, my father has one). Most of space flight is done by a computer and was done even for the Apollo missions. United States Astronauts had to demand that manual controls be put in as they were not planned but in time saved many missions including Apollo 11.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Manual control is for the most part a minor event and typically only used when absolutely necessary. Otherwise, your just a passenger trusting a computer with your life. MechJeb is a great mod for how ever you choose to use it. You can use it just for the information it gives, or you can use it for more. The thing is, people payed their money to play a game, and they have the right to play it as they please with what mods they please. I personally use MechJeb for landing and docking, things I am not good at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dbreed","CreatedById":67190,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T12:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Holo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Holo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can say that if you coded MechJeb yourself.
