But it has never come closer to extinction than it did when the Great Impact occurred, or in the Burrow Era that lasted for three thousand years afterward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore I explain in detail what we currently understand happened, I must describe what society on Kerbin looked like before the asteroid struck. It was nothing like the unified world government that we live in today. Kerbin was split into many countries, with the leaders of each country often disagreeing with each other. In each country, Kerbals spoke different languages, and in many cases lived in completely different ways to each other. They were so focused on their\u00A0petty squabbles that they never realised how tiny and insignificant they were. They never turned their eyes to the cosmos, as we do today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, these ancient Kerbals had rockets. But they never thought to put Kerbals on them. Most of the countries had nuclear weapons, and they were prepared to use them. These nuclear warheads played a significant part in reducing Kerbin to a desolate wasteland, as I will explain in a moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Part image\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022236.25\u0022 width=\u002280\u0022 src=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/7/7f/LV-N_Atomic.png/80px-LV-N_Atomic.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe LV-N rocket engine currently in development. This uses a similar principle to the nuclear bombs that decimated Kerbin.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the 10km asteroid began to approach, it was detected by scientists in several countries at once. A list had been made of asteroids that could pose a threat to Kerbin, but since it was so large, and not a single satellite had yet been put into orbit, there was nothing anybody could do to deflect it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost countries immediately began constructing burrows kilometres underground, hoping to save at least a fraction of their populations from the impending Armageddon. But arguments about which burrows would get more resources, and arguments about who would go into the burrows and who would face certain death on the surface, soon escalated into a nuclear exchange. As the asteroid hit Kerbin, sending tidal waves racing across the ocean and fine dust billowing into the atmosphere, the fallout was already spreading. Only about 100,000 Kerbals made it to safety in the burrows. The remaining billion died from the radiation and bitter cold caused by the dust in the upper atmosphere blocking out Kerbol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus began the Burrow Era. Historians are uncertain exactly how long it lasted, but the current estimate is 3000\u002B years. Countless generations of Kerbals were born, lived full lives, and died without ever setting foot on the surface. Only in the last few hundred years did it become sufficiently habitable enough for Kerbals to return to life on the surface - and even now, after the event that has become known as the Emergence, many choose to remain in the burrows out of fear.\u00A0The Great Impact has left a bruise on our civilisation, and it may never heal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a chance that, in the next century or millennium, another Great Impactor may hit Kerbin -\u00A0 but this time, we hope to be more prepared. KASA is at the forefront of this. If we establish footholds on the other planets in our star system, our civilisation may be spared from complete destruction. And better yet, if we can develop methods to push these objects away from their impact trajectories - such as nuclear rockets - we may be able to avoid any casualties at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Great Impact shows us what can happen if we sit on our planet and don\u0027t pay attention to the workings of the universe. It is one reason, among many, that we are now forging a path away from our home. Perhaps this new age can become known as the Expansion Era.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-13T18:34:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2019 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by RealKerbal3x\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
