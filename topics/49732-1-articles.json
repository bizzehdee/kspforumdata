If you\u0027re really good, you can slingshot from Eve towards Sun and do some braking there, bring your apoapsis down to Moho orbit and get the encounter - this way you would be actually slower than Moho. But gravity assists aside, the best you can do is to meet Moho at your interplanetary periapsis, make sure your Moho periapsis is as low as possible and just brake there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T22:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn Eve gravity assist is definitely the most efficient way. I used one during my SSTO Moho trip (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/hCitr#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eimgur gallery\u003C/a\u003E) to save delta-v; total cost from LKO to Moho orbit was about 3.5 km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should note a couple of things about this. First, you will have to use two Eve encounters to pull this off; the course correction required to get from Kerbin down to Moho is too extreme for a single Eve encounter to manage. The second is that a minimum-energy transfer from Kerbin to Eve is not sufficient to get you all the way down to Moho intercept post encounter; you will need to make another burn during Eve flyby to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, the most important thing to remember when you do this is that it is important to get your transfer from Eve down to Moho \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E right; you want to be as close to tangential with Moho\u0027s orbit when you get there as you can manage. Even minor mistakes can cost over a thousand km/s delta-v, so getting this part right will save you more fuel than anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmmmyum","CreatedById":85231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T23:22:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, so Eve it is. I just had a really interesting Jool slingshot at the inner system with one of my probes (it would have cost me very little delta-v to go anywhere, but that\u0027s another story).

If you encounter it at it\u0027s apoapsis the capture burn will require absurd amounts of delta V. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re launching directly to Moho from Kirbin that means you leave when Kirbin is on the opposite side of Moho\u0027s periapsis. You then burn down to Moho and orbit until you get a close encounter. If you go with Eve that means you launch from the same side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other important thing is to match your inclination before the encounter. If you don\u0027t do this you will also get absurd capture burns, because at the encounter you will be moving at speeds over 20 km/h around Kerbol. Now it just so happens that the ascending and descending nodes line up perfectly with the apoptosis, so you can do it where it is most efficient. This also means you can slingshot around Kirbin or Eve to change your inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmmmyum","CreatedById":85231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T18:46:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t bring more fuel.

My last shot at it was good enough to only require 3.5km/s delta-v in the capture/circularisation burn at 30km.
