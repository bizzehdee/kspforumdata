I crash (obviously).. Then i want to revert, but nope.. Can\u0027t revert because no button works, then i have to close the game, but i don\u0027t want to start it because it also takes 15 min to start with 60 mods, i\u0027ve been having issues since 1.1 came out.

Can you open the map? Can you use the [ ] keys to change active vessel etc? If you hover the mouse over the altimeter does anything happen? If you can take some screenshots and provide some more details, that would be a big help. Also, if the crash log won\u0027t copy/paste, is there any way you can upload the file so we can open it for ourselves?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
