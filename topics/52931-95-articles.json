This is far better than nothing at all as I hope all will agree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve received a lot of support in the last twenty four hours, and this is what made me decide to not leave the forums as a whole. Thank you to everyone who contributed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo address some misinformation I\u0027ve seen a few times in the past few pages: the fork was legal... if you ignore the fact that the terms of my prior license were broken. This is why the link was pulled. This is not what triggered yesterday\u0027s reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, my laptop broke, again. This time the system fan stopped working as a whole. Considering I\u0027m running an A10 on a 15.6\u0022 laptop, it heats, \u003Cem\u003Efast\u003C/em\u003E. I sent it to reparation today, and this one passed on the guarantee at least. No idea when I\u0027ll get it back however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I\u0027d very much prefer for everyone to leave that topic behind. I\u0027m going to reopen the thread now. If things go wrong again, it will be closed until I\u0027m able to take a better care of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you everyone for your understanding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChris\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
