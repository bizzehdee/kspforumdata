I was young and inexperienced in the world of gaming, but being swept into the Kerbal universe I found myself simply craving more of what there was to be offered. I joined the forums, read the dev notes, and became good friends with fellow Kerbal Space Program players. This all has changed my way of life, overall attitude, and ideas in a way nothing else could. This game taught me mistakes aren\u0027t just great teachers, they\u0027re the only teachers that matter! I mess up bad every now and then, but I put on a smile, find out what I did wrong, and grow from those experiences. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReading these developer notes every week for countless months now have made me realize the tremendous efforts that go into games such as these, as well a the people behind the process.

You all changed that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Kerbal Space Program has made me a person I couldn\u0027t be any more happy to be. The effects Kerbal Space Program and its community has had on me has sculpted who I am into someone who thinks and cares about others, someone who accepts failure, and someone who pursues their passion. What if I told you that before my time with KSP I was not interested in space? That hobby had died years earlier, and even during then I was not very into the subject. Now its back! Loving space and space travel has had the same life-improving, character-building experience, and it too has its roots in discovering Kerbal Space Program one slow summer afternoon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, this is a very deep post, but only because Kerbal Space Program has been such an emotional experience that stretches far, far beyond just being an ordinary video game.

I was with this game almost from the very start, and I never once gave up on it. Seeing something I\u0027ve supported for so long come to a proper release like this is almost like seeing something I myself worked on for so long come to fruition. Even if my own contributions to the KSP community have been trivial at best (a few hundred screenshots, a silly Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide-style series of fan-lore, the very occasional YouTube video), I still feel like I\u0027ve been a part of something big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You may be thanking us for our support, SQUAD developers, but I\u0027d like to extend the same thanks to you for making something so worth supporting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T00:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough Minecraft has a crazy huge following (54 million copies!?) the game doesn\u0027t seem as internally consistent, and polished as KSP does already, to me.

Thank you very much for all your effort, transparency and the way you have build such awesome game. I would like also to extend my compliments to all amazing modders that have contributed to making a great gaming experience even better! Thank you all very much and my best wishes in the future development of KSP and other games!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lincourtl","CreatedById":72218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T00:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, what so many others have said. Thank you HarvesteR for a truly unique game with the potential to educate without the player even realizing it, then spurring them on to even further education.
