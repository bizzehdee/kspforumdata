If you see blue intakes, that is a sure sign it is an older design and I would not trust it to work in the newer version without serious vetting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat having been said, there are many different engines that can be used for spaceplanes, but you will rarely find a spaceplane that only uses one type of engine. Most use at least two types of engine, some use three. The reason for this is that different engines are optimal in different conditions, and spaceplanes go through a lot of different conditions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us go over a bit of a list, shall we? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Wheesley:\u003C/strong\u003E Small jet engine, optimal at high atmospheric pressure and low speed, very fuel-efficient. Good for small planes and things that need to fly slowly, but rarely used in spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Whiplash:\u003C/strong\u003E Turbojet engine, optimal at low atmospheric pressure and high speed, liquid-fuel gas guzzler. Most spaceplanes use this engine as part of their design because it is ideal for building up speed while still in the atmosphere, and thanks it to being a jet instead of a rocket, even as liquid-fuel hungry as it is, it is still much more efficient than virtually any rocket. They might take a little effort to get off the ground, but are great once you are above 10K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- R.A.I.P.I.E.R.:\u003C/strong\u003E Hybrid jet/rocket engine, generally less powerful than the Whiplash, but also capable of running at altitudes that would cause the Whiplash to flame out, can switch to rocket mode to take it up into space. A popular option for ecking that last little bit of speed out of your atmospheric-breathing flight, but usually not powerful enough to get most spaceplanes to the threshold where they become ideal. Also only moderately efficient for their thrust as rocket engines, so you cannot expect to go past Low Kerbin Orbit if these are your primary spaceflight engines. Requires oxidizer to burn in rocket mode, so you have to bring some to use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- LV-N Nerv:\u003C/strong\u003E Nuclear thermal engine, only burns liquid fuel, heavy but very efficient, poor thrust. An option on some spaceplanes, and a popular option for the final stages of rockets as well. It has its drawbacks (the poor thrust, large size, heavy weight) but also its advantages (can go far, potentially simplifies the craft design if you have no other oxidizer burning engines you need to make fuel for which makes all your reaction mass usable in all conditions.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Other LV series:\u003C/strong\u003E Liquid fuel and oxidizer burning rocket engines, only activated at high altitude for your final push to orbit. The LV-45 is sometimes used as it is low in the tech tree so it is accessible, reasonably good mix of thrust and efficiency, and is not too heavy. Other options usually replace it as they get unlocked though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Aerospike Engine:\u003C/strong\u003E Liquid fuel and oxidizer burning rocket engine, virtually unaffected by atmospheric pressure, small, and with reasonably good efficiency and thrust. Another popular engine for spaceplanes, again used only for that last push to orbit after the jets have done all they can. Exploits aside, it does not stage with other things behind it, but since an SSTO by definition does not have more than one stage that is not a design concern here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, most spaceplanes will have a mix of more than one of these engine types, usually jets followed by rockets. The R.A.I.P.I.E.R. can pull double-duty there, but is not quite as good at either task as more dedicated engines, but can still be useful for certain kinds of craft depending on their flight characteristics. They are also the only type of engine that a spaceplane can realistically use without any other engine type complicating the design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crestofawave","CreatedById":150015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T08:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for that Fearless, hehe i didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t realise the rapiers were switching, till the other day, if you forget to right click on everything you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see all the options or sometimes even know what they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy rapiers can get me into LKO ok, i need to now work on my design and engine config for vacuum use\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T10:10:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crestofawave\u0022 data-cite=\u0022crestofawave\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eaha, im only a way through the thread, i guess the engines will change nearer the end, got a good design runing rappiers but now need to sort the orbit/mun ones\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch of the information and many (most?) of the stock designs made prior to the current KSP version (1.0.4) are probably obsolete.

Sometimes people would make a tightly fitted \u0022stack\u0022 of air intakes to get lots of intakes worth of air in only one intake\u0027s worth of space. This technique, known as \u0022air hogging\u0022, is no longer necessary or beneficial in the new aerodynamic system after the 1.0 version, so do not try it here or you just make the spaceplane more difficult for no additional gain. That having been said, the new aerodynamic model makes it so that a few intakes can power all your jet engines. The faster you go, the more air they catch, so there is no benefit for having an unbalanced number of intakes. In this regard, there is some difference between intake types as far as efficiency goes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Circular Intake:\u003C/strong\u003E Regular jet intake, works best at high pressure and low speed. If you have an aircraft that needs to fly slowly, this intake will insure the jets have plenty of air to breath even if it has to hover. Ideal compliment to the Wheesley engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Ram Air Intake:\u003C/strong\u003E Hypersonic jet intake, works best at low pressure and high speed. It becomes more efficient at pulling in air the faster and higher your plane goes, making it a good choice for spaceplanes. More massive than the Circular Intake, so it works against you if you are going for low speed flight. Ideal compliment to the Whiplash engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Shock Cone Intake:\u003C/strong\u003E Hypersonic jet intake, works best at low pressure and high speed. Like the Ram Air Intake, but with more intake capacity and more mass. In fact, one of these has about twice the air intake capacity of the Circular Intake. Also has one of the lowest drag coefficients of any \u0022cap\u0022 part. This makes it almost ideal for spaceplanes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Radial Intakes:\u003C/strong\u003E Comes in \u0022fat\u0022 and \u0022streamlined\u0022 varieties. The former is good for lower speed applications where drag is less of a concern, the later is better for higher speed applications where its smaller cross section is less of an issue. In either case, you would need several of these to feed any of the engines. Enough of them can be used as a replacement for the \u0022cap\u0022 style intakes in a pinch, but generally used as a supplement more than a primary source of air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Integrated Intakes:\u003C/strong\u003E Some structural parts have intakes built into them, like the Engine Nacelle or the Engine Pre-cooler. These parts also generally have some liquid fuel capacity built into them as well. However, both their intake capacity and their liquid fuel capacity are fairly small. As such, they are rarely used as a primary source of either intake air or liquid fuel, but they are frequently used to supplement things that are already there. An oxidizer-burning spaceplane generally requires a bit more liquid fuel than its rocket fuel tanks will accommodate, and these are one way of getting that extra liquid fuel for the jets and supplementing the intake air at the same time without the excessive mass a dedicated liquid fuel tank might require. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, do not try to make a spaceplane with jets fed by circular intakes, they have too much drag at high speed compared to the amount of air they take in. A few ram air intakes will work and many designs use them, especially ones in the mid-range of the tech tree. Shock cone intakes are very popular for their great capacity and low drag, but the mass-to-intake-to-engine ratio can be a little more tricky to balance. Also, common wisdom holds that once the jets are completely offline you should toggle all your air intakes closed to shave off a little more drag, but last I heard the jury is still out on how effective this is in the new version.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-28T17:21:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2015 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fearless Son\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T18:17:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(the Aerospike) It is very much affected by atmospheric pressure.Its Isp is about 230 at Eve sea level, its Vacuum Isp is 340.\u003Cp\u003ELosing ~32% of your thrust because of atmospheric pressure is not \u0022virtually unaffected\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven on Kerbin, it loses ~15% of its thrust\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, at Kerbin, when used as the rocket for a turbojet-powered SSTO, you\u0027ll only be running the Aerospike at altitudes of about 23km and above.

What really matters is intake area. This is because of how jet engines work. Each tick of time, the jet consumes some amount of LF and some amount of IntakeAir. If it lacks either one, then the engine will not run. To be able to grab and consume the resources, there must be tanks of them in the plane. The LF is in a fuel tank, the IntakeAir is inside the intakes themselves. The IntakeAir capacity of the intake just says how big this \u0022tank\u0022 of IntakeAir is. And it\u0027s way too small, even in pre-1.0 airhogs, to run the engine for any measurable amount of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, the main feature of intakes is that they create IntakeAir. As long as they create IntakeAir faster than the engine consumes it, the engine will continue to run. Any excess goes into the \u0022tank\u0022 but again, it\u0027s not enough to make any real difference. If you see the IntakeAir resource bar going down, it\u0027s because the intake is making IntakeAir slower than it\u0027s being consumed, but only by a few decimal places. If you shut the intake, the bar would disappear almost instantly because the engine consumes it so quickly relative to the size of the \u0022tank\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rate at which intakes create IntakeAir depends on 3 main factors: intake area, airspeed, and air density. The bigger the intake\u0027s area and the faster the ship is moving, the faster you make IntakeAir. But the higher you go, the less air there is, so the slower you make IntakeAir. For a given amount of intake area, eventually a plane will reach a point where it\u0027s too high for the intakes to create IntakeAir faster than the engine eats it, despite traveling as fast as it can go. Then the engines will flame out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPre-1.0, you could solve this problem by just adding more intakes. Then you\u0027d have much more intake area so could make sufficient IntakeAir even at very high alittudes to keep the engines running. But since 1.0, all jet engines (and the jet mode of RAPIERs) got a thrust curve that just falls off the table at about 23km. The engine will still run above that altitude but its thrust is so low that the plane will start decelerating. Therefore, it\u0027s now pointless to airhog anymore because jets are useless above 23km anyway. The good thing is, though, that because they keep running, we don\u0027t get the asymmetrical flameouts that used to plague SSTOs if they tried to fly too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that you can\u0027t use jets above about 23km anyway these days, you only need enough intake area to get that high. And as it happens, a single shock cone or ram intake per turbojet or RAPIER will do this. Having a tiny bit of extra intake area, however, will help ensure you don\u0027t have asymmetrical flameouts, so adding 1 precooler per engine can be beneficial, but isn\u0027t mandatory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the intake requirements defined, then it\u0027s just a matter of picking the best ones. There\u0027s really not much difference between rams and shock cones. The shock cone has slightly less area but has less drag so the plane will go slightly faster, which means you need slightly less dV for the rocket regime. But OTOH, because it has less area, you\u0027re more likely to need a precooler with the shock cone than the ram, which adds mass and some drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor SSTOs, I don\u0027t recommend using any auxiliary intakes except the precooler. The radial ones have way too much drag to be efficient and the other inline ones not only have more drag but also bulged/lumpy sides so are nearly impossible to attach wings to. And note that the \u0022precooler\u0022 doesn\u0027t cool at all.
