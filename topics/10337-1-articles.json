You really are better off putting any money that might have gone into repairs, into a new laptop as Cardgame suggests.\n\nBuying parts through eBay is a gamble. you might get a good long run, or you might get a near dud. They might have had a long life already with the person selling them, and be ready to up and die without warning. buying parts through eBay is like buying refurbished parts, except there isn\\\u0027t a warranty or manufacturer reputation behind it, nor has it first passed a quality control to ensure its still up to par."}]}
