What I\u0027m wondering is, what\u0027s the smallest and/or lightest rocket capable of achieving orbit? The idea is that a smaller or lighter rocket would be either less costly, or easier to build in a non-commercial environment. I\u0027m not actually planning to build my own orbit capable rocket (for several reasons), but for some reason the idea really piqued my interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foamy","CreatedById":608,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T20:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell the three smallest/lightest rockets to ever put something in orbit are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Arrow\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBlack Arrow\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_4S\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELambda 4S\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_(rocket)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVanguard\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll three were from 1950-1970 so the technology now should be able to offer improvements but I\u0027d be surprised if we\u0027ve advanced enough to have a big impact there.
