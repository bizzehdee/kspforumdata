It stemmed from the thought that these are trained Kerbonauts, and it doesn\u0027t make any sense for them to just quit working and sit there twiddling their thumbs when they run out of food, to the point that they won\u0027t even deploy parachutes to save themselves when plunging through the atmosphere. So I thought up a different explanation:\n\u003E That takes care of the explanation for how the mod works, and opens up some other interesting possibilities.\n\u003E \n\u003E In my current save, I have a Kerbal who ran out of food on their way back from Minmus, and are just swinging in a big orbit around Kerbin. It was very annoying, because I was unable to do anything to rescue them until I unlocked the Klaw, as the craft did not have a docking port, and I was unable to EVA the Kerbal to move to a rescue vessel. Giving the ability to wake a Kerbal for an hour would offer solutions for rescue, as I could have either woken them up and EVA\u0027d them to a rescue craft full of food, or woken them as they approached Kerbin and landed them. I\u0027m not sure how possible any of this would be, but please let me know what you think!\n\ntbh I\u0027m pretty happy with the existing mechanic. Allowing them to be revived at will (even for an hour) completely removes the need for life support.
