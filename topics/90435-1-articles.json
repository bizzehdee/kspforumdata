There is a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of KSP experience and energy floating around in here (I see it all the time in responses to support requests). As some of you may already know, I\u0027ve been working on add-on modules that address some of the more common (and problematic) bugs in KSP. (That thread link can be found in my signature.) My efforts to fix those bugs have relied (knowingly or not) on posts by the various users of this forum. I realized that there\u0027s a trove of knowledge here and quite a few people who care about KSP. I\u0027m hoping we can put that expertise and motivation to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m creating this thread in order to organize efforts and information about some of the more elusive bugs that plague the game. Specifically I\u0027m aiming at those bugs whose causes have been difficult to track down. If we can figure out the exact problem, it frees up developer time to fix more bugs rather than spending their time tracing the source. This is a community driven effort to really dig down into what\u0027s causing these problems. If we really want some of these solved, then we need to work together to build up what I call a \u0022database of knowledge\u0022 so that together we can figure out the root cause of the bugs. From this database, we can all work together to determine what is causing the bug, rather than just saying \u0022this problem exists.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat separates his series of threads from the vast archive of bug reports is that these bugs are the most difficult to replicate. To help with this, I\u0027m creating a series of BUST topics. Each BUST topic will have its own thread. Inside that thread, we will discuss what we \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E is causing the problem and post our \u0022trial and errors\u0022 and/or testing results. If you have an idea for a BUST topic, post that idea in here rather than making new, arbitrary threads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if you don\u0027t think you\u0027re good at troubleshooting, simply providing good posts of what you were doing when encountering one of the BUST topics can help immensely. Any hours of time that you spend playing the game (and finding a bug) is hours saved for someone who is trying to troubleshoot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is an \u0022early release\u0022 type of game. Some people don\u0027t like the implications of what \u0022early release\u0022 means to the player. While these are valid concerns, the BUST series of threads are not the place for that debate. It\u0027s also not a place to debate why the bugs haven\u0027t been fixed. As a player of KSP who is highly interested in fixing bugs, I want to try and organize the efforts of other KSP users. We are here to find the cause, not lament at how bad the bugs are or how long they\u0027ve been around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the purposes of BUST topics, a BUG is something that is not intended through normal gameplay. Bugs worthy as a BUST topic are those whose cause is not well known, or the steps are difficult to repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Example of a non-bug: The default throttle on launch is set to 50%.\u003Cbr\u003E- While this may be highly annoying to some people, it is a specifically designed aspect of KSP. That\u0027s a feature suggestion and not a bug that needs solving.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Example of a bug: Kerbals are ejected away from the capsule when going EVA\u003Cbr\u003E- This is definitely a bug. Kerbals aren\u0027t meant to be flung off of the pods when going EVA. However, this is not a good BUST topic because the cause has been found.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Example of a BUST topic: Docking ports sometimes won\u0027t undock, or won\u0027t dock.\u003Cbr\u003E- This problem has been around for a while and I\u0027ve managed to heavily document how to fix a save file. However, I haven\u0027t seen anyone figure out how to easily and successfully replicate the problem. (Replicating the problem is different than providing a broken save.)\u003Cbr\u003E- Simply put: we know what the problem is but we don\u0027t know what is causing it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPurpose of this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThis BUST Master Thread is NOT for detailed discussion about the specific topics, nor is it for requesting support on any of the BUST issues.
