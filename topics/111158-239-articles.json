Candidates must be 1) over 18 years old so that they can legally sign the non-disclosure agreement, 2) have a history of being helpful and friendly on the forum, and 3) be good at communicating in writing. Once you do join, you would be expected to be logged into the internal moderators\u0027 Slack channel at all times while moderating so that we can consult with each other and discuss moderating policy. We are all volunteers, we do not get pay or any other form of compensation for moderating, and we all started as forum members. If that sounds interesting to you, keep an eye out for our occasional calls for new members."},{"CreatedByName":"Maria Sirona","CreatedById":210882,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-07T12:22:17Z","Content":"Me being me, i have some questions again.\n\n1.

What if a moderator abuses their power?\n\u003E \n\nSince moderators are chosen on the merit of their long-standing behaviour on the forum, it would be much more likely to be a misunderstanding rather than an actual abuse of power. Regular users often see a situation only from a single perspective and don\u0027t have the complete picture of what has happened, so such misunderstandings can easily arise. Having said that, moderators are subject to the same rules as everyone else, so if you ever feel that a moderator is abusing his or her power or otherwise acting unfairly or inappropriately, please report them using the forum reporting tool as you would any other person.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-07T13:26:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2021 01:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Deddly**\n  \nAdded a little information"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-07T17:18:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Maria Sirona said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1.

When we\u0027re called in, there\u0027s something happening and we usually have to be the big meanies.   That\u0027s never fun.   Sure you get a little satisfaction out of banning a dirty dirty spammer, but it doesn\u0027t make up for being the referee.  Yes, it does take a toll after a while.   But that\u0027s why we do things like the Threads of the Month, etc.   They allow us to find the greatness in the forums and to highlight it. \n\nOur previously mentioned mod chat really helps out.   Not only does it help discuss forum matters, the majority of the talk is non-forum.   These folks are my friends.  We enjoy playing other games together, vent life issues, talk about sportsball, etc.   But sometimes you just get burned out and need to step away for awhile.   That\u0027s why we have a team. \n\nBut for the most part, the moderation of the KSP forums is mainly housekeeping.   Moving threads into their proper place, approving new posts, etc.   Having to make a stressful decision doesn\u0027t happen that often."}]}
