A tech tree with various different branches that are mostly unrelated, so you could advance a lot in one type of science before another, but you wouldn\u0027t get the benefits from the other that you weren\u0027t focusing on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps if the tree is separated into different branches of science, there could be different types of science points used on the different types of science? Those new types of science could be gained through contracts to test parts, or for using parts from the same class of science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne compromise between science-based science and time-based science would be to use a mechanic similar to how certain RTS games do science, namely Rise of Nations. In that game, you have to collect enough resources (science points) to research it, then once you select it for research you have to wait for it to finish researching before you could use it. Red mentioned something about reputation levels before, and having some sort of threshold that once you reach that, you gain a star or something. If that were implemented, it could be used to speed up research by some modifier for every star you get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the generic techlevels plugin, I might be able to look into it once the tech tree is done. Don\u0027t expect anything from me too soon, and I strongly encourage some else to take it and do it faster/better than I could, but if no one does I\u0027ll have a go at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust throwing some ideas out there, I don\u0027t want to get started on something then realize it was missing something important.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Traches","CreatedById":79229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T16:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RedAV8R\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RedAV8R\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Traches:\u003C/strong\u003E You failed to install Realism Overhaul properly, or it\u0027s not loading properly\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally worked it out-- after chopping a config file down to the shortest one that could cause my problem, it all came down to where it\u0027s changing engines to use kerosene instead of liquidfuel.
