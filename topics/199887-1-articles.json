I admit not to being very knowledged on this subject, but one appears to be slightly more complicated than the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure there will be some who feel differently, but I always find docking to be overly easy in KSP1. You can slam into a docking port at high speed, with bad orientation, and with bad alignment, and you\u0027ll still magnetize into a clean lock. I find myself hoping that in the next game there will, at the very least, be a difficulty slider for \u0022docking port magnetization\u0022 so that factor can be turned down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I think there are several other additions that could make docking less trivial. Things like requiring a specific orientation, requiring a low velocity/force, maybe even actual moving parts that need to lock together instead of\u00A0a magic ring touching\u00A0another magic ring. What do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-28T02:45:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the current system is pretty good.

Docking is a routine operation and if it\u0027s much slower or more complicated than currently, it just becomes a chore. If you want to get rid of that, you\u0027d need to add docking automation which would make it easy again as well as removing a rather satisfying little bit of hands-on gameplay.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027d really like to see surface docking completely re-thought.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, create parts that make it unnecessary in the first place for a lot of scenarios -- such as fuel lines for fuelling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, create different parts that allow mating less precisely with much less rigidity. There are a few different scenarios here: fastening a craft for transport would require some kind of cargo clamps, whereas building a base by connecting up modules would require at least somewhat flexible connecting tunnel/ports that bend/align to mate, rather than forcing the mated craft into alignment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it is, surface docking isn\u0027t exactly ideal -- you need to get the ports at precisely the right levels, you can only do it on a pretty flat surface, and it creates tension in the resulting craft that can make things pretty jumpy when physics kicks in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Tuning the docking force etc is always welcome, they are rather extremely grabby at the current defaults...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rejected Spawn","CreatedById":172225,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-28T11:24:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d prefer if the docking ports were MORE helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElaboration time: Rather than have some universal magnetic pull I\u0027d like the docking ports to come with a small robotic arm that grabs any nearby ports by a specific \u0022handle\u0022 (resulting in precise alignment to whichever direction you\u0027ve rotated one of those handles) and then gently guides the incoming vessel to the correct spot for a soft, safe and automatic docking. Something similar (manually operated)\u00A0is already being used at times in real life, I\u0027d think people working to develop \u0022space stuff\u0022 won\u0027t be too dumb to extend this functionality a little over time. Of course I\u0027d like around 8 different sizes for the ports, and a functionality to have the arm fold away and hide while not set to look for dockings and a built in ability for the arm and handles to rotate along the outside of the port rather than having the entire port rotate, you only need the comparatively flimsy guide stuff to move like on a little ring sitting around the port itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-28T11:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComparing a crewed spacecraft docking to the ISS with a tiny probe using an oversized docking port being hurled at a small spacecraft is never going to be similar.\u00A0Like many other things in KSP it\u2019s simplified and overpowered to make it easier to use- it is a game after all!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can turn the docking magnet strength down or off per part if you want a more \u2018realistic\u2019 experience, plus there are mods for angle snapping on docking ports, gendered ports, docking alignment indicators, docking cameras\u00A0and even auto-docking.
