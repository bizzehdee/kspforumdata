The heatsink is supposed to be heavy, so I guess there will be a penalty in delta-v. Suppose I decide the ship is sound enough without adding radiators to make it cool faster. It heats as it makes it to a low orbit (either by taking off, aerobreaking, circularizing, whatever). I can\u0027t warp too fast (I think there is a mod for that IIRC). Say I have a maneuver node/alert coming for a different ship in five hours, and this ship in low orbit, which is slowly cooling, has an upcoming maneuver in two days. I need to keep focused in the cooling ship, by warping and looking at it as long as possible, so it doesn\u0027t loose parts to overheating two days from the current time, by which time all parts should have cooled enough already. And the gameplay mechanic for that is \u0022wait\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I guess the opposite would required keeping the thermal simulations of a lot of ships going off in the background, which should consume a lot of CPU, so there is a reason for that decision. It\u0027s just not fun. Maybe the thermal simulation for ships on rails could be abstracted/simplified somewhat? So instead of the more precise simulation, the simulation simply calculates how much heat the ship should have lost, overall, while it was on rails and adjust all parts proportionately, even if it looses some accuracy in the process?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
