However I never seem to have enough dishes, which got me thinking. How many do I need to cover the mun and Kerbin? So far I have 4 dishes on each of my 3 geostationary satellites. Geo 1 is pointing towards Mission Control, Geo 2, Kerbin, and Active Vessel. Geo 2 towards Geo 1, 3, Kerbin, and Active Vessel. And Geo 3 towards Geo 2, Kerbin, and Active Vessel. Now I\u0027m wondering, do I even need to point towards Kerbin? Also how many dishes will I need for the Munar Satellites, and how would you tackle interplanetary space?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Demon_82","CreatedById":81626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T12:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re forgetting about the omnidirectional antennas, any number of antennas of the same range can connect up to the max range without necessity of targeting themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree satellites each one with a single 5Mm omnidirectional antenna and two dishes, one pointing to Mun and one pointing to Minmus, and the same setup in both moons but changing the dishes target to Mun and Kerbin on Minmus and Minmus and Kerbin on Mun. The omnidirectional antennas will give you connection between the satellites and to KSC, you\u0027ll just may need to set lower tan geostationary orbit in Kerbin, or use 4 satellites at that height to get them in antenna range. No need to point dishes to Kerbin or between satellites in one SOI this way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Romby","CreatedById":70744,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T12:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have 4 satellites in orbit around kerbin. My satellites have 2 dishes (only needed one. I realise now) and one 2,5 Mm antenna. Dish 1 is targeted at active craft and dish 2 have been turned off. Only land probes on the kerbin side of the mun/minmus though. You only need to send one probe to Minmus since it only has one biome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T13:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease consider carefully where you place new threads, this one was in the wrong subforum. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Community-Rules-October-27th-2013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERule 2.4 is in effect\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread moved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"larsmaehlum","CreatedById":51566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T10:48:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy Kerbin system satellites are pretty simple. Three geostationary satellites spread around Kerbin with two semi long range dishes each. Each of the satellites target both Mun and Minmus, and I have three satellites with the same dishes around each moon. There is no downtime on the link, and each moon is perfectly covered. I also have a few long range multi-dish satellites further out to facilitate interplanetary communication. I\u0027m in the process of setting up a Kerbin-Duna-Jool triangle, so Kerbin-Duna will work even when the Sun is blocking the signal by bouncing it off the Jool dishes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
