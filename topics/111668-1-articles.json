Launching using 32bit mode would perform correctly. When I went to check the log, I discovered something peculiar - when running under x64, it not only wasn\u0027t finding the config for SoundTrackEditor (correctly installed in /~/Desktop/KSP_linux/GameData/SoundtrackEditor), but also wrote the KSP log to my desktop instead of in the KSP directory. x32 correctly wrote KSP.log in the KSP directory, and was able to correctly find the SoundTrackEditor config file. This problem occurs with a modded game as well as a clean install (plus SoundTrackEditor for testing pathing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: An old log from .90 (which I just found in my home directory) also showed the same issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit ][ : Apparently starting from a desktop shortcut may cause some of the issues I\u0027ve been having.
