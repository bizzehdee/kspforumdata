reply! I wanted to do something like this but it kinda becomes impossible when you think about the fact that the fairing is procedural, and won\u0027t always be the same size/shape depending on how the Microsat is built, I do have plans for a better radial decoupler though which will be somewhat along these lines \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am getting back working on this today! I\u0027m going to go through textures and configs today and sort things out, then I\u0027ll start on the resource scanner again. Reason why I\u0027m going over textures is I\u0027ve got a lot better at normal mapping so should be able to make em look nicer now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T14:24:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t wait to see what more you come up with just love this parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T09:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MeCripp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MeCripp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan\u0027t wait to see what more you come up with just love this parts.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E well after getting held up yesterday overcomplicating the process of making two animations for one object in unity I have solved it and so can get back to work on this resource scanner! (it has a deploy animation and then a running animation, I spent hours looking into all kinds of complicated animation techniques in blender before finding that I could solve my problem in 30 seconds in unity.... on the plus side I know how to animate in blender better than before!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
