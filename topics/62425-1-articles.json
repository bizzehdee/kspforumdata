I\u0027m talking about carrying a payload of 64 tons (Two Orange Fuel Tanks) into orbit, and a larger scale model being an interplanetary SSTO capable of carrying a payload of 100 tons. It would literally be a space station/cruiser that could land and take off on Kerbin yet travel to Jool and back (did I mention all of this would be stock). Unfortunately I don\u0027t have any ideas on how I would go about such design, but there was one youtuber and forum user who did make a stock interplanetary SSTO that was capable of carrying a 36 ton payload (one orange fuel tank) to Duna I believe, or Eve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe when I have more time in the summer I will attempt this Massive Interplanetary SSTO, for Science!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zuni","CreatedById":85203,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T06:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is rather large...
