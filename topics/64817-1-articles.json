The station consists of docking ports, empty fuel tanks, and a science lab. After finishing the test flight, I decided to use the remaining RCS to deorbit the prototype station. I was able to get the station into a 66x69km LKO when I ran out of fuel. So I\u0027m thinking it\u0027ll be fun to watch the prototype ship slowly loose its orbit. I then proceeded with a few other launches for my upcoming Jool mission and then I head to bed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI jumped out of my bed this morning with the sudden realization that \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethere were Kerbals in that Science Lab!!!!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe prototype ship is now orbiting in a 61x65km LKO, and I must save the Kerbals!!
