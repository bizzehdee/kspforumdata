I found the paths of the orbit lines very bizarre. I was approaching to the front of the moon with my velocity going forward (the yellow dotted line) then at the mun entry point, it warps me across the screen and now my velocity vector is going the other way (from the start of the pink dotted line) and I\u0027m headed in the opposite direction of the mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a bug on my system or is it does KSP just do weird discontinuous orbits because their programmers didn\u0027t make the changes between conic approximation regions line up correctly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/voi9i8T.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022voi9i8T.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-01T00:20:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2015 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gsonnenf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eanswered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T22:32:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, there\u0027s a setting for this in the Config file called conic draw mode or something similar.

You see another section coming up which represents your path within the Mun\u0027s SOI, and this is drawn relative to the Mun, centered around where the Mun is right now. So it looks disconnected from your current orbit. But as you proceed the Mun will get closer, and that disconnected segment will move closer, until at the moment you enter the Mun\u0027s SOI the entry point on that segment will exactly align with your current position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that moment the view switches and your current orbit starts being drawn relative to the Mun. It looks as though you have changed direction but you haven\u0027t.
