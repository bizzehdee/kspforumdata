It\u0027s actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it, all you have to do is:\n\n(1) Fly into orbit with the SSTO spaceplane carrier\n\n(2) Detach the Reliant Starship and land on Minmus to refuel\n\n(3) Fly to Duna and land at the desired location - it can also drive across the surface if you don\u0027t land close by\n\n(4) Takeoff from Duna after swapping out crew and refueling\n\n(5) Land on Ike to refuel and gain additional delta-v for the flight back to Kerbin\n\n(6) Fly back to Kerbin and mate with the carrier spaceplane \n\n(7) Re-enter \n\n(8) Land at Kerbal Space port and get all your money back - simple as that\n\nClick the picture in my signature to download the Reliant SSTO.\n\n-- JR\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-28T05:39:08Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2015 05:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jolly\\_Roger**"},{"CreatedByName":"Castille7","CreatedById":101668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T17:25:30Z","Content":"Incredible craft Jolly Roger"},{"CreatedByName":"Halo_003","CreatedById":76050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T18:01:55Z","Content":"Yeah, wow, that is a sweet system JR!"},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T18:54:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Incredible craft Jolly Roger\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, wow, that is a sweet system JR!\n\nThanks, I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s the sort of thing FireBlade was looking for but it will definitely do the job. It\u0027s capable of taking ten Kerbals to Duna (or pretty much anywhere else for that matter), and return them back to KSC. It\u0027s complex to fly but any time you\u0027re doing a return from Duna you\u0027re going to run into that.\n\nJR"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T11:33:09Z","Content":"I commented on that craft before, Mr Jolly Roger, and I still like it a lot.
