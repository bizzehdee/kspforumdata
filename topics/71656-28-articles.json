One fun thing is to be piloting a space station and watch someone come in to dock with you. But in practice we\u0027ve NEVER gotten this to work because even when the two clients are synced to the same time, they keep \u0022arguing\u0022 with each other over the exact position of the station. It keeps teleporting around once a second or so, jumping several meters this way, then several meters that way, and so on, making docking with it impossible (and deadly when it happens to jump to a position superimposed with the incoming ship and BOOM.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem seems to be caused by the fact that one client, let\u0027s call it the \u0022passive\u0022 one, is piloting the station and the small changes it makes with full physics on cause the on-rails calculation of its position that the other client sees, the \u0022active\u0022 one, to be all over the place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fix this, would it be possible to allow a player to put the camera on a vessel but choose to lock himself out and be passive (as if someone else was controlling the vessel even though they aren\u0027t) and treat the ship like it was on rails but at 1x speed? You know how when you go to 5x rails speed you are able to swing the camera around and look at things but you cannot touch the ship? Is there a way to enable that rails mode but have it doing that at 1x speed? That way the \u0022passive\u0022 player\u0027s client won\u0027t be constantly messing with the position of the station and making it jump around. Only the \u0022active\u0022 player\u0027s client would be in charge of choosing both the ship and the station\u0027s positions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T06:04:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egodarklight, when running DMP for first time, but before connecting to a server, when I attempt to Resume a save game, I get a save game invalid error, which delete is the only fix for (update and cancel crash KSP) but will reoccur on game restart since the default DMP save game persistent file is not recognized by Resume Game.

Unless you Recover all duplicates, opening any one of them will cause duplicate vessels to appear in another, leading to a physics explosion. Not good. Its consistent and duplicatable. I\u0027ve not found a work around yet. I recommend DMP test for KAS presence and treat ship spawning differently so as to avoid such explosions. Actually, I wonder if DMP could be made to determine if a vessel has been duplicated within the space of another, and automatically remove the duplicate vessel before loading it in Tracking Center, or before physics load. godarklight, what do you think of this brainstorm - a DMP duplicate vessel detection auto-removal-of-the-newest-vessel workaround?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kasperhangard","CreatedById":99555,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T10:16:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo is it possible to run this with mods and career? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have started a career, with far, drc, remote tech 2 and more. is it possible for me to make a server, with these mods, and then play with my friends, in my already created save ? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHanks:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
