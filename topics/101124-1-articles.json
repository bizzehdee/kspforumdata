Especially now there\u0027s biomes everywhere this strategy seems more efficient and neater.\n\nI did this for the first time in my last career play through. Stuck a station with a lab, a big fuel and RCS reserve in a 75 x 75 polar orbit over the Mun and used it mainly to service the landers. Setting up logistics to keep it fueled and figuring out solutions to things like \u0022Jeb got drunk and took out my solar arrays\u0022 problems added a lot of fun to the game play. \n\nIt eventually evolved in to that station, another one over Kerbin with a \u0022pine cone\u0022 of 1 man capsules to drop Kerbals carrying science down cheaply, ferries and tankers running back and forth, etc. It was rather enjoyable doing this and trying to make it efficient, the big benefit was it seemed to drop my cost quite a bit because I wasn\u0027t doing as many heavy launches and when I did they had multiple missions. The only downside is if you are not any good at rendezvous and docking, you will have to get better at it. \n\nThis play through is using Karbonite, I\u0027m planning something similar but hopefully more self sufficient."},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T22:52:16Z","Content":"It definitely involves a lot more specialised infrastructure compared to the \u0027Apollo method\u0027, but I think it\u0027s more fulfilling and also cheaper overall. You can ferry the crew and fuel supplies to/from LKO in SSTO aircraft, use an orbital shuttle to go between space stations, and have reusable landers at the station. All 100% reusable so very cheap to run. And yes, you\u0027ll end up very good at planning a rendezvous ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T23:51:37Z","Content":"In career terms, where cash is a thing, then its worth setting up a lab if you plan to make more than a token landing or two. Its also a handy staging point for unknown future contracts you might want to take. Even though im not going to land on Mun more than maybe twice in any given game, i\u0027ll still usually put up a lab incase i get a contract near a particularly cool surface feature.\n\nIn a few situations its pointless. Dont put a lab round minmus for instance, you can probably knock the whole moon out in 2 visits with multiple disposable experiments and sub-orbital hops for less than the cost of getting a lab and associated paraphernalia into its orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T01:05:06Z","Content":"Way I see it, it\u0027s probably worth sticking a lab in orbit around every planet, then use it to service landers going to and from the planet and muns, harvesting all the science from them before sending a big wodge of it back at once.\n\nThen you can send smaller missions, just carrying crews and supplies back and forth."},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T02:33:30Z","Content":"What I plan to do, maybe not the smartest, make a rover with a lab and other parts and then rome the moons using the lab to reset the other stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"Torquimedes","CreatedById":137645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T20:58:37Z","Content":"If you\u0027ve unlocked the Science Jr and Goo Canister, you can mount multiples on a rocket or plane and land it in various biomes around Kerbin, even if you lack wheels.\n\n![K249IH2.png](https://i.imgur.com/K249IH2.png)\n\nIf you\u0027ve unlocked the Mobile Lab as well, you can take just one of each experiment type you\u0027ve unlocked.
