Stuck a station with a lab, a big fuel and RCS reserve in a 75 x 75 polar orbit over the Mun and used it mainly to service the landers.

The only downside is if you are not any good at rendezvous and docking, you will have to get better at it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis play through is using Karbonite, I\u0027m planning something similar but hopefully more self sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T22:52:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt definitely involves a lot more specialised infrastructure compared to the \u0027Apollo method\u0027, but I think it\u0027s more fulfilling and also cheaper overall.
