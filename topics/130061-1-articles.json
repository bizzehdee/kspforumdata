No one heard him of course, he was drowned out by the giddy laughter of Val and Jeb. They freaked him out sometimes. He squirmed in his seat, almost trying to escape the claustrophobic seat. He was strapped in, but not tightly. He was shaking too much to pull tightly before launch. Bill looked over to him and put his finger over his mouth. \u003Ci\u003EShhh... \u003C/i\u003EBob started to relax a little. Jeb and Val fell silent. Bill and Bob perked up. Now, this was an occurrence. \u201CKSC?\u201D Bob began to tremble. No one was smiling anymore. When Jeb and Val weren\u2019t smiling, that was terrifying. Mission control gave no response. That was unlike Gene. \u201CKSC, please respond\u2026\u201D Nothing. Jeb adjusted the radio signal to the KSC2. It had been abandoned years ago, but the old tracking station was still operational in case of malfunction at KSC Prime. \u201CKSC, this is the Alternis capsule, please come in.\u201D Static. Val looked back on Bill. He looked at his console. \u201CNothing Val. Nothing on our end.\u201D Val sighed. Jeb put down the com controls. \u201CWe need to make our transfer burn in the next three minutes, if we don\u2019t, we lose our Plock encounter.\u201D Bob shuddered at the thought. He looked up. \u201CJeb, how long specifically until the burn?\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C2 minutes, 37 seconds and counting.\u201D Bob unstrapped himself. \u201CWhat are you doing,\u201D asked Bill. \u201CI\u2019m checking my experiments,\u201D replied Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot so close to the manuever, you aren\u2019t\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere are seats in the lab, I\u2019ll strap in.\u201D Bill grabbed at the hatch, and pulled himself into the science lab.he loked on the mystery goo. It was moving, as if probing for a way to escape the sealed pod that contained it. Bob took no notice, blaming the strange motion on the Gravioli detector nearby, even though Bob new all well that that wasn\u2019t how the detector worked. \u201CStrap in!\u201D It took Bob a second to recognize Jeb\u2019s voice and acknowledge what to do next. A second too long\u2026\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
