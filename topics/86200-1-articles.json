The map views for bodies could initially look like that. After getting the right tech parts (orbital telescope, remote sensing, ...) and science data (point the telescope, transmit remote data) the map view could gain resolution. A manned mission would have the current view, but maybe without the tech the space centre map could not be improved for any subsequent un-manned landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess you could do something similar for the accuracy of manoeuvre nodes - having better timing / observation / gravity data leads to more accurate nodes - i.e. if you have poor accuracy then the SOI might \u0027shift\u0027 in flight from it\u0027s \u0027poor prediction\u0027 to \u0027the physical reality\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T10:55:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that it\u0027s planned that we will won\u0027t even know about any of the planets\u0027 existence until we discover them.
