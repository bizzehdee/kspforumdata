Works fine, even when I strip the craft apart and find numerous clipped stuff everywhere.\n\nGo back and check my clipped craft? Still unloadable.\n\nThe only mod I had/have on any craft were MechJeb control panels, and I have MJ in both 0.90 and 1.0. I am so confused why my 1.0 apparently blows and is saying \u0022nope, you can\u0027t play anything from old.

However, every single one of those craft are also currently sitting in space, and weren\u0027t deleted upon career load after updating to 1.0\n\nBut I just loaded my 0.90 backup KSP, and every single one of the craft is only using, at best, a MechJeb control panel for modded parts. Some of them rely heavily on clipped parts whether for cosmetics, or other, but exluding MechJeb there\u0027s nothing there that would cause \u0022incompatible parts\u0022. This could be an extension of my tech tree being incomplete (i\u0027ll snag a picture of that and upload it), and I\u0027ll check a sandbox 1.0 to see if my 0.90 career crafts load in the sandbox.\n\nEdit: and yes, I do have the 1.0 edition of MechJeb in my 1.0 KSP, so there shouldn\u0027t be a compatibility issue there.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOk, yes it appears this issue is also directly coupled with my tech tree failure... a 1.0 sandbox has no issues loading my 0.90 craft, but my 0.90 career loaded in 1.0 KSP has whole sections of my tech tree being \u0022gone\u0022 and no amount of tweaking with the debug tool fixes it.\n\nSo I have the option of messing around with sandbox and kissing my old career goodbye, waiting for a fix and still messing around with sandbox before going back to career, or starting a brand new career.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T19:44:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 07:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Somtaaw**"}]}
