They have the weird property that the value of the digit grows to the right, not to the left. You also have to allow improper values into the digits, though (like allowing (11) (0) in base ten for 110.) This makes the representation non-unique, so another rule could be that you can only use 1 or zero in each place. This will give us some weird properties.
