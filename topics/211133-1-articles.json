I\u0027ve made sure electronics are set, communication to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is fine, and the craft is aerodynamically stable, includes the T-222 Nemesis Grid fins for control, and has landing gear. However, no matter what engine(s) I use (stock Vector engines, modded \u0022Micro Mother\u0022 engine, Mastodons, 1 engine, multiple engines, etc.), the throttle control of the engines is lost at the previously mentioned altitude and speed.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI have deleted all mods that alter any aerodynamic or wind properties, I\u0027ve messed with reentry heating levels in settings, and I have tried a continuous burn from 70,000m to the 30,000 hard deck. No matter what I do, the engines shut off at this point and are unresponsive when using MechJeb2 or doing it manually. However, all control surfaces and gimble are fine. If I flip the craft on its side and glide it along the Cape for a long time, eventually the engine turns on again at random times (once at 100m @ 154m/s and another time higher and with more speed).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EAny ideas?
