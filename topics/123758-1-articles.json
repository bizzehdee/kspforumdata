The DTS-1 however may not be necessary. I recommend using the Communotron 32 for the Mun and Minmus, as this will cover the entire SOI and then some without aiming and then have a DTS 1 to relay the signal back to Kerbin. If you really want to save cost, only two of the 3 satellites need a DTS-1. There is never point where 3 evenly spaced satellites will have 2 blocked at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: In fact a 1000km orbit with Communotron 16\u0027s might be sufficient enough to cover the poles of the Mun and still get the whole SOI and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ryohpops.github.io/kspRemoteTechPlanner/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ryohpops.github.io/kspRemoteTechPlanner/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-25T22:27:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T07:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERT2 ignores any terrain above datum altitude (usually sea level), so actually you don\u0027t need more than 2 dedicated satellites for 95% surface coverage on small bodies bodies with elevated poles - as long as you have relay satellites to get the dark-side signal back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
