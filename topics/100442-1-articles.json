(It weighs a bit over 25 tons.) The contract called for a base on wheels that could support 17 Kerbals so I figured this would be a great opportunity to use the XL3, but now I\u0027m not so sure. It gets slower and slower as I make my way up the hill, if I try and zig-zag up the whole thing just skids sideways and climbs up the slope of the crater even more slowly. Should I scarp the design and go for the smaller wheels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lBfuVLq.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/lBfuVLq.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I made it out. Physical time acceleration didn\u0027t really help, but I found out that if you make very quick short zig-zags you could maintain the speed at around 2 m/s. Without the zig-zagging the speed sometimes stalled down to zero and I was afraid I would start slipping backwards. All the same, if anyone has some sort of input or suggestions for getting better torque on inclinations like this I would very much appreciate further advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NaJtsYu.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/NaJtsYu.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-22T18:48:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2015 06:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T18:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, that\u0027s just a REALLY steep hill, no problems there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say that, if you did make it out of that hole, that 20 degrees is your maximum inclination with that design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDitch wheels, use the NERVA engines, if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, go with smaller wheels and a lighter craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd some engines to help push you up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022plane\u0022 gear are un-poppable.
