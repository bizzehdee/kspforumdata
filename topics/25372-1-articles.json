Today at work i though, hey, i could make one of those in KSP. Well here she is. unfortunately there just aren\u0027t enough buttons to do her justice flying, and she will not fly in atmo, but i think its a pretty good first attempt. I was going to wait for the Space station viewing pod (Hexagonal all windows) that is going to be in the stock parts next patch, but The Big command pod doesn\u0027t make too bad of a place holder while i wait for 0.20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo really fly well, the game would have to be modded to run the engines like the RCS system, letting you roll, manuver and Translate at high speed. Its Theoretically an extremely agile craft, but without some sort of fly by wire, its a bit of a bear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Hjt26ov.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Hjt26ov.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Assault Bunny","CreatedById":61177,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T04:11:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAtmospheric flight capable Starfury\u0027s were a different model, with flip out wings if I recall right, so you\u0027re covered there.
