People use them for all sorts of things.\n\nA downside is they are much less likely to be seen than threads. There is a section where new blogs appear, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be visited as much. \n\nThis might be advantageous to some people, you might be less likely to be accused of necroposting when it\u0027s a blog, not a thread being bumped.\n\nIt\u0027s a different format to threads, with a lot more focus on the first post. I\u0027ve used it as a place to put stuff I might link or quote in threads."}]}
