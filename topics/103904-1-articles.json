The craft is constantly accelerating from the start to the point when it rendezvous and matches speeds with the target. \n\nIn a scenario where both objects start at rest relative to each other, the vessel would accelerate towards the target for half the trip, turn, and accelerate in the opposite direction until it has reached the target. In this case where the trajectory is just a straight line, I know the travel time can be calculated by:\n\n**T = 2 \\* sqrt[ D/A ]**\n\nWhere:\n\nT = travel time\n\nD = total distance to target\n\nA = acceleration\n\nHowever, I have no idea how to calculate this in the context of an orbital transfer. According to what I\u0027ve read, **I think it would be similar to a one-tangent burn**, but I\u0027m actually not sure about it, and I don\u0027t think I can figure out the math myself. I\u0027m trying to run this in a computer simulation (not Kerbal; but similar), so the equation above is not good enough. I would like to be able to compute not only the transit time but also the elements of the transfer orbit. Assume all orbits are on the same plane. You can also assume the initial and target orbits are both circular if it makes things a lot less complex, but I would like to get a solution that works with eccentric orbits. \n\nTL;DR If a Hohmann transfer is thrifty this is \u0022making it rain\u0022 with delta-v."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T10:36:48Z","Content":"In general, orbital intercepts are absurdly complex class of problems. They are inherently non-linear, unstable, and even your strategy changes entirely depending on your initial conditions. There isn\u0027t a formula. There isn\u0027t even a simple algorithm. Off the top of my head, I couldn\u0027t even tell you for sure that engines-always-on will guarantee shortest time. You have to bite the bullet and solve the numerical optimization problem for any given starting condition."},{"CreatedByName":"mrfox","CreatedById":69277,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T13:12:11Z","Content":"You are looking for a [brachistochrone trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachistochrone_curve)using a[torch ship](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/torchships.php)."},{"CreatedByName":"Virkon","CreatedById":98601,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T13:45:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You are looking for a [brachistochrone trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachistochrone_curve)using a[torch ship](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/torchships.php).\n\nYeah, that\u0027s where I got that formula from the original post.
