It\u0027s hard to explain exactly, because in some ways the overlay is wrong which muddles the important issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The location of the vector before jettisoning the fairings is displaying correctly in the sense that this spot is where force is being applied. That\u0027s what is causing the rocket instability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- After jettison of the fairing, the location of the vector is no longer correct. It doesn\u0027t move until the aero overlay is cycled. In this case, the overlay is incorrect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There\u0027s a third bug, which becomes apparent after jettisoning the fairing. Apparently for parts at the end of a stack that are wider than tall, the lift vector ends up negative. So you\u0027ll see in the overlay, the lift vector is pointing opposite of everything else. This is an actual error and not an overlay problem. This problem is an issue with the body lift calculations, and is not isolated to the fairings. You can see it on any part that\u0027s wider than tall (such as an FL-T100) that\u0027s at the top of a stack with it\u0027s top node exposed.
