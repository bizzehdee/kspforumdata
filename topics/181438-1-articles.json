Press Ctrl-1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen change to another ship and Press Ctrl-2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen\u00A0 go Alt-1 and then Alt-2 to go between\u00A0 the two (1, 2 etc wont work because of action groups)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably the most simple way for this to work is to have it based on a scene load basis. and once other crafts are out of range to not remember their number designation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRTS games seem to have 0-9 possibilities from memory. Just a thought\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-16T07:19:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...or just do what Easy Vessel Switch does.\u00A0 Hold alt and click of the ship you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is another one of KSP\u0027s UI elements that really shouts \u0022we didn\u0027t know what this game would become.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anth","CreatedById":161238,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-16T07:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats another possibility, maybe add both\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
