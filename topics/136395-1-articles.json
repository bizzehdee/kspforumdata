I saw some \u0022explanations\u0022 and \u0022tutorials\u0022 but it appears to me that without McJeb it\u0027s impossible to eye-ball angles and vectors... I know for the \u0022parallel\u0022 planets rule... really frustrating... Does this mean I have to wait for planetary alignments despite, warp drive, fusion power, vista engines with 35\u002BK delta V?
