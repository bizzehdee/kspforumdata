I am moving to a new high school where they give you 11 inch Apple MacBook Air. I love playing KSP on my parents iMac and is works well. When school starts and I get the laptop, they expect me to play it on there. I do not knoe the exact year but I can estimate that it will be around early 2012- late 2014. Does that laptop have the power to run KSP? Would I need any texture reduction mods to help? I like to play with mods too, so would i need to stop playing with them in order for the laptop to run KSP? I apreciate all advice on the matter. Thanks a lot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECollin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clouds","CreatedById":32610,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T09:34:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cutlercollin99\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cutlercollin99\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eearly 2012- late 2014\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s quite a wide range. It makes it harder to answer your question because the speed of the Intel graphics chip got a lot better during those 3 years. A late 2014 would do OK (with low-medium quality settings), an early 2012 would be pretty slow, and in the middle will be...in the middle. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as mods go, that will depend a lot on how much RAM the specific laptop has. Most were made with 4GB, which will work best with only a few mods at a time. If it\u0027s one that was custom-ordered with 8GB RAM, it will be OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MacBook Air, since it is thin, doesn\u0027t keep itself cool very well. Sometimes people even reported that it automatically has to slow its speed down temporarily to keep from getting too hot. If you can get a cooling pad with fans to use when playing KSP, that might be a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T13:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a late 2013 11\u0022 Air, with the base (slowest) i5 processor and RAM bumped to 8GB.

My install is currently stock \u002B hyperedit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first important thing to note is that the video card uses shared RAM. Mine claims to dynamically allocate RAM, up to 1.5GB from my 8 total. If you\u0027re running with the 4GB that was standard on this model, then that will heavily eat in to how much is available for the game. I\u0027d be surprised if video and OS overhead left more than 3GB for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve decreased render quality to simple and texture quality to quarter res. The game seems playable with these settings but probably sluggish.
