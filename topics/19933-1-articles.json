A dae file, its texture and config top out at ~350kb but a mu file made from that exact same dae and texture result in a total of ~3.5mb. I didn\u0027t add in anything extra beyond the 3d mesh and a plain old .png texture. Did I do something wrong or is that normal? Is there a way for me to cut out some of the fat to make a smaller mu file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize that 3.5mb in modern terms is quite small but we\u0027re talking about a 10 times difference in file sizes.

I guess I was asking the wrong question. After learning more about the part tools I identified that the .mbm file is the culprit. I use a .png file for my textures that tops out at a whopping 60kb (1024x1024 px w/ alpha included) but when I drop it into my unity scene it is reported as being \u00220.7mb\u0022. That\u0027s still reasonable. However, when I click \u0022write\u0022 it spits out an .mbm file that is 3mb in size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked at the stock parts and noticed most of them have mbm files in the 1mb range. I must have missed a setting or am simply doing something wrong. Can anyone offer insight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Edit*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it also looks like I accidentally put this in the wrong sub-forum.
