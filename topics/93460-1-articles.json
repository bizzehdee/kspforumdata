However, I\u0027d love a way to rearrange them. For example, I started a 1m parts category, and later when I unlock smaller engines and tanks (precision engineering) I\u0027d love the ability to create a new category of parts ABOVE the 1m parts button. Right now I can only add them below. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T02:19:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I found a way to do it outside of the game.
