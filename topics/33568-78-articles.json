I can find the ability to add thrusters easily enough, but I have absolutely no idea how (or if this is even possible) to use KTO to accurately model some of the thrusters that don\u0027t fit into the \u0022burns fuel at some set ISP with some particular thrust\u0022 box. Things like the Q thrusters (which don\u0027t use propellant), or VASMIR (which has variable ISP and can use a range of propellants), and so on. Some engines can use various propellants and have different ISPs for each propellant, and some like the VISTA actually use three propellants at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first guess was to create a dummy thruster that has ridiculous ISP and uses a certain propellant, remove a ton of dry mass in the vessel\u0027s state and add it to that propellant.

I can find the ability to add thrusters easily enough, but I have absolutely no idea how (or if this is even possible) to use KTO to accurately model some of the thrusters that don\u0027t fit into the \u0022burns fuel at some set ISP with some particular thrust\u0022 box. Things like the Q thrusters (which don\u0027t use propellant), or VASMIR (which has variable ISP and can use a range of propellants), and so on. Some engines can use various propellants and have different ISPs for each propellant, and some like the VISTA actually use three propellants at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first guess was to create a dummy thruster that has ridiculous ISP and uses a certain propellant, remove a ton of dry mass in the vessel\u0027s state and add it to that propellant. Maybe that would work for engines that don\u0027t use a propellant at all. And that just sounds really messy and liable to create subtle errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I\u0027m thinking that for any burn with an engine that uses propellant I\u0027ll have to do all of the mass calculations myself, determine the length of the burn, kludge this somehow into the mission planner, and then set the vessel state myself after each burn based on calculations I\u0027ve done by hand. Prone to errors, probably won\u0027t work well, and almost certainly will bugger-up the optimization tool; or at least so I gather from how it operates after reading the tutorials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there something I\u0027m missing?
