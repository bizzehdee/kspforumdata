It is like someone grounded up the TMA-1 Monolith and sprinkled it around choice places around the Mun. Even with the Sun still in the sky I had to guess where the ground was. Somehow I managed to guess correctly, something I rarely do when I can see the Munar surface. The Mun has also gotten very, very bumpy as well, promising lots of opportunities to explore and find cool new mountain and crater formations. I made a short album of my first landing on the Mun in 0.21. It is near the Memorial, but I was more distracted by the new terrain to try to include it.
