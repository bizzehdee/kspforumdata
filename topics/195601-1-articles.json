Granted, they are trained astronauts but being tidy is hardly rocket science and the ISS is far more cluttered and cramped (so more things likely to go in said eyes) than I would expect a luxury space liner to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get the concern but I would take a different approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor zero-g activity rooms where the idea is to be moving around, I would give passengers a locker to stow any small personal items in and have a dress code for that room which would basically boil down to tracksuits or sweatshirt-and-pants.\u00A0No shoes, no belts, no zips or buttons or other loose fastenings.\u00A0Not so very different to typical sportswear on Earth in other words, especially for contact sports, or sports like trampolining, where you really don\u0027t want to be wearing anything that might get caught on something or someone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor lounge areas, I would provide areas to store\u00A0loose items - think of the netting on the back of airline seats - and give passengers plenty of warning before zero-g so that they can drop things off at their cabins if need be. The space liner equivalent of the \u0027stowing personal items and returning your trays to their upright position\u0027 routine familiar to any present day\u00A0air passenger.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn both cases you adapt the familiar (and therefore acceptable and reasonable) rather than impose the new and overzealous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelmets are an interesting one. I can see arguments for and against them, depending on how they\u0027re designed. It\u0027s not much good having a helmet that protects its wearer at the expense of\u00A0causing greater injury to anyone that they collide with, for example.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFloor carpeting would be cleaned regularly\u00A0 over a multi-month voyage so I don\u0027t see this as being a big problem. Besides, zero-g conditions will required some kind of forced ventilation anyway to keep air moving around the ship, so why not put the intake vents for that ventilation at floor level and make use of zero-G time to auto-vacuum the carpets?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCushioning the walls - again I understand your point but as I said I think a better approach is to\u00A0design your rooms to remove the obvious zero-G hazards, give passengers a means to anchor themselves to the floor and then provide specific areas for the more confident or adventurous passengers to zoom around without damaging themselves or others.

After all you can go running anywhere (including this liner when it\u2019s under thrust) but you can\u2019t get easily get\u00A0that zero-G experience anywhere \u00A0but space -\u00A0not for more than a few minutes at a time anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what does zero-G give you as an experience? My immediate thoughts are: that floating in midair feeling, the challenge of manoeuvring in three dimensions and the challenge of aiming something at a person moving in three dimensions. You can probably come up with more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what kind of activities would take advantage of those experiences? I have some ideas, again you\u2019ll probably have more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The Tube.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically a long enclosed space for one\u00A0passenger at a time\u00A0to float along. Either transparent so you can see outside or using VR to simulate a view outside. Either way the idea is that you start yourself moving and then just keep going... and going... and going, till you get to the other end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Climbing walls\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could have some pretty funky climbing experiences in zero-G, including crawling along the ceiling Spider-Man style. And if you overreach and fall off the wall, or just need to take a break and hang for a bit - well that\u2019s not a problem in zero-G.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Obstacle courses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA variation on The Tube but with padded obstacles in the way to manoeuvre around. Challenge yourself or\u00A0compete against other passengers to post the quickest times through the course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Dodgeball.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a padded room played with a lightweight sponge ball and appropriate PPE, I actually think zero-G dodgeball would be a lot of fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaserTag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically the Battle Room from Ender\u2019s Game (the book - no idea how it worked in the film).
