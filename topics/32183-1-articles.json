H/N will push you forward/backward, J/L translates sideways (pushes your ship, nose keeps pointing straight ahead if balanced), I/K translates up and down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this to work you have to have thrusters pointing in all directions, easiest is 3 (preferrably 4) thruster blocks (RV-105 RCS, white block with 4 black nozzles) arranged around your center of mass, one in each direction. When building a rocket just click symmetry to 4 and slap them onto your hull. If you\u0027re building something that doesn\u0027t have a round hull you might have to place them manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your RCS thrusters are off your center of mass they\u0027ll start to spin you as well as push you (physics at work), you can have ASAS enabled while using RCS but a lot of people feel that it wastes too much of your monopropellant.
