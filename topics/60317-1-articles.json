Moderators feel free to move it if you believe somewhere else would be more appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to scan through the Gameplay Questions from time to time and offer a tip or two, especially to newcomers who are hitting the learning curve of the vanilla game for the first time. I don\u0027t have anything particularly against mods, but my experience with them is very limited compared with my knowledge of the vanilla game and the basic physics of interplanetary travel. Lately, I\u0027ve found that a lot of mod-related questions are coming up, and though they are legitimate requests for assistance, I can\u0027t help but feel it\u0027s a totally different kind of help you\u0027re looking for if you\u0027ve installed a mod that you don\u0027t fully understand or that\u0027s created bugs that you need to work around, compared with just getting to grips with the core game. It seems like the rookies are being lumped in with the old-guard, and I can see that being a little intimidating to new arrivals on the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt occurs to me that having two Q\u0026amp;A rooms, one for modded and one for unmodded versions of the game, might be the answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve expressed myself brilliantly here, but if anyone thinks they get what I mean maybe they can say it better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T16:12:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt occurs to me that having two Q\u0026amp;A rooms, one for modded and one for unmodded versions of the game, might be the answer.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo thank you.

The forums are kind of borked as far as organization. There are too many categories and it results in overwhelmed newbs piling in and posting everything in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexample. We have a forum forum. Did you know that? This technically should be there. That said, less than a half percent of the active forum population (about 5000 right now) browses there. Fan works only has one percent. If this thread got moved, it\u0027d be gone. The activity would flatline, and \u0027proper categorization\u0027 ceases to be any different than rule-supported thread burying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the forums need some tweaking to make more parts of them see more activity. Mod related questions should be directed more to addon general or addon support (which, unfortunate as it is, lots of humans don\u0027t think and don\u0027t get that addon=mod) rather than gameplay suggestions (though there are some reasonable exceptions). Ultimately, many mods change gameplay behavior, which then changes the nature of the question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo should they get split? no. Humans are lazy and don\u0027t want to navigate through more subforums. That would probably make the new section neglected, not counting the stock elitists who would purposely avoid it and not help, or troll.

Sometimes the question is borderline (includes a mod but might not be dependent upon it) and we may feel that it\u0027s more likely to get help if it stays here. Or there was one thread recently where the question was answered before I found it, so the thread was effectively dead and there seemed to be no reason to move it. Or, we might simply have not run across a thread that needs moving yet, as we are volunteers and monitor the forum on irregular schedules when we have time, and not all of us read every sub-forum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you see something that you think is in the wrong place, just hit the little triangular report button to call the attention of the mod team to it.
