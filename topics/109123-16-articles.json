(worlds most over engineered cubic oct strut)\n\nThis may be too late (I was just reviewing the thread after being away for a week) but the ATM was launched on top of the Skylab, then moved to its position on the side once in orbit. I screwed up my \u0022Starlab\u0022 and launched it with the ATM already on the side with some counterweights and a horrendously huge fairing. Feel free to learn from my mistake.\n\n![9801796.jpg](https://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/IMAGES/HIGH/9801796.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T22:46:29Z","Content":"The third kerballed mission in the Odin space program and the first flight of the Command/Service Module (CSM) with the Munar Excursion Module (MEM): [Odin IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_9)\n\nThe launch itself was almost uneventful, the Sleipnir V booster worked as expected. A small explosion occured during first stage separation that did not influence to remaing ascend. After orbital insertion the crew spent one orbit with system checks before separating the CSM and preparing for MEM extraction. The CSM turned around, docked with the MEM and used it\u0027s RCS to pull it away from the S-IVB stage.\n\nThe next day was spent with checks of the MEM and several test firings of the Service Propulsion System (SPS). On day two board engineer Bill Kerman entered the MEM to power up it\u0027s systems. Pilot Valentina Kerman followed and after several more checks they undocked and took the MEM on it\u0027s first kerballed flight. They moved about two kilometers away before heading back to again dock the two spacecraft. \n\nDay three started with another test firing of the SPS. After moving to a higher orbit the MEM undocked again and Valentina and Bill took it on a more thorough test ride. Using the MEM descend engine they moved over 30 kilometers away from the CSM. On their return leg they seperated the ascend stage of the MEM and used it\u0027s engine to dock with the CSM. Valentina and Bill Kerman then did another EVA to transfer back to the CSM. \n\nAfter undocking from the ascend stage the crew spent eight more day in space, testing their equipment, navigation and the SPS. On the eleventh day the SPS fired one last time to intiate reentry. The capsule separated from the service module and splashed down close to the KSC only ten minutes later. \n\nThe mission was the second manned launch of a Sleipnir V rocket and it proved the MEM worthy of kerballed spaceflight. Further tests on the Odin 10 mission will prepare the MEM for its ultimate goal, landing on the Mun.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

After two hours of system checks it was time for Trans-Munar Injection (TMI). The S-IVB stage fired up and put the craft a free return trajectory to the Mun. Shortly after completing the burn, the CSM separated, turned around and docked with the MEM. It then used it\u0027s RCS to pull the MEM away from the spent stage. \n\nAfter a one day trip to the Mun the Service Propulsion System (SPS) fired up and put the spaceship into a 52kmx47km munar orbit. After serveral orbits around the Mun checking systems Commander Valentina Kerman and Munar Module Pilot Bill Kerman entered the MEM and activated it\u0027s systems. They then used the MEM\u0027s RCS to pull away from the CSM and intiate a simulated landing. Using the descent engine they lower the MEM orbit to a point where powered descent would beginn. But instead of landing on the Mun, they jettisoned the descent stage and used the ascend engine to rendezvous with the CSM. After five hours of thorough testing the ascend stage docked with the CSM and Bill and Valentina again entered the Command Module.\n\nAfter undocking the crew spent another day in munar orbit before they again fired up the SPS for the trans-kerbular injection. The engine worked as expected and put them on perfect return trajectory. \n\nAnother day later the capsule spashed down on kerbin after five days in space. The crew returned savely back to Kerbin and now ready for the big mission!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
