The Grand Tour. Single launch from Kerbin orbit (assembly on orbit obviously), visit every landable body in the system and return - with crew and science! I will be attempting this without ISRU, as this is my last attempt at mastering the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation before moving on to ISRUs, fueling depots and permanent bases for good. The first and most important step is determining the route and landers. I have made prototype landers and a suggested route, and I am posting it here so you can give suggestions to improve them, or to get ideas for your own missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun and Minmus are done with the Ion Lander, detailed later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first interplanetary trip will be Eve, since it is close and requires the most massive lander.

Tested using Hyperedit, rated for 500m landing altitude (did not test sea level). Requires a decent gravity turn to make it into orbit. Includes a small deorbit module that has 84 m/s delta-v. Starting orbit: anything it can survive heat-wise, or about 150 km circular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom eve, it\u0027s logical to take the trip to Moho. Instead of bringing the whole mothership (MS), I modified my ion powered lander with extra fuel and engines to bring TWR up to be able to land on Moho. It will be taking the trip to Moho and back to Eve alone. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/rkdlrr5erls3tpu/IonTugMoho.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oMyBdB2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oMyBdB2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5hGib2g.png\u0022 alt=\u00225hGib2g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal mass: 6.8 tons with Moho tanks, 3.8 after it discards them on Moho.

Add 3.4 tons of monoprop, some crew, structural etc. and the entire payload should be less than 100 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonnage summary: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve 40.6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilly \u002B Moho 6.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna 3.3\u002B0.9(xe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke 0.9(xe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe 8.2\u002B0.9(xe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo 6.4\u002B0.9(xe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVall,Bop,Pol 2.4 (initial) \u002B 0.9(xe) \u002B 2x(1.7\u002B0.9(xe))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres,Eeloo 2x(1.7)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I am not counting Mun and Minmus is because the refueling tank (0.9t xe) doesn\u0027t need to be moved at all and can be discarded immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo sum up route: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- From LKO, take the ion lander and land on Mun and Minmus, rendezvous with MS back in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Transfer to Eve, land and discard the 40-ton lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Take the ion lander, land on Gilly, continue to Moho, get back to Eve and rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Transfer to Duna, land on it, take ion lander, transfer and land on Ike, rendezvous with MS on Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Transfer to Jool. Order of landings depends on the orientation of the moons. Basically park the MS somewhere, take the tug and push the landers in position in turn, land and rendezvous with the tug, return to MS to refuel and pick up next lander. After Jool, dump the ion lander as it will be pretty useless at these distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Transfer to Dres, land with the FarLander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Same with Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Back to Kerbin. At this point the only objective is to land back on Kerbin with the crew and science intact. Possibly with only minor course corrections and a heavy aerobrake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did test most of these, excluding Moho lander. Will need to run some tests on it as it only has ~1.1 TWR on Moho at arrival. It does have some monoprop though, so I\u0027m thinking of constant altitude landing with monoprop assisted suicide burn at the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not yet attempted to design the mothership. It will probably be nukes with many stages, plus possibly an initial super-heavy chemical stage for the Kerbin-\u0026gt;Eve transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T16:45:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome! This really needs more attention since these are all very efficient designs. It\u0027s amazing that you were able to get full science capability in such small mass landers. One thing you might be able to do better is ditch the RCS and use a separate RCS tug to dock and undock, saving precious weight on your landers. I think I\u0027ve got you beat on mass, but at the cost of not bringing a materials bay or goo down to the surface anywhere. We have the same plan for the mothership and order of the planets, too, except I might do Dres before Jool. How many parts are your landers all together?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, if you add a pressurized pod for the Moho transfer, you\u0027ll qualify for the Jool 5 challenge (shameless plug) since one of the rules is no seats for interplanetary transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Teutooni","CreatedById":76518,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T05:22:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks! I know sitting in an external seat for years is indeed kinda fishy. Actually, sitting in a tiny single seat pod would probably not be much better, realistically. I might redesign the Moho part at some point, since it happens early in the trip it might be reasonable to bring a dedicated lander, instead of slapping more fuel and engines on the sides of the tug. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RCS tug is a great idea too. The reason the reusable landers have RCS is some landings actually need them for that little bit of extra TWR and delta-v to make landings on Moho/Vall/Mun even possible. I did the Moho landing, TWR was 1.00-1.02 with the ions, the RCS brought it up to ~1.1, which made the landing possible. I reckon redesigning most of the landers so they don\u0027t need RCS and to have a separate RCS tug would probably make total mass a little lower and be more convenient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the Jool-5, does it matter if the interplanetary transfer in a seat does not actually involve any part of a normal Jool-5 mission?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T06:31:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI did test most of these, excluding Moho lander.
