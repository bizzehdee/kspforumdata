have to say no since i never liked the realism mods too much.\u00A0 I gave them a solid try, and while i enjoyed the initial challenge of actually doing anything (lets face it, its not easy to make something get into orbit irl let alone go to mars or any other planet), the mods just made exploration not all that much fun, and frankly, i enjoy actually going to other planets (and having massed battles with capital ships, starfighters, tanks, ect) much more then having to meticulously engineer every single lifter stage (and getting a puny 60t corvette, let alone a 200t carrier thats as big as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E into orbit in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E is IMPOSSIBLE).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually think that teh stock game is in a perfect state as it is, interplanetary travel is more then possible, but it still takes enough engineering and everything to pull it off.\u00A0 With realism mods there is way more time and effort spent just designing vessels, and way less time spent actually exploring the universe (and battles).\u00A0 Its probably just me, but i actually see KSP as a sci-fi game that has technology between WW2 and the cold war.\u00A0 Stock combat is pretty much WW2 kinetic impactors or primitive guided missiles, engines are more or less cold war tech minus ion and a few others, and well, you are in a small scale solar system where reaching anywhere can be done with said primitive tech.\u00A0 Absolutely best game ive ever played since i can have my battles, explore the planets (by deploying tanks and fighting over em), and well i can design every single craft from ground up (one thing ive always loved in games is making your own crafts and not being given a choice from x number of ships/whatnot)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nosirrbro","CreatedById":69814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T15:52:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as I still get Kerbals and Kerbin
