I assume this isn\u0027t much different on Eve. Now, what if I ascended from the Evian surface at 2-3 km above what passes for sea-level, I would still need ... 5-6 km Delta-V ... ?

Also, your terminal velocity will be relatively high; in RSS, on Venus (so only ~1g of gravity, but 92 atm of pressure) macallo had a rocket that had a terminal velocity of 150 m/s, so on Eve it will be much higher, since higher gravity and lower air pressure.

I seem to have a problem with rockets flipping when I build them tall - they\u0027re fine at first but up a few km they flip tail over nose as soon as the nose diverts a few degrees from surface prograde. This, by the way, is following a gradual gravity-turn-like ascent profile including throttling down to maintain efficient airspeed. The only way to combat this is to load up the rear with fins, which I\u0027d rather not have to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other day it dawned on me that it seems to be because fuel empties from top to bottom - which results in the top getting lighter, the CoM dropping, and creating a situation where the nose of my rocket would much rather be trailing. I confirmed it by transferring fuel up during ascent and stability was preserved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this truly a significant factor in this behavior, or are there other factors at play to be more concerned with?
