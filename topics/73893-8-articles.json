Do we really want to live out some hypothetical where Kethane distributes ModStats, MechJeb distributes a disabler, and then the two start eradicating each other? Do we want to set a precedent where that kind of interaction between mods is accepted? ModStatistics is controversial, which is to say that some people like it and some people don\u0027t. But I don\u0027t think anybody wants to see mods start fighting it out in GameData.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, your distribution scheme for ModStatistics is fairly close to spyware/crapware, based on the following criteria:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The auto-replication code (which wouldn\u0027t be necessary if there was a single instance of ModStatistics, in it\u0027s own GameData directory, you know like if it was explicitly installed by a user.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It defaults to opt-in (although you\u0027ve said you\u0027re fixing this), but this wouldn\u0027t be an issue if the user had to explicitly opt-in in the first place by downloading the mod separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Unique identification of the user (addressed further below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure I subscribe to your slippery slope argument of e.g. MechJeb including a ModStatistics disabling plugin, since the point of the ModStatistics disabling plugins are to disable something that was shoved into the user\u0027s computer in the first place. That concern could be addressed by re-licensing the disabling plugin using a \u0027No License\u0027/ARR license, and not granting any 3rd parties distribution rights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majiir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majiir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a bit of hyperbole. The \u0022ID\u0022 that\u0027s sent is a \u003Cem\u003Erandom number\u003C/em\u003E. So yes, when a user plays KSP multiple times, their reports are all known to originate from the same user.

It could be reasonable to hash the incoming IDs, much like passwords are encrypted in databases.

It identifies it at home, it identifies it at work, it identifies it at the coffee shop (fun fact, a whole lot of work went into designing privacy extensions into IPv6 because of this concern with MAC addresses). Hashing it does nothing useful (since the purpose of a hashing function is to produce the same output for a given input every time). I know it seemed like a really good idea at the time, but this, coupled with encouraging mod authors to bundle your DLL in their distributions, really makes this, potentially quite useful, plugin look like spyware/crapware.
