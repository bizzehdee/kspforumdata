Ive Reuploaded to compensate for the rear wheel being too far back.. the longer wheelbase was preventing takeoff at 35m/s..\n\nReuploaded and tested.. \n\nLanding works fine as long as you make sure your hitting the ground at or below takeoff speed.. the narrow wheelbase bounces a little but she\u0027ll settle down nicely\n\nTakeoff speed is around **35**ms but she\u0027ll float happily below that once airborne\n\nStalls are nothing to be afraid of.. especially going vertical.. as once she slips in reverse.. control has already been restablished and will glide happily in any direction to regain course and speed\n\nId love to hear any feedback positive and negative\n\n**DOWNLOAD LINK @ KerbalX:**\n\n[**http://kerbalx.com/Overland/Ultralight-Trike**](http://kerbalx.com/Overland/Ultralight-Trike)\n\n![1JGJf5f.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1JGJf5f.jpg)\n\n![IdB1t7d.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IdB1t7d.jpg)\n\n![glt2daF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/glt2daF.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T03:04:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 03:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Overland**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T11:28:48Z","Content":"You call that ... an ultralight?\n\nI\u0027m wondering what you\u0027ll come up with when you build an ultraheavy."},{"CreatedByName":"Overland","CreatedById":119812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T11:35:45Z","Content":"Apologies -

BACKSPACE)\n\nI\u0027ll upload the craft once ive finished tweaking it \n\nthe alternate design is also a forward trike vs the reverse wheelbase of the original.. better ground handling at higher speeds.. best suited to get places rather than survey the terrain as the craft floats overhead.. 2 similar craft for 2 different roles\n\n![ah6XLBR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ah6XLBR.jpg)\n\n![ek2S9dK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ek2S9dK.jpg)**KTP1001A \u0026 KTP1002A** identification plates not included unfortunately -
