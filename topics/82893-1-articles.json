That wouldn\u0027t be a problem since they can stay on that trajectory for long time without spending any substantial dv, but to get on the cycler, you need to spend that inefficient dv on your ship - and you can get to Duna significantly cheaper. Kerbals don\u0027t really need to spend the travel on large space station, having stations on Duna and Kerbin orbits is much more useful and flexible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd most importantly, the cycler orbit is extremely unstable.

If I were attempting this I would set the cycler\u0027s orbit so it never enters the SoI of either planet and instead just comes fairly close to it, it should be much more stable that way. Have low mass shuttles to do the actual SoI entry and exit, but remember that these ships will need more dV than for a more conventional transfer to the planet.

I\u0027m not sure if it is possible.

The position of intercept moves by 42.7 degrees but the deflection should send the ship from descending leg to another ascending leg so the angle difference is smaller because both intercept and ejection angles subtract from the phase shift.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-26T11:50:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2014 11:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psyper","CreatedById":90641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T13:56:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECyclers would be useful if you use lifesupport mods - have a large ship with crew quarters, large lifesupport supplies and a means to recycle them (hydroponics?) then all you need to do is get the crew launched from kerbin and meet the cycler as its passes through the system - you spend the same amount of dv but because your ship doesn\u0027t have any lifesupport on it then it can be smaller than a ship required for the journey - the crew spend their time and the resources on their trip out to duna - course correct the cycler at duna and then eject their small craft and do an aerobreak. meanwhile the cycler is on its way back to kerbin recharging its lifesupport.
