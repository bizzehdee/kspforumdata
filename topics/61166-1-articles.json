I\u0027d really appreciate it if a moderator (or whoever it is that can remove things from the Spaceport) could remove the two versions which are incomplete- they have 0 downloads, and no ratings, and you can also tell because the \u0022How To Use\u0022 sections are incomplete (but it is complete on my other upload).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEsvDefcon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just in case it is unclear, when I hit the \u0022delete\u0022 button, it says that my addon has been removed, when in fact it hasn\u0027t, and that\u0027s why I need help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T15:00:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have sorted this for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EsvDefcon","CreatedById":62949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T15:46:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, really appreciate it! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nereid","CreatedById":68815,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T22:09:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis happened to me, too.
