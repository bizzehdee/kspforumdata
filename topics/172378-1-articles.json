The nodes get activated but neither the part fails or gets destroyed by the according nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith much simpler crafts the part failures work as intended. I tried to rule out any craft naming issues but couldnt fix it. So I build a 6 node mission which shows the failure to fail, maybe someone can tell me if I did something wrong or if they experience the same problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dnmMVS-cY01VXSDr_VGt2M8-Rp2Fw2mL/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMission Download\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKind Regards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHurzelgnurk\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hurzelgnurk","CreatedById":101818,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-16T05:44:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I tested this behaviour I noticed that it may only apply on crafts that are not made in the mission builder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft File differ only in persitentId and partname though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission Builder\u00A0 part = mk1pod_4291394128\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSandbox \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E part = mk1pod_4290768578\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t know if thats normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rafa Hdz","CreatedById":166762,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-16T22:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Hurzelgnurk!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you built your saturn in sandbox and then moved the craft file to your mission?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hurzelgnurk","CreatedById":101818,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T02:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAye, that\u0027s what I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hurzelgnurk","CreatedById":101818,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-29T12:14:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersists in 1.4.2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
