Kerbals are light so a small puff (quick tap on the key) is all you need to get going.

Also, there\u0027s a lot of EVA propellant in those packs (600 dV with just a kerbal) so you can experiment in space there is also an EVA tutorial in scenarios (accessible from the main menu)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-27T09:32:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry about EVA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust quicksave before you go out, and try practice flying around and going back in next time.
