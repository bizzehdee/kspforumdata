I haven\u0027t tried that plug-in (it requires multiple installs, not something I feel like doing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m finding air-breaking very annoying, since I can\u0027t leave the vessel \u0027alone\u0027 (at least not for any length of time) as it\u0027s in atmo, or going through atmo (the whole air part of air-breaking) and since I messed up and ran out of fuel, I\u0027ve been waiting (so far) about 20-in-game days (and probably have 10 or 20 more to go). I can\u0027t reverse the launch as I\u0027ve closed the game and re-opened it, so I\u0027m stuck baby-sitting this single mission (more or less) while I wait for it to descend. While I don\u0027t PLAN on missions taking this long in the future, it\u0027s entirely possible I\u0027ll mess up again and they will. So... I thought it\u0027d be nice to be running another mission while keeping an eye on this one, but I don\u0027t want to risk losing this ship or have it not lose altitude or whatever happens when I leave it alone.... I could (and have) played other games while waiting, watched TV shows, etc. But, I really want to play KSP and not risk losing this ship or having it stay in orbit forever, neither is desirable. So, multi-screen for multi-missions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-23T03:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nactually, if youve got beefy hardware, you can run that on *one* box...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-24T15:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223639467\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186621\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221563854177\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277721\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stone Blue\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/22/2019 at 9:56 PM, Stone Blue said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nactually, if youve got beefy hardware, you can run that on *one* box... \u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile true, this is still a pale alternative to actual and proper multi-monitor support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing a multi-monitor user this is something I\u0027ve dreamed about in nearly every semi-complex game I\u0027ve played.\u00A0 Why am I limited to a single viewpoint, on a single screen?\u00A0 (or the appalling and disgusting \u0027span a single view across multiple screens with bezels in the way\u0027 option)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing technical is preventing the use of multiple render targets, each for specific views of the game.\u00A0 Should not need to run multiple copies of the game to do this, or even use multiple processes/applications.\u00A0 Should be doable entirely from within a single application, natively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have three monitors normally.\u00A0 Would love to put map view on one, all of MechJebs / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E info displays / control panels on another (virtual cockpit?), and leave the central one for the flight-scene viewport.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I realize that my setup is not the norm, and likely pretty far down in the minority list, and as such, likely not worth spending developer time on the feature.\u00A0 Multi-monitor is more common then it was in the CRT days, but is still not quite the \u0027standard\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-31T20:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also dream of the map view on my second monitor.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Three Beard","CreatedById":200381,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-20T20:04:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMe too!
