This is a great community so far, already helped me on a few issues I have had.\n\nA little bit about me: I am 28, ex-Army, born and raised in NW Georgia. I migrated south a little over a year ago and now live in southern Florida. I love building things, sandbox style games, and explosions. Kerbal Space Program just about makes my face melt with awesomeness.\n\nI have a Youtube channel, where I post videos, mainly Minecraft, but I have started a KSP Let\\\u0027s Play recently. If you are interested in it, check my profile or ask for a link. This isn\\\u0027t a \\\u0027view my channel\\\u0027 or \\\u0027gimme a sub\\\u0027 post, so don\\\u0027t worry.\n\nI\\\u0027d also like to ask if anyone has any mods/plugins they would suggest for a beginner/newer player. I have managed to reach orbit, land on Mun, and return to Kerbin, so the very basics I can do, but I\\\u0027d like to find some good mods that are noob-proof, so to speak.\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nSporks"},{"CreatedByName":"Radion","CreatedById":3273,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T18:58:53Z","Content":"Welcome to the Forums!
