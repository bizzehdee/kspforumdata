I pulled it up and found... that it was stillperfectly targeted to a Jool aerocapture from the midcourse maneuver I had done many weeks ago (my time). So I just had to carefully sneak it across the Sphere of Influence boundary at 1x speed, and let it fall in toward Jool. Below we see it passing near Laythe on its way in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FujR30b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FujR30b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we see the aerocapture at Jool, burning through the atmosphere at about 114 kilometers altitude.

Once in its final Laythe orbit of 80 to 90 kilometers, the Tug\u0027s main tank was over 63% full. Later, I\u0027ll take that fuel and drop most of it off at Laythe Space Station. I separated the Tug and targeted Base 2 into the Fido Bay area of Dansen Island, a few kilometers north of the current Laythe base site. Deorbiting was done by four 24-77 engines fed by two FL-T200 tanks mounted on top of the heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1uuZLzS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221uuZLzS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBase 2 comes burning in towards Fido Bay...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5WWGRrH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225WWGRrH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heat shield is dropped, and then it was just a matter of waiting for the right moment to pop the chutes. First came the two drogue chutes. The landing gear were also deployed at this time. The landing gear are needed because otherwise the heavy weight of the base would blow the tires upon landing (I suppose that would not really matter here because I have kerbals on site to fix the wheels).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ipJTWWV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ipJTWWV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the drogue chutes fully open, the eight main chutes are popped out in reefed condition.

As you can see, the Base has three 4-kerbal Hitchhiker pods, one to serve as bunkhouse, one in the center to serve as the dayroom work area, and the other with more laboratory and improved life-support equipment. On top is a 2-kerbal control pod as the operations center. The modules are connected with \u0022tunnels\u0022 that I envision allowing the kerbals to access the different modules without having to suit up. You\u0027ll notice that there are eight roundified RCS tanks on the base, but no RCS quads... those represent tanks for various consumables. The base has eight RTGs for power, but also has some solar panels that can be delpoyed if they are running experiments or recycling equipment that requires more power during the daytime. Currently, a lot of the empty space in the modules is filled with boxes of supplies, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude!

I didn\u0027t really mean for Base 2 to be a fully-mobile exploration base... I only included the wheels so it could lumber along and be moved slowly to new positions if needed. But it turned out that it could easily travel along at up to 20 m/s on the relatively smooth terrain of the Laythe Base area. Thompbles originally wanted the new base to be located north of the current base, but there was a low ridge separating that location from the current base, so he had Kurt drive the base southeast to see how it looked over there. They wanted the new base to be located at least 2.3 km from the current base to prevent lag...er, I mean, to be sure it was located on higher ground in case of any future tsunamis. But the land to the east seemed a bit steep, so Thompbles had Kurt drive it over to the south to see if it looked good there. But the elevations there were not great, so Thompbles had Kurt move it back to the east.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Will you make up your mind?!

The base was oriented so that the operations center window has a nice view of Jool on the eastern horizon, and the landing legs were extended for extra stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dvxv0bY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dvxv0bY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this, Alarm Clock reminded me that I needed to take care of the plane shift maneuvers for the BirdDogs and, one day later, the Vall Expedition. These burns required 135 m/s and 142 m/s of delta-V. I was able to target the BirdDogs in toward a 114 km periapsis at Jool, but the targeting of the Vall ship was encountering Tylo, so I had to settle for an apoapsis further out for now (I\u0027ll fix that closer in). After these maneuvers, the Triple Tugs of the BirdDogs had 7% of the fuel left in their rear tanks (the tanks of the triple tug adapter were dry...and I had to move fuel back into the central tanks of the GasStations where it had been sucked out -- I really wish ships would remember when you\u0027ve set parts of them to NOT crossfeed fuel). The Triple Tugs of the Vall Expedition had only 2% of the fuel left in their rear tanks. This was fine -- these tanks are often used up in the boost out of Kerbin orbit... but the ships did start out with the additional fuel in the tanks of the triple tug adapters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next thing to take care of was the Secondary Base \u002B Fido payload that was also heading in toward the Jool system. This payload consists of another Laythe base that is like the original, along with a slightly more compact version of the Fido rover. The intention is to drop this somewhere on Laythe as an alternate base that kerbals can explore from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Secondary Base\u0027s trajectory to Jool was such that the descending node of the trajectory relative to Jool\u0027s orbit occured immediately before entering into Jool\u0027s SOI. Back when I launched this, this arrangement seemed like a good thing because it meant that the plane shift burn could be done as far from the sun as possible. But, it turned out not to be as good as I\u0027d hoped, since this also delayed my fine targeting burn until the ship was quite close to Jool, so that took much more fuel than normal. Ah, well, the Tug had plenty of fuel. Below, we see me targeting the incoming ship using Conic Draw Mode 0 (which is easily set on the fly using the Improved Maneuver Nodes mod that I love). This lets me tweak the maneuver node (off in the distance there) while I\u0027m focused in close on the Jool system to see exactly what the trajectory looks like close to Jool. The only problem I have with the process is that shifting the focus to Jool is not easy when you have the Jool system full of dozens of ships and probes -- trying to double-click on Jool to focus on it often leads to selecting a spacecraft instead. It would be nice if the little pop-up menu that appears when you click on Jool ALSO had the choice \u0022Focus on Jool\u0022. And, while we are mentioning dirt-simple fixes to the KSP interface, how about adding a \u0022Go to Tracking Station\u0022 button to the menu that comes up when you press ESC? It\u0027s annoying to have to \u0022Go toSpace Center\u0022 and wait a long time for that view to load just so I can click on the Tracking Station. AND, while we are at it, it would be nice if they changed the direction the planets rotate around in the \u0022wait\u0022 icon in the bottom-right... it looks like it hould go the other way. What? Quit complaining and get on with it? OK, OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sGvPpDn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sGvPpDn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I was targeting the aerocapture at Jool, Laythe kept getting in the way. OK, have it your own way... I\u0027ll send the ship in for a direct aerocapture at Laythe. Normally I avoid doing a direct-to-Laythe aerocapture because it seems more unrealistic to try to burn off all that interplanetary speed screeching to a halt in a short span of Laythe\u0027s atmosphere. I expect that when reentry heat and damge are added, even doing the Jool/Laythe two-step my be too hot to handle. We\u0027ll probably have to do some engine breaking, then skim high up through Jool\u0027s atmosphere, slowing down just enough to get captured in a huge orbit...then perform a couple more aerobrakings through Jool\u0027s atmosphere to lower our orbit. What a pain. Is that how you Dangerous Reentry guys have to get to Jool?

The secondary base will remain in the high elliptical orbit for now until I decide where to drop it (so that any plane-shift needed will be cheaper). The comsats were manueuvered up into approximately 10000 km cicular orbits. Hopefully now it\u0027s less likely that all of them won\u0027t all be bunched up on the same side of the planet when we need them. Yes, yes, I could try to tweak them all into perfect orbits that will keep them nicely spaced...but that\u0027s not my particular idea of fun. So I\u0027ll just throw more satellites at the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9QQWifR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229QQWifR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cSPsd0f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cSPsd0f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up, Kerbal Alarm Clock started nagging me about Laythe Tug 6 that was returning to Kerbin. My burn sending this tug out of the Jool system had been sub-optimal, but a relatively small midcourse burn set it up nicely for a Kerbin intercept, and I did some final targeting to do an aerocapture pass at 29.5 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lnKWiAf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lnKWiAf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the white-hot goodness of compressed palsma provides a light show over Kerbin. The aerocapture resulted in an elliptical orbit with an apoapsis of 552 km. I then rasied the periapsis a bit, did an aerobraking pass, and raised the periapsis again, and made a final aerobraking pass, then raised the periapsis out of the atmosphere with the Tug in moderatly low orbit, ready for refueling and re-use. But the design became obsolete in the time it took the Tug to travel to Jool and back. All those probe cores were there to provide extra torque...but now the old SAS unit provides plenty of torque, and all those probe cores are just a huge drain on electricity. Maybe I\u0027ll just deorbit some of these old tugs (ones that have parachutes on the nukes, anyway), and use the parts for upgraded tugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PhceKv9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PhceKv9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9oUKeOl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229oUKeOl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now for the main event: The Vall Expedition and replacement BirdDogs are heading into the Jool system. Even though the BirdDogs were boosted away from Kerbin first, the Vall Expedition is the first to arrive at Jool\u0027s sphere of influence, four days ahead of the BirdDogs. The small high gain antennas on the ships are designed to communicate with the huge high-transmission-power, high-reception-sensitivity antennas at KSC, but once the ships get close enough together, they can start communicating with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022*static*...calling Laythe Base.

I mentioned that the flimsy connections between the triple tugs were sufficient because the forces were the same on all three parts under thrust. But, during aerocapture, the different forces acting on the separate parts made them wiggle around a fair amount...and wobble around a LOT if I tried to use physical time warp. So, the laggy ride through Jool\u0027s atmosphere had to be done at 1x and took a loooooong time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/M7PkDBf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022M7PkDBf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Em-Emi?

I\u0027ll let you keep my girl up late talking some other night.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Roger, Hawk. Talk to you later. Night, Hellou.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext in came the BirdDogs with their multiple GasStations...laggy, but not as laggy as the Vall Ex. ship. Again, I had to sit through the looong laggy aerocapture at 1x to minimize the shaking of the ship. The aerocapture altitude was 114.5 km, which placed the apoapsis a little way out beyond Laythe\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vS7ZFRV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vS7ZFRV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nVaAAgE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nVaAAgE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are the orbits after the aerocaptures and apoapsis kicks of the two ships. Then I took a break. I did ponder what would be the most efficient way to get to Vall... My default method (based on what I did in my early Visiting Vall mission), was just to wait in the post-aerocapture orbit for a handy encounter with Vall. If Jool does have a powerful radiation belt, it would probably be important not to hang around in this zone any longer than necessary, even if burning extra fuel was required. And, while I hang around like this for a Laythe capture, so that Laythe\u0027s atmosphere can provide all the delta-V for speeding the ship up to Laythe\u0027s orbital velocity...in the case of going to Vall, my ships\u0027s engines are going to provide the delta-V to speed up to Vall\u0027s orbital velocity. So maybe it\u0027s all the same if I burn out at apoapsis right away to speed up to Vall\u0027s orbital speed, and then arrange a capture out there at a slower relative velocity. Or would that be losing me so gravity-assist that I get from coming at Vall from further in? BUT...I think maybe the most efficient way might be to get an aerocapture by Laythe (or an almost-aerocapture) and then proceed on to Vall from there. Has anybody done the calculations comparing these options? I was originally planning on using a save game to repeat the mission trying different methods...but this laggy beast is such a pain to work with, that ain\u0027t happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fP13qD3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fP13qD3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first ship to get an encounter was the BirdDogs. I planned a small burn to adjust the encounter and got the plot below, which may look funny until you recall that I\u0027m using conic draw mode zero, so the encounter path is down near Laythe, and the seemingly disconnected ellipse is where the ship would end up if it shot past the Laythe encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZKDvHa7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZKDvHa7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did the maneuver to encounter Laythe and tweaked the aerocapture altitude at Laythe to 24.36 km. This emptied the fuel in the rear drop tanks of the three Tugs, so I separated those as the ship headed in toward Laythe. These empty tanks should then do aerocapture and then multiple aerobrakings until they enter Laythe\u0027s atmosphere...but that wouldn\u0027t happen unless I actually focus on the tanks and follow them around. I\u0027ll probably just terminate their flights later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P5gM0sk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P5gM0sk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome reentry heating...a little plane shift with Jool as a backdrop after Laythe aerocapture...some further aerobraking and orbital maneuvers... and the BirdDogs and GasStations are safe in Laythe equatorial orbit, ready to be brought down under remote control on another day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8ewQf7h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228ewQf7h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main fuel tanks of the three Tugs are almost 90% full... plenty of fuel to bring to Laythe Space Station....... except... hmmm... ...there\u0027s no way to dock those Tugs at Laythe Station because they all have Senior docking ports, and the Station has no Senior docking ports...having been built back before Senior docking ports were developed. Bugger. I guess I should have kept one of those rear drop tanks attached, since they had standard ports on their bottoms. I COULD blow the Senior port off of the center Tug to uncover the standard port underneath...but then that Tug becomes useless for re-use pushing Senior-port payloads from Kerbin. Bugger. Ah... there is a standard port on the top of the Double GasStation in the center...so once I dump off the BirdDogs and the two side GasStations, I could use that to dock to the station...maybe it would be toooo laggy. Ah! The Tug that brought in the Secondary Base \u002B Fido is one of the upgraded old Tugs that has a standard from port, but also has a Senior port on its butt for docking on the drop tank. So I can dock THAT to the station, then bring these other tugs in individually to dock there and offload fuel in a less laggy manner. Yeah...I like that. Maybe it would have been better to plan ahead properly...but getting the job done with the tools at hand is satisfying in its own way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost immediately after the the BirdDogs got settled down in Laythe orbit, an encounter came up for the Vall Ex. ship.....at Laythe. Should I? But while fiddling with a maneuver to either dodge Laythe (the ship had earlier dodged past Laythe, getting a little pump-up to a slightly higher orbit) or maybe try for a Laythe/Vall two-step... I saw that I could get a direct Vall encounter. So I just went with the original plan and took that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I1qssra.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022I1qssra.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the maneuver setting up the close pass by Vall (about 163 km).

The right-Tug retained enough fuel to return to Kerbin. A little extra fuel from the middle-Tug, and the main ship was 100% full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NBnr99A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NBnr99A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe double Fido rover payload was separated, and then the middle Tug was separated.

The rovers were then sent off into a slightly lower orbit (by about 3 km) to get them out of Lag City.

And on top is the Vall Lander. This Lander doesn\u0027t drop any tanks, so it can be used to go down to Vall and back multiple times if it\u0027s refueled.

Anyway...waste not, want not. Be prepared. And other clich\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3StIlJ8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223StIlJ8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhat disconcertingly, when I switched away to some other location (taking care of a different ship) and returned my focus to the landing site, the collection of empty fuel tanks exploded a little ways into the sky and fell back.

This is because I found out during engineering testing that a single light located above the hatch (which seemed like a good idea) causes the kerbals to bump their heads upon exiting the hatch and getting rather violently thrown to the ground. Which never looks good on world-wide television. Unfortunately for the boys on Laythe, their new Base 2 has exactly that kind of arrangement. Very embarrassing. And I believe I\u0027ve had this happen in the past on a ship in orbit around Kerbin...and the kick from the bumping the light caused the kerbals to go sailing off a considerable distance from the ship when they went out for EVA. So heed well my warning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Hellou joins Emilynn on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022I\u0027m on the surface. Hello to everybody on Kerbin!

I notice you didn\u0027t plant a flag.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Ah, you noticed that, did you? Planting flags is under Hellou\u0027s department. I handle the piloting, half the rover driving, and the repair of equipment and wheels. Hellou handles flags, the other half of the rover driving, science, and explosives.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Umm...I forgot to bring out the flag.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Wait...explosives? Why explosives? Is this some geology thing?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022No. Well, I have some small charges for that as well. But the explosives are mainly for blasting a shelter into the ice if we need to hide from any radiation storms. I can blast us a nice bunker in 20 minutes flat...but I can do a much better job if I have longer. You see, we aren\u0027t lucky like you boys on Laythe with your nice atmosphere to hide under. If there\u0027s a kerbol-flare and Jool\u0027s radiation belts act up, all we have around us is vacuum.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022I thought Jools magnetic field would protect us from any kerbol-flares.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Sure, it will deflect a lot of it. You wouldn\u0027t get blasted directly like you would if your ship was out between the planets. But a lot of those high energy particles will work their way in to add to Jool\u0027s radiation belts. And if the kerbol-flare is accompanied by a strong coronal mass ejection, it would compress Jool\u0027s magnetic field and the radiation belt intensity could spike by a few orders of magnitude. Best to be under several meters of ice if that happens.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022My little Chickadee sure does that geek-speak real well. And it was a lot of fun watching her blast holes in the ice cap back on Kerbin for practice! Listen, Buzz, we\u0027re going to pack it in for the night.

I was originally thinking of putting it on Aldner Island, but the payload includes a rover, and Aldner Island (although nicely placed at the equator for a fine base location) is really not a very large island, and I thought the rover could be put to better use exploring a bigger island. So I decided to put this Base/rover combo onto the high basin area on Fredoly Island (the large island to the southwest of Dansen Island). It has a nice wide basin, easy for landing planes, and is located far from the oceans, so no danger of tsunamis. But it is located at over 13 degrees South latitude, so first I had to use the Tug (the recycled/upgraded Tug L5) to shift the orbital plane to reach 12 degrees South...and the Base\u0027s engines could handle it from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vBFnOTn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vBFnOTn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was just a matter of waiting for the right time when Fredoly Island would be lining up under the orbit, and the payload was separated from the Tug and deorbited with its four 24-77 engines.

The heat shield was separated after the drogues deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cQ16z6G.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cQ16z6G.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4oXeraM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224oXeraM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also got the main chutes out in reefed condition right after dropping the heat shield. Below we see the base/rover stack descending vertically under the fully-opened drogue chutes and the reefed main chutes. The landing legs of the base have also been deployed. Since the base was all set to land, I separated the rover at a couple thousand feet and let it freefall a bit to get it clear of the base (this whole operation has been controlled from the probe core on the top of the Fido rover), and then deployed the six parachutes on the Fido. You can see the Fido hanging from its fully-deployed parachutes with the base high above under its fully deployed chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S48q57m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022S48q57m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the Fido toucheed down, and I immediately ran it off to the side to get out from under the base, which we see descending from the Fido\u0027s viewpoint. The base landed on a slight slope, bounced a bit, and did a heart-stopping partial pirouette around on one leg before settling into place. Whew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BH52vCg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BH52vCg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe base landed a couple kilometers short of my intended target in the flat bottom of the sandy basin, but it\u0027s not tilted too badly. Now the base (Laythe Base 3) and Fido will sit and wait for me to assign a kerbal or two to use it as an exploration camp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3MFbIcs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223MFbIcs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast came the drudgery of handling the Tugs. A thankless job, but one that had to be done. So Thompbles probably had to take care of it. There was stll a lot of fuel left in the Tugs from the BirdDog ship, but those Tugs only had Senior docking ports, and Laythe Space Station has no Senior docking ports (having been sent out before they were invented). BUT, the Tug L5 that just dropped off Base 3 has a standard port on the front, and has a Senior port on the rear that it acqired during its refurbishment back at Kerbin before it was sent back to Laythe again with the Base/Fido payload. So, Tug L5 was docked to the Space Station first, then the two Tugs from the BirdDog ship were docked (after coming down from their higher orbit and dropping off the triple-tug-adapter in a slightly higher circular orbit in case I have some use for it in the future. The fuel from all of these Tugs, except what they would need to return to Kerbin, was transferred to the tanks on Laythe Space Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ql8BC8b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ql8BC8b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the fuel transfer, I separated Tug L5 (WITHOUT its upgrade module that had added the Senior docking port and a bunch of probe cores that were for extra torque...but which are not needed now that the Tug\u0027s ASAS unit mysteriously started generating torque). Tug L5 scooted out of the way, and then the remaining Tugs re-docked the upgrade adapter to the Space Station...where it will serve as a Senior docking port for any future operations needing one. The two Tugs then backed off and moved to a higher orbit to await being sent back to Kerbin. I have them docked to each other, rotated at 90 degrees, just so I\u0027ll be able to send them back as one ship (much less bother that way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ME0wWcm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ME0wWcm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TA1LPXg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TA1LPXg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s all the new assets at Laythe. The high orbits have the four comsats wandering around; the ellipticl orbit is the Tug with GasStation 5 waiting to be placed somewhere in the future; then comes the ancient Clark lander from the original Laythe expedition; then comes the orbit of the possibly useless triple-tug-adapter; then the low circular orbits close together of the Laythe Space Station and the recently released Tugs awaiting return to Kerbin. And then all the goodies on the surface. It makes me happy to look at all my goodies in place at Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bpfvtwJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bpfvtwJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so ends this installment. Oh, OK... here\u0027s a last look at our girls on Laythe readying their rover for their Big Trip. The rover is my tried-and-true eight-wheel design that has done so well for me in the past, but this one has a control cockpit (good visibility, and very high impact tolerance) for the driver, and a single-kerbal lander can that has been refurbished into a living quarters module so that the off-duty kerbal can stretch out, wash up, and ride in comfort. There is also a \u0022Granny Clampett\u0022 chair on top of the module that a kerbal could ride on to get a good view of the surrounding terrain as the rover travels along. The Fido has RCS for those unexpected moments when the rover might become airborne over a bump (but I expect the cockpit torque will be sufficient to keep the rover steady in such a case), a couple RTGs for power, and lots of bateries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3br3vcm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223br3vcm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mIAnU0K.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mIAnU0K.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-09T06:16:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2013 06:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T03:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhew!
