I\u0027m not in favour of full scale because launches to orbit and many other common tasks take a lot longer, but maybe something like twice or three times the current size.

I\u0027d also love to see some sort of camera function where Kerbals can take ingame pictures of features on bodies which you can not only share with the internet but also use them ingame. Taking pictures is a big part of real life space exploration. I think the most data coming from space is actually some sort of imagine material allthough I have no sources on that one. How about this: Planets show absolutely no features in map mode and the tracking station as long as you haven\u0027t taken pictures of them yet. You could either send a suicide mission to a red blob without knowing anything about it or visit it with unmanned probes. The closer you get the smaller the details you can take images of. So you had to map it from a far distance to get the general look of it and go much closer on features you find most interesting. Your landing site would not only be visible via a flag in the tracking station but also by the sheer detail you can see on it.
