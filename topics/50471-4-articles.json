Basically, rocky Mun fades away and is replaced by perfectly spherical gray blob.

I tried with atmo height of 135km, but after extensive testing, it looks like CelestialBody.maxAtmosphereAltitude is just for show; static pressure seems determined only by scale height (and SL pressure), and the clamping is when the exponential calculation drops below approx 0.000001, not when altitude above sea level is \u0026gt; maxAtmosphereAltitude. The only way to fix it would be to increase pressure at sea level above 1 atmosphere and then decrease CelestialBody.atmosphereMultiplier, but that would throw off the exponential curve since it looks like pressure ASL is multiplied in _before_ the exponent is applied rather than after (i.e. it\u0027s (p*e)^(-alt/scale) ). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr we could switch to the new atmosphere method?
