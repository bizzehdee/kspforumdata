I made a minimal ion glider (smallest probe, single ion, single xenon tank (empty), and a pair of Delta-Deluxe Winglets), and turned on infinite fuel. It topped out at 51km doing around 840 m/s, it also took like an hour to get up to that... which is a lot more than a single xenon tank worth of delta-V. And even that craft is technically abusing infiniglide slightly. The only possible non-cheating method left that I can\u0027t eliminate completely is a hybrid ion glider / chemical rocket... but I think it\u0027s quite unlikely you can actually lift anything with an ion glider that could then give the boost needed to allow the ions to achieve orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have already beaten that with 2 tanks of xenon and normal fuel flow.

If we don\u0027t need it to be single staged (or we somehow try to use some linguistic trick to have stages anyhow) then it\u0027s easy (any standard Eve lifter works). If we ditch the stock parts requirement we can again do it fairly easily, using any number of mods (Hooligan labs balloons, firespitter electric props, the Orion Nuclear Pulse rocket, any number of options from Interstellar).

Our whole discussion here is based on this premise, and our effort is to explore the problem space and systematically eliminate possibilities. We can, with mathematical and logical certainty say a pure chemical rocket is impossible, the math has been done. Just as I can unequivocally state that you cannot add two positive rational numbers and get a negative number. We\u0027re now exploring other possibilities, but trying to say \u0022nothing is impossible\u0022 is not only not useful, it effectively is working counter to our goal to narrow the problem space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T02:34:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETest run #3 got me 1,877 M/sec.

I\u0027m definitely not saying you\u0027re trying to use infiniglide... you\u0027re probably trying quite hard to avoid it, but I\u0027ve only found 1 way to not be leveraging infiniglide, and that is to not have control surfaces on your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust one thing to check, take your craft near the ground and nose up until you\u0027re pure vertical...

I\u0027ve realized the primary problem, we\u0027re talking past each other a bit... totally my fault. You responded to my numbers which was a test I conducted on Eve. Going back and checking, I was unclear on that. Since those are what you responded to, I assumed you were on Eve as well. Rereading your earlier posts, and looking at the picture again (to see the big BLUE planet that is totally not Purple) I realize you\u0027re still doing the Kerbin testing. You numbers suddenly make much more sense, and no longer require anything bizarre to explain them. I still worry about infiniglide polluting results when using flaps as wings... but it\u0027s significantly less of a concern to me knowing this, it\u0027s likely mostly just providing some bonus lift/speed during the early phases of the launch but at 40k on Kerbin the effects should be negligable. When I used my craft on Kerbin (Still infinite fuel cheating), it achieved orbit easily... so I\u0027m hopeful for you to get a positive result on Kerbin. My numbers unfortunately still stand for Eve though... it\u0027s just not possible to get a pure ion-craft to orbit there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
