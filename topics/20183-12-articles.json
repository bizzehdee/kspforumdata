Is that correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me that runs for Duna, Dress, Eve. For the other planets, When Theta comes to 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, my Phi angle is between 340\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and 300\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 so that I have to wait a long time before beginning burn, which means that at beginning of burn The Theta angle is less than 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, let\u0027s say around 359,5 sometimes far less than that, it decreases rapidly and the result is that I don\u0027t come close enough the planet I aimed and the intercept needs many many DV more....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is in this case, do I burn when Theta is 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, no matter how is Phi?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"demian_travis","CreatedById":90563,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T23:03:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt worked!!!!
