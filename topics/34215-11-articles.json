I say we get a station going up around Minmus at the same time, so we can have modules with more parts that way. Though dedicating everyone to a ground base only might also be interesting, it would make for a huge base. One of the biggest issues we\u0027ll face with a ground base will be the standardizing of docking ports, since they\u0027ll need to be at the same height for things to attach properly. So again, it might be better to have less people on the base just so it\u0027s less of a hassle. We definitely need to get something on and around the Mun as well, it seems logical to go there next after Minmus. After that...so many possibilities! An Eve station would be great, that\u0027s such a nice planet. Getting a ground base there too will be more difficult, but totally worth the trouble, I think. I also had an idea for getting a large interplanetary vessel built and then sending it to various places, but it might be better to hold off on that until we have a few more stations around for it to visit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T03:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I think Eve ground base I think a huge bustling port of life with cars everywhere and huge buildings towering into the sky with hydrogen balloons for support.

Esinohio, I\u0027m not sure if you video went up, please let me know and I\u0027ll make sure to add it to the playlist. As for the people going next, we\u0027ve got Hoojiwana up on deck, with Goose to follow afterwards. I\u0027ll be sending out some PMs tomorrow to make sure everyone\u0027s still on board. Hopefully the forums going down didn\u0027t affect us too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-24T08:49:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2013 08:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nauthy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyritdragon","CreatedById":70515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T17:36:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeeey :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the time the forums are out, i was unable to get to the persistance file and launch anything.
