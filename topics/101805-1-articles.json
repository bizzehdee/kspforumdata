With the recent update to the iOS app, I even bought a precision stylus for my Ipad to easily jot things down on it. After all, when you are writing with your hand you remember a lot more than you do with typing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, you can convert formulas, equations and regular old text into digital text!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vector graphics are awesome too. You can draw a house and easily change the roof color, you can cut a text from the net and underline/highlight anything freely. It all just feels so natural.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even made a OneNote for my class. More than half uses it and we can write in homework for each subject and store learning materials inside. There is also a fun zone where you can draw or write anything you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOneNote is like Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Paint and others combined in one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, in my country not everyone is rich enough to get a simple iPad mini even, which is a real shame since everyone in class could jot things down like me and share it with others.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T14:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m only in high school, but I prefer simple paper and pencil.

Besides, you can share it with others and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit has a lot more features that a notepad. Try ripping out a website page and sticking it into your paper notepad lol, or attaching a pdf to your notepad.
