With the recent update to the iOS app, I even bought a precision stylus for my Ipad to easily jot things down on it. After all, when you are writing with your hand you remember a lot more than you do with typing.\n\nAfter that, you can convert formulas, equations and regular old text into digital text!\n\nThe vector graphics are awesome too. You can draw a house and easily change the roof color, you can cut a text from the net and underline/highlight anything freely. It all just feels so natural.\n\nI even made a OneNote for my class. More than half uses it and we can write in homework for each subject and store learning materials inside. There is also a fun zone where you can draw or write anything you want.\n\nOneNote is like Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Paint and others combined in one.\n\nSure, in my country not everyone is rich enough to get a simple iPad mini even, which is a real shame since everyone in class could jot things down like me and share it with others."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T14:55:34Z","Content":"I\u0027m only in high school, but I prefer simple paper and pencil.

Besides, you can share it with others and\n\nit has a lot more features that a notepad. Try ripping out a website page and sticking it into your paper notepad lol, or attaching a pdf to your notepad. You\u0027d end up with a huge briefcase full of papers.\n\nThough for OneNote a Windows tablet would be best like the Venus 8 Pro or the SUrface Pro which is really optimized for it."},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T21:07:56Z","Content":"I would have killed for a laptop for note-taking in school.\n\nTBH, considering my speed and legibility, I don\u0027t even feel like I would be honest in saying \u0022I can write.\u0022\n\nMy ability to communicate through the written word exists solely because of keyboards.

Our history teacher switched slides so fast it is impossible to keep up.\n\nIf only she could at least send the presentations to us, or even better, put them inside our class OneNote History section. That would\u0027ve saved so much hassle, and it wouldn\u0027t get lost within all of the emails we recieve."}]}
