Essentially, the time that your spacecraft was put on rails. If you want to set where your spacecraft is RIGHT NOW, It helps a lot if EPH is set to the same value as the Universal Time ( UT = ) value at the top of the persistence file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMean Anomaly at Epoch is Time since periapsis in terms of the angle that a hypothetical body in a circular orbit that has the same semimajor axis as your spacecraft would travel, expressed in radians. All ellptical orbits with the same semimajor axis have the same period, and there are 2*pi radians in a full circle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So MNA = 0 will put you at Periapsis. MNA = 3.1415927 will put you at Apoapsis. MNA = (PI/2) will put you where you would be if your orbited for 1/4 your orbital period from periapsis. MNA = (3*PI/2) will put you where you would be if you orbited for 3/4 your orbital period... All of the above assumes that you\\\u0027ve also set EPH to the current in-game Universal Time Value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStoring Mean Anomaly at Epoch and Epoch makes it slightly cumbersome, but doable, to set an object at a certain time since or until periapsis in its orbit. Setting an object at a particular altitude in its non-circular orbit (that isn\\\u0027t at periapsis or apoapsis) from its Mean Anomaly at Epoch is significantly more complicated, as there isn\\\u0027t a simple equation to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow Are You Able To Put Things Into Orbit With The Save File Editor?
