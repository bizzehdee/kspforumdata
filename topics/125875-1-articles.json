I got in the VAB and started building when I noticed my framerate was around 20-30 fps. A while later I switched to the SPH to try out the new jet engines, and my game slowed to a crawl at 8fps when I looked out the door, and only 20 fps while looking towards sides. The only time I could maintain a steady 60 fps was when I looked towards the back of the hangar. While actually piloting craft, everything seems to be fine. I\u0026#39;ve tried reducing all the settings to minimum, but the problem still persists.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m on version 1.05.1028, with Steam.

Never got around to debugging it, so I don\u0026#39;t know what caused it. Re-installing (I think when 1.05 came around) fixed it completely though. It was the exact same problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCheers!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T11:14:10Z","Content":"\nHi Djsnowboy267, please ensure your graphics driver is up to date and is on high performance mode, that you have no unnecessary programs running in the background, that you are not on a powersave setting and that your delta time slider in the Settings screen is low (slider to the right).\n"}]}
