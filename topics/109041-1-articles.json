When i set the D-pad to the horizontal camera axis, the direction the camera moves switches around depending on if i am viewing the vessel or on map/IVA mode. This is just a small annoyance and i was wondering if any one has a fix. I have tried to invert the axis however this just switches around the axis but it still changes when i change the view mode."},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T20:27:11Z","Content":"Here is my settings file:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/lytapm7gfa94vck/settings.cfg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lytapm7gfa94vck/settings.cfg?dl=0)\n\nAppreciate any help."},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:40:12Z","Content":"This issue persists in 1.0.4.
