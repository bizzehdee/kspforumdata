The 1.0 update introduced new behavior for SAS which automatically puts it in hold when your movement or the target is likely to change rapidly. The perfect example of this is when landing on the Mun or Minmus. You\u0027d have your SAS set to retrograde, but if you accidentally overshot by 0.1 m/s your rocket would flip over to point down, then back up again as gravity caught you. Same for when you land and aren\u0027t moving - weird things happen there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause your relative speed to your target is almost 0 it\u0027s flipping off, but you appear to be hugging the line between on and off.

Relative velocity to your target describes the change in position relative to your target. So a rel. velocity of 0 means that you are not moving at all resulting in the exact opposit of \u0022flipping off\u0022.
