Apparently I did not set them up in the same way as the NDS Orion docking port. I did not set the \u0022dockingNode\u0022 gameObject to have its \u002BZ-Axis pointed in along the parts \u002BY-Axis as it should have been. Correcting this, as well as setting the \u0022acquireRange\u0022 parameter to \u00220.5\u0022, has made it much easier/possible to dock modules with CBMs. There does, however, appear to be an issue with the PMA docking to the CBM as it should. I did discover that the dockingNode of the PMA was also not set correctly in Unity, and it was corrected at the same time I corrected the CBM. In the succeeding tests, however, I launched a module (via the Shuttle, more on that in a minute) with two CBMs and a PMA attached to one of the CBMs to add to the test station in orbit. I docked the tug to the module\u0027s open CBM and successfully docked with the orbiter to temporarily remove the PMA to dock the module to the station. Once the module was docked to the station, however, the PMA refused to dock with multiple CBMs. I believe that the issue may be that the docking node is on the bottom of the PMA, so I have the dockingNode \u002BZ-Axis aligned with the part\u0027s -Y-Axis. I am able to decouple a PMA from a CBM and then dock the PMA back to the CBM using a docking test craft on the pad at KSC with \u0022Hack Gravity\u0022, but the CBMs also worked in that setup before the fix and refused to dock while in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone out there has had experience with placing the docking node for a part on the bottom I would appreciate any advice.

I have rebalanced the mass of the orbiter by decreasing the mass of the OMS engines (as they had the same mass as the SSMEs, an unfortunate oversight on my part), and after further test fights added that mass back in as MonoPropellant in the OMS Pods. I also increased the mass of the Shuttle Docking System Airlock to try and keep the CoM forward of the CoL for landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy most recent flight, to deliver a second module to my test station, was much less of a headache than previous attempts. I turned the STS stack in the VAB so that the orbiter was already aligned nose-down to ensure that no roll or yaw would be needed to orient the stack correctly after liftoff. The reason for doing this was that when launching modules with the Setesh IV (Delta IV) that even though the vehicles were perfectly symmetrical, the SAS was still trying to cancel some small amount of roll. The only thing I could think of that the two vehicles had in common was that there was an initial roll maneuver after liftoff, and orienting the Shuttle to eliminate this maneuver did reveal that the SAS no longer tried to cancel out any roll. I also completely disabled the rudder for the ascent so that after SRB separation the SSMEs and the elevons would work for pitch and roll while only the SSMEs would work for yaw. I did need to do some yaw and roll correction, but I was able to get an orbit that was only inclined by 3\u00BA, better than the nearly 40\u00BA\u00A0inclination I had gotten on some previous launches. I will also note that this was the first Shuttle flight where I was able to successfully land the orbiter and at KSC to boot. I will continue to work on the Shuttle\u0027s stability issues to hopefully make it more flyable even without a payload for shuttling crew to and from your space stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEdit:\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EUpdated to Version 1.2.2\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChanges 1.2.2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Corrected Issues with the CBM and PMA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Corrected an issue where the Serenity Service Module would lose all of its ElectricCharge when entering the flight scene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Upped Delta-V of the Orion Spacecraft to about 1100 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Updated Craft Files and subassemblies to account for the changes to the Orion SM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Very Slight update to the ShadowWorks-STS.craft that orients the stack to eliminate the initial roll maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThere is a test engine part that I forgot to take out.

You may need to provide some roll and yaw input together, but it is much more flyable (in my opinion) than before.
