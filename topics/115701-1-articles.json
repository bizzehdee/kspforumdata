So now instead of disabling ModuleReactionWheel function to generate electricity and Xenon gas, the mod can generate these resources even when the craft is not moving. You now have your reaction wheel function back!\n\n\\*Reduce the amount of Xenon gas and electricity in the mod, making the mod more affordable in game. But you don\u0027t need to worry about running out of fuel, given there is now a brand new energy generating system installed (as mentioned previously)"},{"CreatedByName":"Eskandare","CreatedById":62742,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T18:35:38Z","Content":"Is it a Lol-ex car?
