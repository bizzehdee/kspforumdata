But it says nothing about \u0022wear\u0022, which you seem to have to find by left-clicking on the individual parts. And there is very little clue in terms of hints about what to do regarding the wear. The wiki said something about engineers causing less wear than pilots, but I saw the most wear in a module inhabited only by an engineer. Maybe because it was a smaller module (2-person as opposed to a 6-person module the pilot was hanging out in)?"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T01:34:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, Sir\\_Robert said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is my first mission away from Kerbin.

If I were coming in as a new user, (even now I\u0027ve got several of these) I think these would be some of the most helpful questions to have answered:\n\n1. How much life support do I need per day? (wiki, 16.2 units per Kerbal per day. Why not a more round number that\u0027s easier to eyeball guess?)\n2. What is habitation?\n    - How does habitation affect my vessel? (Is it the default, what makes it turn on, how do I turn it on myself)\n    - How do I know how much I need, or how much a part has? (I believe this is visible in the LS window, but maybe make the module visible in the module list with the value?)\n    - What happens if I don\u0027t have enough? (I assume this is the \u0027homesick\u0027 value in the config, and by default nothing happens)\n3. How do recyclers work?\n    - What parts recycle? (Science lab is the only stock part set up for this iirc)\n    - How does recycling affect my mission longevity? (is having a recycler on board reflected in the LS window in the editor?)\n4. What is wear? (is it on by default, or only with MKS? Can it be turned on without MKS?)\n    - How quickly do things wear out?\n    - What happens when parts wear out?\n    - Is it possible to resupply repair parts? (Resource says non-tweakable and non-visible so I guess that\u0027s a no?)\n\nOn a side note, I noticed the other day that putting a Nom-o-matic on my vessel and stocking up on loads and loads of fertilizer still showed the time to Supplies run out as if I wasn\u0027t making more. Is this intended or can that window calculate the new rate? If it cannot, what\u0027s the easiest conversion of fertilizer per Kerbal to extended mission days?\n\nAlso, I read somewhere that MKS comes with its own version of the config, and that USILS takes the most pessimistic settings. If I want to override that, would it be enough to make a single MM config that modifies the settings for my own changes to take effect?"},{"CreatedByName":"antilochus","CreatedById":144588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T04:06:54Z","Content":"Hey, I installed USI-LS by mistake while installing some of RoverDude\u0027s other stuff (going with a simpler mod loadout where I can launch and not worry about LS) and unfortunately I now have a few manned stations that have now been tourist-ified.\n\nCan anyone give me instructions on how to uninstall the mod with an existing save?

The game simply doesn\u0027t do \u0022background processing\u0022 on anything but tracking the ships orbits and SOI transitions. What you see when you come back to the ship is that it \u0022catches up\u0022 with what happened since the last time it focused. You should notice that the Supply time then jumps up from the value before you focused the ship.\n\nThere is a little [bug](https://github.com/BobPalmer/USI-LS/issues/73)in the mechanic though, but gameplay-wise you should be fine.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, Sir\\_Robert said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, for some reason the 3 Kerbals on board have a different habitation time, despite them all having boarded the ship at the exact same time.

I forget whether it is the config or database tabs, but eventually you will find a list of parts with a debug button next to them. Hitting the debug button will display the Part module in raw form. Granted this doesn\u0027t really help you determine which order patches are being applied anymore than what you are already doing. I\u0027m still trying to figure out why the Inline Ballutes mod suddenly stopped applying the RealChute compat patches. ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif \u0022:huh:\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nThanks, I didn\u0027t know about this feature.
