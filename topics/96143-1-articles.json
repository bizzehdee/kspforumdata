(Nah, i\u0027m just kidding, life is insanely rare across the Multiverse.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s look at Universe #423525436457896786346. Universe #423525436457896786346 has 3 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension like ours has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#423525436457896786346\u0027s macroscopic world is largely empty, as baryonic matter does not exist there. Only very strange matter \u0026amp; physical laws apply there. If you were to magically appear inside of it, every single subatomic particle inside your body would be ripped into pure energy (or, in this universe, an area of jumbled up, tangled quantum foam that exists permanently as a field of unstable space (a clump)) as there would be no gravity to hold them together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#423525436457896786346\u0027s quantum world is even stranger. The quantum foam of #423525436457896786346 does not form spheres, but \u003Cem\u003Eclumps, holes, \u0022pricks\u0022, tangles, knots, the essential \u0022line\u0022, rouge strands \u0026amp; even the absolutely strange void\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA clump is a large area of rouge strands that come together by change to form a very dense unstable sphere of static strings that have locked eatchother in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E While the clump itself moves, the strings do not \u0026amp; have even achieved infinite relative inertia. In other words, you can move the clump, but it\u0027s components remain locked to the ball. However, if two clumps collide, they explode with \u003Cstrong\u003Eextreme\u003C/strong\u003E force, annihilating every other thing within 500 planck-lengths. Therefore, it is very likely for this universes that MACROSCOPIC clumps occur very rarely, and thus hardly ever collide. but when they do (macroclumps are usually 5 kilometers wide), they blow a huge hole several LIGHTYEARS in diameter which is very empty of even quantum foam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To go in those areas where a single strand is 5 miles apart from the next is to be considered a part of another universe, and are thus places where our type of matter can exist so long as it never interacts with the rest of #423525436457896786346.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA hole is where strings form very wide circles. Like the clump, the strings cannot be mutilated. however, holes are, in fact, also locked in place like tacks in the fabric of spacetime. They are circles with walls only 1 or 2 strings thick, but the circle is a perfect circle 5 meters in diameter. for some reason not yet known, though, all matter that passes through the circle is mysteriously \u0022deleted\u0022 at the quantum foam scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPricks are the mobile, destructible equivalent to matter in our universe. Rather then being hollow spheres, there\u0027 really just denser and smaller, tangled quantum strings. held together by Lines. The only thing that gives them diversity is their shape, size, density \u0026amp; thing they contain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a way of classifying particles you find: (note, all classification types are self explanatory.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShapes: distorted - distorted rough - rough - smooth jagged - odd - assymetrical\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESizes: quantumscale - microscopic - macroscopic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDensities: stretched - compact - large very dense\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContains: line - clump - embedded hole \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETangles are when lines become, well, entangled. tangles are EXTREMELY weird, as they can have their individual lines pass through eatchother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are very fast and travel at 500 times the speed of light (in this universe, there\u0027s no speed limit) unless they collide with something. since they don\u0027t have mass, they have an inertia of 0 and simply bounce off of stuff. tangles themselves are softbodies and act like a gelatinous, expanding and contracting jumble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnots are when Lines become knotted together permanently.

They are indestructible quantum structures only 1 or 500 Planck lengths in thickness. They hold together macroscopic, microscopic \u0026amp; quantum scale formations alike to produce something akin to gravity. That\u0027s really it, though, lines can form other stuff if they destabilize and explode (if a line explodes, all its individual strings will likely come together into either a prick or a clump, or something else maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rouge strand is an elementary wavicle (a mix between particle and wave) that forms EVERYTHING in this universe. you probably already know what it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Void is a gap inside the universe altogether. it\u0027s a space where space and time form a gap between itself, or so i can explain. Anything touches a void? It gets deleted from existence. Voids are rare formations only a few microns in diameter (you get one void every lightyear or so) that can erase any formation except for other voids. If a string has another string connected to it, and it touches the void, it and anything connected to it will be banished from reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThat\u0027s it folks. now, let me set a debate for you all, what would YOU think would form from these laws of physics if osme weird big bang analogue formed a universe like that?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T22:47:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s a universe that has a scale relative to ours, say... 100 to 1, where if you enter the other universe and travel 1 meter, you travel 100 meters in our universe.
