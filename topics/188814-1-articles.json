highly dependent on it\u0027s diet.\u00A0 For the most part, I would expect that most, if not all, species that achieve intelligence and sentience to be omnivores.\u00A0 Large carnivores are, by nature, very territorial, and they are unlikely to develop agriculture or fire, since evolution would have given them a digestive system that obviates the need for plant crops and cooking.\u00A0 Without agriculture or fire, the species won\u0027t advance to the stone age.\u00A0 A herbivore might be able to pull it off, but most herbivores go for either big herds for safety in numbers, or for large size (or both).\u00A0 They also tend to have no need of cooking, and will instinctively fear fire, as well as a lot of other things.\u00A0 Their digestive systems require a lot of intake to provide the energy they need, and in general, high energy foods like grains and starches, are quite unhealthy for them.\u00A0 Omnivores, on the other hand, aren\u0027t specialized in eating any particular thing, which means their digestive systems kinda sucks at a extracting energy from a good portion of their diet.\u00A0 This means that cooking is a massive advantage, and therefore, taming fire is more likely.\u00A0 This means that our species must have some way of easily manipulating things.\u00A0 Humans evolved from apes, who were optimized for life in trees, although the larger apes evolved to work better on the ground.\u00A0 Humans are the pinnacle of the ground apes, having evolved to have absurdly high stamina, which allowed our ancestors to chase down game like antelopes and deer until they literally died of exhaustion.\u00A0 Our ancestors that lived in trees gave us thumbs and an upright posture, as well as large brains and sharp eyes for calculating jumps between branches.\u00A0 This means that Humans are uniquely specialized in pretty much nothing, but our stamina allowed us to develop all sorts of things.\u00A0 Any technological race, therefore, will have a similarly convoluted evolutionary history, since evolution won\u0027t just crank out a big-brained creature that can eat just about anything, with huge stamina reserves and spare appendages for grabbing and carrying things.\u00A0 Instead it will tend to optimize for other things.\u00A0 The creatures that evolve to a technological level will come from tiny niche environments that are sufficiently isolated to allow time for evolution, and sufficiently rich in resources to allow a non-optimized creature to succeed.\u00A0 This rules out any extreme environments and probably also any large biomes.\u00A0 Essentially and technological species will be similar to humans in form, baring any variation in ancestral lineage regarding numbers of limbs and whatnot, although I\u0027d expect four limbs to be pretty common, since more limbs means more muscle and bone for not that much more benefit.\u00A0 That\u0027s not to say they won\u0027t look really alien, they might have their noses in weird places, or have a prehensile tail.\u00A0 The largest variations will likely be from their planet\u0027s gravity and atmospheric density, as well as the nature of the environment they came from.\u00A0 On a planet with lighter gravity (unlikely because of a number of things, but not impossible) they may still live in forests to titanic trees and use their lower limbs as their \u0022hands\u0022.\u00A0 On a planet with higher gravity, they might indeed have six limbs and be very squat and muscular.\u00A0 It is very unlikely, though, that any race from a planet with higher gravity achieves space flight.\u00A0 The gravity of Earth stretches the limits of what is possible with chemical fuels, and any planet with higher gravity will require too much

humanoid race of sentient, technological beings is probably a home planet with an orbital velocity of around 7km/s, an orange dwarf as a sun, and a large moon with a molten core that helps their planet maintain a very strong magnetic field to keep the solar wind of a more active star at bay.\u00A0 A thicker atmosphere might also help, but it could also be a hindrance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
