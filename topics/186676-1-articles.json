I might be wrong in this case but I have experienced this myself with my own craft (more investigation is needed), however, you ought to have relative control in a hover, and rapidly lose control as airspeed increases.

Then that rotor has slightly more leverage than the other and asymmetry of that rotor wins out and results in a net roll-force.

You\u0027d have to tune the torque, such that the rotor causing the roll is proportionally weaker than the other.
