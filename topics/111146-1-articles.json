Maybe I could reduce the subdivision in some noncritical places, but if I reduce it on the wings, tail or nose, the shading gets messed up.\n\n2.

Yeah, for the polycount apart from what you said, I was told that the CSS uses a ....ton of polygons, so I gave myself a bit of a margin to work with. It can only be seen in those places I told you, even with smoth shading, so if there\u0027s a method to subdivide just some places on some axis, I\u0027ll do it.\n\nAnother doubt, should I create the cargo bay with the unsubdivided model, or with the subdivided one? And what about the UV unwrap?"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T02:20:08Z","Content":"This looks like you used subdivision surface, and cranked it too high.
