One thing I have been having problems with is posting videos. I understand that I am going to have to upload my video somewhere before I can share it, but where should I upload it? All the sites I seem to find aren\u0027t really orientated towards gamers, does anybody have a suggested site? Or is there a way to share it without uploading to a 3rd party site?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. If anybody is into modding, I would love some help getting started.
