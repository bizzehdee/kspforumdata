What I would do in this situation is kill throttle, kill jet engines, activate aerospikes. and then slowly increase throttle being careful about overheating.

This is a static test I just did, 4 aerospikes on a quadcoupler - with small tanks as a buffer. Full throttle, burning nearly a full orange tank ... note the overheat level.\n\n![JyXEeg1.png](http://i.imgur.com/JyXEeg1.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T08:04:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have 2 on a spaceplane and when I activate them they immediately overheat. Any ideas?\n\nNote: just seeing the \u0022overheat\u0022 bar is actually not a problem. There are several engines which burn so hot that they always do this. However, they will stabilize themselves somewhere near the middle or upper end. The LV-N for example goes all the way to 85% or something.\n\nBut your engine doesn\u0027t actually take any damage from the heat until the bar is at 95%. So you can let them run all day long with the overheat bar showing and there is absolutely no downside whatsoever. Only when it fills up completely will you start seeing explosions."},{"CreatedByName":"Delrey","CreatedById":131343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T12:02:23Z","Content":"I\u0027ll post a pic tonight.
