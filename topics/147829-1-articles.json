But the camera is focusing on the middle part - so it is hard to access the science instruments. Is there a way to focus camera on front of it somehow?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maja","CreatedById":168379,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-16T06:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, try this mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/122491-12-camera-focus-changer-v100/#comment-2216126\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ECamera Focus Changer\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chiron0224","CreatedById":147812,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-16T15:45:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, in 1.1.x you can right click a science part and then click that little grey button in the top right corner of the right click box to pin that menu.\u00A0 Once pinned you can put your menu somewhere where you can easily get to it.\u00A0 Also you could put your science gear on one or more action groups so that you can just hit like 3 or 4 on your keyboard and activate your science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-17T16:48:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned above, action groups can be really helpful. \u00A0You can add multiple commands to a single action group, so it is easy to, for example, activate all your science equipment with a single key press. \u00A0To avoid having to keep turning my refuelling drone during docking I attach a bunch of small, forward facing, motors to slow down. \u00A0I also deactivate the main engine with the same action group (after a particularly nasty incident!) so I know that they will be the only ones firing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy other tips for using action groups. Write them down! \u00A0If you return to a craft that hasn\u0027t been used for a while, you can easily look up the relevant commands. \u00A0Finally, it helps to be consistent. \u00A0I know that any ship I command, with retractable solar panels, will toggle them in and out by hitting the \u00221\u0022 key. \u00A0That also really helps if you dock one or more vechiles together as they will all do the same thing with the same key press.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, remember you can zoom out the camera and change the angle to help click on difficult to reach parts of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CSE","CreatedById":145588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-26T09:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the KSP 1.2 pre-release, you can aim the camera at specific parts as a stock feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
