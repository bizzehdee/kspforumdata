For me it\u0027s most common when I leave Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003Esoi\u003C/abbr\u003E when it\u0027s still loaded, this is guaranteed to cause exactly what you described. This seems to be caused by changing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003Esoi\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s in the map view and then going back to flight view. Also the game with visual mods, especially the Jool system gets like 30 FPS when it used to get 50\u002B FPS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I forgot the one time when the sun disappeared in map view and not being able to see Kerbin in map view and my screen Turing black if I looked at Kerbin (this may be scatterers fault though.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit 2: the FPS lag and crashes is not mod related, although mods may make it worse.
