But the only other lifeforms on Kerbin are trees, catci, and grass, none of which are fungi, and Kerbals are only found at KSC. The most logical explanation is that the Monolith Builders abducted small herd of Kerbals from somewhere else, possibly a parallel universe, and dumped them at KSC just to see how they\u0027d react. And periodically, the Monolith Builders return and add planets to the Kerbol system, or scramble KSC around, or drastically remodel Kerbin and the other planets, just to screw with the Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T19:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that Jeb is actually a really proficient pilot, and quite a good scientist (but not as good as Bob).
