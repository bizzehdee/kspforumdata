They are pretty, robust and most important they do their job! ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nSome helpful information. All the rockets are tested in suboptimal flights for the players that who doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have much piloting skills (like me :/) use the lifters without too much problem. And be careful with the heaviest ones they are way trickier than a thought to put in orbit. Always put struts, for reducing the wobble on the heaviest and taller, you can put struts in your payload and connect then all way down in the lifter.
