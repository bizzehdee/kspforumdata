It would be nice to have a thread where new players can go to look a list up with a brief description of what each does and a little clarification on some of the nomenclature used. For instance, the term \u0022MuMech\u0022 pops up a lot, and while I understand it has something to do with MechJeb (which is the first mod I installed and love), I do not always understand the parts and contexts in which it is used\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, I have MechJeb, Orbital and Planetary Construction, and Electrical Power (though I cant figure out how to install that one. There are a lot of files in a \u0022source\u0022 folder which does not seem to have an equivalent in the KSP folder.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sure there are threads like this already, but as it seems like the community has moved forums, and all of the old links are broken, it might be nice to start fresh with new, unbroken links to current mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am looking for specifically is solar powered rockets/ion engines, nav lights, rovers (big Trak looks great but doesnt appear to be updated for 1.6 yet), and anything else you guys think improves the KSP experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone, hope to hear from you soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launchings,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZalack\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T19:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Zalack and welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/7854-PLUGIN-PART-0-14-Carts-v1-32-M%C3%BCn-Rover-RCS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecart mod by tosh\u003C/a\u003E, it adds some really nice rovers, and you can find lots of add-ons in the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/forumdisplay.php/35-Addon-Releases-and-Projects-Showcase\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eadd-on boards\u003C/a\u003E, as for a proper list though, there were some but the speed that new mods appear meant the lists were hard to keep up to date, there\u0027s an old one in the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.net/kerbal-space-program-mods\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Wiki\u003C/a\u003E for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the move from Simple Machines to vBulletin, all the old links died, so to find stuff now you need to know it\u0027s name and use the search box in the upper right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-09T19:18:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2012 07:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dishycourier","CreatedById":35171,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T21:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you like ion engines, you can try my part hacks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe batteries work with the dynavolt stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*snipped* - DC\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-10T16:32:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2012 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by dishycourier\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T23:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on what you like building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d recommend Damned Aerospace (including Crewtank) and Damned Robotics, Bigtrak (which needs the Cart mod), Katerpillar wheels, HSTW Pontoons and the Truss pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to avoid the really enormous mod packs, as they make finding parts in the SPH or VAB like a needle in a haystack!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gobbles Gusto","CreatedById":37727,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T17:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022colmo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022colmo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHSTW Pontoons\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I get a link?
