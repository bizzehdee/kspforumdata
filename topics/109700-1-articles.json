The first desing was basically am upright 126 ton mining lander but had weels. The wheels broke almost immediatly on testing at kerbin. (three times the G, I know, but I think it might be similar performance on duna due to wobbling anyways. ). \n\nThe second was a lay-down verision, that would have to perform a tilt manouvre after or before landing (I\u0027ve done both), but I generally find the problems with these to balance the darn wheels, and get the thing to orbit. I am lacking inspiration of wheel bases. What do you use them for, what configuration, and so on?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T20:09:28Z","Content":"For those contracts I usually land on struts and retract them to set the whole thing on wheels, allowing for contract completion. It helps to find a nice flat place to land, and build your ship wide instead of tall to make the landing more stable."},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T20:14:54Z","Content":"I can\u0027t really suggest any designs for you, however I can tell you one thing not to do. Do not employ the small landing gear in your design. I had a similar contract to put a base on the Mun \u0022with wheels\u0022 so I slapped on the small landing gears and whatever other stuff the contract stipulated. The mission went well, landed on the Mun, and did the ten second wait, only to find out the contract did not consider the landing gears as wheels! Result?,,, Fail. Now this was in the .90 version so it may have been changed. Regardless, make sure all required equipment has that little green check!"},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T21:49:21Z","Content":"Here\u0027s one I built for the Mun in 0.90. I guess it follows the \u0022build it tall and fall over\u0022 philosophy. If a few tires break, you can use engineers to replace them. This model has some side-mounted rockets to liftoff for long-range exploration. Some \u0022Mun Patrol\u0022 glamour shots are included as well. \n\nFor Duna, with the new parachute physics that keep them open/attached until you stop vs the old style of disappearing when you touched down, I think you could setup a drop that landed already tilted somewhat (offset parachutes, or lots of SAS), and use the chutes to drop slow enough that you don\u0027t break wheels/URD. But I haven\u0027t visited Duna myself yet, so YKMD (Your Kerbals May Die).\n\nI suggest installing Kerbal Construction Time or Hyperedit to test your Duna descent before sending your system there.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I built a big behemoth today, an upright towering thing. It has enough TWR to lift from duna (I think, depends on atmosphere and poodles), I hope it\u0027s enough to lift from duna to orbit (no mods or calculations here). Will check by comparing with my current duna lander."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T04:26:33Z","Content":"The most likely explanation I see, based on what seems to happen with others around here, is that you\u0027re landing too hard. What is your touchdown speed, i.e. your vertical speed just as the wheels hit the ground? For most things not on lander legs this needs to be less than 6 m/s, and when there are tires involved the slower the better."},{"CreatedByName":"martinborgen","CreatedById":142875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T10:34:47Z","Content":"Oh, this is moving on the pad.

But, the wheels were stock, so it\u0027d work for your contract. The downside was that it was only designed as a 1-man rover, but had the capacity to hold far more. I tweaked the design a bit, but I did this in three or four separate versions so I know it\u0027s workable.\n\nI later switched to even larger rovers, and that necessitated the use of caterpillar treads from a mod:\n\n![70OpYtL.png](http://i.imgur.com/70OpYtL.png)\n\nThat\u0027s a 600-ton megarover in the background (default crew of 3, but can hold 9), and a 25-ton smaller rover (also a kethane refinery) in the foreground. The smaller rover uses stock wheels, but it doesn\u0027t have enough crew for those contracts. I highly recommend using treads, though, simply because of the fact that they don\u0027t rip themselves apart under even minor shears. (They do have a very poor top speed, though. That huge rover tops out at about 12m/s; those 5m KW fuel tanks are really heavy when loaded.)\n\nHonestly, though, all of those base construction contracts are simple because of one simple flaw: a lander qualifies, as long as you stick any necessary parts (docking ports, antennae, wheels) on the side as necessary. The wheels don\u0027t have to touch the ground, the ports don\u0027t have to be reachable, etc., they just have to be on the craft (even inside a cargo bay).\n\nIn my career I\u0027m still in the second tier of techs, and I\u0027ve got a 7-man lander (3-man pod plus hitchhiker) that I use for quick astronaut training. (One trip to Mun or Minmus with Jeb piloting, and POOF, a half-dozen level 2 kerbonauts!) I stick a couple extra parts on it, and suddenly it\u0027s completing my orbital station contracts as well for big money. I\u0027m just about to send it to Duna and Ike for HUGE profits, as soon as I unlock the LV-N for my transfer burn."},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T20:28:13Z","Content":"In the past (version 0.25, I think) I set up a surface outpost on pillars that had a detachable rover underneath (connected by docking clamps).

The huge (12000-ton) stack of rockets below the rover was an SSTO launcher (fully recoverable, other than the fuel of course), and once in orbit the skyhook on top would draw fuel from the rover\u0027s tanks for the rest of the trip. (After landing on Mun and refilling all of the fuel tanks, the skyhook detached and flew up to Mun orbit to act as an emergency fuel depot.) With the new atmosphere model, that sort of design might have a bit more drag than it used to, but it should still work given the raw power of the booster."},{"CreatedByName":"martinborgen","CreatedById":142875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T01:11:51Z","Content":"I just love the Idea of two rovers!
