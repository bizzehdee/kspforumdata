I suppose some/all of these issues are present in vanilla KSP on the PC, but it\u0027s not much of a problem due to mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPlaying without Kerbal Engineer is hard. Not knowing the Delta V or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E makes rocket design very hit and miss.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHaving to jump into the map to see the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E is frustrating as you have to then toggle cursor mode and go select the node. Why can\u0027t this be displayed near the navball??\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCollecting science is confusing and tedious. Trying to click on a thermometer using the cursor whilst there\u0027s a slight roll is a challenge. Also, knowing when science is available is obscure; I end up clicking through each experiment in turn each time I believe I could be in a new biome; not a lot of fun with a joystick controlled cursor.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCan we have an option to hibernate (if available) during timewarp? Running out of juice while doing a Hohmann transfer makes me sad.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn the quicksave screen, it always defaults \u0022quicksave\u0022 and you can edit the name. Would be great if I could press up/down to cycle through previous quicksave names rather than having to retype it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere doesn\u0027t seem to be any buttons to delete a part or snap to center in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. To delete, you have to drag back to the part list. Also, the navigation of the parts only works with the joystick; this needs to also work with the control pad.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nZoom controller binding changes in map mode. Normally it\u0027s LB \u002B Right JS, it changes to LT/RT.

If they want to keep the old, pc based controls for people that are used to them they can have them as an option in the controls settings. The new controls would work well if they were similar to \u003Cem\u003ETrailmakers\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0console edition controls, for those controls were redesigned\u00A0\u00A0specifically for consoles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
