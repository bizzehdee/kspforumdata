But they don\u0027t know how to!\n\nThe president of Kerbin has announced that the first to colonise another planet will get Minmus for all their dessert needs!\n\nNo time to waste you screamed loudly to your own PC, you drove to the KSC on the way there you downloaded all the mods you needed and started building! (Don\u0027t use cheaty mods and yes, you know what I mean)\n\nFree Minmus dessert is the best kind of dessert. \n\n**What does it entail?**\n\nCreate a Kerbal colony on Duna.\n\nBe creative! You can do anything you want!\n\nExamples:\n\n-Rovers\n\n-Satellite network\n\n-Planes\n\n**How will I be rated?**\n\nHow creative is your colony?\n\nAre the rockets realistic? (Not like the typical 0.19 space station rockets with like 10 poles with docking ports dangling on the side)\n\nHow big is your colony?\n\n**Leaderboard:**\n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\nDebug menu and config edits are **NOT** allowed\n\nEverybody can rate eachothers colony (Please do this on a scale from 1 to 16,7)\n\nI will take everybody\u0027s rating into account!\n\nI will try to answer every question there is ASAP!\n\nTips/Suggestions are always welcome!\n\nGood luck engineers!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T13:00:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 01:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Phafor**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T15:49:59Z","Content":"Debug menu and config edits are allowed?

I will be replacing it with one with fuel cells by the next transfer windows. Also, the service bay is troublesome. I think it would fall apart without KJR.\n\nBoth spaceplanes have enough fuel to fly all over Duna, and can return to Kerbin as well, in case some of the kerbonauts begin to miss their Minmus made deserts.\n\nIt\u0027s not a massive base, but I like to keep part count as down as possible to avoid drag. I am missing rovers, which I\u0027ll send in the next opposition. For the time being, transportation is done by spaceplane. There is a mining outpost at Ike.There is an orbiter with capacity for five, currently without a crew, currently on Ike\u0027s orbit, as it has finished recovering the Ike lander. It will double as a space station, once I put it in Duna\u0027s orbit"}]}
