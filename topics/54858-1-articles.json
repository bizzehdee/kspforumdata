I feel like this would interfere with and have a detrimental effect on game play. Therefore, a system should be in place to allow kerbals to play an important part of the mission without allowing them to affect craft performance. I\u0027ve outlined my initial thoughts on such a system, which includes attributes, jobs, and gear for our little green minions. Some of these ideas have been touched on in other threads, but tangentially, and I think there\u0027s room for this in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal Attributes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOverview\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttributes represent a kerbal\u0027s aptitude and experience in various skills needed for space flight. Experience for each attribute is tracked separately for each kerbal, and gained by performing related tasks (indicated below). Attribute experience may be spent to improve job ranks (see below), or potentially increase the attribute value, depending on the implementation. The attributes below are not intended to be a complete listing of every possible attribute, but I don\u0027t think many more should be included in the game (total of not more than 5 or 6).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDexterity \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis attribute represents a kerbal\u0027s skill and experience controlling a craft*, and the primary attribute needed for a pilot.

Also, I\u0027m really opposed to returns based on skill level for the same reasons that I\u0027m opposed to returns based on experiment time: it gets even more \u0027gamey\u0027 because players begin to worry about \u003Cem\u003Eoptimization\u003C/em\u003E instead of \u003Cem\u003Eachievement\u003C/em\u003E.

After launch, no particular amount of skill is needed to pilot a craft. This is important because you may need to swap kerbals between craft midflight, or a pilot could be injured, stranding the entire crew. It also makes the weight check very simple to code and understand: the check only needs to be made once, and there\u0027s no confusion about whether the weight of fuel counts against the weight limit (in this case, it does). And theres no chance of a kerbal in the pilot seat \u003Cem\u003Ebecoming\u003C/em\u003E ineligible to pilot a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, the mass of many craft after launch is a small fraction of what it\u0027s launch weight, due to fuel expenditure and staging. And, practically, I don\u0027t think what gets to space is ever more than 20% of launch weight.; I don\u0027t think anyone in the payload % competition beat 20%. So there would have to be a LOT of docking going on before it really became a problem.
