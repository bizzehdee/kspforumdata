This has significant impact on total weight and currently all you need is engines and fuel. Remember that Apollo was cutting down to as little as possible in both weight required and complexity of the mission. Imagine how much weight did the direct ascent add to a mission if they decided that increasing complexity of the mission with LEM docking to service module on return from surface is better solution. Docking also required additional weight of its own too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T02:49:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few months ago I helped someone proofread a tutorial, and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://flyonbudget.onegiantleap.info/chapter3.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eone section in particular\u003C/a\u003E ran the numbers for a real-world lunar direct ascent as a comparison to a KSP one in the context of a discussion of when a separate lander might be worth it compared to a direct-ascent profile in KSP.
