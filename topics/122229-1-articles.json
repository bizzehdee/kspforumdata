There were many instances where I would have quit the game were it not for some new inspirations you guys here, on reddit or on youtube gave me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch an inspiration happened this week... I had a mission gone bad (the lander for an Outer Planets Mod exploration mission was destroyed - thankfully the pilot survived with all the science) and was planning to send another lander out there. I could have gone the easy way and just build a new transfer vehicle and send the lander to Sarnus. But then one YouTube commenter suggested I used an old rocket that was still in LKO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was called the \u0022Joolishka\u0022 and I used it to complete my Jool-5 mission successfully. However, it was still from version 0.90 and had 21 nuke engines that - back then - used not just liquid fuel but also oxidizer and didn\u0027t require radiators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah... quite the conundrum. However, I managed to upgrade the old girl with some parts and brought the new lander to my OPM mission craft. That was really an awesome experience and I wouldn\u0027t have had that if I hadn\u0027t got the idea from within the KSP community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: It seems like you can actually use some of your old nuke ships, if they have enough docking ports to attach some radiators and additional fuel tanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond conclusion: KSP rocks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final 12 images in this album are relevant to what I have written here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qesa0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
