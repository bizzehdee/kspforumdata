Not by much, of course, but just enough to make a difference.\n\nThird, Green Iron Crown and Christmas. (people were VERY rep happy around those times), and in the starting days of the forums, people barely used rep at all.\n\n\u0022But Norpo!\u0022 you say, \u0022Surely it must be SOME indicator of quality?\u0022 And yes it is, but you need to take it with a MAJOR grain of salt. There are examples I could use that say it does work, and examples I could use that say it really doesn\u0027t work, here\u0027s one of those;\n\nLook at me for example. I made the Titan Engine mod, and basically other than that just made witty comments and went to Green Iron Crown and was around on christmas. rep divided by postcount gives me: 0.9277 as my rep ratio. Now, chances are if you use mods, you\u0027ve heard of RoverDude, or at least used one of his mods. (Umbra Space Industries? MKS/OKS? Sounding Rockets? Karbonite? Any of those ring a bell?) Apparently not; he has a rep ratio of 0.2537, despite releasing some of the highest quality mods out there, and used in countless saves. \n\nSkewed somewhat, I imagine, due to support posts, so you could argue that his 10 (or so) release threads are nothing compared to his 5870 posts that are not release threads. So while it might be a representation of *average* post quality, by no means is it always a representation of what they\u0027ve done for the community. ESPECIALLY if they hang around in space lounge/etc.\n\nIn the end, just decide for yourself, if they\u0027re good posts in your eyes, then they\u0027re good posts. *No need for confirmation.* If it seems like someone should be beaten in the head with a stick, don\u0027t give them rep. If they made a good post, give them rep. It\u0027s that simple. /rant\n\n**EDIT: I imagine some people are going to ask for examples of good posts and bad posts, well..**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not much, but i\u0027m proud anyways, I made a Minmus hoverbike!

Now, good mod creator has a history of, er, \u0022Snark Diplomacy\u0022. Not that\u0027s a bad thing, considering obviously Bad Poster is asking a trivial question that nobody with common sense would ask considering it\u0027s 2015 and Google is a thing, here\u0027s his reply:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how\u002Bto\u002Binstall\u002Bkerbal\u002Bspace\u002Bprogram\u002Bmod](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how\u002Bto\u002Binstall\u002Bkerbal\u002Bspace\u002Bprogram\u002Bmod)\n\nBad poster, not the brightest bulb, replies:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Huh?? How does this help?\n\nWell then, obviously nothing flies over Bad Poster\u0027s head, his reflexes are too good. Mod creator replies:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It was humour. When you google it, there\u0027s like 7 different tutorials on how to do it, but i\u0027ll just copy and paste one here: (in-depth tutorial, no snark, just details)\n\nOkay, Mod Creator decided to reply despite bad poster being a needy guy, that\u0027s nice of him. However, Bad Poster isn\u0027t so appreciative.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why didn\u0027t you just TELL ME!? You\u0027re a ..... And I STILL Don\u0027t Know how to do it! Just GIVE ME A TUTORIAL!\n\nUh oh. Bad poster is mad. Mod Creator, being sick of this, even though he linked a tutorial, just doesn\u0027t reply. He\u0027s gone through this a dozen times with a dozen different people, and he knows well enough that you can\u0027t underestimate a moron. \u0027Tis the life of a mod creator.\n\n**Obviously Bad Poster could of just googled it.** The irony?

Then the \u0027light green group\u0027 thread started and I started thinking about rep because IIRC at the time I was about 50 from a light green bar. Now I have one I\u0027ve stopped thinking about it again.\n\nI look more at when someone joined the forum and base things more on that than anything else, the people who were here in the earlier days (and are still here) just seem a bit more committed to the forum being a nice place and the game in general. It\u0027s not a totally hard and fast rule and there are exceptions for sure but it\u0027s an indicator.\n\nOne person, who I shall not name, joined the forum a while after me and posted A LOT. Initially they acted like a pseudo-mod, pulling people up on errors and answering every question that got posted, then they just made loads of posts in the support thread. Over a year they averaged over 10 posts a day and had over 4500 posts when they just stopped posting 13 months after they joined the forum. They got a lot of rep in a short time but now they are gone. If ever anyone talks about \u0027gaming the rep system\u0027 I always think of them.\n\nSo, as I say, someone who has been posting for a while and still continues to post will carry more weight for me than someone who posts a lot or someone who has a lot of rep bars.
