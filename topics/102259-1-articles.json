Now I have one I\u0027ve stopped thinking about it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look more at when someone joined the forum and base things more on that than anything else, the people who were here in the earlier days (and are still here) just seem a bit more committed to the forum being a nice place and the game in general. It\u0027s not a totally hard and fast rule and there are exceptions for sure but it\u0027s an indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne person, who I shall not name, joined the forum a while after me and posted A LOT. Initially they acted like a pseudo-mod, pulling people up on errors and answering every question that got posted, then they just made loads of posts in the support thread. Over a year they averaged over 10 posts a day and had over 4500 posts when they just stopped posting 13 months after they joined the forum. They got a lot of rep in a short time but now they are gone. If ever anyone talks about \u0027gaming the rep system\u0027 I always think of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as I say, someone who has been posting for a while and still continues to post will carry more weight for me than someone who posts a lot or someone who has a lot of rep bars. Of course, someone with a lot of rep bars, who has a high post count AND has been active on the forum for a long time is someone who would get me to think about their post far more than someone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit 2 : rep ratio 0.232 (540/2329)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T17:30:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by John FX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T17:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy rep to post ratio is 1/7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe majority of those posts have been in discussions or support requests, which you would have thought would give a lot of rep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(And forum games, which probably wouldn\u0027t.
