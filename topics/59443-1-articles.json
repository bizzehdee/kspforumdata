I don\u0027t know how many time\u0027s I\u0027ve heard the phrase \u0022polar vortex\u0022 (usually said in an alarmed tone) in the news in the past week... It got me thinking about how wind chill factor has been distorted in recent years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I grew up on the Canadian prairies, wind chill factor was quoted in Watts per square metre. When Environment Canada said it was 3000 W/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, you knew it was extreme and that you had to cover every last bit of exposed skin. Maybe even wear ski goggles if you had to be outside in the wind for long. Media outside of public broadcasters would usually \u0022translate\u0022 the Environment Canada numbers into an equivalent temperature, so eventually even Environment Canada capitulated. Now everyone reports wind chill factor as a wind chill temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrouble is that people don\u0027t seem to know anymore what it means when the wind chill factor is reported as \u0022-1 000 000 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C !!!!\u0022. People believe that it actually \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E that cold. I have even been asked how car thermometers are calibrated so that they don\u0027t read -40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C when the ambient temperature is -20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C and you\u0027re driving at 100 km/h.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question then for this forum is: What (if anything) can we do about it? Does it matter? Or is it another example of the dumbing down of our society? Maybe W/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E is too technical for most people but what if we were to drop the units and call it an index? It is an idealised number anyway. The idea of using an index that is less prone to misinterpretation and exaggeration appeals to my engineering sensibilities, but maybe I\u0027m the one who should lighten up? What do people do in countries outside of North America?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-09T17:19:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2014 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T17:33:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my country, they\u0027re almost exclusively real meteorologists with proper education, at least the ones on official national broadcast channels.

The idealised tables and empirical equations that define wind chill temperature make assumptions about the surface temperature of the body that is being cooled. This is why they talk about the effect of wind chill on exposed skin. The convective heat loss of someone standing naked is obviously different than that of someone wearing a heavy parka because the difference in temperature between the air and the surface of the person is smaller when wearing a parka than it is for someone standing naked. The heat transfer rate isn\u0027t a linear relationship either because the convective heat transfer coefficient is also dependent on the air temperature in the boundary layer. You can get away with having an exposed face at -40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C if there\u0027s no wind, but it will be darn uncomfortable or even dangerous to have an exposed face at -30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C and exposed to 20 kph winds (roughly -40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C wind chill temperature). This is why it makes more sense to use a wind chill index than a wind chill temperature.

If a wind-chill of -40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C means that you\u0027ll be loosing heat as if it\u0027s -40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C in still air, well, you better dress yourself as if it\u0027s -40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C out there. So that really is the simplest way to report these numbers. I don\u0027t see any problem with it. They do report true ambient temperature as well, and in fact, that\u0027s usually the first number listed, so it\u0027s not like people aren\u0027t given a clue that there is a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI happen to live in North Dakota right now, and it was significantly colder than usual here (it hit about -30 F or about -33 C) and the windchill was reported as -50 to -60 (depending on where you looked and where you were) this last Monday. Even the actual temperature is enough that you don\u0027t really want to go outside, and the wind makes it much, much worse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T20:04:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry about the necro, but today\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://xkcd.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EXKCD\u003C/a\u003E is somewhat relevant to this thread and I thought some of you may enjoy it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cold.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cold.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-24T20:07:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2014 08:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded link to XKCD website\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
