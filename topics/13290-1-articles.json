It\\\u0027ll work like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople give me a task, say, putting a satellite into LKO (150,000 meters). I\\\u0027ll build a satellite designed to do whatever the idea proposes, and launch it. All debris and craft will be left as is, and no persistance modification will be done. If you want a specific craft in the program, PM me the file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn more detail:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will take suggestions from the community on what to put into space, and what it should be tasked with. Then, I will build craft to complete these missions, and will upload the persistance file on here. I will only be using some specific mods, which I will list. My goal is to attempt to be as realistic as possible, and each flight, depending on how many stages there are, will be given a random chance of failure via random.org.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo suggesting new mods.
