Generally you want the CoL a bit behind the CoM. As for lawndarty behavior, that might be due to insufficient pitch authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall you could fix this by adding a tail, or shift the wings back some and add a canard. There are other ways though, that\u0027s just the most straight forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you may want to consider a vertical stabilizer on back (vertical fin) to help with yaw control. You might experience some issues later with yaw stability, especially as you start to ramp up speed (assuming that\u0027s a spaceplane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T22:57:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned, your biggest issue is the CoL is a little too forward. A general rule of thumb for spaceplanes is to have the CoL ball halved by the CoM. It doesn\u0027t have to be perfect but you need to see about half of that ball. I say \u0022for spaceplanes\u0022 because they generally don\u0027t need a high degree of maneuverability. If you are launching into equatorial orbit, they don\u0027t really need to turn much at all except for minor inclination correction. Even if you are going polar, no need to turn on a dime, take your time doing it. Fighter planes and other jets you may want it a bit further in but you will lose stability for maneuverability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour vertical stabilizers are too far out on the wingtip to be useful for yaw and stability. Whether using one or two, it needs to be a little close to the body to be really effective and they might need to be a little bigger. This image was not made by me and I\u0027ve forgotten where I got it, but I love using it as a reference for finding good tail designs that fit with everything else I\u0027m trying to do. You should note again, dual vertical stabilizers are seldom useful on spaceplanes, unless space is just an issue. You will find the first three are used in real planes most often, and with good reason, they are simple and work best. (In fact I would almost say they are in order of most to least common)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OdvPU6I.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OdvPU6I.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T23:04:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 11:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T23:09:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENich,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That spaceplane design has wandered off into the weeds like a drunk on a bicycle! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Please don\u0027t take that as any kind of disrespect; you know that *I* know that you are a steely- eyed missile man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But I mean... \u003Cem\u003Elook \u003C/em\u003Eat it, amiright?

Best advice I\u0027ve got from this pic is to \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ecompletely scrap it and start with a fresh sheet of paper.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Step #1 is to define the mission and thus payload capacity. Get a feel for the scale of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Step #2 is to build a simple SSTO in accordance with the ratios that you (and of course the rest of us) have established in previous designs, but \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ebuild it completely out of fuel tanks\u003C/span\u003E. Tweak and adjust as necessary until you are successfully orbiting enough mass to account for the mass of your orbital mission payload (the mining equipment, fuel to get to Minmus, etc). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Step #3 is to take all this data in hand and build your spaceplane with the required parts, supplies/ etc. And build it like a proper spaceplane. Make it clean, efficient and well- balanced from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If it\u0027s deficient, don\u0027t succumb to the urge to crutch it by tacking stuff on. Look for things that you can \u003Cem\u003Eeliminate\u003C/em\u003E or design to be more aerodynamically stable, clean and efficient. Take it from the top if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What\u0027s wrong here isn\u0027t a technical deficiency in the design, but the philosophy behind how it was laid out, assembled, and adjusted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Specific suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a plane that light doesn\u0027t need that much wing with that much incidence. You just need enough to keep the nose firmly aligned with the prograde marker throughout the ascent. With all that t/w, you don\u0027t need that much wing *or* that much incidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the vertical stabilizer(s) should be as far aft as you can possibly get it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- don\u0027t stack bulky draggy equipment radially out in the slipstream. Find a way to shield it from the airflow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Don\u0027t add additional parallel stacks if you can help it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T23:19:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 11:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T00:20:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to note: with the different angles of incidence for the wings, your CoL will shift with AoA. Until the critical angle, the CoL will shift towards the greater magnitude aligned lift vector sum as AoA increases. That critical angle has crazy behavior though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that your zero incidence surfaces are ahead of the CoM, your craft should have a stronger stabilizing response with AoA as long as you stay within the critical angle.
