Most times a colision occurs between 2 craft its at a couple hundred meters or less. Normaly an overly enthusiastic rendezvous is the cause but sometimes 2 craft that started in the same orbit can meet agian after one transitions into a more ecentric one. Still thats slow enough that most times the ships wont bypass eachother between physics steps. While you can intentionaly generate edge cases such as the 180 degree orbits in the OP you also have to figure that that situation has the unpioleted ship crossing the physics window in 2-3 seconds. Not worth the extra performance hit to cover those rare edge cases."},{"CreatedByName":"EBAO","CreatedById":140732,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T16:38:13Z","Content":"Holy mother of Kessler. I just reran that save, and on the very next pass the two (slightly damaged) stations hit much harder. The screen was full of explosions. I was not able to get a quick screen shot due to weird frame lag, but the result was two severely damaged stations, 70ish chucks of debris, and both stations transferred enough momentum to drop the periapis into the atmosphere. The stations will burn up but I now have 10X the amount of debris as before.
