If it worked after switching to Legacy mode then that was coincidence. Whether or not fairing enclosed parts are considered shielded is determined in one of several ways\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFAR is checked to see if it thinks a part is shielded. If FAR is not installed, returns false or an error occurs when getting the shielded state then..\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA ray is fired from the part along its flight path to a distance of 10 meters. If the ray hits anything at all (including parts that broke off or were jettisoned from the ship) then the part is considered shielded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E(there is also a stock KSP property that is checked for a shielded state but nothing currently uses that property)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically it comes down to either FAR or a raycast, and both can fail for various reasons. FAR because (as near as I can tell) it checks a box shaped area, and parts very close to the edges of the fairing can fall outside the box. The raycast can fail if it slips between the fairing parts, which can happen when it the part is dead center and the ray passes exactly along the long axis between the fairing front. I also suspect a problem with the colliders on the front part of the fairing. Finally, because the ray is 10 meters long, parts farther away from the fairing front than 10 meters will fail the raycast test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I have always had issues with the Procedural Fairing reliably passing the raycast test. FAR is more accurate and even it can fail as mentioned above. I once had plans to use the PF parts to make a Copernicus styled aeroshell for Duna/Mars reentry and that\u0027s when I noticed it had a problem. So what you\u0027re telling me isn\u0027t really news and it\u0027s not particular to this new version. You\u0027re only just now noticing it.

Bind to the vessel modified event so if any parts detach, break, blow up, jettison, etc etc then check again.

I\u0027ve been noticing that a long time now but didn\u0027t connect it with DRE and since the object returns to its proper distance when I come off rails it seems a nuisance but one I\u0027ve ignored. I\u0027ll see if I can repro it and try to figure out what causes it though. However, that\u0027s WITHOUT KAS that I\u0027ve seen that. And I take it the object shouldn\u0027t be spawning 100m away. (it should be attached to the Kerbal right?) So something else might be happening to you and maybe it\u0027s not safe. I\u0027ll look into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you say Kerbal RCS, you mean actual Kerbals on EVA right? And they otherwise behave normally?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you point me at some post links for KAS discussing this or reporting it? And did they have DRE as well? (preferably NON-Linux; if this is isolated to Linux it\u0027s really going to be a PITA for me to troubleshoot since I\u0027m not able to test in that environment right now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I think is happening is this: DRE is trying to initialize certain things when parts load in for the first time. (during Awake and during Start). KSP / Unity can easily have that process halted if errors occur in any plugin at that time so other plugins that need to initialize after that might not be able to. Cascade failure basically.
