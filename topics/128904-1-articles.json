If you assume capital ships have proportionally thicker armor to \u0022tank\u0022 these kinds of unavoidable hits, then they will be very slow indeed, and thus it will be only a matter of time before weapon fire grows sufficient to completely obliterate it. As made apparent by the Naval Battle Club threads, armor is largely ineffective against even kinetic energy weapons, much less nuclear-tipped weapons; what are you going to do against a tungsten rod capped with a 30 megaton warhead\u00A0moving at 5 km/s?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final nail in the coffin is Lancaster\u0027s Law, which states that for ranged combat an\u00A0\u003Cem\u003En^2\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eincrease in quality (e.g, armor, weapons, etc.) is proportional to only an\u00A0\u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0increase in number of opponents, and thus it will be vastly more effective to have a swarm of small ships than several big ones. As such, there is no real reason to utilize large vessels outside of carrier craft, and as previously pointed out anyway, even fighters may be redundant with respect to potent drone-missiles.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond this, all interstellar combat will likely be MAD (mutually assured destruction); building a world-burning laser with interstellar range is probably more practical than amassing a large fleet, because once fired there is absolutely nothing anyone can do about it, and thus one\u00A0can be assured that one\u0027s opponent will be obliterated in fairly short order. Simpler, if less effective, is to\u00A0just construct a nuclear weapon of extraordinary power and ram it into a planet at relativistic speeds; this, too, is nearly impossible to defend against, and will likewise obliterate all life on that body.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, capital ships are definitely impractical, and fighters possibly so; but it is more likely than anything that combat in space will simply not happen at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are basically all wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u00A0A spaceship can have any arbitrary geometry, it doesn\u0027t need to be shaped any particular way. \u00A0Thrust isn\u0027t proportional to engine aperture either, it\u0027s proportional to mass flow * exhaust velocity. \u00A0The type of engine I am talking about, the thrust plume is a narrow beam traveling at several % of the speed of light. \u00A0It\u0027s the helium nuclei\u00A0right off a fusion reaction, redirected into a beam. \u00A0 The actual thrust developed is so low that the ship only accelerates\u00A0at 0.01 G or so, very light. \u00A0The ship can be shaped like a thin pencil made of girders, it does not need to resemble anything you have seen in sci-fi. \u00A0One strategy might be to put the main engine on a kind of rail car so you can move it around for various missions requirements, so you can face the narrow end of your ship at the enemy to minimize profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u00A0Open cycle cooling is the worst kind and not practical for space for most situations. \u00A0Look up \u0022droplet radiator\u0022 for an example of a practical closed cycle cooling method that can vent massive quantities of heat with only tiny losses of coolant. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. \u00A0A heavier\u00A0ship relies on offense to protect itself, not defense. \u00A0It has very very long range laser weapons that can zap out of space smaller ships and incoming missiles and railgun rounds before they ever arrive. \u00A0It also might have it\u0027s own railgun/coilguns, and being heavier, can afford the mass of a\u00A0much longer weapon that has a higher muzzle velocity and thus a further effective range. \u00A0The main \u0022defense\u0022 is to either fire at the enemy laser emitters with your own lasers (since nobody can dodge a laser, even a space fighter, at realistic ranges) or fire at the incoming enemy kinetic rounds and missiles with your own guns and lasers to damage their propulsion. \u00A0Once the enemy projectiles can no longer maneuver, you just burn sideways so when they reach your ship they miss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. \u00A0Lancaster\u0027s law is from the age of non-computer assisted gunnery. \u00A0A swarm of small ships engaging a much heavier ship will not have an advantage if the total firepower of the small ship swarm is less than the large ship firepower, and if the large ship has high speed servos and computer assistance to rapidly change target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing is the large ship commander(s) have the initiative over smaller ships if they have more thrust and/or more dV at a given thrust level. \u00A0If their engine is significantly better, they can choose to engage the small ship fleet only a few members at a time, picking them off with laser fire. \u00A0Space fighters \u0022chasing\u0022 will never catch up because they have more thrust. \u00A0(not that fighters are even practical) \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be \u0022swarmed\u0022 by attackers from all sides isn\u0027t going to happen like you describe for a lot of reasons, the main one being intercepting a vehicle by surrounding it requires more engine performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. \u00A0A spaceship is to patrol the outer colonies, not to genocide entire countries or planets. \u00A0Interstellar warships are incredibly unlikely at all, so it\u0027s all interplanetary patrols.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-31T00:41:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2015 12:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy123\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T00:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse a gravity drive.
