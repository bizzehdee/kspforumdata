That problem. I ran into it during Eve tests; basically, you need to turn your ship in order to keep the prograde marker as close to straight up as possible.

Instead, use the WASD keys and think of your \u0022direction you\u0027re pointing\u0022 marker as \u0022pulling\u0022 your velocity prograde marker towards it; try to keep it close to being straight up, but on the opposite side from your velocity prograde in order to keep your velocity prograde up.
