I can\u0026#39;t live without this!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever I have a question for you; why is it that when I have a, say, rover on the Mun and it has one life support pack on it. Yet it doesn\u0026#39;t have anyone on it. Why is it that the supplies go down on the menu screen. I for instance have a rover with no one on it and it says it\u0026#39;s -6 years. And the thing is that there\u0026#39;s still supplies in the rover. But as soon as I get a kerbal into the rover, they die because of starvation. Why is this and is this a bug? Or am doing something wrong?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, as for a suggestion: I\u0026#39;d love to see two things. First thing would be a warning that displays where you are at that [ship x - kerbals a, b, and c] are low on supplies, whenever the supplies are at a certain point. Maybe you can let us, the users, be able to tweak the amount of days left until they run of supplies. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I\u0026#39;d really like to see an option to \u0022Ration Supplies\u0022. By enabling the option, the food is consumed 50% less as fast, except the crews training is decreased. If you have Jeb Kerman who has level 5 skills, and you chose to ration the food, he will go back to level 0, meaning he can\u0026#39;t use SAS, or do anything a pilot can do.
