I can\u0027t live without this!  \n\nHowever I have a question for you; why is it that when I have a, say, rover on the Mun and it has one life support pack on it. Yet it doesn\u0027t have anyone on it. Why is it that the supplies go down on the menu screen. I for instance have a rover with no one on it and it says it\u0027s -6 years. And the thing is that there\u0027s still supplies in the rover. But as soon as I get a kerbal into the rover, they die because of starvation. Why is this and is this a bug? Or am doing something wrong?  \n\nAlso, as for a suggestion: I\u0027d love to see two things. First thing would be a warning that displays where you are at that [ship x - kerbals a, b, and c] are low on supplies, whenever the supplies are at a certain point. Maybe you can let us, the users, be able to tweak the amount of days left until they run of supplies.   \n\nAlso, I\u0027d really like to see an option to \u0022Ration Supplies\u0022. By enabling the option, the food is consumed 50% less as fast, except the crews training is decreased. If you have Jeb Kerman who has level 5 skills, and you chose to ration the food, he will go back to level 0, meaning he can\u0027t use SAS, or do anything a pilot can do. But he can still preform basic tasks such as move the ship and whatnot.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T05:10:17Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 05:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Betelgeuse**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mynar Moonshadow","CreatedById":118328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T20:44:57Z","Content":"GokouZWAR mentioned over in the MKS thread his issue of non orange suits being returned as tourists on Kerbin instead of returning to their original professions.
