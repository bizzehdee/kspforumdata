One thing that interested me about ksp2 is the focus on higher technology engines being focused on speed. Its been stated that torch ships (the end game engines) are sometimes less efficient then your previous engines and are focused on speeds. The thing is, why? Why the need for speed. With timewarp, going faster is roughly the same speed as going at a slower speed for the player. For cargo transportation, cargo does not care about the speed that it goes*, and focusing on efficiency and throughput seems much more practical here. These engines are clearly going to be attractive, but there seems to be no internal factors attractive about them, so what if there was something external?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe obvious thing here is life support, the faster you go the less life support you need, this however feels weak. The requirements of life support have to be balanced around being easy enough for early game missions to nearby planets, so it cant be that much of a burden. Considering torch ships are for maneuvers in the solar systems, its not like the maneuvers would take relatively long anyways. Late game life support seems like a solved issue, and while torch ships would definitely help with it, I doubt they\u0027d be a significant difference in terms of gameplay. So what if there was cargo that cared about speed. Certain resources decaying with time seems like it would offer good justification for torch ships, the obvious one here is antimatter, however I can see something like maybe a manufactured element that\u0027s in the island of stability that while it passively decays, it makes a great structural component for rocket parts. Even this raises more questions though, if it\u0027s antimatter or some other unstable fuel what\u0027s the point of going fast just to be able to transport your own rocket fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order for us to get some grasp at this, we need to go back to square one. Rockets are from moving one thing to another. Torch ships are generally for transportation in the same solar system very quickly (and presumably very far). This means that torch ships are\u00A0 for moving things long distances quickly, therefore there\u0027s something that needs to be moved\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Elong distances\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0quickly. Assuming this is some sort of intermediate unstable resource that needs processing to be stable, this implies that for some reason, you cant process/stablize/apply it nearby where you\u0027re harvesting it. Maybe the planet you get it from cant support colonies (this raises a whole other can of worms), maybe the processing needs very high gravity to accomplish and most planets/bodies don\u0027t have enough gravity, maybe the resource you\u0027re harvesting isn\u0027t even from a planet but instead is from a gas giant/star. I don\u0027t know what this intermediate would be, but either way it introduces a very interesting element and I have a feeling its going to be something very exotic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-30T15:53:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2022 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Strawberry\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thelittleidot","CreatedById":218377,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-30T05:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that KSP should not have to be this complicated...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-30T09:08:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, first of all, torch ship engines are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Einsanely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0efficient compared to standard interplanetary engines, which is why you can do baristochrone trajectories with them without seeing 99% of the mass taken up by fuel.
