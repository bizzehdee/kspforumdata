pounding rain, and massive tidal surges, Hurricane Beta stretched from one end of Kerbin\u0027s East Ocean to the other. It was a force of nature the likes of which no Kerbal had seen in generations and caught every coastal establishment by surprise. For the Kerbin Space Center, it looked to be the final nail in the coffin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMonths earlier, the politicos back inland had cut \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s funding down to nothing, mothballing most of the facilities and leaving just enough in the budget to keep the halls clean and the lights on. Even so, Gene Kerman had managed to squeeze enough funds and Science from them to send up the occasional rocket. One such flight had been sent out to the pad shortly before Hurricane Beta registered on the tracking station monitors - a flight that promised to be a total loss, since it would never launch before the storm hit and there was no time to bring it back inside the Vehicle Assembly Building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeta rolled inland, directly over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, striking it with every ounce of fury imaginable\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdJDPepGOAM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCoastal flooding sent debris washing over the runway, littering it with spent rocket parts. Penance for the kerbals\u0027 wastefulness - hundreds of rockets had jettisoned lifter stages above the bay over the years, and the hurricane seemed determined to throw every last chunk of it back. Even the flag flying at the recruitment complex was torn asunder. When at last the skies cleared, it was clear the once-proud spaceport was beyond repair. \u003Cem\u003EEverything\u003C/em\u003E had been utterly destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They were building the last Duna transfer pylon right here,\u0022 Jeb said wistfully. He stared up through the twisted girders that had once been the roof of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u0022We were so close to going interplanetary.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Be glad we didn\u0027t,\u0022 Bob answered, picking his way through the rubble. \u0022With the wreck the tracking station is in, we\u0027d have lost all contact with Kerbin and probably gotten stranded there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve been stranded worse places.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob rolled his eyes. \u0022Please, the Mun Orbiter had enough fuel left in those OHLs you could\u0027ve flown it right back to Kerbin any time. Not the same as being stuck on another planet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Or in space,\u0022 Bill chimed in. \u0022Remember what happened to Kerny and the others?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027d rather be up there than down here,\u0022 Jeb insisted. \u0022What do you think it\u0027ll take to get those bureaucrats to fund us again?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob laughed. \u0022You\u0027re kidding. There\u0027s nothing here \u003Cem\u003Eleft\u003C/em\u003E to fund, Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked thoughtful. \u0022Isn\u0027t there, though? A runway is just a long flat strip of ground. Sure the pavement\u0027s wrecked, but we\u0027ll have to start small anyway - we could do with a dirt runway for a while. Bulldozing would be cheap. Same goes for the launch pad.\u0022 He began pacing around the ruined \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, waving his arms excitedly. \u0022Hangars don\u0027t have to be fancy, just keep the weather off. You remember what we started with, way back in the early years.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill nodded. \u0022Tracking station\u0027s the worst of it - even the cheap radio equipment is still expensive.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tech\u0027s gotten cheaper, I\u0027m sure we could find something at a good bargain - or heck, laying on the side of the road even.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s fuel tanks, Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You never know. Besides, Beta washed up loads of old junk. Drain the seawater out, give it a good scrub, could be good as new!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob kicked a loose chunk of concrete. \u0022\u003Cem\u003E\u0027And having trod upon the heavens and tasted the freedom of the stars, he would never again accept the shackles of a single world...\u0027\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 After a moment\u0027s pause, he continued with resignation. \u0022Alright Jebediah Kerman, so what\u0027s your plan? Kidnap a senator\u0027s fuzzling and hold it ransom?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Senators get to keep fuzzlings?\u0022 Bill went wide(er)-eyed. \u0022I always wanted one as a young kerb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re not kidnapping anything,\u0022 Jeb stated firmly. \u0022We\u0027ll talk to Gene.

As good fortune would have it however, the admin he \u0022consulted\u0022 for was one Dudrin L. Kerlington, a longtime proponent of the space program. The Kerman Trio were as good as rock stars, in his eyes. Gene arranged a meeting for them, Jeb bought bus tickets (three hours of pure torture, sitting in a tin can he \u003Cem\u003Edidn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E have control over), and they arrived at Kerlington\u0027s office late in the evening. The administrator was still seated at his desk, reviewing reports, but gave all three a warm smile as they entered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jebediah Kerman! Bill, Bob, good to see you as well! What can I do for you fine fellows?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Find us a spare rocket, so we can strap Jeb to it?\u0022 Bob suggested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerlington gave a deep chuckle. \u0022As I\u0027ve heard tell, it wouldn\u0027t be the first time. But Gene didn\u0027t send you here to beg me for fireworks now, did he?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mr. Kerlington-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Please, Dudrin is fine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022-Dudrin, we\u0027re looking to rebuild the Kerbin Space Center.\u0022 Jeb gave Kerlington his best flyboy smile. \u0022Gene seemed to think you could help get us flying again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe administrator rubbed his mustache thoughtfully. \u0022Tall order, that. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E didn\u0027t have a lot of friends up here, even before the hurricane leveled it. But there might be a way... Take a look at this.\u0022 He pushed a folder across the desk to Jeb, its corner marked with an orange hexagon. Jeb opened it, reading carefully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeside him, Bill grew restless and wandered over to the filing cabinet. A funny scent had caught his attention, and he climbed up the drawers to peer over the top behind it. Bob shot a reproachful glare at his backside. \u0022Bill!\u0022 he hissed, \u0022what in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKer\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s name are you doing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hang on, I think there\u0027s some old snacks stuck back here.\u0022 The cabinet shook slightly as he rummaged behind it. \u0022Ahah! Wow, these wrappers are \u003Cem\u003Eold\u003C/em\u003E! How long have they been back there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob\u0027s cheeks flushed dark green under his stubble. \u0022Get down, blast it. You\u0027re embarrassing us!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSheepishly, Bill hopped off the cabinet and placed the dusty treasure on Kerlington\u0027s desk, just as Jeb finished reading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So this scientist, Duderov, he thinks we\u0027ll be able to find this \u0027karbonite\u0027 stuff all over?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDudrin nodded. \u0022Naturally occurring as liquid or gas, nearly universal - if it\u0027s true, it could mean the end of expensive fuel stations, easier interplanetary travel, and would make space look a whole lot more attractive. At least,\u0022 he added, \u0022to certain interested parties.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What is it you\u0027re proposing, Kerlington?\u0022 Bob queried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll get you a grant - fight tooth and nail for it if I have to - though I can\u0027t promise it\u0027ll be much. Coordinate with Gene Kerman, get the wheels turning and the rockets flying again, and we\u0027ll make sure the private sector knows it. That\u0027s where the money is, Jebediah. Trust an old kerman, convince those suits there\u0027s money in the stars and they\u0027ll climb over each other to reach it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA month\u0027s time saw the rubble cleared from the ruined spaceport.

As soon as it was operational, Gene Kerman settled in and set his small team to scanning the skies. As a warm-up test, he gave them the coordinates of the old Arc Luna base on the Mun. Unless something catastrophic had happened to their little gray satellite, the base and rover should still be intact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlmost immediately, they began getting back readings - the base was over a year old, but still very much operational. A new crew would have no difficulty settling in, if they chose to reactivate it later. Sadly, the base\u0027s small lifter drones had lost torque in their SAS modules. Some flaw had manifested in the OKTO2 probe cores, making them all but useless - their engines had no vectoring and they were not equipped with RCS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene shrugged. They still had a long way to go before returning to the Mun became an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently, some Kerbals had begun showing an interest in setting new records - which Kerbal had the tallest head, who the fastest snack-eater was, how many times Jeb had survived explosive failure, and the like. It had gotten so popular, a new agency had formed to log all of Kerbin\u0027s global achievements. Several letters from the \u0022Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society\u0022 sat on Gene\u0027s desk, offering small rewards for any milestones KSC could set. Most had already been done once - Ker\u0027s sake, they\u0027d landed on the Mun already! - but the KWFRKS hadn\u0027t been around then, and they wanted \u003Cem\u003Eofficial \u003C/em\u003Erecords.

Every scrap of Science had been lost, along with the VAB\u0027s plentiful catalog of parts. The only equipment KSC had left was whatever Hurricane Beta had washed ashore, cleaned up and made (barely) flight-worthy. To further complicate matters, the space center had changed so much in the last few months that even their old survey data would\u0027ve been woefully inaccurate, if they could\u0027ve recovered it at all. If R\u0026amp;D was going to start anywhere, it may as well be their own grounds. To that end, the mechanics in the VAB assembled a small survey vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob had never been more embarrassed by a ship in his life. \u0022What in Ker\u0027s name is that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We call it \u0027The Dumbell,\u0027\u0022 a mechanic explained. \u0022We couldn\u0027t recover any wheels, so we just emptied out some fuel tanks. You\u0027ll have to push it to get it anywhere, but the capsule\u0027s got plenty of space for survey reports.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know the Mark 1 capsule, Jenners, it\u0027s never had \u0027plenty of space\u0027 for anything.

He took observations from the launch pad, the crawlway, and when that was done, moved on to the runway and SPH. He even secured \u0022in-flight\u0022 observations when a hatch malfunction smacked him in the rump and sent him sailing several meters over the dirt. When it was done, he was bone-tired and ached everywhere, but at least they had a start on survey data.

As the sole registered pilot on KSC\u0027s roster, it was up to Jeb to secure the height record. Without decouplers, there\u0027d be no separating of stages to lighten the load, so a pair of girders were grafted to the rocket\u0027s sides, with extra chutes on top to ensure a safe landing. It was a simple up-and-down no goal beyond getting some altitude, but Jeb didn\u0027t care. It was still \u003Cem\u003Eflying\u003C/em\u003E again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Bottlerocket 1, as they named it, practically screamed off the launch pad, leaving KSC far below a moment later. The tank was still half-full when Jeb crossed 5,000 meters, trailing vapor as it broke through the clouds. Gene\u0027s voice crackled through the radio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright Jeb, we\u0027ve got the record.

Jeb attempted to open the capsule\u0027s hatch for EVA, only to find it had been sealed.

Rockets were rolled out to the launchpad for Jeb almost as fast as they could weld them, and as soon as he launched, it was back to the plane hangar. There, they grafted new parts onto a Mk 1 capsule for testing, and carved off the old ones with as much precision as they could manage.

The KVx 1 was a tripod lifter with a small LV-909 tucked under the capsule in the center.

With the added weight of three tanks and their LV-T30\u0027s, Jeb kept a little fuel to spare for a descending retro-burn. The chutes would probably have no difficulty handling the load, but if playing it a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E safe meant not crashing and exploding, so much the better.

Instead of the satisfying rush of a rocket engine pressing him back, he heard only the soft pop of flameout. Worried, he checked his gauges, and found the central tank was bone-dry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022KVx 1 to Control, reading me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We copy, Jeb.

Jeb worried briefly if they might get tangled in the rocket nacelles, but soon enough he was drifting back down towards the space center and all three Mk16s remained stable. A few short spurts from the rocket motors helped slow the craft below 100m/s, as he\u0027d intended. At just over 1,000 meters up, they caught the wind and unfurled, jerking him back in the seat. It wasn\u0027t the same as \u003Cem\u003Eacceleration\u003C/em\u003E, but he enjoyed the G\u0027s anyway. The rest of the ride down was out of his hands, so he simply leaned back and listened to the rush of the wind, imagining he was returning from some great journey to Minmus, or even Duna. At around 200 meters up, Gene\u0027s voice interrupted his reverie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control to KVx 1, do you copy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Still awake, Control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb, you\u0027ve drifted a little bit from launch path, you\u0027re coming down over the crawlway tracks.

I go where the wind blo-oh!\u0022 The KVx 1 touched down with the scrape of metal on concrete, one nacelle catching the raised track of the crawlway. Off-balance, the tripod craft tipped over onto its side. Jeb heard a loud \u003Cem\u003Ebang\u003C/em\u003E as impact sparks ignited fuel vapors in Tank 3. Over the headset, he heard Gene sigh heavily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022KVx 1 has landed. Ready for round 2, Boss.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, Jenners and his crew had pushed the second Mk1 capsule out on the runway for Bill to run his own tests. A tiny Sepratron I was grafted to the right side of the pod, while a cylinder of \u0022mystery goo\u0022 perched on the left. No one really knew if the Goo was alive, or just very good at faking it, but they all agreed it was excellent for doing Science with. From the simple dirt runway however, the Goo just appeared bored and innert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter observing the Goo, Bill gave Control a quick countdown and fired the Sepratron. Like the LV-909, it had been drained of propellant, but testing circuits confirmed positive ignition. Had there been any fuel in it, he\u0027d probably be spinning crazily around the grasslands about now. He radioed in the results and climbed out of the capsule to help Jenners haul the pod back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s next flight, KVx 2, was a much taller affair. KSC had finally gotten in touch with Rockomax, and they wanted flight test data on one of their solid-fuel BACC boosters. To ensure a safe landing, the mechanics affixed a trio of radial chutes around the booster\u0027s top, just below the command pod. Odds were, the Mk16s on the tripod engines would suffice, but after Jeb\u0027s little accident on the crawlway, they wanted to be extra careful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill, on the other hand, conducted his next test by \u003Cem\u003Edescending\u003C/em\u003E. His pod was attached to a TT-18a launch clamp, suspended several meters above the runway. The sudden drop, followed by an equally sudden stop, nearly made him toss his snacks onto the pod\u0027s controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs afternoon became early evening, the KVx 3 was rolled out to the pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s this test, Gene? I see a T45 under there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yep. Fire at high altitude - the parameters are in your flight computer already - and try for a new altitude record for Kwa\u0027ferks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ka-what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022K-W-F-R-K-S. The world-record guys.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Jeb headed towards his next ride, he glanced back. \u0022So you\u0027re saying there\u0027s actually fuel for the T45 this time?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I am indeed. Shoot for the sky, young Jebediah.\u0022 Jeb\u0027s grin was positively manic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the rocket shot skyward, he noted the LV-T45 test requested an ignition altitude of at least 22 kilometers, at speed. Even if he conserved fuel, the main T35 engines would run dry well before that. This would be a \u003Cem\u003Echallenge\u003C/em\u003E - he had to hit his altitude, at the right speed, and he\u0027d have to do it coasting on momentum only. Thinking quickly, he throttled back and kept an eye to his airspeed indicator. He\u0027d thread the minimum speed up as high as he could manage, until 1/10th of the tanks remained, then go full-throttle and hope the boost carried him high enough and fast enough. Once the T45 kicked in, he should already be plenty close enough to hitting the altitude record. Almost as an afterthought, he nudged the nose slightly to his right, out to sea. The last two flights had come back down directly on KSC grounds - he didn\u0027t want to risk tipping this one over on the crawlway or worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the T45 ignited, he felt like a rock had landed on his chest. The g-forces pressed him back into the command seat as though it\u0027d become quicksand trying to envelop him. The fresh rocket motor carried him well above record height, where Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere became a pale blue sheen on the horizon, and the sky was a deep black filled with stars. He stretched out a gloved hand, touching the capsule\u0027s tiny window. \u0022Soon,\u0022 he whispered. \u0022I\u0027ll be back soon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill\u0027s final test was a radial decoupler. He was getting tired of not-doing-anything-interesting, but as the resident flight engineer, it was his responsibility to make sure the parts worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bill to Tower Control, everyone ready up there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ready and waiting, Bill.

He remembered the 38K\u0027s being key components of their old lifter stages, but he was always too preoccupied with the act of flying to wonder what the staging was doing behind him. When the explosive bolts blew, they knocked him back hard into the pod\u0027s wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gwah! Wreck me, what just happened there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oooh, nice shot Kerman! Quick, EVA and have a look before it lands!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMystified, Bill climbed out of his pod and looked where the Tower directed him. In the distance, a black speck was arching down onto KSC\u0027s lawn, out near the kerbonaut complex. There was a fiery explosion as it struck the ground. He heard applause and cheering over the radio, as well as much crunching of snacks. \u0022Well,\u0022 he said, feeling a bit dazed, \u0022we sure know it works.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/lEhiI/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-25T09:40:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2016 09:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kieve\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheGamingNoobster","CreatedById":94887,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T11:04:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Very nice\u0022, Boris Johnson.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I may agree with him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T21:54:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes I hate me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png\u0022 alt=\u0022-_-\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was doing some trials for the next update, and after completing them hit \u0022recover vessel\u0022 instead of reverting back to hanger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDerp - those weren\u0027t supposed to be official, and I took no screenshots!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried reloading from my last quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out my last quicksave was \u003Cem\u003Ewhen I began the career\u003C/em\u003E.

A separate pile detailed the parts they\u0027d worked out with other manufacturers. Like KSC, the Rockomax, KerbolWorks Rocketry, and O.M.B. facilities were all hard-hit by Hurricane Beta, and were still repairing damage to their production plants. Parts catalogs were limited right now, but hopefully would grow as things came back online.

Short version is, today was productive but we won\u0027t be able to keep this pace up very long. It\u0027s too rough on the crews, and I mean pilots and mechanics alike. We\u0027ll run ourselves ragged trying to keep the lights on at this rate.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So the issue is funding.\u0022 Mortimer steepled his fingers on the table thoughtfully. \u0022I have to make a trip back to the Capitol tomorrow evening. I can see about arranging a fundraiser dinner later this week - guests must have \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E notice, of course.

Test-flights and altitude records simply won\u0027t do. We can stake our reputation on achievements, but they have to be significant, or you\u0027ll barely see a return. Also,\u0022 he added, \u0022it will help if some of your kerbonauts can make an appearance at the dinner as well.

Presiding over an active mission was stressful enough - trying to run an entire space center required more administrating than he had time for. Once orbital missions began flying, there simply wouldn\u0027t be room for these meetings. Until he could pass that particular burden however, there was one more task left for today. \u0022Karol, can you send Danbrea from KR in please?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe skies were cloudy as dawn broke over the launch pad. Fresh from the VAB, the lightweight KSV-X1 sat ready and waiting. Built in two stages, it consisted of an inexpensive Rockomax BACC solid-fuel booster, with a KWR Wildcat liquid-fuel engine and tank on top. A pair of Goo containers were bolted to the side, almost as an afterthought. Jeb sat fidgeting in the cockpit, awaiting launch. Today was the day he touched space again. \u0022Misson Control to X1,\u0022 Gene\u0027s voice crackled over the radio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022X1 reads you. \u0027Morning boss!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good morning Jeb.

You are go for ignition.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe BACC\u0027s thrust output had been reduced 25% for better fuel and atmospheric efficiency. Even so, it hurtled into the sky like an arrow from a very large bow, making Jeb\u0027s teeth rattle as the booster roared underneath him. He loved the sensation, but forgot what a kick in the pants these big solid-fuel boosters could be. It blazed beneath him for a full minute before exhausting its fuel at around 7 klicks up. There was a heart-stopping jolt as the separator fired, dumping the spent booster and triggering the Wildcat. The BACC\u0027s smoky yellow plumes were replaced by the clean blue flame of liquid propellant, and the KSV-X1 surged forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb checked his trajectory readings, noting when projected apoapsis passed 80 kilometers. KWFRKS had challenges for passing 56,000 meters, and for escaping atmosphere at 70,000, and the X1 was built to hit them both. It lacked the muscle needed for full orbit however, and Gene had made it very clear he was to land back at KSC. Reluctantly, he cut the throttle and let the X1 coast upwards. Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere barely made a sound as the X1 rushed through it, but drag still managed to steal two kilometers from the craft\u0027s apoapsis when it finally peaked and began its lazy fall back to the ground. Jeb drifted in his seat, relishing the weightlessness for a long moment before he remembered the Goo. Quickly, he made some observations through a tiny camera in the sample pod, and some notes of his own through the Mk1 pod\u0027s equally tiny window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin rolled beneath him as the X1 descended back into atmosphere. At 2,000 meters, he engaged the chutes and with a soft bump the rocket touched down on the plains just west of KSC. It would take the crews a few minutes to drive out and collect him and his rocket, so he pulled out a granola snack to munch as he waited, and wondered what his next flight would bring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, Jenners guided another part-testing capsule to the runway, with Bill strapped securely into the pod. His manifest required a grounded ignition test of the LV-909, and firing the TT-70 Radial decoupler. The latter made him grin. After last night\u0027s surprise, decoupler tests were now something he looked forward to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright Bill, test capsule in position. Give us a few minutes to get clear and get our snacks, and we\u0027ll see how that decoupler fires!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sounds good Jenners! Radio when ready.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few minutes passed while Jenners and the other mechanics got their flatbed out of the way and dug out packets of Krispy Mix. \u0022Ground team is clear, Bill. Fire when ready!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a wicked gleam in his eye, Bill thumbed the decoupler release. The pod kicked to the left as the explosive bolts blew, and he watched from the pod\u0027s monitor as the mount sailed off over the plains. The ground crews cheered as it struck dirt and exploded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is the best job on Kerbin,\u0022 the kerbonaut laughed, jotting down his report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022More parts tests?\u0022 Jeb sighed. \u0022C\u0027mon Gene! We broke atmo! Let me go orbital this time!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission controller shook his head. \u0022Sorry Jeb, not just yet. You know we need to make bank here, and we\u0027ve got some important survey contracts lined up - but we need flight data from those jet engines first. Parts testing it is.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re killing me, Gene.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No faster than you\u0027re killing yourself - or trying to. Unless you\u0027d rather someone else take the KVx 4 up?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KVx 4 was yet another test-vehicle, with a single Basic Jet Engine beneath and a pair of TFE731 turbines on each side. Only one was required for testing, but two were easier to balance. Jeb was starting to hate the KVx rockets, but he\u0027d be damned if he gave up flight command over something so petty. Luckily the altitudes for both jet engines were close enough, he could fire them off in rapid succession. Less than ten minutes later, he was drifting back to ground at the end of KSC\u0027s runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KVx 5 followed immediately, this time a test of the Rockomax Mark 55 Radial engines at altitude, and T2 Solid Rocket Separation Boosters splashed down - \u0022Wait, \u003Cem\u003Esplashed down\u003C/em\u003E?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s right. Tetragon wants to see if they\u0027ll ignite in water.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was utterly mystified. \u0022But why? When would we \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E use a solid-fuel in water? Even \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E haven\u0027t done anything that crazy.\u0022 He thought for a moment, and added under his breath, \u0022yet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I ... have no idea,\u0022 Gene admitted. \u0022But they\u0027re paying us for it, so we\u0027ll get it done. Besides, it\u0027ll give you a chance to get our R\u0026amp;D boys some data for ocean-landing. They\u0027ll need it later.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s test of the KVx 5 proved significantly more challenging than any others he\u0027d performed thus far. There simply wasn\u0027t enough fuel in the tanks to reach the required height of 10.5km, at at a speed of at least 270m/s - at least, under power. He\u0027d run out of fuel well before then, which meant having to coast the rest of the way, with atmosphere constantly slowing him down. No matter how he looked at it, there would only be a precious few seconds while the KVx 5 maintained both the altitude \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E speed required for Rockmax\u0027s contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe gritted his teeth, and grinned fiercely. The KVx ships were starting to wear on him, no doubt, but it was still a chance to affirm his status as the best damned pilot on Kerbin. Split-second reactions, tiny margin of error? This is what he lived for. Once more, Jeb hurtled into the sky, trailing plumes of fire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excuse me, I\u0027m here to see Ms. Danbrea. Is she in?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKarol the receptionist looked up from her desk. The Kerbal in front of her had thick grey hair and an equally thick grey mustache-beard. \u0022Burhat!\u0022 she beamed. \u0022Welcome back! I\u0027ll let Danbrea know you\u0027re here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you,\u0022 he answered, giving her a warm smile. \u0022KSC has certainly changed a lot since I was here last.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, the storm really - sorry, hold on,\u0022 she held up one finger as Danbrea picked up the phone in her office. \u0022Yes, he\u0027s here now. Do you want me to send him in? Of course, I\u0027ll let him know.\u0022 Karol hung up the phone and motioned down the hallway to the right of her desk. \u0022She\u0027s in her office now, just go on in. I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll be happy to see you. Though,\u0022 she added with a sly smirk, \u0022not as happy as I am.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you Karol,\u0022 he said again, refusing to be flustered. The receptionist was sweet, but she could be a shameless flirt at times. He\u0027d learned to resist her charms. Mostly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite being told to \u0022go on in,\u0022 he gave a quick knock on the door frame to announce his presence. The Kerbal Resources Director looked up from her desk and motioned him in. \u0022Mr. Kerbalski,\u0022 she greeted him, holding out a hand. \u0022Good to see you again. You\u0027re a tough Kerbal to get a hold of.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurhat chuckled. \u0022I was never a fan of the spotlight the way Jebediah is. I\u0027m glad to see KSC is-\u0022 The roar of rocket engines drown him out as the KVx 5 on the pad lifted off. \u0022-flying again,\u0022 he finished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027ll have to get used to that. They\u0027ve been firing off flights nonstop for the last day and a half now. Gene\u0027s up to his eyeballs in contract work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Space flight is privatized? I\u0027d heard things were a bit different, but I had no idea you\u0027d gone corporate.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanbrea shrugged. \u0022It\u0027s not quite like that, but the Capitol is only providing a small amount of funding. We supplement with private contractors to keep the funds flowing. Mortimer could tell you more, if you wanted to know the details.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think I\u0027ll stick with flying.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good choice. Now then,\u0022 she dug out a folder bearing his name, \u0022let\u0027s get you enrolled in the program.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJenners looked over his latest baby. The KVx rockets flew, and the KSV-X1 had flown \u003Cem\u003Ehigh\u003C/em\u003E, but this... this would \u003Cem\u003Efly\u003C/em\u003E. He was really beginning to like the new parts the R\u0026amp;D boys had secured for him. Now if only they\u0027d add proper landing gear to their list. Officially titled the KAV-11, his Skipper was a twin-engine VTOL using a pair of the new jet turbines provided by USI. It was light, agile, and carefully balanced to ensure proper flight performance. Flying a twin-engine was like hanging from the sky by a string - the balance had to be \u003Cem\u003Ejust right\u003C/em\u003E or the pilot might lose control and the craft would tumble and flip. And crash. They definitely didn\u0027t want it to crash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022She\u0027s pretty,\u0022 a voice behind him admired. The mechanic turned around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbalski! They didn\u0027t tell me \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u0027d\u003C/em\u003E be flying her!\u0022 Jenners gave Burhat a swift hug and backslap. \u0022Ker bless you, kerman, it\u0027s good to have a pilot \u0027round here that ain\u0027t crazy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurhat laughed. \u0022Come on Jenners, Jeb\u0027s not that bad.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe when you were around he wasn\u0027t, but being out of the sky for months made him a bit stir-crazy I think. And you know he wasn\u0027t all that grounded to begin with.\u0022 Jenners shook his head, grinning. \u0022Anyway, Skipper\u0027s all yours. Two engines, plenty of fuel, and an emergency chute just in case she misbehaves. Hopefully you won\u0027t have to use it though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hopefully.\u0022 Kerbalski climbed up onto the plane\u0027s nose and popped open the canopy. \u0022Let\u0027s see how she handles.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJenners scurried back as the KAV-11\u0027s turbines spooled up, a low hum building to a howling crescendo that set the blood pumping. \u003Cem\u003ESomeday I\u0027ll have to take flight classes\u003C/em\u003E, the mechanic promised himself. He watched hungrily as Burhat and Skipper lifted above the dusty runway, angling for the mountains to the west.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene had assigned two nav points for Burhat to check out. The first was Bobak\u0027s Approach, in the foothills of the mountains. He cruised along steadily, getting a feel for the tiny VTOL. Skipper was well-behaved for a twin-engine, but he noticed a subtle tendency for the craft to nose up, especially at high throttle. Despite the care Jenners had put into her, the KAV-11 was still slightly tipsy. Burhat hoped it wouldn\u0027t get worse as the fuel drained. As he neared Bobak\u0027s Approach, he brought the craft level and slowed the engines, drifting to a low-altitude hover as he made his observations. Skipper mounted a Communotron 16 antenna behind the cockpit, so he elected to radio in his findings, rather than scribble notes while trying to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Skipper to KSC Tower, come in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tower reading you, Skipper. How\u0027s she flying?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nimble but slightly tipsy. Tell Jenners she\u0027s a good girl but her sister will be more refined.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal manning the ATC tower chuckled at that. \u0022Will do, Skipper. We\u0027ll set out doilies.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tower, standby for survey data. Transmitting altimetry and crew observation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Affirmative Skipper, Tower is standing by to receive.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile Burhat made his report, the plane continued drifting west, nearing the mountains. As he finished transmitting, he released the landing legs and scanned the mountainside, seeking a flat place to set down. Gene had made it clear any additional data or observations he could get would be helpful to KSC, and as far as he knew no one had surveyed the mountains yet. As Skipper hovered over the rocky terrain however, he began to think better of it. The USI turbines were powerful but slow to respond and likely to send him bouncing off the ground and into a cliff. And Skipper just wasn\u0027t balanced well enough for a smooth drop, she drifted too much. Somewhat discouraged, he retracted the legs and rolled the plane to its side, pointing the turbines out to sea for the second nav point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArea 7T-MIP was well out over the ocean to the southeast of KSC. Burhat didn\u0027t know what he was expected to observe, but he dutifully made his report as he brought Skipper to a hover around 5,000 meters. The craft was starting to pitch up more strongly now, and he was eager to set her down back at the space center. Jenners might be proud of her, but as the pilot Burhat preferred not to fight his own craft for control. Skipper came in low, drifting forward around 400 meters. Burhat waited until he\u0027d cleared the Research \u0026amp; Development grounds, then killed the engines and deployed the emergency chute. At 11.5m/s, the landing gave him a good jolt, but the legs held and nothing was damaged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Another ocean survey? What are they trying to find out there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene gave Burhat a wry smile. \u0022You know those stories about the Space Kraken that sometimes destroys ships? Somebody at Tetragon thinks there might be an ocean-dwelling Kraken that destroys boats too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s ridiculous,\u0022 the kerbonaut scoffed. \u0022Who would build a boat on Kerbin anyway\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111518-Tempting-Fate-the-KSV-Kraken-Pic-Heavy-Updated-3-19-15%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E?\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not my place to ask. How\u0027d your meeting with Jenners go, by the way?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He was a bit disappointed with Skipper, but he\u0027s building the KAV-12 as a quad-engine, which should fix the stability concerns. Each engine has a dedicated fuel cell, so fuel imbalance won\u0027t be an issue.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Clever. That your idea?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bill\u0027s actually. He got bored and was looking for new decouplers to launch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ker help us,\u0022 Gene laughed. \u0022I\u0027ll have to get him tasked soon or KSC\u0027s lawn will look even worse than when Beta rolled through.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was just past noon when Jenners had the KAV-12 \u0022Slider\u0022 brought out to the runway. Wider and sleeker than her predecessor, Slider also mounted a Probodobodyne OKTO behind the cockpit. Burhat had questioned its addition at first, but Jenners assured him the craft was not intended to be unkerballed, it was simply there to help with flight guidance and alignment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The cockpit faces down most of the time,\u0022 he explained. \u0022That can really mess with your sense of direction, so the OKTO helps keep you oriented. It\u0027s also useful for VTOL landings, to help kill drift velocity.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nav point for \u0022Zone KEIZ\u0022 specified an observation \u003Cem\u003Eabove\u003C/em\u003E 17,800 meters. As Burhat quickly discovered, pushing Slider to that altitude was going to be a tricky proposition. The KAV-12 mounted only two intakes, aligned along the craft\u0027s fuselage. This meant they spent most of their time facing downward, and intake suffered as a result. The BJE\u0027s had a low flameout tolerance, and began to sputter the moment the air thinned out - above 10 klicks. He nursed the throttle back, bringing the nose up as gently as he could. Even changing pitch disrupted the airflow and made the engines cough. Slider was beautifully stable to fly, but in her own way she was just as touchy as Skipper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a little luck and a lot of pluck, Burhat peaked the craft at 17,900 meters, just as he entered Zone KEIZ. Even as he leaned over to make his observations, the front right \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E rear left engines sparked and died, sending the KAV-12 into a whirling spin that threatened to snap Burhat\u0027s restraints and splatter him across the canopy. Quickly he killed the throttle entirely, forcing Slider out of her spin with SAS torque. Fortunately the craft was light enough that the SAS ring didn\u0027t suck the electrical dry, and he brought the throttle back up to 33%. Sparks and smoke belched from the air-starved engines as they spooled back up. Burhat glanced to his left, seeing the contrails the engines left as they slid sideways through the thin air. A long downward-sloping curve, but gradually drawing level as the engines powered back up.

However, by the time I started hitting Mun and Minmus, I had taken to using \u0022expendable\u0022 Kerbals, since I was still new to KSP at the time and didn\u0027t want to risk my valuable kerbonauts.

I could use it, after all these KVx flights.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I ran into Shelbree on her way to the VAB, bringing some plans over from R\u0026amp;D. Jenners has his crew assembling the parts now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb gave him a curious grin. \u0022Kerston? I thought she was flight-certified. What\u0027s she doing in R\u0026amp;D?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene shrugged. \u0022Apparently she signed on with Research \u0026amp; Development when we resumed operations. Anyhow, I thought the plans would interest you more. KSV-X2 is designed to attain full orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Outstanding! ...So, wait, what\u0027s the bad news?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You have to take KVx 6 up first. Jet turbine test.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wreck me. Well, let\u0027s get this done then,\u0022 he said with resignation. \u0022Gotta keep moving forward, straight ahead\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOIr1v6LlRY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E.\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor KVx 6, the engineers had decided to try something a bit different. Rather than burning expensive amounts of fuel and oxidizer with rockets, they\u0027d outfitted the KVx capsule with two jet-powered pylons. Taking advantage of Tetragon\u0027s generosity, the pylons used two more of the D-30F7 Turbojet engines, with the test-model mounted in the center below the command pod. Using jet engines this way felt strange to Jeb, but if it did the job he wasn\u0027t going to complain. Besides, he had to admit it looked kind of neat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft was slow to take off - the Turbojets took some time to spool up before he could feel the thrust and the acceleration was gradual. As he passed 10,000 meters altitude, he still hadn\u0027t met the airspeed velocity Tetragon was requesting, and began to wonder if he\u0027d top minimum speed at all before he broke the upper altitude limit. Finally, at 15,500 meters up, the craft was moving at the required 480m/s and he could engage the ignition for the third test engine. With that done, he shut the engines down and waited for the KVx 6 to coast towards apoapsis, and return to Kerbin\u0027s surface. The jets were equally slow to spool \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E, and he drifted up above 30 kilometers before he felt that brief moment of weightlessness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe popped the chutes at just over 2,000 meters. They would not fill out until a kilometer above the surface, but he\u0027d barely used any of the jet fuel in his ascent and the small test craft was still quite heavy. Too heavy, in fact - even after the parachutes caught air and unfurled, he was descending at over 10m/s. The speed barely slowed as he neared the ground, and suddenly Jeb realized he stood a good chance of crushing the pylon engines when he touched down. He nursed the throttle back up, but the stubborn jets were too sluggish and he\u0027d waited too long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb winced as the craft struck ground with a loud \u003Cem\u003Ecrunch\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the runway, Burhat was reviewing the latest quad-VTOL iteration. The KAV-13 Stratus was a two-seater this time, using structural wings in place of the narrow swept pylon mounts Slider had employed. Stratus lacked Slider\u0027s sleek design, but Jenners had taken his airflow jest to heart and made sure each engine had a dedicated intake mounted to it - in the correct orientation. Hopefully this one wouldn\u0027t fight him so much, since he\u0027d have a passenger along this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob had been directed to join the survey flight, to contribute his Scientist\u0027s expertise to whatever observations Burhat took. The search for this elusive \u0022Sea-Kraken\u0022 was still ongoing, and Bill\u0027s Drift was another ocean scan. Somebody at Tetragon had a lot of money to waste. Or had lost a bet. Either way, it seemed like a waste of jet fuel. \u0022I just think sending \u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E of us out to look for some fictional sea-beast is a serious waste of time,\u0022 he protested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe, maybe not, but we\u0027re going anyway. \u003Cem\u003EBoth\u003C/em\u003E of us,\u0022 Burhat stated firmly. \u0022Hop in, I want to be here when they take the X2 out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite Jenners\u0027 improvements, Stratus was actually the worst VTOL so far. She didn\u0027t just pitch, she bucked and rolled and twisted in every direction but forward. Burhat made an almost-game of it, wrestling her back on course with disturbing glee. It was frustrating how much she wanted to fight, but he was determined to see the mission through regardless. Bob, lacking pilot\u0027s controls, sat white-knuckled in the pod behind, watching in mute terror as the sky continually shifted above his canopy. It took several agonizing minutes for them to reach Bill\u0027s Drift and ascend to the required height - 18,200 meters. The \u0022airflow\u0022 lesson had definitely stuck though. As ornery as Stratus was, she never came close to flameout, even at this height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy now, even Burhat was growing sick of her antics. \u0022Well Bob, you see a Kraken down there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I feel like one\u0027s latched onto our tail, Kerbalski.

Use the comm back there and report in, maybe we can still make it back for the X2 launch. Then,\u0022 he added, \u0022I\u0027m going to have a very long talk with Jenners about aircraft.\u0022 Burhat hauled hard on the stick and forced Stratus into a swift U-turn that had them briefly facing their own contrails. \u003Cem\u003EShe may be a feisty wretch,\u003C/em\u003E he thought with amusement, \u003Cem\u003Ebut she\u0027s a damned nimble one.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s... it?\u0022 Jeb was incredulous. \u0022It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Etiny\u003C/em\u003E. Where are all the boosters?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right there on the side,\u0022 Shelbree assured him. \u0022Most of the necessary lifting is done in-atmo, and the X2 is very light. Those jets are all you\u0027ll need.\u0022 The KSV-X2 was Shelbree Kerston\u0027s brainchild, and she had taken a personal interest in its launch. Now that funding was a concern, R\u0026amp;D\u0027s primary focus was on \u0022cheap and reusable.\u0022 Heavy rocket boosters were yesterday\u0027s news - assuming the X2 performed as intended. \u0022Now Jeb, listen carefully. Dumping the first stage will be very different from what you\u0027re used to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All in the flight plan, sweetness,\u0022 Jeb laughed. \u0022Don\u0027t worry, I read it twice. I\u0027m just having trouble believing it\u0027ll do what you say. But,\u0022 he added, \u0022I guess we\u0027ll find out soon enough.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShelbree scowled after him as he climbed up into the command pod. Her reputation - maybe her career - was riding on this flight, and Jeb was just laughing it off. Of course he was. What did he have to worry about? KSC loved him, the press loved him, he was \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E poster-boy for spaceflight in this hemisphere. Possibly across all Kerbin. \u003Cem\u003EHis\u003C/em\u003E job was safe. Suddenly her teeth hurt, and she realized she\u0027d been grinding them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike the KVx 6 before it, the X2 lifted slowly, though the Basic Jet Engines were nowhere near as sluggish as Tetragon\u0027s D-30F7\u0027s. Following Shelbree\u0027s instructions, he waited until 15,000 meters, then brought the nose to a 45-degree angle facing east. It was a strange hybrid of SSTO flightpath and standard rocket ascent, with one \u003Cem\u003Emajor\u003C/em\u003E twist. As predicted, the engines began to cough and sputter around 30 kilometers up. The starboard engine died first, sending the X2 into a slow yaw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSwiftly, Jeb killed the thrust and threw the craft into a roll, decoupling the jet boosters as he did. The two tiny pods were flung away, spiraling back to Kerbin behind him, while the KWR Wildcat engine roared to life. With a little help from the rocket\u0027s vectoring, he had the X2 pointed back space-ward in no time, burning hard for the stars. He still had nearly half his fuel remaining when his apoapsis peaked at just under 83 kilometers. The rest of it burned away as he circularized - and then some. The X2 was on an elliptical orbit now, with an AP of 169,500 on the other side of Kerbin. KSC\u0027s Tracking and Mission Control centers were still rudimentary and lacked the equipment to send him sophisticated telemetry readings. Orbital maneuvers were careful, educated guesses for now. He was beginning to see why Gene had been holding back on full orbital missions...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was still one more task to perform, however. Mounted to the X2 was a TT-70 Radial Decoupler, like the one Bill had fired off earlier that morning. O.M.B. wanted to see how it performed under orbital conditions, and Jeb was more than happy to oblige. He rolled the X2 until its test item was pointed back at Kerbin, and fired. The pod gave a small jolt as the decoupler blew, rocketing off towards the planet below. \u0022Bill was right,\u0022 he mused. \u0022That \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E fun.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout the ability to set maneuvering nodes, it was up to Mission Control to figure out how to return Jeb to KSC grounds. True, he could deorbit at any time, there was plenty of fuel for that. But KSC currently lacked the infrastructure to retrieve him from half a planet away. If he landed in a far-away ocean, or on another continent, it would be a long time before they could retrieve him, and hauling the X2\u0027s capsule back all that way was out of the question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt four minutes past AP, he gave a short burn, bringing his periapsis to around 20,000 meters and ensuring atmospheric capture. Now, he just had to hope Control had done its math right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForty-one minutes had passed since the KSV-X2 lifted off. Bill, Bob, and Burhat stood together on the sidewalk outside the VAB, watching the sky for Jeb\u0027s return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you think he made it?\u0022 Bill asked, munching thoughtfully on some Krispy Mix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course. Gene\u0027s still holed up in the Tracking Station with the monitor crews,\u0022 Burhat replied. \u0022You know he won\u0027t leave until Jeb\u0027s back down, safe and sound.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb is neither safe \u003Cem\u003Enor\u003C/em\u003E sound,\u0022 Bob chuckled. \u0022But I take your point. We should be- there!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA dull orange smudge was rapidly growing brighter behind the clouds. As they watched, it passed over a gap in the cloud cover, a steel meteor trailing a writhing snake of furled canvas. Blue-white fires flickered from the LV-909 at its base. The ground rumbled as the X2\u0027s sonic boom rolled over them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah Kerman had returned home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater that afternoon, Jenners brought out the KAV-14, which he\u0027d named \u0022Selene.\u0022 Like the Stratus, it was a two-seater, though he\u0027d taken Burhat\u0027s admonishments and gone back to structural pylons for the engine mounts. This time, it was Bill\u0027s turn to accompany the pilot - more parts testing \u0022splashed down at Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Rockomax 24-77 I get,\u0022 Bill said, climbing into the passenger\u0027s seat. \u0022It\u0027s a radial-mount engine. I can see that doing a water landing. But the C7 Turbojet? If that goes in the drink you\u0027ve got bigger problems than whether your engine still lights up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Truth,\u0022 Burhat agreed. \u0022But you know KSC needs the funding. You heard what Jeb was saying in debrief?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nah, Shelbree wanted to talk to me. She\u0027s thinking of signing on with the flight program again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hm. Getting the gang back together, wouldn\u0027t that be something. But anyway, from the sounds of it even Jeb isn\u0027t keen on doing more than low orbital passes until KSC improves the tracking and telemetry equipment.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill shook his head, speaking into Selene\u0027s comm as the engines spooled up. \u0022Now I\u0027ve heard everything. Jebediah Kerman \u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t want to go into space?\u003C/em\u003E You\u0027re kidding me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No joke. Gene\u0027s supposed to meet with some contractors later today. Seems somewhere in all this hectic chaos, we\u0027ve actually built up enough funds to consider upgrading our facilities.\u0022 Selene gently lifted off the runway and Burhat tilted her forward, towards Booster Bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027d be nice. Do you think he\u0027ll expand the Kerbonaut Complex as well? We could do with a few extra dormitories. Y\u0027know, in case more of the old crew starts coming back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Afraid you\u0027d have to share a bunk with someone, Bill?\u0022 Burhat eased Selene out over the water, debating whether or not he should throw in a jibe about Shelbree. Bill decided for him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Only if it\u0027s you, Kerbalski. I remember what that Hitchhiker smelled like after a week of \u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E laundry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just be glad you couldn\u0027t smell yours, Kerman. Bet Shelbree would have some choice words about it though.\u0022 He popped the chutes and let the KAV-14 drift down onto the waves. The engines hissed with steam as their hot nacelles touched the water. \u0022Alright, we\u0027re in. Fire \u0027em up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Roger. 24-77 lights up fine.

Political, historical, scientific. Lot\u0027s of space stuff. Pick up one of those books and start reading it and, well maybe it\u0027s good, and maybe it\u0027s not. But almost invariably, about halfway through the book (and sometimes, halfway through a \u003Cem\u003Eparagraph), \u003C/em\u003Ethere will suddenly be half a dozen glossy pages with photographs on them. Photographs that have been abused to get them to fit on the pages. Personally, by the time I get to those photos I usually don\u0027t care any more. I would need to go back a hundred or so pages to find the part of the book that mentioned the people milling about in that grainy image, and I\u0027m much more interested in finishing the paragraph I was in the middle of when the photos started. So I skip them. Sometimes I go back, sometimes I don\u0027t, but rarely do they contribute anything-- they\u0027re just there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImgur galleries are basically the same thing, and are often done for the same reason. It\u0027s a system limitation, in one case from the printing process, in another due to bandwidth limitations. And, I think, the consequences are the same-- the pictures are largely stripped of context and they lose any sense of awe they might have had during the compression process. I tried the \u0022open gallery in Imgur\u0022 option you mentioned, but the results were the same. The pictures are \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E squashed.

I saw one thread in here that was pretty decent, that had most of the pictures embedded as direct URL links in the text. I thought that worked pretty well-- they didn\u0027t load until the reader was ready for them, the text provided context and a single click netted you the full image. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to do it that way, maybe you could try putting the screenshots into a spoiler box?

At 17,000 meters the boosters coughed and died, and Jeb swiftly jettisoned them. Blue fires erupted from the Wildcat V on the X3\u0027s transfer stage, leaving the spent boosters spinning in graceful pirouettes as it soared ever higher. From the newly upgraded Tracking Station below, Gene monitered Jeb\u0027s progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Orbital insertion looking good Jeb.

Circularization in progress.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough the night, Jeb had done his own calculations. While the contractors worked on installing the new computers and sensor equipment, he studied Shelbree\u0027s plans for the X3, and the slim L2 Atlas motor that would power the command module. He was accustomed to flying \u0022by the seat of his pants,\u0022 but in the vacuum of space, fuel was too precious to waste. Thus, while Bill, Bob, and Burhat snoozed in bunks down the hall, he stayed awake plotting out orbital paths, timing, and trajectories until he was confident in the results. Gene might hate him for this at first, but they\u0027d \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E be thanking him later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Wildcat finished burning, peaking at a healthy 143 klicks on the opposite side of Kerbin.

Jeb waited until he was well clear of it before he made his move. \u0022X3 to Control, Transfer stage is clear and all yours.

Our task is making sure he gets there - and back - alive. Bobak, keep monitoring the X3 drone, make sure it gets back here in one piece.\u0022 The mohawked kerbal nodded, fixing his attention on the readout screens and the controllers bringing the craft in. \u0022Dansen, head to R\u0026amp;D and get Shelbree in here ASAP.

They\u0027d tracked Jeb\u0027s course, finding him on an intercept with the Mun. Five hours from now, he\u0027d be the first kerbonaut in over a year to feel the pull of Kerbin\u0027s little grey neighbor. Meanwhile, the X3 drone would splash down in Booster Bay in less than thirty minutes. All thoughts of contracts and funding had gone out the window - until Jeb was on the ground, Mission Control\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E priority was to ensure he made it back alive. For now however, all they could do was wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs evening closed in, Dansen reported Jeb\u0027s comm had finally come back online. Apparently he was ready to talk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022X3 to Control. You guys awake down there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We read you, Jeb,\u0022 Gene answered, struggling to keep his tone level. \u0022Mind filling us in on this little adventure of yours?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Materials lab and Goo containment readings in Mun SOI, plus personal observations. I thought our friends over in R\u0026amp;D could make use of the extra Science.\u0022 A brief pause. \u0022Tank\u0027s a bit emptier than I expected though.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbree grabbed a spare headset and plugged it in. \u0022It wasn\u0027t designed for Munar orbit!\u0022 she bit back fiercely. \u0022If you-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene quickly stabbed the mute button, making a gesture across her throat. \u0022We\u0027ll deal with that when he\u0027s one the ground, Kerston,\u0022 he hissed. \u0022Focus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Was that Shelbree?\u0022 Jeb asked. \u0022She sounds mad.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027ve given her a good reason for it, Kerman. Now let\u0027s talk about return vector. How much fuel is left in the X3?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roughly 15%. Computer says that\u0027s around 200 dV, little less.\u0022 Gene winced. According to the course Jeb had laid out for himself, it would take at least that to break him away from the Mun, leaving nothing for course correction. They\u0027d only have one chance at this, and it\u0027d have to be \u003Cem\u003Eperfect\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright Jeb, listen carefully.

The tank was dry now - he just had to pray to Ker that Gene\u0027s instructions were accurate, and that he\u0027d followed them correctly. There were no second chances here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for now, he\u0027d done all that he could. Well, almost all. He \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E still in Mun\u0027s grip, and he\u0027d come with the intent to do Science. The shell on the Goo canister slid back, and he watched for a bit as the blob bounced and gyrated in zero-g. A few more switches later, the experiments in the Materials lab also began processing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFive more hours - the better part of a day - before he returned to Kerbin. Jeb sighed, gazing out the Command pod\u0027s tiny window. \u003Cem\u003EThey really need to give this thing a better view.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---===---\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene sat back in his chair, looking out over the monitors and the kerbals assigned to them. They\u0027d done all they could for Jeb. With any luck at all, he\u0027d make it back to Kerbin\u0027s surface intact. \u003Cem\u003EWhere\u003C/em\u003E was another matter entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore the shutdown and the hurricane, they\u0027d had recovery teams in position to pick up both ships and their pilots from anywhere on the globe. But what hadn\u0027t deteriorated from lack of funding had been utterly destroyed in the storm - if it didn\u0027t land near KSC, they likely weren\u0027t getting it back at all. \u003Cem\u003EUnacceptable\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027d not struggled for the last day and a half to see Jebediah home safe, only to abandon him on \u003Cem\u003Etheir own planet\u003C/em\u003E. The irony of being stranded in Kerbin\u0027s mountains, or the middle of the ocean, after having come all the way back from the Mun, was simply not a result he would tolerate. There had to be a way to fetch their wayward pilot back, once he landed. He voiced the problem out loud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What about those VTOLs over in the hangar?\u0022 Shelbree asked. \u0022Bill said a couple of them were two-seaters.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Burhat\u0027s provided extensive reports on the flight capabilities for each. The only one that flew worth a damn was KAV-12, and it\u0027s single-seat. But,\u0022 he added, the glimmer of an idea flaring in his mind, \u0022it did mount an OKTO probe core for guidance assist.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The same core we used in the X3\u0027s transfer stage. That might work, if we can rig it for remote operation.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore Gene could agree, she was rushing out of Mission Control towards the hangar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---===---\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Just tell me, can you do it?\u0022 Kerston demanded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJenners rubbed his eyes, forced out of bed in the pre-dawn hours. \u0022Dunno. Slider\u0027s different, core wasn\u0027t linked to control systems, only guidance and navigation. She wasn\u0027t built like your X3.\u0022 He yawned. \u0022Might work, might not.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Then we have four hours to find out. Go wake up Burhat and I\u0027ll meet you in the SPH.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---===---\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlames licked along the sides of the X3\u0027s Command pod. His final burn put him much deeper in the atmosphere than he\u0027d intended - even with the engine and Materials Lab taking the brunt of the reentry heat, he was sweating. There was a sudden popping sound, the squeal of metal tearing, and through the tiny viewport Jeb saw one of the pod\u0027s canard stabilizers tumble into flaming shrapnel behind him. The pod slewed sideways for a moment, then straightened as the second canard ripped free. At twenty kilometers up, the X3 trailed fire and smoke as it shot over KSC and out to sea. For the first time, Jeb began to wonder if he\u0027d actually survive this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the ground, Burhat watched the meteor that was the X3 streak overhead. \u0022Jenners, I need that remote link ready,\u0022 he shouted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Almost done. You know Slider was never designed for this,\u0022 he cautioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know, but she\u0027s still our best option. She\u0027s the only one that hasn\u0027t tried to fight me in the air.\u0022 He looked over KAV-12, parked on its landing struts next to the hangar and smiled thinly. Aside from the intake issue, she was Jenners\u0027 best work to date. As long as he kept the plane below nine kilometers, she should fly true. With a tiny motorized hum, the antenna on Slider\u0027s OKTO probe core extended, blinking ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There!\u0022 Jenners announced triumphantly. \u0022Remote link established. It\u0027s a jury-rigged mess but it\u0027ll work.\u0022 The mechanic stepped aside, leaving the console and chair open for Burhat. \u0022Go get \u0027im, Kerbalski.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurhat siezed the controls and opened Slider\u0027s throttle wide. There was no time left to waste. Outside, her quartet of jet engines roared to life and Slider hurtled into the air, screaming like a banshee. Deftly, he tucked the landing struts in and lowered her nose, pointing all four engines toward the coast. In no time, she was out over the water, a gleaming white speck headed for the horizon. At top speed, he noted a subtle tendency for the craft to pitch up, but a little coaxing and the SAS ring kept her flying straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime seemed to accelerate as he followed the X3\u0027s course eastward. It was mid-afternoon outside the hangar, but Slider was quickly shooting off into an early dusk, leaving the sun dipping ever-lower on the horizon. The ocean faded from glittering cerulean to an inky black as he crossed over the large peninsula that framed the far shore of Booster Bay. Then the tracking signal went silent. Jeb had landed, somewhere...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurhat leveled the VTOL out, using the nose camera to scan the black waters for signs of life. A scant three-hundred meters up, Slider drifted on plumes of jet exhaust, searching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---===---\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hatch hissed as Jeb forced it open, letting the salty ocean air replace the stale recycled stuff in his pod. The X3 capsule floated on the waves, buoyed up by its spent fuel tank and the lightweight materials of the command pod. Seabirds squawked in the distance, but he saw none nearby. He\u0027d probably scared them off with his reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb climbed out, standing on top of the capsule, and took stock of his situation. It\u0027d been two full days since the X3\u0027s launch, and he\u0027d barely eaten or slept since. He\u0027d forgotten what prolonged space travel was like, and the Mun was only six hours - one day - away. Less, if he\u0027d planned his course better. Feeling he should do something useful, the kerbonaut leaned back into the capsule and dug out sample cases. Maybe the X3 pod was a loss, but he\u0027d still obtained some Science. Quite a bit of it, in fact - maybe Shelbree would forgive him when she saw it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hah. Fat chance of that, Kerman,\u0022 he muttered, collecting experiments from the Materials Lab. The Goo container was trickier to get at, but he managed to coax the viscous \u003Cem\u003Ething\u003C/em\u003E into a plastic tube. As he straightened up, he became aware of a faint keening sound, steadily growing louder. Just above the setting sun, something white was approaching. As it drew closer, he saw the foggy trail of jet engines - Burhat had found him at last.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlider\u0027s jet nacelles hissed and pinged as they touched the cool seawater, setting down a few meters from the X3 pod. The craft\u0027s nose rotated, facing him as the cockpit canopy lifted upwards invitingly. \u0022About time you got back,\u0022 Burhat\u0027s voice crackled over the comm, sounding tinny and mechanical. \u0022Ready to head home?\u0022 The wake from the VTOL\u0027s landing made the X3 bob, and Jeb struggled to keep his footing. He tucked the samples into a waterproof bag, sealing it and securing it to one of the straps on his flight suit, then hopped off the pod and into the water. It was colder than he expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Home is where the heart-t-t is,\u0022 he said, soggy and shivering as he crawled into the plane\u0027s cockpit. \u0022I just-t-t-t came back from mine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/lvfLdlf430o?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of those cases where there\u0027s a bit of discrepancy between \u0022how the story went\u0022 and \u0022how the mission went.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the cinematic, the stabilization canards were mounted on scaled-down decouplers, to \u0022break\u0022 them at the appropriate time. The landing legs, likewise, were just for show. Now with Tier 1 VAB limitations, I was capped at 30 parts, so the cinematic X3 had a much tighter budget. The \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E X3 also mounted Goo and a Communotron-16 antenna, in addition to the Materials Lab, meaning more Science. Mission-wise, Jeb\u0027s capsule had plenty of fuel for high-orbit Mun SOI and a safe return. With the upgrades to Mission Control and the Tracking Station, I had no issue landing him safely back in the waters just outside KSC, for recovery of pilot, capsule, and all the delicious Science he\u0027d picked up brushing Mun\u0027s gravity.

A research \u0026amp; development firm had contracted with KSC to provide altimetry scans of Kerbin, a project initially delayed due to the need for better orbital tracking. At first, they\u0027d tried SSTO delivery, hoping that fuel-efficient jet engines could augment the delivery system and get the scanning satellite into orbit. Unfortunately, every design resulted in a machine more complex than the VAB or SPH could handle. In the end, they went back to basics. The Maxwell 1 was a simple, elegant, and most importantly \u003Cem\u003Echeap\u003C/em\u003E three-stage missile with more than enough kick to put the satellite into orbit with delta-V to spare. The first stage was a towering S1 SRB from Kerbodyne, which carried the rocket well into the upper atmosphere. From there, a trusty liquid-fuel Wildcat finished orbital insertion and circularization, and released the actual Maxwell satellite for maneuvering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time it was rolled out to the pad for launch, Gene had finalized contracts with Probodobodyne and Kerlington MR\u0026amp;PP for their own satellites. Maxwell 2 and 3 were almost identical, save for smaller satellites and downsized fairings to match.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ty2UvY3.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ty2UvY3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMid-afternoon saw the first Maxwell lift off, veering northeast to align itself for the orbital path the altimetry contract requested. While Bobak lead the ground crews in tracking and maneuvering the little satellite, Maxwell 2 was quickly sent out to follow its slightly bigger brother. Mission Control delayed the launch, however, waiting until Maxwell 1 was in its proper place and scanning. The rockets flew beautifully, but they wanted positive confirmation that the satellites would achieve the orbits they\u0027d been slated for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MG2siOG.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MG2siOG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fairings are away and on reentry trajectories.

Clear skies greeted the third and smallest of the Maxwells as it burned southeast for a polar orbit nearly eight-thousand kilometers out.

I don\u0027t know if this is because I updated OPT with the new parts from 1.6, or because ScanSat just eats memory for breakfast with its mapping, but I uninstalled a few mods to try and ease the burden. One of them being the Environmental Visual Enhancements, which I\u0027ve personally found to look good only at extreme distance from Kerbin anyway. Maybe it\u0027s just my settings, or maybe ATM compressed more than it should\u0027ve, I\u0027m not sure. Either way, that and a couple others have been dropped, so Kerbin\u0027s thick fluffy clouds are now gone. I may reinstall it briefly for story purposes here and there, but for regular gameplay I\u0027m no longer using it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA final note about the Maxwell 3 shot - yes, it\u0027s actually pointed \u003Cem\u003Enorth\u003C/em\u003Eeast. I initially got confused about the polar orbit / direction on that one and reverted the launch, but the screenshot stayed. Derp.

Minwell 1 was, as its name implied, destined for an orbit around the tiny mint-colored iceball of Minmus. Maxwell 4 was slated for an equatorial orbit so far distant from Kerbin it was likely to crash into the Mun. And Munwell 1 was the heaviest of them all, designed not to \u003Cem\u003Eorbit\u003C/em\u003E Mun, but to land on it, bearing a compliment of Science instruments and experiments. With so many pans in the fire, it quickly became evident to Gene he\u0027d have no time left to maintain KSC\u0027s day-to-day operations. From this point on, Mission Control and the Tracking Station would require attention all six hours a day, with multiple flights in play at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there still remained the issue of upgrading their facilities, requiring downtime while the contractors did their work. R\u0026amp;D needed improvement the most, but the costs involved were far more than he could afford right now. Likewise, the VAB was high on the priority list, since Munwell\u0027s design was \u0022too complicated\u0022 for what they could handle in the current building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe painfully slow dance of orbital trajectories didn\u0027t help either - leaving them waiting hours or even days for funding while the satellites drifted into position. Only then, when they could confirm orbital stability, was payment sent in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot every satellite remained in that orbit, however. Part of Maxwell 2\u0027s contract had stipulated an on-board materials lab, and Gene used this as a perfect opportunity for high-orbit experiments. However, the Scientific value of those experiments dropped substantially when transmitted, so Maxwell 2 had also been sent up with a radial parachute mounted to the top of its probe core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NtstVyP.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NtstVyP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ex-satellite screamed over KSC just before noon the following day. An error in the OKTO\u0027s trajectory calculations resulted in a splashdown much further up the coast than they\u0027d initially planned, straining the limits of the recovery team\u0027s range, but they were able to haul the waterlogged probe out of the bay and back to KSC intact. Maxwell 2 was still being dried out and dismantled when the KSC Air-Traffic Control Tower began reading an incoming signal on the short-range systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022KSC Tower, this is Kerbin United Flight 1202 on approach.

By the time the P-77 Sunrise had landed and taxied over to the hangar, a small ladder truck was already waiting to load them up. Jeb had been all but sentenced to it as penance for his errant pass at the Mun, while Bill and Bob joined him feeling it was their duty as part of the Kerman Trio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229TCKN7b.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9TCKN7b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what does Gene expect us to do out there?\u0022 Bill asked, glancing up to the hatch. Their mission controller had already disappeared inside the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mostly just hobnob with the guests. Convince wealthy kerbs that what we\u0027re doing is worth signing a check for.\u0022 Jeb shrugged. \u0022Wow them with tales of adventure and glory.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob smirked. \u0022So should we leave out the part where you go rogue and nearly strand yourself in Munar orbit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is \u003Cem\u003Eanyone\u003C/em\u003E at KSC going to let me live that down?\u0022 Jebediah grumped. \u0022If you have to bring it up, tell them how all kerb-kind came one step closer to returning to the Mun, and KSC\u0027s heroic efforts in getting me back alive.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill nudged Bob in the ribs with his elbow. \u0022Jeb\u0027s right. We can tease him in private, but if we want more funding we have to really live it up as daring space explorers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027d have an easier time with \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 Bob snorted, \u0022if we\u0027d actually explored space. Mun and Minmus barely count.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene peered around the plane\u0027s hatch. \u0022We\u0027re burning daylight, gentlekerbs. Get up here and strap in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a resigned sigh, Jeb grabbed the ladder and lead the way up, Bill and Bob following close behind. The P-77\u0027s hatch sealed behind them with a pressurized hiss, and the plane was backing away from the hangar even as they buckled their seat belts. Despite the unpaved runway, the small passenger jet had no trouble getting up the speed required to lift off. The cabin tilted as the pilot banked, turning them northwest towards the Capitol further inland.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WLXMjKC.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WLXMjKC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWork began on the VAB as soon as the P-77 was out of sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MqnnSdG.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MqnnSdG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe advance from the new satellite contracts had provided enough funding to improve both the VAB and the dormitories. With construction on the Munwell 1 still in limbo, the VAB upgrades became first priority. By late afternoon, the new Assembly Building was finished and the work crews could put the final touches on their waiting Science probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f95HAdz.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f95HAdz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027d left fairings off this one to reduce weight, trusting the sturdier probe would hold up through its ascension. Likewise, the lower stabilizers had been removed from the Kerbodyne S1 SRB, and the liquid-fuel tank for the Wildcat had been extended to increase capacity. By all calculations, the Munwell \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E pack enough fuel to fulfill its mission of orbiting, landing, and returning from the Mun, loaded with Science. It would be several days before it returned to Kerbin however. That was the trouble with looking beyond low Kerbin orbit - the missions stretched on for days at a time, during which any number of flaws could expose themselves, or things could go wrong. The Minwell 1 satellite had lifted off late last evening, and would take another seven days before reaching its destination around Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221mmVZxI.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1mmVZxI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy that comparison, Munwell\u0027s six-hour drift out to the Mun was blissfully short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo Jeb, even \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E hour felt like eternity. He tugged at the stiff necktie, somehow finding it far more uncomfortable than the wide saucer-like collar of his flight suit. At least that didn\u0027t try to strangle him at each opportunity. \u003Cem\u003EMaybe this is why Mortimer\u0027s so sour all the time. His clothes are always trying to choke him.\u003C/em\u003E He sipped at something fizzy and bitter, wondering where all the good snacks and Joose had been hidden. Bill had gone to look earlier, but found himself roped into a discussion on industrial expansion on low-gravity worlds instead. Despite barely scratching Munar orbit, these tycoons were falling over themselves at the possibility of exploiting fuel sources on Mun and Minmus, and potentially even further out. He didn\u0027t even know where Bob had gotten to. He was about to go searching when a familiar voice greeted him from behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb...? Jeb Kerman, in a suit jacket? Oh Ker, never thought I\u0027d see \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E happen!\u0022 The kerbonaut turned, nearly spitting out his fizzy drink at the kerbal behind him, and choked as he tried to swallow it. Staring back at him with a crazy grin was one of the few pilots KSC considered as much a lunatic as himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalger took a step forward and clapped him on the back, though whether it was a greeting or to ease his cough, Jeb couldn\u0027t tell. \u0022Well,\u0022 he sputtered, \u0022feeling\u0027s mutual Cal. What\u0027d \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E do to get sentenced here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hah, nothing, my old Da just didn\u0027t feel like showing up so he sent me instead.

Hey, aren\u0027t you supposed to be begging me for money or something?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was Jeb\u0027s turn to laugh. \u0022That was Mortimer\u0027s idea. I\u0027m just here to tell everyone how grand space is, but you\u0027d know as well as anyone. Plus, Gene was mad at me. I took our last test vehicle on an early detour back to Munar orbit, and ran out of fuel on the way back. Burhat had to remote-pilot a VTOL out past Booster Bay to pick me up.\u0022 Jeb shook his head, still chuckling. \u0022Ker damn, it\u0027s good to see you again Cal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You too Jeb.

They\u0027re barely qualified as prefab huts right now, but we make do. If they start expanding the place, you\u0027ll be the first to know though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalger took Jeb\u0027s hand and shook. \u0022Consider it a deal.

Just a ton of probes drifting around Kerbin or its moons, waiting for the next maneuver node to demand attention. On the bright side, the contracts are finally starting to pay worth a damn and that means R\u0026amp;D can get the upgrade it needs to move tech forward - SSTO spaceplanes, orbital stations that serve a purpose (rather than one scrapped together for the sole purpose of fulfilling a contract), and interplanetary capabilities. Plus, Jeb\u0027s back at the Mun and this time it\u0027s even on-mission! So frequent readers rejoice - the early-game grind is at last coming to an end and \u003Cem\u003Einteresting \u003C/em\u003Ethings can begin to happen.
