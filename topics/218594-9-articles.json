Spent a few hours playing around and testing things . It\u0027s rough, and broken, and there\u0027s valid criticism and feedback to be given, but I\u0027m hoping people remain fair and reasonable in doing so. Don\u0027t attack the team, talk to them, they\u0027ll listen. KSP 1 was a 10\u002B year long journey to get where it is. I imagine that KSP 2 has a long road ahead of it as well, with bumps and bad weather, but I also believe it will be worth it when we get to the finish line.\u00A0 Right now, the baseline game play of building and flying rockets to places, works. That\u0027s what KSP 1 was before career / science mode showed up.

I have 21 FPS with\u00A0 a 1060 with only the CAPSULE and looking into space. No game released in the last 10 years had a scene more barebone than that and all run far better than this game.\u00A0 Even DCS renders far more content with more details and using far less hardware (and it is a game that is seen as inneficient at rendering\u00A0 already) Planet performance is even worse,\u00A0 but I take this is obvious even for the devs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSound: 9 out of 10-\u00A0 Very good sound designs but I got some things to point. The decoupling create vibrations so there should be SOME sound. Also I do sometimes get parachute or wave like sounds when in space... minor bug, but just pointing there is some ironing to do here as well\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamera:\u00A0 3 out of 10- Runs smooth but\u00A0 it gets locked in absurd angles (seems a sort of gimbal lock) it is not easy to reset and start wandering by itself.

The bad.. It is unfeasible to load a save where you are landed in the mun or minumus for example, each time I reload the game the ship appear in a different place in a radius of some 100 meters.. including up and down under the ground\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGUI-\u00A0 4 out of 10. I\u00A0 really think the new gui got too cramped and with too small fonts, specially in the navball directions. I am almost 50, I cannot read that size of font after the full day of work. I also\u00A0 would like an EXACT measurement of climb rate.\u00A0\u00A0 I also think the removal of right click on each part was a great loss for usability. I see the part it is there, in my face, there is no reason to make me search for it in a list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMap view: 6 out of 10, I am considering you will soon fix the lack of trajectory showing\u00A0 when you get an interception planned. On overall is good. But please,\u00A0 REDUCE thickness and increase length of the node planner. It is annoying to have to be so careful to select the correct one. I also think the KSP1 detailed node planner was better, far better. All those bads said, the map behaves smoothly and there is no stutter so that is good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals-\u00A0 Please give me an option to NOT render them inside the ship. I keep seeing helmets clip trough the ship and\u00A0 we are wating the already problematic resources rendering something that I DO NOT CARE while in flight.

I will quote one review that is quite comprehensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst reaction is sticker shock. There are a lot of promises made, and if those features were available right now that price would probably be worth it. At it is, in early access, $50 is asking for quite a bit when we\u0027re getting a game that could easily be done in the original game with some mods. Obviously I\u0027m hoping for greatness, but that $50 price at early access is going to make a lot of people walk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond reaction is the launcher. Private Division, for some reason has a separate launcher that they clearly want us to create yet another login for. This extraneous bit of nonsense never fails to liquid me off. Guys, we\u0027re launching from Steam, your launcher can tell we launched the game from Steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing that they\u0027re hoping to make this extra launcher a mod hub or something? Maybe something to do with multiplayer. Even if true it grinds my gears something fierce. Especially if they\u0027re looking to force us to log into this thing to access those features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird reaction is at the EULA (browse it at take2games.com/eula ). Now, I get that nobody actually reads these complete garbage cans, but I did take a peak at a few terms and WOW is this one ready to throw you to the ground and start at you without lube if you manage to break the terms. First up is all of this will be done using New York legal code, which is kind of famous for all the wrong reasons. Secondly you can expect to see arbitration, not a jury ( that we can wave a right to actual trial like this is still BS ). For those of you who don\u0027t know, arbitration is legal code for the company wins because the arbitrator is rewarded ( paid ) for favoring them because the arbitrator will get more cases if they favor the company. I don\u0027t expect any of that to actually happen, but it does go to show the prevailing mindset in the developers studio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a hefty section on in game currency and purchases, so we may very well be subjected to micro-transactions or other garbage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModders: you will not be able to make any money from your creations. No surprise, but it goes further. Basically if you create a mod, you do not own it. At all. For those unaware, back in the day there was an RTS game called Warcraft 3. It was immensely popular. One of the reasons for this popularity was the incredible freedom that modders had to create custom maps. Eventually a collection of maps called \u0022Defense of the Ancients\u0022 became a significant percentage of all WC3 online games. \u0022Defense of the Ancients\u0022 would be so popular that those guys would go on to make a separate game...and LOTS of cash. There\u0027s drama and more to the story, but the important bit is that Blizzard ( the makers of WC3 ) were upset they didn\u0027t get that money and decided that any mods to their game was theirs and nobody had legal right to any of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo. TLDR for modding: don\u0027t expect to be able to take any code or ideas you create and profit from them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso in the terms allows for them to spy on you and sell your data. So, you know. There\u0027s that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourth: the limits of early access. A lot of players will be immensely disappointed to learn that the only game mode available is sandbox, and a limited sandbox at that. Hopefully science and campaign will come soon, but I\u0027m not really a sandbox guy so I\u0027ll be waiting for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, the gameplay. The tutorials were nice. graphics are better, but hopefully something that can be improved. I\u0027m not really aware of physics engines to comment. Overall, the rocket builder worked nicely. There were a number of small UI improvements that were quite nice all through out the process. Everything was similar enough to the old KSP that adapting wasn\u0027t difficult and the improvements were overall just that: improvements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting into orbit of the Mun was no trouble, and the UI changes to show where you entered the sphere of influence were great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo hours play conclusion...I\u0027m really let down. I mean, the long wait time ( years ), ending in an early access release? The sticker shock? The launcher? The EULA? Especially the spying?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt present I don\u0027t recommend this game. Maybe they will actually deliver on those rather grandiose promises. Maybe. But honestly, I\u0027m tired of paying for a product that spies on me for people to sell my personal information all over the world. I\u0027m just, really tired of it. And people say things like \u0022You don\u0027t have to play\u0022 or similar, but damn near every digital product has that in the EULA. Damn near every one. And what does that say about the culture of the owners? Of all of these businesses? Not good. It\u0027s just not good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original KSP was so wildly fun because of the freedom. I\u0027m not entirely sure what freedom this EULA and company culture gives us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MgNQPYp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002298.56\u0022 height=\u0022479\u0022 width=\u0022486\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MgNQPYp.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYIKES!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like they learned nothing from KSP.

They will sell you a $5 dollar super engine that is better than any other engine and you will buy it. KSP is now technically EA. Where EA is not Early Access, but Electronic Arts.

This game will lose interest in about 1 week on Twitch and then it will be relegated to the bottom of the internet where it belongs for trying to insult gamers, when it really is a spyware bug simulator that has an entry fee of 50 bucks if you wanna become a tester / test subject for the greedy company behind it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T17:10:58Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 05:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by mystik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheTechnobear","CreatedById":225941,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T12:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224241951\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212392\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677328049\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022172088\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mystik\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, mystik said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPublisher, please, do not refund any of the buyers.

A modestly sized ion vessel can already spend a fair chunk of a Kerbol orbit on the acceleration phase. When I do perform these kinds of intercepts, high time warp levels seem to cause my resources to fluctuate somewhat, and approaching 100,000x acceleration the craft repeatedly runs out of electricity.
