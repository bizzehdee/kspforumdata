I learned basic orbital mechanics from it, like going up to LEO, rendezvousing with the ISS, and flying to the Moon, but I could never figure out the more complex rocket science needed to fly to other planets. I was clicking around in TransX and IMFD and didn\u0027t really know what I was doing. I remember once trying to reach Mars using the more primitive but easier to understand Transfer MFD, and managing to get close enough, that Mars was a small circle in the distance, not a red star-like object, but that was the most I could do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I started playing KSP, I had a large head-start of simpler orbital manoeuvres because of Orbiter, and thanks to the ingenious, simple and intuitive map view of KSP with the manoeuvre function, I successfully flew to Eve after about 2 weeks of playing KSP, when the whole interplanetary transfer thing clicked in my brain and for the first time, I actually knew what I was doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid anyone else get a better understanding of orbital mechanics that could be used in more complex sims, like Orbiter, because of KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T20:24:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorta, though not with Orbiter, I tried a few things I\u0027d learned from KSP in Pioneer, a remake of Frontier Elite 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust basic stuff like raising and lowering my apoapsis and periapsis, and plane changing manoeuvres, even managed a hohmann transfer to the Moon, none of this I\u0027d have tried without knowing about them from KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pipcard","CreatedById":2541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T20:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, I got a better understanding of KSP because I played Orbiter first.
