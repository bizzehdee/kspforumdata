I\u0027m going to test the plate with an extra floating top node for attaching the Orion as a few pictures I\u0027ve seen show an ability to house cargo beneath the Orion in the Block IB configuration as was done with the Apollo Saturn V stack. I\u0027m hoping that this node will not complicate using the plate to encapsulate cargo for Block II configurations so that the one part can be used for both vehicles.

I turned off everything in the ascent guidance module (including Auto-Staging and Auto Warp) and left the ascent path at the default values for the Automatic Altitude turn (turn starts at 3.5 km or velocity of 98.9 m/s and turn end at 60km) with the exception of the Turn shape, which I set at 25%. It flies to a 100km apoapsis with a little propellant remaining in the Core Stage and after it cuts the engines I stage away the core, LAS, and SM fairings and then warp to apoapsis where it performs the circularization burn leaving plenty of propellant in the ICPS for a free-return TMI burn with some propellant left over (not much but there was some).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the SM \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v, I figured out what was going on.

I set the initial numbers for the Black Paladins such that the Isp would yield the same burn time as the 5-segment SRBs, when in fact their burn time is faster so they were giving too much of a push (by Core Stage burnout, pitched well below the horizon, the apoapsis was above 100km).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t tested the liquid booster configuration as of yet, but I have tested the liquid boosters (LRB) in its proposed crew launch vehicle first stage with an Ares I upper stage (called the Anhur I upper stage in-game). With the right application of throttle it will easily place the Orion with little headache into a 100km orbit. The biggest thing surrounding the LRBs is the lack of mass data. I was able to calculate a propellant amount based on the thrust of the F-1Bs, their Isp, and using a burn time equal to the 5-segment SRBs (though I should probably scale it back to the same burn time as the Black Paladins), and then just picked a seemingly reasonable dry mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe now come to the biggest issue I\u0027ve had thus far with these new parts: the Ares I launcher. As I stated before the vehicle would not survive a pitch maneuver, as the SRM gimbaled and pitched the upper stage would not pitch at the same rate and be drug along. Once the pitch maneuver was stopped, the upper stage would continue pitching over until it began to bend almost, or completely, in half. Initially this would cause the vehicle to break up, but after I realized that the breakingForce and breakingTorque numbers were rather small and increased them it would simply bend and force the whole vehicle into a retrograde burn position nose down engine up. In short, all that did was keep the rocket from snapping in half. I have also tried turning down the \u0022angularDrag\u0022 parameter, which may have helped some, but not enough to make a difference. Thinking about it right now, when I replace the Orion spacecraft with something else of similar mass, but smaller diameter, this doesn\u0027t happen, or at least is controllable enough to made it to first stage burnout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to make sure that the Block II SLS is more balanced that it seems to be at the moment, and once I\u0027m at that point I\u0027ll release the new parts, even if the Ares I still doesn\u0027t fly right. Or, I could release the Ares I upper stage parts so people can test it out for themselves and maybe help me find what\u0027s going wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T02:07:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T17:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had similar pitch-over stability problems when I was designing my Orion-inspired parts.

The realization came when I re-exported the Ares I upper stage from Unity to return it to its unaltered original state (I had changed the diameter of the collider in an attempt to fix the issue) and was testing it with the liquid booster first stage. In this configuration there was no wobble, it pitched as though it was a single rigid vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it occurred to me, \u0022what is different about this launcher than the Ares I?\u0022 The thrust is probably about the same (I kept the F-1Bs at 66% throttle for most of the flight), and then I realized: The liquid booster powered launcher didn\u0027t have the 2.25m - 3.25m adapter. I then build the Ares I without the adapter, so that the vehicle as arranged, from top to bottom: Orion Spacecraft, Ares I upper stage with J-2X, Aries I 3.25m cylindrical decoupler, 5-segment SRB. In this configuration, with an initial pitch angle of 65\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, there was absolutely no wobble (though if I flew with a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA initial pitch angle the vehicle flipped over, but without doubling over). So I went into the config of the adapter, set \u0022PhysicsSignificance\u0022 to \u00221\u0022 (it had not been present before), lo-and-behold no wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow once I figure out what the problem is with the fxOffset on the F-1B I believe I will be ready to release the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E I\u0027d be happy to beta test.
