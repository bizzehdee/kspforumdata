Regardless of what you do, there will be spontaneous explosions at touchdown. Eve is especially prone to cause such explosions, because the gravity is significantly higher, which exacerbates the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheoretically, and logically, the answer should be that you look at the \u0027Stress Tolerance\u0027 value of the parts, and compare that to the weight of your craft (adjusted for local gravity). This number should indicate how much weight they can handle, or how many legs you need for the calculated weight. But as you can quickly notice, that value has already been raised to an absurd number in the stock game, and legs still explode anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the most practical answers are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you still want to use legs anyway: however many legs you use on Kerbin, times 1.7x, plus a safety margin of about 25-50% to allow for a few legs to explode. Legs are going to explode no matter what you do, so try to think in terms of \u0027how many legs do I need to have left after the inevitable explosions for my craft to remain stable\u0027... and go with it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse something other than legs. Ironically, just about any part not meant to be a landing leg is more reliable to land on than landing legs.

This last 1.6 patch they decided to increase the range of the suspension/damper sliders, apparently as a workaround. They haven\u0027t explained how that is supposed to help though, and it contradicts earlier statements that extreme values for those sliders would make matters worse. So hopefully there\u0027s still some actual fixes in the works for the intrinsic problems with the wheel system (legs in KSP are internally handled as a type of \u0027wheels\u0027).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA small source of hope is that it didn\u0027t use to be this way.

There\u0027s also mods that replace the wheel code with something that works. So the possibility for a fix exists.
