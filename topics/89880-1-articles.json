However I was thinking it would be cool to maybe have ship discounts when displaying company flags on your ship. For example if you display a rockomax flag then you will get discounts on any rockomax brand parts you have on that ship. However an idea is to make price discounts of more used companies lower and the price discounts of the less broadly used companies higher. This will encourage players to not just slap a rockomax/other highly used manufacturer\u0027s flag on every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea I had was that if you used a custom, non company flag, then this wouldn\u0027t alter the prices of parts but instead increase your reputation. That way it would be a nice balancing factor that could lead to two different paths of choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T01:31:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENobody can see the flags you put on your ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
