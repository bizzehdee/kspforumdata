I have had several CTD\u0027s with my modded KSP. Basically, it will crash some of the time when switching between screens (VAB to main screen three times) (Main screen to launch pad once). I can usually play normally for a little while (including going between screens), but sometimes it just crashes unexpectedly. Does anyone know what might be causing this? and more importantly how to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a couple of error logs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/avRYMBwN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELog 1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/MYb60jWS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELog 2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Minwaabi","CreatedById":91050,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T21:41:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there is any other information that could be helpful, please let me know.
