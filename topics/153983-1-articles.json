Another forum user was offered a sneak peek at it, shortly after I started playing with it in game, and he did some interesting things with the model that you guys would probably like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027ve still gotta get that revision released for Structural Tubes. And the aforementioned trophy truck. I was gonna tackle ST\u00A0today, after a few stages of Dakar, but personal matters came up. All in good time, I suppose.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the feedback, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/171444-bureaujaeger/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022171444\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/171444-bureaujaeger/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@BureauJaeger\u003C/a\u003E !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Madrias","CreatedById":89995,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-03T00:34:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I\u0027ll admit, I\u0027m not going to be making anything any time soon, but I am bumbling my way through Blender.\u00A0 Slowly.\u00A0 But maybe I\u0027ll set that as a goal, that this is the year I learn to use Blender and do something to give back for all the great mods here.\u00A0 I\u0027ve got an idea of what I want to do, so the hardest part is converting from my somewhat old-school way of doing things to learning Blender.\u00A0 Because, let\u0027s face it, my ability to fold paper into models is a great strategy for seeing what something needs to look like, but it\u0027s hardly useful for KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually have to thank you for the link to that tutorial, because seeing how easy it is to work with Blender has actually inspired me to try, even if what I come up with looks bad to start with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
