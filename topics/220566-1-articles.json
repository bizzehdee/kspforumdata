I read this post below and discovered that it sends out bursts of Transmissons rather than constant signal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso suggestion as the deployed antenna range is limited. put a relay satellite in geostationary orbit (permanently above) then the transmit rate far higher.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother suggestion - leave a rover next to it and use that as a relay too.
