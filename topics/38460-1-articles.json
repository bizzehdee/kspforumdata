You deliver the ship to orbit in manageable chunks, but without significant risk of stranding the crew in orbit without means of re-entering. You also don\u0027t waste fuel on things you don\u0027t have to carry with you. A spacious living module is necessary for both legs of the trip, but there is no need to haul the lander back from Mars.

But it doesn\u0027t mean that we should be trying to do everything at once in one go. That makes a disaster that much more likely. First mission should be designed for a bare minimum. And it\u0027s not like the months of stay that the minimum duration mission requires are not enough to get a lot of work done. Once we have men working up there, we are certain to learn how to make the consequent missions safer and more reliable, allowing for future missions to be designed with a longer stay. We can bring in more equipment and supplies that are really needed and less stuff that turns out to be relatively useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, we should be planning for multiple missions from the start. There is a very real chance of the crew getting stranded on the planet, in particular, due to weather.

Something like this (the Venus flyby shaves a few days off but isn\u0027t needed):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/mars/image/shortstay.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022shortstay.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has the advantage of a shorter (~600 days) total trip duration, but the disadvantage of a very short stay on Mars, more time in interplanetary space, and more delta-v needed. Opposition-class missions use pretty much the same trajectory as a Mars free-return (like Dennis Tito\u0027s mission) except with a short stay at Mars instead of a flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other kind is the Conjunction-class, where you take a fast transit to Mars, a long stay at Mars of about 600 days, and then a fast return to Earth. Something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/mars/image/fastrans.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022fastrans.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has the advantage of little time in interplanetary space, less delta-v needed, and more exploration time, but the disadvantage of a longer total duration (~900 days).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConjunction-class human missions usually have faster than Hohmann transfer orbits in order to cut down the time needed to stay in interplanetary space. But you can always use a Hohmann orbit to save a little delta-v at the cost of increased travel time. Something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/mars/image/longstay.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022longstay.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat one has a shorter stay at Mars but longer transit times. The total mission duration is about the same though. Since staying on Mars\u0027s surface is preferable to staying in deep-space (lower radiation dose, no zero-g problems), Hohmann transfer conjunction-class missions are not used for crew transfers. But if you can split the mission into cargo and crew, you can send the cargo on a Hohmann transfer minimum delta-v trajectory, and then send the crew later on a fast transit trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T22:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I see what you meant.

Radiation is quite another. Mir and the ISS both orbit inside Earth\u0027s magnetosphere, whereas your prospective Mars mission would be in interplanetary space, fully exposed to solar radiation (Curiosity\u0027s radiation instrument was running the whole way to Mars, and measured that the total radiation exposure on the way there was something like 2/3 NASA\u0027s maximum lifetime dose for astronauts, ONE WAY - meaning that one mission would put you over the limit by as much as 30%). Thus, it stands to reason that shorter transfer times are desirable, especially given that a longer stay on Mars would have large scientific benefits (for instance, serving as an ongoing experiment in long-term variable-gravity biology - we only have experience in 1G or 0G, and nothing in between; a 600-day Mars mission would basically be the test case for low-G human health studies).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
