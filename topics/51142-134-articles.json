It is especially an issue, when you put the MinLight to 0 (over cloud brightness), which makes the clouds on the dark side totally black (as they are in real life, except on long exposure images where lights indeed come through a bit, but not to this extent), which would be even more realistic (try it, on low orbit, around sunset or sunrise, only the dark silhouette of the clouds can be seen over the reflecting surface of the planet, really cool), because currently the lights shine through, even though I would want them to block the light.

It is very easy to go around this, just change the default scale for the Detail and Bump to 15 (then globally we are still using 15k x 15k coverage), which makes the texture still detailed enough from above the atmosphere, but keeps it large enough so that the repeating pattern is not really visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ster.kuleuven.be/~peterp/KSP/Clouds_screenshot9.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ster.kuleuven.be/~peterp/KSP/Clouds_screenshot9.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Change all the default rotation values to negative on Kerbin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Go to map mode and time warp, you will see it is much better like that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Check other planets to have the same effect everywhere.
