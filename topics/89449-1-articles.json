We strolled over to a large shape covered by a tarp, surrounded by ground crew, all grinning.

The two tail fins pointing at an angle, its majestic gear bays deploying polished wheels, the UKN flag on its side.

Three comfortable reclining leather chairs sat in the room, one behind two others, the front two positioned at the front console, with all the instruments, but the third chair was behind and in the centre of the other two, with a panel to the side of each armrest, with a folding central console, fitted with pop-up joysticks, a screen, and numerous other functions. I walked back to the door in the rear of the cabin, and opened it, which revealed an airlock, which in turn lead into a cargo bay, which came back to a passenger section, capable of seating eight. I came out of it, in a high of glee, asked the crew manager, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAnd we get to fly this, like, right now?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He smiled and nodded. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRight,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Checking his watch, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNow, actually.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I jumped up and down in excitement, and took my seat in the central chair. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBOB!

I started the engine as soon as all the ground crew was cleared, and upped the throttle, and the high pitched whirl of the jet engines whined into the day. I pulled back on the stick as Bob started the science panel, gathering data on all aspects of the flight, and Bill was viewing his engineering panel, looking at readouts of all the structural integrity, the thrust output, overheating, and other egghead stuff. The plane moved smoothly along the paved strip of land, angling up, and leaving the ground, free from gravity, free from rocks, free from\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.everything. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EFalcon\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E climbed into the sky, not caring about anything. I turned, and the plane did too, banking hard, I turned towards the tower, and flew right past it, probably giving a few heart attacks in the process. We flew on, for seventy miles out from shore, towards one of our little military outposts was awaiting our arrival, to help us on our quest to circumnavigate, then go into orbit of Kerbin, our world. We drew near to the air base, and saw a scene of ruination, the control tower toppled and smoking, the hangars destroyed, and the runway peppered with craters. We then decided to activate the cameras, and record this disastrous event. I peered through the camera\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s view, and saw three tanks on the ground beneath us, bearing the flag of the NAT (Norther Allied Territories) and they saw us too, because they raised their guns, and opened fire, trying to lead their shots and hit us. But due to C7\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s brilliant new engine, a RAPIER, which can switch between rocket and jet modes, we went into an almost \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153afterburner-y\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 state, boosting past them.

Four of them died, one was hit through his pilot\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s head, the next two had parts stuck in their intakes, which sputtered, and then started to smoke, spiraling out of the sky, plummeting straight downwards. The last was hit in the intake, part of its wing sheared off, and some ammunition was detonated, the plane looping, dying, and flaming in the air, flying down into the sea, and exploding on impact. We felt the ship jump, and we were hit, one shot clipping Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s shoulder, He screamed. From the rack of helmets we deposited, they came up from it on little tracks, and dropped onto our heads. I hit a button, and the plane went into autopilot, utilising the new MechJeb system. We all scurried to the airlock, donning parachutes, and crash suits. We hurried back to the chairs, and disengaged MechJeb. KSC was only five miles out, and I angled the plane downwards, coming in for a landing of sorts. Four miles, three miles, two. I shut off the engines and reengaged mechjeb, putting in in for landing autopilot. We lined up at the door, and Bill, the youngest of us jumped first, Then Bill and I exchanged glances, and In that instant, I heard the mechjeb unit beeping angrily, and knew that he wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t coming along, not at least at the same time. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNo,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I said into my mic, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to end this way,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he held me to his chest, and hugged me one last time, then, with arms bonded, and shoved me out, a grim expression on his face, closed the door, and the plane veered down, going straight down towards the ground, and I saw him through the windshield, and he nodded. I spread my limbs, slowing my descent, I passed Bill, who had already pulled the chute, I, in my usual daring style, only 50 metres up pulled my chute, the force jerking me upwards, and only seconds later landing on the ground. I ran as fast as possible to the runway, awaiting Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s arrival. The two fighters continued to hound Bob, and one landed a direct hit with a cannon shot into one of the engines, sending shrapnel into another, but then the flames caught all the fuel lines, and the flames spread to all over the ship. I sat in awe and horror as the ship drew nearer, and nearer, the ball of flame almost close enough to touch. Suddenly a NAT gunship came out from nowhere, and opened fire upon the ship, completely destroying it in a ball of fire, and I knelt, deploying my radial shield, protecting myself. Once the heat dispersed, I stood and saw a silvery shape drawn into the gunship, and it disappeared in a boom. I only stood in shock as the fighters left, and Bill landed next to me, asking, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhere\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Bob?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I threw my helmet down and cried endlessly.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003Ethat day, we went out to our quarters, took Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s suit, put a statue of him in it, and buried all his most precious belongings.

We breached the atmosphere, and our escorts broke off, heading back to the planet. We landed inside of the main bay, and rushed to the bridge, all of us taking positions at our seats. I ordered the first wave of missiles to be fired from UKOWPS, the weapons station in orbit near us. Blast tube caps were shot off as twenty small Hydrogen Bombs were fired into the atmosphere, destroying NAT military bases wherever one hit.

And so we did, the flames of reentry splayed across our front viewer, a display almost comforting, reminding me of my childhood days, playing with my brothers near the fireplace. As we drew nearer to the surface, the four massive thrusters deployed from each corner of the craft, and engaged at full thrust, allowing us to avoid crash and hover. A swarm of our finest most advanced fighters took off, moving as a flock towards the main NAT base, strafing, bombing, and destroying wherever they saw fit. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ESuddenly, many of them exploded, an opposing swarm of small silvery objects impacting our own.

A blue egg formed around us and our shielding mechanism activated, rippling whenever projectiles impacted it. But then, several large hatches opened on the sides of their carrier, firing large missiles at us. They hit, each and every one of them hit, destroying our shields. The dropships opened up, one pulling right up to our viewing window, and firing explosives into it. After three, it buckled, sending glass shards flying into the room. Gusto fell as five of them embedded themselves in his face. Nielfry dove to behind a large station, protecting all but his arm from the blast. Bill removed his Kluger pistol from his belt, we both had one, courtesy of Tetragon projects. He rolled to behind his chair, training his gun on the hole, and I did the same. All our security personnel knelt, or stationed themselves with some kind of cover, ready for the storm. Three dropships pulled up, their rears going directly into the hole, and opened, NAT troops, around fifty strong flooded the area, and all of us opened up, including one soldier who fired a rocket into one of the dropships. One blew up entirely, one other was damaged, and both of them fled, five troop falling to their doom as they jumped, not expecting the planes to leave, one was even squooshed by the door as it closed, half a kerbal sticking out. The damaged one listed to the side, smoking, and the cockpit exploded, causing it to careen into its companion, destroying both entirely.

After the memorial was built to Bob, we got down to business, Bill, myself, and a newcomer, Nielfry, the most experienced of the other astronauts, joined Wernher in his office. A new chair waited for him, Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s chair having been put in his memorial. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGentlemen, I won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t elaborate on our loss, but we will be discussing NAT. You managed to snap some images of their fighters and tanks. Their designs are quite advanced, and judging by their swept wing design, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re allied with Ferram Aerospace company, or FAR as we refer to them by. The Skillful armoury seems to be a part of their repertoire. However we have BahamoutoD armoury pieces, so we need not worry about their weapons. Thier intakes aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t very advanced, as screws managed to bring them down. They managed to bring down a non-armoured cargo plane, not a very big achievement, but their news sources are going insane with hype, I say we bring that down a notch.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThe next day, we all began to plan a new plane, a fighter this time, heavily armed for strafing and dogfights, still a three-seater, however. It had the same cockpit, but the design was sleeker, and way more compact, missiles mounted under each wing, a machine gun poking out from under its nose, and cannons on the wings. After three weeks it was completed, and We three got into it, none of the previous exuberance that existed before, no adrenaline rush, just eh panels coming alive, the hangar doors opening, and the takeoff initiating. Our mission was to scout out the island again, if possible to land and investigate. A turbojet-powered squadron of fighters was ready to follow if needed, and a small flotilla awaited about 25 kilometres south of the island, prepared to go in, guns blazing, and rescue us. We were a kilometre up when we leveled off, and then descended to get a lower view of the airfield. Now it looked abandoned entirely, which was hopeful as we snapped photos of it, that is until the hangar doors to both surviving hangars, and one spilled five tanks, the other three VTOL fighters, meaning they could take off like helicopters, and fly like jets. They streaked towards us, bullets shrieking past as tanks opened up with their howitzers, each shot growing nearer, and nearer, until, BOOM! One flak round exploded near us, and a piece of shrapnel flew towards us, penetrating the exterior armour, and shredding a fuel line underneath Bill\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s panel, sparking and exploding the console. He flew out of his chair, bleeding uncontrollably from his face, many, many pieces of metal stuck inside his head, and possibly dead. I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t focus on my brother\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s apparent death, because I was busy trying to get Nielfry and myself from dying, which was growing more difficult by the second as I started to lose a terrible amount of blood from the gash in my arm caused by a piece of flying metal. My vision started to darken, and I had to force myself to stay awake. I hit the emergency call button, telling the fleet and the fighters to move in, and destroy everything.I blacked out from the blood loss, and awoke as the plane was flying straight downwards, Nielfry strapped a parachute onto Bill, held the ripcord in his hand, and shoved him out of the plane, unconscious. He helped me to my feet, and gave me one, putting one on himself at the same time, setting an autopilot to the KSC runway, so that at least some data could be retrieved, but not before he let loose all the explosives of our plane loose on the airfield, causing massive, fiery blossoms of pure heat-death. With his arm still around on my shoulder, he dragged us to the door, and jumped out, pulling both of our chutes at the same time, and relieved, I saw Bill\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s parachute, thinking \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EAt least I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be able to bury this brother\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E, and blacked out again, awakening in a hospital at KSC, the harsh light stinging my eyes, Wernher\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s and Nielfry\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s worried faces hovering above me.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Press Start 2P\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EKSP, Part Five\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI sat up abruptly, not realising the presence of Wernher, and hitting him in the face with my forehead, and he fell laughing, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGood morning to you too, Jebediah!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I sat in shock, and Nielfry punched me jokingly in the arm, and I normalised, and started to laugh uncontrollably, until I remembered, Bill, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNielfry, how\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Bill, he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 you know,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He chortled, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNo, he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just a little\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 jarred, he really wants to see you, and know that you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re all right, he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s in R\u0026amp;D right now.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I jumped out of the bed, feeling the bandage wrapping my upper right arm, stained green with Kerbal blood. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI burst into the research labs, seeing the back of my brother\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s head, and ran to him, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBILL!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He turned about, and I was taken aback from his appearance, and eyepatch over his left eye, a scar stretching from above his eyebrow to his cheekbone through his eye, smaller scratches all over his face, and his arm in a sling. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cyou look like hell, Bill, but a little more badass with that patch.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He laughed good-naturedly, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, you look a little haggard as well, here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he said, grabbing a small reflective thing from a work table.

But now, that could be no more. He was dead, and that was final. I fell to my knees, catching his body, and I cried into it, I cried for what felt like days over Wernher von Kerman\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s death, that is until a gasp erupted from the crowd, and machinegun fire sounded off, and I arose, not feeling sadness, nor pity, nor anything but a void of pure hatred and rage. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI saw a parachute descend slowly from the VAB, bullets streaming from it. A soldier handed me his K-17 automatic rifle, and I walked powerfully through the people, the crowd splitting for me. I stopped walking right about twelve metres from where I thought he was going to land, and aimed upwards, priming the gun in the process. I shot most of the magazine into the parachute, the man falling from the sky, and landing with a crunch on the ground. He tried to stand, but that could not be permitted, I shot into his kneecap, which was bending backwards at the moment. Then I fired the rest of it into his other leg. I walked to him, and kicked in a swiping motion through his face, green blood spattering my boot as part of his skull cracked. A small spattering of it spilled from his mouth. He sat up, and leaned against the wall of the building. I held the rifle as a staff, and slammed his face with the stock, slightly crumpling it. Two flight crew, ones who had been on staff for almost two decades now, who had known me as a child, held his two arms, and held him up. I thrust my fist into his gut with a force unparalleled by any Koxer, and he let out an exhausted grunt. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhy?

A soldier handed me a combat knife, and I plunged into his ribs, more of his blood leaking from the wound. I kept on hitting him, and beating him until his face was unrecognizable as a pulp, but could still see. I took a pistol from a soldier\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s belt, and officer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s edition Tetragon Projects K2199, and felt the cold of the handle pressing into my palm.

I fell not because of physical exertion, but my adrenaline rush was gone entirely, and my emotions resurfaced, no longer the uncontrollable rage, but now overwhelming levels of depression, sadness, and utter loss, now two parts of my heart carved from my chest. I collapsed in a bout of crying, and I slept. I woke up in my room, and was going to cry, when I saw Bill in black dress uniform, holding his hand out, biting his lip to avoid sobbing, his face contorted with the lines of one who is about to uncontrollably cry.

The entire staff, setting aside the security staff was here, in a line with a red carpet leading to a podium, with the insignia of the KSP on the front, not the UKN. I joined everyone in line, not acting higher than anyone as the casket passed us. Then I realised I was to give a speech after he was put in the mausoleum. I strode to the podium, and cleared my throat. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve all come here today, to hear the speech my late Uncle had prepared, but you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t hear it, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to deliver my own address.

Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s death was hard enough, but now, with Wernher gone, nothing will be the same, and I know this, the UKN\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s most brilliant mind, now reduced to a corpse. No one will be as sorely missed as this brave man. He never flew our planes or rockets, or orbited the Mun. But he designed all the things we fly, and fixed our air system on the Kerpallo thirteen, saving all three of us, Bill, Bob, and myself. But we need not reminisce, We need to act, we need to do something about NAT. I will be having a conference with UKN military advisors, and all of my senior officers, and- hey, what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s this?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 A little boy ran up to the stage, tears lining his face, and he deposited a little flower on the stage and hugged my leg, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhy, what is-what..?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He looked up, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou looked like you needed a hug.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 It sounded incredibly childish, but he was right, all I really needed was a hug right now, and I picked him up, and embraced the kid for a minute or so, put him back on the ground, and gave him a little cufflink from my jacket, shaped like my Mun thirteen mission badge, and he ran back to his parents. Then, hundreds of flowers flew to the stage, thrown by the audience, and little teddy bears, with other things flying down to my feet. I heard a whining of a jet engine and hit the deck, protecting myself with my hands, but when no one screamed, I stood in a rain of flower petals being dropped from one of our bombers. I dried my eyes and continued, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI have been elected director of the KSP, and this will be a new age. Once we defeat NAT, then all our military planes, stations, and so forth will be scrapped, and relaunched as vehicles of exploration, aid, and communication. Once this war is through, I have a vision of a new Kerbin, the United Federation of Kerbin, the UKF. No nations, just Kerbin, alone to explore our solar system, and colonise planets, like Minmus, or Laythe. Maybe we could travel to Eve, or orbit Moho, or even create gas mines on Jool. Possibly even terraform Duna into a tropical paradise. This IS what will happen when this is all over, and I promise this, nothing will get in my way, not even the strongest of armies.

I smiled, this is what I had been waiting for. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGentlemen, if you will indulge me.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The general tried to touch it, but pulled his hand back in disappointment, as he couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t. A keyboard appeared from my suitcase, and connected to the display. I hit the play button, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThis, my fellow comrades, is a virtual simulation of the ship versus four NAT battleships, if you will watch, that would be greatly appreciated.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I began the scenario, and readied the canons of the ship. I aimed them for the rightmost ship, which was seven kilometres away, and fired the frontal battery, and all eight shots landed, crushing the ship into the sea, sinking it with all hands. Next I set it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s engines to full, propelling it at high speeds towards the enemy fleet, and stopped in the middle of them. they all aimed their broadsides at me, and fired. I quickly hit the command for our shielding, the egg of interlocking hexagons appeared, rippling from the cordite explosions, and went offline, showing not a scratch on its hull. The point defence cannons activated, meant for fighters, but firing explosive ammunition, opened up on the nearest ship to the left, the rounds cut across the deck, separating the guns from their mountings, and the superstructure from the base, the bridge toppling onto the deck and into a magazine, detonating it. The ship cracked in half, and sank. Another code inputted, and the fighters launched from three separate flight decks, a swarm of them bombing and strafing the last one to the right, no kerbal escaping the bullets, or the water. The last ship had reloaded its guns, and the shield was still offline for another minute, so, I demonstrated its second best feature. From the front,and back sides, emerged four thrusters, which engaged, vaporizing the water beneath them, and raising the ship from the oceans. the water poured off of the model as it flew, and exposed the four zeppelin/submarines that were hitched inside of the bottom of the ship. All of them detached, and splashed down, firing torpedoes into the hull of the last remaining warship, and sank it. The carrier lowered itself back into the water, and the subs returned to their moorings, as did all the aircraft. But, from nowhere, and my surprise, a swarm of at least 200 NAT fighters appeared, swarming the ship. I hit a red button labeled \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153AA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 and the point defence cannons reactivated, taking down scores of fighters, but then, tongues of flame erupted from the launchers, bathing the assailants in the fires, destroying the remainder as the program ended, and the holoprojector deactivated.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSo, gentlemen, that wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just a computer program, we have the tech to do this, just not the resources.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 the army general stood, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKILL!

Opening my eyes, I saw it was only Bill, come by to get me ready for the next test flight. I sighed, and left my comfy chair, moving into the hangar. A VTOL dropship awaited us, and the back opened, showing some of the generals, all dressed in flight suits, along with some engineers. Bill, Nielfry, Gusto, and I all got on flight suits, hooking our helmets up on the rack, with all the others. I directed my queries to the admiral, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhy, exactly are you here? Where are we going?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He chuckled and raised a finger to his mouth. I heard the hangar open, and the engines started, lifting us oh-so slightly off the ground, and flying slowly out the doors, and There I saw it, hundreds of our spaceplanes, some carrying, some tugging cargo containers. Even a few copies of \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EFalcon\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E were there, and a ton of VTOL dropships were on the side of the runway, and as soon as the pilots saw us, they saluted, and boosted upwards, tilting 90 degrees, and flew into Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s upper atmosphere, keeping pace with us. I looked through the rear window, and saw military, KSP, and UKN flags all over the ships, some carrying pilots, others marines, and some with scientists, experimental weapons, and many, many more carrying engineers and builders. Staring further into the distance, I saw all the spaceplanes taking off, and we looked like a cloud, streaking off into orbit, to build, \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003Esomething\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E. The lights went red inside, and dinged, our helmets went on the rails and deployed onto our heads, and we fastened them, a hiss coming from each one as it was secured. Again, looking out the window, I saw the UKNSS, our national space station. We docked at the highest dock, and clambered inside, feeling the familiar oddity of zero Gees. Bill and myself were the only ones who really knew how to move in such an environment, as we had been the ones who had founded the UKNSS. Station commander Doodbro Kalan pulled up to us, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDirector Jeb, good to see you again, you too Lieutenant Bill!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2I saluted in return, but could contain my curiosity no longer, I went over to the observatory section, and Peered out. All the spaceplanes were in orbit, and I thought that if anything moved, everything would be destroyed, but as if choreographed, they all boosted backwards at the exact same moment, and the cargo was either released, unhitched, or thrown out. Every piece acted as if it knew what to do, the boxes all unfurled, kitchens, living quarters, recreational areas, turrets, and hangars all flew towards the station, and I tackled Bill behind a small console, waiting out the worst, but then I heard clacks and clicks, hisses and chunks, I looked out again, and the station was building itself! When it had all stopped, the station was around five times its original size. All the dropships went to one hangar, and the spaceplanes mostly departed towards home, some fighters docking inside another hangar. Taking a self guided tour, I saw that it was now a floating drydock and military base, hundreds of marines and pilots lived here now, and the original staff still manned the base modules, but they controlled the whole thing. A kitchen for every three barracks was deployed, and more engineers than soldiers were now living in space as well. In the cargo bays were stockpiles of material, ready to build \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EWVK\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E.

We came in range of it, a dilapidated little thing, comprised of a large hangar, and a bunch of spy modules smooshed together, alongside some defence turrets, with one antimatter reactor inside of it, a wire hub on either end of it. Firstly, I angled my fighter towards the neck of the hangar, where It was connected, a forcefield powered by the reactor keeping everything and everyone from spilling out into the vacuum, and fired my chin cannon, severing the hangar, and everything flew out, except for two fighters, already prepped, but from the force of the explosive decompression, one was shredded to little bits when pieces of the crumpled up-hangar flew through it. The last fighter, however, managed to get a shot off on one of our dropships, flaming out the central engine, but it still had the two wing engines, so I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really matter. Two other fighters blasted it to pieces a second later, and it passed from my mind as I fired my wing cannons into the upper wire hub, cutting off electricity for all of the station, but not the reactor. I parked near the station, getting out my shiny silver pistol, the one I killed the assassin with, and loaded it, the 14-round magazine clicking as it did. Depressurizing the cockpit slowly, and I crept out into the void, wearing my pressurized flight suit, and compression helmet, blocking out our sun, Kerbol\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s bright glare, and allowing me to see. One dropship opened behind me, around twelve troops spilled out, all wearing combat EVA gear, wielding assault rifles only meant to pierce flesh, and not to damage the station. I counted one my fingers, signaling to go as soon as I finished, and I pinned myself aside the airlock door, and finished my countdown, shooting out the door\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hinges, and kicking it in, flooding the room with soldiers. We breached the second airlock, and all but one NAT personnel present were sucked out, their eyes exploded from lack of air pressure. The last one I punched, telling him, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COpen the door, or I kill you slowly, or you can open it now, shut the airlock, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll kill you instantly, choose. He nodded nervously behind his visor, and opened it, cringing at the prospect of death, and I lowered my pistol, put my hand on his shoulder, and whispered into the now taken off helmet, as air was restored, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBoost yourself out of here, get into a dropship, with these handcuffs on, and put your hands in a surrendering gesture, he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll take you in, and you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be treated well.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He thanked my, nodded, and put his helmet and cuffs on, leaving as soon as we were out of the room.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EWe burst into the observatory, And I snuck up behind the Kerbal in the chair, put my pistol behind the headrest of the chair, cocking it in the process. I fired, and a messy green goop plastered the observation screen, and we moved onto the nearest spy module. The door opened, and several NAT soldiers awaited, guns pointed at the entrance. As we were in zero Gees, I ran along the wall, spinning as I fired, taking down two of five. I backflipped off of the ceiling, and crossed my arms, my two guns pointing towards the backs of two others, fired, and spun about, face to face with a gun barrel, He grimaced, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTime to die, UKN fiend!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I shook my head, and ducked, jumped, and somersaulted midair, landed behind him, and beat his head with the butt of my gun, knocking him out.

We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll never submit to you bastards!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He spit on the floor near my feet, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGlory to the Northern Allied Territories!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He cringed, expecting to die, but I waved my hand, and the soldiers fired, messily killing three others. I stepped up to his face, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDo it, or now, every fifteen seconds, we kill two!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I pushed aside a floating body, leading him to the control panel. He beat his head, and entered a code, unlocking both the system and a door near us. From that door burst five NAT commandoes, probably station complement, all firing. Everyone ducked for cover, and only one was caught in the bullets, dying near instantly. I however, grabbed the commander, and held him in front of me, feeling him spasm, and released him as I heard them reload. Launching into more 0-G acrobatics, I spun, and landed behind them, firing my last five rounds, but only wounding the sergeant, belting him across the back of the head, and leaving the body there, tied to his counterpart, and taking the remaining station crew prisoner on the newly appointed prisoner dropship. We left the platoon there to keep things running, protected, and to clean up the mess, as we moved onto the next, this time planning far less mercy upon the next crew, far less. None would survive this attack.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Press Start 2P\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EKSP,Part Eleven\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThe subsequent attack was much easier after we adopted our strategy of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CShoot everything\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. The next station we came upon was severed at both ends of the reactor, and left there, in twelve hours, every kerbal on board would die of asphyxiation, and we would take over, no hardware damage. The last of the smaller stations was over a piece of land that we didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t honestly care about, so every attack ship stopped in front of it, targeted the core with their missiles, bombarding it until the field failed, and the antimatter annihilated with the matter of the station, destroying each and every last vestige of it. Eventually, we reached the final station, NAT-1, an orbital emplacement almost rivaling ours in size, but not complexity. Our cluster of ships stood at attention, destroying the hangars wherever we could, but one was activated in time, and two hits were scored on my fighter, hitting the tiny nuclear reactor onboard, destabilising the power plant, and I bailed as quickly as possible, grabbing my two pistols before I Cracked open the cockpit, and escaped. I activated my tiny boosters on the suit, flying towards a dropship as fast as I could, and I spun around as I attached to the side out of curiosity. The middle of the craft glowed red, and it softened, bending the metal towards Kerbin, and it exploded, literally vaporising the remains. I knocked thrice on the side of the walls, telling them to allow me to board, and so the doors opened, and closed as I entered, everyone removing their helmets, and I spotted a familiar face, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGusto! Good to see you so well! Ever been in combat?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He shook his head, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not glamourous, but you make the most of it! Say, is there any spare pistol ammunition, and weapons?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He pointed to the locker towards the front of the ship, and I nodded, walking towards it, and removing several extra magazines for my two pistols, and an assault rifle, with a semi automatic taser, infinite solar charge, meant for fun. Communicating to the motley fleet through my headset, I ordered all of them to stop, for fighters and bombers to await officer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s artillery pointing, and for dropships to halt course, and release their troops, from there, marines would position at each airlock they could find, and breach, meanwhile, the dropships would join all the others in support roles. We depressurized, and leaped out, the force of the air being sucked out, an 0G forces propelled us to an airlock door. I fired the taser into it, sending electricity into the system, overloading it. The door opened, and two NAT soldiers flew out into space, their skulls partially caved in. I fired again, and it closed, pressurizing the room, and we flicked off our visors, not currently needing them. I saw through the glass door a squad waiting for us, and drew my rifle, killing the one who was reaching for the door control, and spraying the group with bullets, none remaining. We advanced into a small hub nexus, connecting to around ten doors all around the near-spherical room. We decided to split up, one group for one door. Gusto and I opened a door near us, and Four rounds of ammunition sped towards us, not hitting anything but my rifle, oddly enough. Not liking the bulky weapon anyways, I drew my pistols, their silvery polish glinting in the artificial light. Crossing my arms, I hit all four targets, square in the chest. We left the habitation chamber, and moved onto a section where one of our sections was having trouble, having already lost a man. I leaped over them, firing in front of me, as I twisted midair, grabbing onto a handle, and pulling myself towards the line. The section had already lost pressure, and because he was the last remaining one, I turned him around, and pistolwhipped his visor, cracking it into spiderwebbed pieces, his skull turning into messy goop, and we left the chamber, sealing it off as we exited. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003Eafter much of this, room clearing, mess hall massacres, and medical bay irony, we arrived at the control centre, where the executives were lined up, all kneeling (relatively) and hands bound behind them.

Gusto grabbed my hand, and led me to a detox chamber, just inside the next hallway. I stepped in, knelt, trying to incoherently make a joke, and put my palm to the door, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou were...and always could be...my acquaintance.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and started to uncontrollably laugh, and the spray began, and I stood, er..floated at attention. Sobered, I pushed out, and sort of space-swam alongside Gusto. We opened a door, and seven NAT soldiers, all dressed in EVA suits, but not armed, were holding on the handholds, and chatting \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou set the charges?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNo, was I \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153possed to?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said an underling, presumably drunk.

Now we have to go and set them!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He took a sack from the other one, and I shut the door, hopefully not being noticed. I grabbed a baton from an unconscious crewman, and handed another to Gusto. The bomber stepped through the door, and I clubbed him, descending from the ceiling. He went out immediately, but his friends didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t notice. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGusto?

Jumping up, I gave one a fierce uppercut, and his mask shattered, leaving little shards of glass just hovering in the air. I spun about, kicking one square in the chest, right towards the open door, and I heard a \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EWhump\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E as Gusto clubbed him.

The former, however went out like a light, leaving only the commander to deal with, who I bashed his faceplate in, making impossible a space escape. His nose bled profusely, little globlets of blood floating around the room. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAre there others?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He looked at me confused, and I hit him again, most likely not raising the chances of information, but lowering my stress level.

To avoid burning up on reentry, we deployed airbrakes, slowing our descent enough to not die. We plunged towards Kerbin at alarming speed, though. In my usual badass style, I pulled up dramatically when only twenty metres up, and the plane shuddered, warning me as to not do that to a more extreme degree. The others followed my lead in a safer fashion, and pulled up next to me, a squadron of nine, flying over to the KSC. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EWhen we arrived, I saw smoke billowing from the horizon, and immediately kicked in the afterburners, boosting towards the centre at maximum speed.

The other squadrons pressed the assault on the enemies, trying to drive back the forces of apparent evil from our home. I swooped low, trying to inspect the damages done, and I saw tanks, some bearing our flag, but most NAT insignia, along with ground troops and dropships floating, dumping their payload, and flying off to collect more troops. A tank noticed my slow flying, and aimed its main gun, and fired. The shot broke apart midair, revealing a cluster of bomblets, flying through the air towards me, some exploding in the wings, but most damaging, most in the intakes. The jet sputtered, and I set the MechJeb unit to autopilot, and leapt from the cockpit, pulling my chute low to the ground, but before I dismounted, I made sure I had my pistols.

Sprinting to a dropship, I jumped off a tank, firing behind me, and reloading as I grabbed onto the chin of the craft. I clambered up and saw the two pilots, side by side, so I shot my guns, side to side, dispatching them with ease. Climbing in, I pushed the bodies out of the chairs, and set the craft to hover. Unleashing a burst of chaingun fire on a section of incoming dropships, I downed them with a considerable lack of difficulty. Turning my attention the the infantry, I opened up with the full armament of the craft, decimating the lines. Finally, I let go of the stick, and jumped from the window, downing the craft on the still strong right flank. Landing on a NAT corpse, I grabbed his rifle, and led the allied troops to victory, charging into the side of the opposing force, still tying down our right flank. Smashing into them, and taking them by surprise, I sprayed my rifle, killing multiple personnel. Somersaulting onto the deck of another tank, I jumped ecstatically in front of the driver\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s windshield.

I aimed the turret towards another tank, and destroying it, showering the surrounding infantry with shrapnel. I ran out of the tank as I saw it being aimed upon by one of ours. I retreated to our own lines, holstering my pistols in my flight suit. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ESeeing the command tent, I ran to it, and shoved aside the entry curtains, and saw the only thing I wanted to, my brother, still living.

Taking a position on the barricades of the temporary HQ, I manned a machine gun, and was shocked as the NAT forces, with only a couple hundred left, mounted a charge, hoping to overrun us, and have a defensible position to stakeout the reinforcements. A rousing battle cry erupted from their lines, and all of them charged, from above, it would have looked like a forest-green blob charging smoke, but from ours, it was a wall of fanatics, ready to give up their lives to make us forfeit ours. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMen, hold your fire!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and the only sound was that of charging men, and burning buildings.

The rear door opened, but the craft was still about a foot off the ground, and we took his hand and he pulled us aboard, the door closing and the ship moving as soon we were on.

I guess it, along with other experimental designs had made it out of the KSC before it was destroyed. We flew at high speeds, and then stopped suddenly, and because of that, Gusto flew out of his chair and into a wall.

The runway was freshly paved, with new lights, glistening in the sun. Several large buildings stood above the rest, and a new mission control and astronaut centre stood proudly inside. Another skyscraper housed all the offices of the non-action KSC employees, and we found a little Keep, a small military vehicle, and boarded. We drove down the runway, and stopped around a kilometre off of it, directly overlooking a cliff. Dunfrey entered a command code into his watch, and a large door opened into a ramp. We started down it, and looked around, shocked, I realised that it was an underground VAB and launchpads! Rockets were under construction, engineers scurrying around, holding parts, welding things, and doing other things, of which I was uncertain what they were. We continued down the underground street, and ran into (not literally) battery of launchpads. We dismounted the Keep, and proceeded into the little control centre, where all the mission control staff were busy at work, making preparations for what seemed to be something big.They all turned their heads towards the door, and smiled. Many ran over to us, others yelled \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI thought you were dead!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and there was happiness to be shared. After the main tour of the facility, I found out that the large buildings up on the surface were not offices, save one, but tall spaceplane hangars. The planes were housed, and when needed, taken by elevator down to the bottom, the widest, however, was where they were built, and designed. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EAt the end, Dunfrey turned to me, and spoke, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJeb, I have something important to announce.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I motioned for him to go on. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going back to the Mun!

Each stack held five Kerbonauts, along with supplies, and whatever that stacks specialty was. Of them, one was for habitation, one for survival, another for science, and the final one for observation. Under those, were four stages of fuel, engines, and RCS ports. The thing was a monster, a rocket powered spear made to pierce the sky, and explore the heavens. We boarded our section, the Mark I control pod, specially modified with a low ceiling, door, and cupola module up top for the fourth. Gusto sat in the top, being the best rocketeer amongst us, and we sat in a circle, three chairs, on rotating mounts. At first we sat as normal chairs do, but as soon as the countdown started, the chairs re-angled, and we all sat skyward, our torsos pointing towards the sky. The engines rumbled, and ignited, the silo doors opened just in time, and we streaked out of it. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EIt was around ten minutes before we breached Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere, and jettisoned the second stage. We angled ourselves prograde, and boosted to the Mun. It took four days of boosts, burns, and rocketing to reach the Mun.

We finally reached the Mun, ejected the third stage and readied ourselves for the landing. I woke Bill, and we all took our stations. Gusto gunned the RCS thrusters, and I decoupled the last stage, making sure not to damage the docking port, as that was our return mechanism. The stack split into their fours, separating from the group, the four stacks fell to the Mun, firing thrusters to slow their descent. We followed a little later, landing perfectly, and before the others. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThe stacks landed well, and deployed themselves. One unfolded into four large barracks, another into a science station, one per module, the next into a farm/replication centre, as well as recreation, and the final one needed to be built, but it would become an observatory, meant for watching NAT and the stars, two very different things, and purposes. We exited the craft, overjoyed to stretch our legs and escape the craft. Grabbing tools from the kit, we went to work, twenty-four Kerbals building a Munar colony. Bill and I were assisted by ten other Kerbals in assembling the observatory. We made great headway, and completed it in three short hours, now it was only a matter of setting up the KAS modules, interconnecting the separate emplacements, as well as providing oxygen, with electricity from an experimental portable atomic/hyperthermal generator, cooled by both the hyperthermal mechanism, and the vacuum of the Mun. Finally, all was finished, in less than a day. We decided to stay the night, waiting to return. For hours, though, we messed about with the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 Kerbin gravity, jumping and throwing rocks at each other, which, in hindsight, may not have been the best of ideas, but, who cared? We were having a great time. The time came though, when it was morning, and we left, taking along twenty kilos of munar soil, minerals, and stone. Along with that, we took a bunch of snacks for the way home, including some of the plants being grown on board the colony. Piling in, we took off in our little lander, docking with the return stage, and took another four days to reach Kerbin again. We braced ourselves for re-entry heat as we ditched the last stage, leaving us with just our lander. We descended quickly, the flames engulfing us, but I wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worried, the veteran of several spaceflights, no one was worried. But we noticed that we were off-course, and that we had been locked out of controls, just as we realised this, we saw a small black object hovering near the KSC, the older one, as NAT did not yet know of the existence of our new one, but the signal was originating from there, and I had to climb out the side, with parachutes on though, and manually direct the thrusters, positioning us directly above the ship, and I told the crew of my plan, and let go of our lander, falling gracefully onto the top of theirs. Ripping off the access hatch, I swung in, kicking an unlucky NAT flight crew in the face, knocking him out. I whipped out my pistols, which I carried with me everywhere, (You never know!) and blasted what looked like computers, the ship swerving, I grabbed onto the side of the walls, silently advancing, not caring that the gunshots had probably alerted them to my presence. I opened the last door, and saw a crew of four, sitting in pilot\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s and observer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s chairs. I shot two of them, then as one reached for a weapon, dispatched him. unfortunately, my shots had broken the windshield, and the last was putting up a fight, so I picked him up, and threw him out the front, hearing him thump on the side of our ship, now below me. Setting the ship on a crash course, I climbed out of the window, and ran down the nose, leaping off the edge. For a moment, time stopped as I fell, body spread, but it resumed, and I hit the side, jarring it, but in the process, I hit my head, but luckily hooked my chute on the ladder. My vision went black around the edges, then entirely. What felt like moments passed, and I awoke, a parachute deployed, but looking down, the pod had no parachutes anymore, and was spinning out, flaming on one part. I reached out, hoping it was still close, and it hit the ground, explosions wracking the air and pod. I looked again, and saw that the main pod had survived, but not the cupola, along with that, the science module had survived. On closer inspection, a little body hung out the front of the cupola, and the main capsule was heavily damaged, and on fire. With no regards for my own safety, I cut the chute five metres up, fell, rolled, and ran towards the wreck, hoping that everyone lived. I reached a close distance, and a fireball erupted from the cupola, blasting me backwards, and sending shrapnel all over my body.

I felt cold, at my knees on down on my left leg, and the whole thing on my right. I pulled back the sheets, and sat, completely agape with horror. My legs, were...not there! They were metal, with little lights, and a cover, that retracted for charging and readouts. I stood up, and tried walking on them. I looked at my wrist, and there was a section of my forearm replaced, with a large metal cylinder. I opened the lid, and a screen lit up! It was a fully built Executive, upgradable Kpad, with holographic displays, extra functions, so many bells, whistles, gizmos and whatsits that I almost forgot the shock-horror of losing limbs. Reality rushed back to me, and I ran to the nearest mirror, wondering in terror of what would await me there. Thankfully, nothing bad had happened, and I let out a long sigh of relief. Running out to the hall, I tested my new legs, and they were amazing! I could run almost indefinitely, and do impossible things with them. I strolled now, right over to Bill\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s room, who was completely intact, Nielfry as well, except for two fingers, but that didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really matter.

With nine left, it was easy, Gusto blasted one to shreds with his shotgun, Nielfry killing another two with his SMG\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s, and Bill mowing down the remainder. I flipped around my prisoner and kneed him in the gut, he bowed over in agony, and I put him down, blasting a massive hole in his head. We proceeded down the street, clearing out shops, and buildings. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EBefore we knew it, NAT had called dropships on us. Three of them bore down on us, trapped in a small plaza. It was too late, and the troops all dropped down, but, I managed to kill the pilots of one, which caused a chain reaction, destroying the other two, and shutting off the plaza with the twisted metal hulks. Around forty NAT soldiers circled us, and things seemed hopeless, Bill threw a stick of gum in his mouth, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m here to kill NAT and chew gum, and I think I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll just do both.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 At that, we all knelt as Bill emptied the last of his ammunition into the crowds, killing around eighteen of them. His machine gun useless, He picked up a rifle from a fallen soldier, and we broke out into pure killing machines. I ran into the middle of a crowd, shot out two mags, and holstered my guns, wanting to save rounds, and drew my unfolding blades. They did as the package said, unfurling into .6 metre long blades. The soldiers closed, hoping to knock me out to capture, but I sprang up into the air, and came down a whirlwind of doom. I spun from target to target, slicing and dicing foes wherever my blades met flesh. Only three left in my group. I used my pommel to jam into one\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s gut, forcing him to drop his gun, and recover. The other two, however, were not so fortunate, as I stabbed one through his eyes, and crossed my blades, bisecting his head, I backflipped to the next one, locked his head in my elbow, and pulled his back into my blade, the end coming out of chest, like a gruesome flower. Shifting my focus to the last, I chopped his head off in one fell stroke, the skull plopping on the ground. I watched Bill as he pounded their heads against each other and blasted others point-blank in their face, pulverising some. Gusto used his shotgun to its full potential, killing off multiple enemies in one shot, and then swinging it with great strength, caving skulls inwards. Finally, Nielfry was ducking and rolling, mowing down crowds with considerable ease. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EAt the end of the battle, we looked up, weathered and tired, ready to just sleep, and saw UKN fighters flying overhead, taking down NAT aircraft, but it was all too late, Kresden was ruined, and we heard over our Kpads that Kerbingrad had suffered similarly, as well as Kidenurough, all massive cities in three of five UKN countries. Oddly enough, the Bartender had managed to get into the plaza, and was carrying a platter of drinks and snacks. We were amazed by the kindness of the man, and how he had survived. We all grabbed a beer, and snacks, while the bartender did the same, and we shared a drink, until a UKN dropship lowered itself to us, the doors opening, and two UKN bodyguards, heavily armed and armoured held out their hands, and we boarded, not forgetting the kindness of the bartender, we took him along, so he could continue on at KSC, where he would be greatly appreciated. The VTOL zoomed off towards the KSC at lightning speeds, and as soon as we were on the plane, however, we slept until we arrived, six hours later.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Press Start 2P\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EKSP,Part Twenty\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ELanding on the helipad at the office building, we proceeded not to Dunfrey\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s office, but to the UKN emergency council room. The massive doors opened, revealing a large conference table, seating the leaders of each country and their militaries, who, oddly enough, were shouting and yelling at each other, accusing one another of treason and so on. As I stepped in, everyone shut up. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAlright, all of you, it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t anyone from the UKN, it was a full-fledged NAT assault on Kresden, Kidenborough, and Kerbingrad.

Unfortunately, our military is spread thin along borders and defending those cities. I propose that we launch an orbital strike on the city of Keijing, and in north Kerbea on Kyongkang. UKN 1 has been set up, is fully functioning, and we have control over three of their orbital emplacements, the other being destroyed. We could hack into their reactors, deactivate the safety, or launch NAT\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s own missiles at their cities.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThe leaders all scratched their chins, and discussed amongst themselves the best courses of action. Eventually, a decision was made, Kyonkang would be bombed and overloaded, and Keijing would be strafed, assaulted, and bombarded by the Twelfth fleet. The four of us took the tram to a spaceplane hangar, suiting up, and getting into a dropship, we boosted towards the heavens, off to UKN 1. We reached space, the helmets came down, and we docked half an hour later. Walking on the deck towards the control centre, we had to pass though guards at every door, part of the new security measures designed to keep NAT out. We entered, and there it was, the big red button. I love buttons, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re the best, and when they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re big and red, well\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 yeah.

We zoomed in on the city, but not enough to penetrate the cloud layer. The missiles hit home, and the clouds were disintegrated as the air bubbled, the seas boiled, and the ground melted. Massive fireballs rose up, convecting the air around them, and the city was no more. Shifting our focus to the launch bays, battalions of fighters, bombers, and drones took off, from us, and from dozens of runways scattered about the UKN. The swarm closed in on Keijing, and razed it to the ground. Buildings crumbled, homes caved, offices died, and an entire populus yelled out, and were silenced by the thousands of explosions wracking the city. Turning off the screens, I turned to everyone, toasting with wine glasses, and those from the ruined cities celebrated especially, feeling sweet vengeance for the destruction of their homes. Not too big on parties, the four of us boarded our dropship, and commenced our return.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ESomething caught my eye, however, a slight ripple in the light, characteristic of the cloak we had designed.

NAT had still not yet recovered from the nuking of Kyonkang, and the razing of Keijing, and constantly made empty threats about attacks and such, but none ever came, except tiny little raids on convoys and such, and they had still yet to find out about the \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EWernher Von Kerman\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E, and all was good. I looked out my office window, the rain vaguely covering the window in little drops, and fogging it up, but it didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t matter, still a beautiful view. I sipped on my coffee, feeling the warm fluid go down my gullet and heat me from the inside. In the last year or so, we had made so many scientific breakthroughs, like ionic fuel and engines, solar sails, and more nuclear weapons. Still gazing, I saw a kerbal run onto the launchpad, screaming about something, I paid no mind, as protesters loved to storm onto here, but then he opened up his jacket, cringed, and blew up. Literally exploded. I was taken aback by shock, and then looked up, and there it was, a massive bomber, the same as one that was hijacked along with three others zoomed towards the KSC, straight at me! I grabbed my emergency chute from the closet, grabbed the PA system, and shouted quickly, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThis is Director Kerman!

The building was wrecked, utterly wrecked. Smoke and flame billowed from the top floors, as well as the lobby. I looked closer, and there were a few office kerbals hanging out the window, probably a last ditch attempt at escape. Bill, Nielfry, and Gusto came quickly, mounted on a Keep. They stood in shock, just as I did, Bill could only say one thing, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C.....\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Nielfry as well, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSQUADdammit!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 finally, Gusto, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMother of Harv.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 We piled into the Keep, and found out that all the officials had survived the blasts, and proceeded to the underground complex, where Gene sat, dumbfounded, pointing at the screen.

I sighted the wingtip, and opened up with the chaingun, shearing off the entire wing, sending them into a downwards spiral, and splashing down in the ocean. I angled my plane downwards, put their tower in my sights, and let loose two missiles, both locked onto the skinny midpoint. They impacted, destroyed it, and crushed the rearmost plane as it fell. Three hangars were deploying plagiarized bombers, and they too were destroyed with ease. Swooping in again, I fired off the wing cannons into the line of offending planes, destroying each that was hit.

Not thinking we would necessarily need it yet, I saved it for a moment when it would be crucial, and surprising. But my waiting was not to be, because from UKN-1, we saw a large NAT fleet, around forty strong, including three carriers, two battleships, and many, many, landing ships, as well as cruisers and destroyers. The trail of ships was a mile long, bearing in on our biggest port city, Kan Franbillco, located in the United Kates. If they reached it, then civilian, military, and material casualties would be untold.

I strode down the pipe leading to the bridge, and a beautiful sight beheld me. The bridge was massive, controls and panels everywhere, two stations at the front, and finally, two amazing command chairs sitting in the centre, obviously meant for Bill and I. We took our stations, and luckily, they were not alien in design, so no one had to spend valuable time figuring anything out. The station fired a small tactical nuke into the fleet, disabling a third of it. We then proceeded to undock, angle ourselves prograde, and fire the thrusters. Reentry was smooth, nothing damaged, except a few snacks left laying out on the flight deck. Clearing the area of reentry, we angled the four main thrusters downwards, and burned until we hovered. At that point, we activated our cloak, still not functioning perfectly, but enough to get the job done right. Around only a kilometre away, we stopped accelerating forwards, and hovered once more, floating above the enemy fleet. The Zeppelins on the belly detached, and splashed down, but the NAT fleet thought it was only a pod of whales. The subs did their mission well, sinking the remaining troopships, and pulled away, speeding off towards Kan Franbillco, to warn them of a possible threat. We angled the ventral guns towards the carrier decks, which had, unfortunately aired around ten squadrons before being disabled. This is when the fighters were deployed, swarming the enemy air-fleet. The battleships decided to coordinate their fire, and shot straight upwards, a risky gamble, for if we weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t there, the shells would impact on themselves. Unfortunately, we were there, and it disabled our cloak. We shut off the engines, descending fast into the sea, floating as a normal ship does. Turning our guns towards the two ships, we shot out holes in their hull, sinking them. Turning our attention to the carriers, we fired a drillshot into their magazine, detonating it, and sinking it instantly in two pieces. The other two sank under the stress of so many shots taken on them. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EAfterwards, we counted up the fleet, but only thirty-eight ships lay either capsized, sunk, or burned.

Finally, there was an entire defence and naval emplacement, cannons, AA guns, VTOL underground lifts, and a naval base, complete with drydock, ports, and submarine docks. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EEntirely revamped, the space centre was massive, and amazing. Four silos opened simultaneously, and four rockets all took off, leaving massive contrails behind them as the engines glinted through the flame.

We nabbed a Keep, and drove off to the tracking station. entering with pizazz, we threw open the door, sunlight flooding the artificial lighted room, shadowing our figures. We strode in, watching the main tracking screen. It showed a map of all our exo-kerbin vehicles. from Kerbin to Minmus. Around Kerbin was UKN-1 through 4, and masked signal, \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EWVK\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E, along with these, hundreds of satellites, and the four supply rockets showed up. Shifting over to Minmus, the further out moon of Kerbin, akin to a large blue mint, had several research stations, only automated, many, many satellites, and a large spaceplane inbound for a kerballed exploration. Going back to the Mun, We saw the massive satellite network, the colony, but then something happened. Three satellites went offline, and five objects, accompanied by a large destroyer, apparently one just retrofitted from terrestrial use, to fly in space, quite shoddily done, really. Seeing them descend on the colony, it was over for them, their weapons were not well stocked, and fifteen died before surrendering, leaving only five left. They started into the science lab, a squad of ten entering the complex. I ran to a panel, draining all the data, and self-destructing the lab, killing the ten inside, and disabling two dropships with debris. Tired of not having a single break, We sprinted to an SPH, assembled three dropships of marines, and took off, hopefully reaching them in an hour, either that, or any Mun influence would be lost, and information would be extremely hard to gather on NAT, this would change the course of the war if NAT won. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-07T20:33:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2014 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ZoidPool\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
