So I get it on the launchpad and turn on the autopilot and sure enough, 180 into the ground. For a while I was sure it was the airship part, I mean surely it was exerting some weird torque during launch, RIGHT? I was really close to going to the airship thread and reporting it as a bug when I noticed something odd. All the fins were hard over during launch... in the direction that it was turning.

Apparently an odd occurrence with the version of MJ I was using caused the MJ unit to flip out if installed with the antenna pointing downwards.
