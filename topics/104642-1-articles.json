Doing a contract that asked me to fly to a spot and take a crew report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I fly there and take the crew report. YEA!!! I get credit for doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I start to fly back to base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get close to base and start my landing approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI Bring the Jet engine down to about 2.5 Kn thrust.

Now I\u0027m was going 185 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m flying level but plane is barely slowing down at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I turn engines to 0%. (0.0 Kn) I\u0027m still going 175 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill cant slow down. So I touch down on the run way with brakes on. Slow down to 170 m/s and bounce slightly up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the runway is behind me. Dang it!!! What\u0027s going on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I turn on the FAR flight data. It says be total drag is 0.21\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat seems extremely low for some reason. My plane will just not slow down!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happened?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday I was flying. I lower the jet power to about 5% thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane slows down from 150 m/s to about 70 m/s very nicely. No problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut today its completely different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I did today was I added a mod called Karbonite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt added a few parts like Jet motors but I didn\u0027t use a single part from the new mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot ONE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to be able to mine Karbonite from the Mun so I could re-fuel my ships.

So, if you were using a different plane from the one from yesterday the drag from the wings can be different. In addition, If you continue to encounter this problem there could be a problem with infin-gliding in which your aircraft wont ever slow down. Or may\u0027be you can try aerobraking by taking bank turns. However, as far as I can comprehend from this information, it must be infin-gliding, FAR physics merging with ksp physics, or just coincidental.

Then I was just putting it back, and everything was fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I bet its possible when I was flying my plane around, that one time and it was flying more like I was expecting it to fly, I may have had FAR deleted\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand didn\u0027t notice because I was deleting it and putting it back in so often.

Because actually in real life even large passenger jets have managed to glide well over 50 miles after total engine failure maintaining a very slight descent path. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn explanation I found\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to add a bit of explanation. It is not the engines that keep aircraft in the air, it is the wings that generate lift as they move through the air. Whether the engines run or not does not affect the lift generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever as the aircraft moving through air and wings producing lift cause drag that slows the plane down. The engines compensate the drag so the plane can maintain speed. But when the aircraft flies, it also has potential energy due to it\u0027s altitude (that had to be provided by the engines during climb) and that can be exchanged for kinetic energy to maintain the speed instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lift is significantly higher than the drag, so the plane only needs to descend quite slowly to keep flying. Glide ratio ranges from around 10 for small general aviation planes to around 60 for good sailplane. A typical value for airlines is around 18 which means from the typical cruise altitude of 10km they can glide about 180km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T03:30:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to modded support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
