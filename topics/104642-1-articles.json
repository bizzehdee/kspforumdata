Doing a contract that asked me to fly to a spot and take a crew report.\n\nSo I fly there and take the crew report. YEA!!! I get credit for doing it.\n\nSo I start to fly back to base.\n\nI get close to base and start my landing approach.\n\nI Bring the Jet engine down to about 2.5 Kn thrust. Just above being turned off. I would guess they were at about 1-2% throttle.\n\nI\u0027m at about 3,000m above sea level going about 200 m/s. I bring it down to about 500m.\n\nPlane is barely slowing down. Now I\u0027m was going 185 m/s.\n\nI\u0027m flying level but plane is barely slowing down at all.\n\nSo I turn engines to 0%. (0.0 Kn) I\u0027m still going 175 m/s.\n\nStill cant slow down. So I touch down on the run way with brakes on. Slow down to 170 m/s and bounce slightly up.\n\nNow the runway is behind me. Dang it!!! What\u0027s going on?\n\nSo I turn on the FAR flight data. It says be total drag is 0.21\n\nThat seems extremely low for some reason. My plane will just not slow down!!!\n\nWhat happened?\n\nYesterday I was flying. I lower the jet power to about 5% thrust.\n\nThe plane slows down from 150 m/s to about 70 m/s very nicely. No problems.\n\nBut today its completely different.\n\nThe only thing I did today was I added a mod called Karbonite.\n\nIt added a few parts like Jet motors but I didn\u0027t use a single part from the new mod.\n\nNot ONE!\n\nI just wanted to be able to mine Karbonite from the Mun so I could re-fuel my ships. That\u0027s all.\n\nBut now it seems like the drag model is completely broken.\n\nDoes anyone know a way to fix this problem besides just deleting the new Karbonite mod?\n\nThanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T07:09:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 07:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Solar71**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T02:41:24Z","Content":"Silly question maybe--was your navball set to SURFACE or ORBIT when you observed the high speed on landing?

So, if you were using a different plane from the one from yesterday the drag from the wings can be different. In addition, If you continue to encounter this problem there could be a problem with infin-gliding in which your aircraft wont ever slow down. Or may\u0027be you can try aerobraking by taking bank turns. However, as far as I can comprehend from this information, it must be infin-gliding, FAR physics merging with ksp physics, or just coincidental.

Yesterday when I was flying my plane around and I said it was flying perfectly fine.\n\nIt was, but I was putting in mods and removing them the entire time because many of them I didn\u0027t like.\n\nAlso a few of them were not playing nicely with some of my other mods that I had already installed \u0022Like FAR\u0022 and \u0022Procedural Parts\u0022\n\nSo I was removing and adding mods to try and find the conflicting mods. Well during that time I think I deleted the FAR folder inside the GameData\n\nfolder about 3-4 different times for testing. Then I was just putting it back, and everything was fine.\n\nBut I bet its possible when I was flying my plane around, that one time and it was flying more like I was expecting it to fly, I may have had FAR deleted\n\nand didn\u0027t notice because I was deleting it and putting it back in so often. In fact that\u0027s the only thing that makes sense.\n\nBefore that, after installing FAR the 1st time I think I was only using rockets. Not Airplanes. Hmmm that\u0027s actually funny. lol\n\nWell TBH If this is how FAR works with Airplanes its not as realistic as I first thought.\n\nI can Coast my airplane at level flight for miles and miles and miles and it will only lose a tiny amount of speed without flaps.\n\nIn a real airplane if you are not nose down you lose airspeed SO FAST its not even funny. You cant just coast along the way I do.\n\nWell anyway. Thank you for helping me figure out what I was doing wrong.\n\nAlso, thanks everyone else for helping too. much appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"nekogod","CreatedById":103186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T11:08:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I can Coast my airplane at level flight for miles and miles and miles and it will only lose a tiny amount of speed without flaps.\n\u003E In a real airplane if you are not nose down you lose airspeed SO FAST its not even funny.\n\nIs it dead level flight? Because actually in real life even large passenger jets have managed to glide well over 50 miles after total engine failure maintaining a very slight descent path. \n\nAn explanation I found\n\nI would like to add a bit of explanation. It is not the engines that keep aircraft in the air, it is the wings that generate lift as they move through the air. Whether the engines run or not does not affect the lift generation.\n\nHowever as the aircraft moving through air and wings producing lift cause drag that slows the plane down. The engines compensate the drag so the plane can maintain speed. But when the aircraft flies, it also has potential energy due to it\u0027s altitude (that had to be provided by the engines during climb) and that can be exchanged for kinetic energy to maintain the speed instead.\n\nThe lift is significantly higher than the drag, so the plane only needs to descend quite slowly to keep flying. Glide ratio ranges from around 10 for small general aviation planes to around 60 for good sailplane. A typical value for airlines is around 18 which means from the typical cruise altitude of 10km they can glide about 180km."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T03:30:55Z","Content":"Moved to modded support."}]}
