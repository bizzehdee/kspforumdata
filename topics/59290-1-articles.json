I always put a larger reaction wheel on the rocket instead of using the payload\u0027s reaction wheel to improve the rocket\u0027s steering and stability. If I leave the payload\u0027s reaction wheels on, they work against each other during launch and flexes the ship to pieces, so I have to manually go and disable torque on all of them and it\u0027s often annoying trying to guess where the parts are by clicking through the fairing walls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, because the payload may not always point in the same direction as the rocket, I use a remote guidance unit below the payload fairing which I have to manually set \u0022control from here\u0022 each time I launch. This isn\u0027t really a big issue, but it becomes an issue in the VAB when you delete a set of parts that include your first part. Even if you have other control units, it completely invalidates your build until you add another one. We should have the option to set which part is node 0, or have it automatically fall back to another one if it exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, I\u0027ve had to handle the reaction wheels issue by setting the torque toggle of all the wheels as an action group, but it seems silly not to just have the option to disable them normally, and it\u0027s a waste of an action group.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atoning Unifex","CreatedById":58766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T14:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey may have been overlooked, tweakables are brand new after all!
