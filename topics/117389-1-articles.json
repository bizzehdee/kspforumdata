Sometimes on loading the airbrake doesn\u0027t seem to work correctly. If it doesn\u0027t deploy properly just toggle the elevon back to inverted/normal, it\u0027s correctly set up in the SPH but on loading seems to forget this at times. Can\u0027t seem to consistently replicate it...\n\nShe behaves as one would expect of a fighter aircraft, nimble, yet will bite if you push it too. Can handle 9G. Unfortunately she\u0027s a bit on the slow side compared to the real thing, but pretty enough that one forgive such a heinous crime. She\u0027s much heavier than the real version, and does carry a lot more fuel. If you want to arm it with BDArmory you\u0027d want to fit a 30mm cannon to the port side (squeeze it into the landing gear fairing thingy above the intake) and six missiles under the wings (2-4 AIM-120s in place of the R-77, and remaining AIM-9s instead of R-73s). It also has a single hard point along the centreline for a drop tank.\n\nFeedback, comments and criticisms of all sorts welcomed and wanted!\n\n[Download here](http://kerbalx.com/flipnascar/MiK-29.craft)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
