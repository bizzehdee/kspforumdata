Sometimes on loading the airbrake doesn\u0027t seem to work correctly. If it doesn\u0027t deploy properly just toggle the elevon back to inverted/normal, it\u0027s correctly set up in the SPH but on loading seems to forget this at times. Can\u0027t seem to consistently replicate it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe behaves as one would expect of a fighter aircraft, nimble, yet will bite if you push it too. Can handle 9G. Unfortunately she\u0027s a bit on the slow side compared to the real thing, but pretty enough that one forgive such a heinous crime. She\u0027s much heavier than the real version, and does carry a lot more fuel. If you want to arm it with BDArmory you\u0027d want to fit a 30mm cannon to the port side (squeeze it into the landing gear fairing thingy above the intake) and six missiles under the wings (2-4 AIM-120s in place of the R-77, and remaining AIM-9s instead of R-73s). It also has a single hard point along the centreline for a drop tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeedback, comments and criticisms of all sorts welcomed and wanted!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/flipnascar/MiK-29.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDownload here\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/k2LWV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
