I play in career mode. 1.0 seems to be a great update. It fixes a number of bugs/annoyances and tries to bring the physics closer to reality.\n\nOne question I had, since I had not seen in posted yet...\n\nI had researched several sciences and unlocked a number of parts, though far from all. I appear to have lost a number of parts with the new part structure. Is this a bug? I was looking forward to my next science upgrades, but after the update to 1.0, I find I have to spend science to reacquire parts I used to own.\n\nThanks in advance,"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:38:50Z","Content":"Indeed, due to the sheer massive number of changes we made to parts in 1.0, legacy saves such as those from 0.90 may have significant issue.

Could be worse. Not the same grind as some other apps. BTW, great game/simulation, great support, and great community. Lots to still explore. Looking forward to the journey."}]}
