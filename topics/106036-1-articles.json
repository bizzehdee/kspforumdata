I was looking forward to my next science upgrades, but after the update to 1.0, I find I have to spend science to reacquire parts I used to own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:38:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, due to the sheer massive number of changes we made to parts in 1.0, legacy saves such as those from 0.90 may have significant issue.
