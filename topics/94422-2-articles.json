Your OP\u0027s coordinate frame was thrusting at a given angle above the horizon, so you were in a rotating frame of reference. Your latest is using a fixed coordinate frame. In a rotating frame of reference, you need a centrifugal term, as arkie pointed out. In a fixed coordinate frame, you don\u0027t have centrifugal terms.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, if you can provide a resource that discusses this issue, I\u0027ll happily read it. Not a partially legible scan of some equations where it\u0027s impossible to get context or understand what\u0027s being presented. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if all you have is more \u0022you\u0027re wrong\u0022, you\u0027re wasting your time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I don\u0027t see how you can claim the OP is any kind of rotational frame of reference. Burns described take place over a distance of less than 50 km, and usually much less than that. Traveling even 50 km over the surface at sea level leads to practically no deviation from a linear frame of reference, the diameter of the Mun at sea level is over 1,200 km (400 pi km), in which case there is at most a 15 degree change in horizon during the burn. This is means theres less than a 2,000 m deviation from a straight shot over the burn course (again, over 50 km long). I fail to see how any substantial amount of angular momentum (which I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E is the real source of \u0022centripetal lift\u0022) can occur over that burn. What I\u0027m presenting is basically just the linear frame of reference, and as you state doesn\u0027t require a \u0022centrifugal term\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s basically just a raw linear prograde burn to reach a particular prograde velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, what Arkie presented just shoves this term into the equation, demonstrating no rigor or derivation. We simply have to accept it\u0027s presence as fact, which is antithetical to this discussion. On top of that, I can barely read what actually \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E presented due to the small size and poor resolution. Again, I\u0027d \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E love to discuss what was presented there, but it\u0027s not possible given the information available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth, from what I can glean from the meager information presented about the rotational inertial frame, you would need to intergrate the entire fight path over dR/dt up to AP to determine altitude, and the initial burn would need be expressed in delta theta (radians/sec)... We don\u0027t do \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E in these terms. You could back convert from polar cordinates to linear terms, but again, I don\u0027t see any kind of discussion about this in what arkie\u0027s presented. And, again, maybe it\u0027s there and I just can\u0027t make it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E I get that you need a centifugal term in for this, since dr/dt = 0 in a circular orbit, and you need something to offset the gravity term, but again, there needs to be \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E more information given about this method before I can draw any conclusions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, I\u0027ve got no problem with this \u003Cem\u003Eover\u003C/em\u003E-estimating cost, and under-estimating efficiency, as this is designed to be \u003Cem\u003Elower\u003C/em\u003E bound for engineering purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ll to sum up: \u003Cem\u003Eplease\u003C/em\u003E provide some worthwhile resources to support your statements.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T03:54:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E And finally, I\u0027ve got no problem with this \u003Cem\u003Eover\u003C/em\u003E-estimating cost, and under-estimating efficiency, as this is designed to be \u003Cem\u003Elower\u003C/em\u003E bound for engineering purposes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELD\u0027s prediction 893m/sec \u0026lt;-- \u0022lower bound\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal DV to escape 871m/sec \u0026lt;-- *actual result* under less than ideal circumstances\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a worthwhile resource...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T03:57:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003E[some data contradicting LD\u0027s model]\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving quickly read through LD\u0027s paper, there is something that it appears hasn\u0027t been accounted for: g (acceleration due to gravity) is not constant with altitude (I may have simply missed it).
