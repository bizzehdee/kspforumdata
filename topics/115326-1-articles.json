No problem, I have the Office ISO on my other HDD, just to quickly download the DEAMON tools and I\u0027ll be done in a minute.\n\nWell, it turns out DEAMON Tools Lite now forces the install of Razor Web adware.\n\nIt is impossible to launch the thing without installing this crap that camouflages as an essential part of the install. It\u0027s not a question of unchecking a box. It just refuses to launch (reports an error) until you install that thing.\n\nNow in the process of removing this crap, along with the DEAMON Tools.
