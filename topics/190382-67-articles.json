Actually, having a \u0022spare parts\u0022 resource, and a \u00223d printer\u0022 module that can use spare parts to fix malfunctions, that would be the best option. Kerbalism uses the (ir)rational resources, and every planetary surface gives a complex composition that is never really used. Introducting some extra drills that would mine various metals - that the game already has in planetary surfaces - and machinery that turns those metals into spare parts. the idea is that there should be a cost - a real cost, not a symbolic one like 600 kg of mass on a space station - else there is no challenge. and you may as well just remove malfunctions entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSandCastle (by mgb125) is a small mod all about 3D printing in-situ (well, it being the latest incarnation of the ideas behind OSE Workshop) but it introduces such ideas and gameplay loops as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome parts can be consumed as ingredients for other parts\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome parts can only be printed in some situations such as \u0026lt; 0.3 gee or only in vacuum\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome parts can be universally blacklisted and must be shipped, namely the included \u0022box of generic parts\u0022 or a \u0022black box\u0022 part which is equivalent to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E SpecializedParts which are hard (or impossible, depending) to produce off-world.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhat a given printer can print can be affected by the current tech tree situation\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the (ir)rational resources, I recently settled on my own formulas for producing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E MaterialKits or WBI Equipment and avoiding Ore input as much as possible.
