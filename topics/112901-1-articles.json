They are perfectly balanced with CoM at center of cargo bays, and all fuel evenly distributed to keep CoM unchanged from beginning to end. If you want a reliable workhorse that you can just throw a large payload into orbit with, and recover for only fuel costs, this is it.\n\n**Extremely practical:**\n\nShielded Docking Port in front, Docking Port Sr. in back for docking with anything\n\n8 RCS thrusters and 250 MonoProp for orbital maneuvering\n\nLarge Reaction Wheel for orbital maneuvering\n\n4500 Electric Charge and 2 small panels for power\n\nQuad Airbrakes for extreme re-entry angles and glide-path control\n\nFore/Aft/Internal Lighting\n\n**Standard flight profile:**\n\n**Takeoff**\n\nFull Power in airbreathing mode, rotate at about ~80m/s, keep shallow climb until ~200m/s airspeed\n\nIncrease climb to 30-40 degree AoA\n\nAt ~10k go to a ballistic trajectory by keeping the nose inside the pro-grade marker, maintain until climb levels out and airspeed is around 400m/s\n\nOnce airspeed is \u003E400m/s begin gentle climb to ~100m/s\n\nAllow speed and climb to accelerate, target is ~1400m/s horizontal and ~150m/s climb as you pass ~22k alt\n\nDo not switch to closed-cycle until thrust is \u003C40 per engine, should be ~28k alt for switch-over\n\nBurn at 20-30 degree AoA until climb is ~300m/s then put nose on or just above prograde marker until desired AP is reached\n\n**Landing**\n\nApprox 1/4 orbit from LZ perform retro-burn until impact is just long of LZ.\n\nKeep trajectory ballistic or slightly nose up\n\nUse AoA and Airbrakes to keep glidepath just long of LZ\n\nWhen LZ is ~30 degrees or more below nose, point straight at it using airbrakes to modulate airspeed\n\nApproach ~100m/s, landing ~60m/s with empty tanks and no cargo.\n\n**Download Here:**\n\n[https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4zLBUio4kInZzA5Z3VnVThjR0k\u0026usp=drive_web\u0026ddrp=1#](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4zLBUio4kInZzA5Z3VnVThjR0k\u0026usp=drive_web\u0026ddrp=1#)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T03:06:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by g00bd0g**"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T02:48:51Z","Content":"Great work!
