Maybe a 3-hour delay due to launchpad cleaning, during which time you could launch from the runway. This would give the player an incentive to explore more of Kerbin, as well as giving the research a little more realism and exhausting it slower. It\u0027d also encourage the player to build more efficient crafts or multiple missions into one launch (such as sending a rover up with a space station core so that when the core has reached its destination the rover can be flown to its destination). The issue is that you can still launch rockets from the runway, and some players would abuse this.
