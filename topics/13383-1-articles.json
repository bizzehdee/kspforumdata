But then I realized some people had models here and there beyond 1000 polygons for a single object. What would the devs like to see as standard? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what about the amount of objects? With animations you need to have more objects, but what is the max limit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I presume that 1024x1024 is max for a texture?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-29T15:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll I can say is that the stock rocket, no matter how huge, has a negligible impact on my FPS.
