by what can fit inside the fairings because they were *designed* with fairings of theur current\u00A0sizes. \u00A0If they had been designed with larger fairings, they could transport less dense cargoes. \u00A0And the MCT is still in the design stage- NOW is when SpaceX is deciding how much volume to make available for cargo...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe MCT currently is designed with a payload capacity of 450 tons. \u00A0350 of those tons (and a certain volume) are dedicated to crew accommodations for 100 people. \u00A0100 remaining tons are\u00A0for cargo. \u00A0Those are the numbers they are currently intending to design around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever it\u0027s easily within limits to expand the design volume of the MCT so that you can have a full 450 tons dedicated to crew accommodations, and enough volume within the aeroshell to allow for that. \u00A0Just the same, you can easily fill an alternate version of that expanded aeroshell with nothing but cargo until you run out of space or run out of mass-budget. \u00A0Guess which limit you\u0027ll bump up against first?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass is the limiting factor by a longshot. \u00A0In the current design, 100 tons of cargo takes\u00A0up maybe 10% of the space of 350 tons of crew accomodations. \u00A0That\u0027s of course with the cargo flat-packed to minimize the mass expended on cargo bay (there\u0027s nothing to say they couldn\u0027t design in a more spacious cargo bay- but all that extra volume incurs extra structural mass from a larger aeroshell), but the fact still stands that cargo is much denser than crew quarters...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a cargo-only MCT, you could easily fit 450, even 1200 or more\u00A0tons of cargo inside the expanded aeroshell (roughly 24% larger than the current preliminary design to allow for a 28% increase in crew capacity- remember that the cargo still occupies volume, even in the current reference\u00A0design).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe true limiting factor would be that you really can\u0027t load much more than the current mass of the tanker on the booster stage and still reach orbit...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that point, you need to load any additional cargo in orbit, or change the distribution of fuel tanks between the upper and booster stages of the MCT so that the upper stage needs pack less Delta-V to reach orbit (this would, however, increase the length of the manned journey to Mars *unless* you made use of a Cycler Ship \u00A0mission architecture...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFully-fueled, it appears the MCT will need to pack between 6.4 and 8 km/s of Delta-V to reach Mars and land on it within 90-150 days, depending on how aggressive of an aerobrake Musk plans to make use of at Mars capture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you *can* reach Mars with as little as 3-4 km/s on a slower trajectory. \u00A0Roughly cutting your Delta-V requirements in half means you could shrink the fuel tanks on the cargo-only MCT and load on extra cargo at launch until you reach the point where, fully-fueled, the cargo MCT packs just enough Delta-V to reach orbit (5.4 km/s with current booster cut-off speeds)\u00A0and weighs about the same as the fuel tanker (about 50 tons more than the crewed MCT), which seems to be about the upper limit of what the booster can boost towards\u00A0orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat extra capacity only used for the tanker is probably to provide the crew with better safety margins and engine-out capability, but you *might* be able to dip into it for cargo MCT\u0027s launched a full transfer window ahead of the crew (if cargo costs will be under $140k/ton, equipment probably won\u0027t be as over-engineered and expensive as current space equipment is, meaning it might\u00A0be affordable to just build equipment in duplicate in case of a launch-failure...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottom-line is this: a crewed/cargo MCT specialization will only save you money in two situations. \u00A0The first is if you are willing to give up some safety-margin on cargo launches so it is only about as reliable as the fuel tanker launches. \u00A0This will net you a roughly\u00A08-11% increase in the amount of cargo you can deliver to Mars for the same number of MCT launches and crew members sent to Mars, more if you build a seperate (smaller) aeroshell for the cargo MCT due to its lower volume requirements than crew. \u00A0But it will cost you in launch failures- so\u00A0it remains to be seen whether this would actually be economical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SECOND is if you are willing to load additional cargo onto cargo-only MCT\u0027s in orbit the same way you\u00A0currently would fuel in the plan Musk presented on. \u00A0In this case, you actually could more than double, perhaps triple the amount of cargo you send to Mars with a given number of MCT\u00A0launches (remember, it takes more than 2x the fuel to obtain 2x the Delta-V, and you could *expand* the fuel tanks on a cargo MCT in this situation as cargo needs less,volume than crew), but of course you would have to engage in orbital cargo-loading operations, and that could get expensive as well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, I am forced to conclude that Musk\u0027s solution of sending crew and cargo together may actually be the optimum balance of R\u0026amp;D costs and long term\u00A0cost-effectiveness. \u00A0An increase in launch failures or the need to load cargo in orbit both eat up most of the cost-savings of sending cargo seperately. \u00A0Meanwhile there are other, lower-hanging fruit for saving money on long-term operations at the expense of higher initial R\u0026amp;D:\u00A0like making use of a lander to ferry crew and cargo down to the Martian surface instead of landing the MCT there...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNorthstar\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T04:36:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just want to recap here. \u00A0A trend is starting to emerge that ideas that I initially thought were great, like cargo-only MCT\u0027s or Cycler Ships will, individually, only yield very small cost-savings (between 8 and 11%) and require, substantial additional R\u0026amp;D investment...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis does *not* mean that these are not good ideas (and some of them are synergistic- providing greater savings when used together: like implementation of cargo/crew seperation and landers/Cyclers). \u00A0Only that they are small optimizations to Musk\u0027s mission architecture that aren\u0027t really worth the R\u0026amp;D investment with the smaller\u00A0scale of launch volume (\u0022only\u0022 a handful of MCT\u0027s every two years) that Musk and any sane person would initially anticipate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceX has probably looked at these ideas as well, and came to similar conclusions. \u00A0That these are optimizations best saved for the day when we are launching thousands of MCT\u0027s a year (if we ever get to that point), and even tiny improvements to cost-effectiveness are worthwhile. \u00A0For the meantime, SpaceX has quite enough on its plate already...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only advice I could give to SpaceX, if they were somehow listening, is to keep these possible future optimizations in mind when designing the MCT now, to make them easier to later implement...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, placing a small docking-port on the MCT capable of crew-transfers will provide the capabilites that are useful today, like being able to make last-minute adjustments to the crew compliment of an MCT, or perform emergency evacuations if the MCT somehow lost its ability to land and were stranded in LEO...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it would *also* pave the way for later implementation of lander or Cycler\u00A0infrastructures, when the cost-savings these provide someday become worth the extra R\u0026amp;D due to the numbers of MCT\u0027s flying each year...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan
