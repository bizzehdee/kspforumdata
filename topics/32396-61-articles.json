This will be useful but I just installed the mod and have not had time to test it. I am not however new to KSP been playing since 0.15 so am a great pilot and dont need a tutorial on how to fly and land this stuff. But what I do need is a written, or a pictorial or a video tutorial on how all this stuff goes together. I have used the Kethane mod before so I know how that works and I have looked at the parts in this mode and get how some of them work as well. But how do the different parts get hooked together. I see you have hoses running all over the place, how did you hook those up would be a good start. I have done better writing than what I am doing here so if I could get a basic explanation I probably could write a tutorial with pics once I got the system down. (don\u0027t have time to write well now my three children are causing havoc)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehm i guess i could write a short tutorial if people are interested. it has to be said though, for this mod i recommend a lot of \u0022tweaking\u0022, like using kethane drills for ore and the like. this is mostly because the vanilla-mod parts are a bit tricky to combine/ and or its much easier to get a working rig with matching 2.5m parts ;-). KAS is an absolute must have, without it your launchpad might get thrown around, KAS lets you fix it to a surface and of course transfer resources like a pro.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcirish3","CreatedById":50775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T10:57:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like I will need a KAS tutorial more than a tutorial for this mod lol.

However, as KhaosCorp says, getting enough science to unlock them isn\u0027t too hard.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently working on designing up some \u0022recipes\u0022 to make EL a little interesting (eg, using MgO, H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO, Cl\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, and a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of electricity to convert CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E into C and O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, and then the C is used to refine FeO\u003Csub\u003En\u003C/sub\u003E. The interesting thing is everything (but the electricity) in the CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E -\u0026gt; C \u002B O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E converter would be recycled, but Mg has other uses, so making things separate could make for more interesting play. Then there\u0027s also Al, Ti, etc \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, once I get some basics sorted out, I might be able to decide on how to spread EL throughout the stock tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow are you planning on determining which parts need what materials?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T03:39:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022skykooler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022skykooler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow are you planning on determining which parts need what materials?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat I have yet to decide, and it\u0027s part of the project, though I think for now (ie, initial stages) I won\u0027t worry about it too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skykooler","CreatedById":60459,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T03:48:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mod is now being maintained by taniwha.
