The reactor uses the same code as the stock ISRU - are you seeing similar behavior from that?\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: Do you have NFE installed?[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nSadly random. I haven\u0026#39;t used any of the ISRUs, so no comment on that regard. I don\u0026#39;t have NFE installed though, but I do have modular fuel tanks (so I can stick xenon tanks in the Mk1-\u0026gt;Mk2 converters). The only difference between this ship and one that works is placement of parts, and even then, the placement differences are so slight it shouldn\u0026#39;t affect anything (RCS, panels, and radiators are the only parts that would be placed differently).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI tested the craft on its launcher to see if the reactor will start on the ground, which it did, oddly enough.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: so I tested it some more: sub-orbital (worked), orbital (worked), and detached from the lifter (worked). Don\u0026#39;t know why two identical craft have different results.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit 2: I managed to somehow reproduce it. I deorbited my lifter, recovered it, and suddenly it stops working on the new one.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit 3: The ship is entirely unmanned, so I\u0026#39;m wondering if that has anything to do with it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit 4: Docked a ship with a pilot and a scientist on it. It failed to start up. I\u0026#39;m going to suspect that it needs an engineer in order to run, which would explain why it would stop once the parent vessel\u0026#39;s crew is recovered. The fact it worked though while unmanned and not connected to any other craft though is puzzling to me.
