The reactor uses the same code as the stock ISRU - are you seeing similar behavior from that?  \n\nEdit: Do you have NFE installed?[/QUOTE]  \n\nSadly random. I haven\u0027t used any of the ISRUs, so no comment on that regard. I don\u0027t have NFE installed though, but I do have modular fuel tanks (so I can stick xenon tanks in the Mk1-\u003EMk2 converters). The only difference between this ship and one that works is placement of parts, and even then, the placement differences are so slight it shouldn\u0027t affect anything (RCS, panels, and radiators are the only parts that would be placed differently).  \n\nI tested the craft on its launcher to see if the reactor will start on the ground, which it did, oddly enough.  \n\nEdit: so I tested it some more: sub-orbital (worked), orbital (worked), and detached from the lifter (worked). Don\u0027t know why two identical craft have different results.  \n\nEdit 2: I managed to somehow reproduce it. I deorbited my lifter, recovered it, and suddenly it stops working on the new one.  \n\nEdit 3: The ship is entirely unmanned, so I\u0027m wondering if that has anything to do with it.  \n\nEdit 4: Docked a ship with a pilot and a scientist on it. It failed to start up. I\u0027m going to suspect that it needs an engineer in order to run, which would explain why it would stop once the parent vessel\u0027s crew is recovered. The fact it worked though while unmanned and not connected to any other craft though is puzzling to me. I\u0027ll test with an engineer tomorrow.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T06:31:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by iospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T07:27:33Z","Content":"What texture are you using for the spike part of the linear aerospike?   \n\nI remove a lot of the stock parts from the game to help save ram because I use a LOT of mods, and it appears I have removed the part that the aerospike pulls it\u0027s texture from unknowingly.  \n\nThank you!
