It would be cool if engines had individual throttle controls by means of a right click menu or an action group setting. This would allow you to put the engine, with the most weight on it, at full throttle while the other engines can be throttled down. I would only think that you would need three sets of these at maximum active at one time. Much how the recover craft menu pops down from the altimeter, you could just have the alternate throttles pop out of the side of the current throttle control once the controls are activated. Switch between one or the other by clicking on the throttle. Or to use both, click on one, then ctrl\u002Bclick on the other, much how selecting multiple parts in stages works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dazhat","CreatedById":59413,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T08:34:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has already been suggested.

The ability to add slightly obscure features that extend the game a bit is exactly why it\u0027s been designed as moddable.
