My guess is that the two engines that are over the door portions are the ones that don\u0027t light while the one that is between doors is ok?. Normally you cant attach things on the door, unless symmetry puts it there. If you can open the doors without blowing the ship up you may be get them lit through activate, but it is not a good idea to build like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T17:20:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI bet you can recover this with a bit of save file editing--I have not looked personally but maybe the \u0027bad\u0027 engines have some kind of state = STOWED (or something like that) that you can edit to be the same as the \u0027good\u0027 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T17:40:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kuzzter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kuzzter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI bet you can recover this with a bit of save file editing--I have not looked personally but maybe the \u0027bad\u0027 engines have some kind of state = STOWED (or something like that) that you can edit to be the same as the \u0027good\u0027 engine.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot quite.
