Developed after accusations that current SRB designs were nothing more than \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctrash cans full \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153o boom\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, the AdvSRB boasts many exciting features:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stackable: Each AdvSRB Segment added to a booster stack increases the thrust of the entire stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Varying Thrust: By carefully shaping the propellant (or modifying the MassFlow floatcurve in the .cfg) you can change how quickly the propellant burns, exchanging burn time for thrust. Have thrust constant, reduce over time, or even decrease before increasing again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Gimbaled Nozzles: Nozzles are gimbaled to help steer vessels. While they have no thrust of their own, their Isp helps determine the thrust for the entire stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fixed Burn Times: If mass flow is fixed at a set time, then how does Isp work? Thrust! Low Isp results in lower thrust than a higher Isp, just like on the fictional world of Earth!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(May be out of date)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to use: Attach as many AdvSRB segments as you would like one on top of the other. The height of the stack determines its thrust. At the bottom of the stack add an AdvSRB Nozzle. Without a nozzle, the segments are useless. The nozzle will only activate through the regular staging process, and its icon is the standard SRB icon. Note that there is no fuel gauge drawn in the staging stack, so you should use the right click \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CT\u002B\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 indicator on the nozzles to determine how long they have been burning. When in the editor, hover your mouse over a nozzle and press the \u0022Home\u0022 key to bring up the editor GUI (hover and \u0022End\u0022 closes it). This advanced GUI will enable you to customize burn profiles in game, without having to have different parts each with a specific burn profile! Symmetry is not yet supported though, so it\u0027s best to make one booster stack to your liking and then engage symmetry. Copy and Paste functionality are per nozzle. While the nozzles provide the GUI, the burn profiles are saved per segment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion v.1 July 1, 2013 Initial Release\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion v.2 July 3, 2013 Update\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion v.3 July 4, 2013 Update\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion v.4 July 20, 2013 Update\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion v.5 September 13, 2013 Update\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion v.6 October 26, 2013 Update\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion v0.7 Alpha December 4, 2014 Initial Limited Release\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BaGOZFV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BaGOZFV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures to be implemented before final release:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Full effects: heat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Engine damage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-How-To guide, on how to develop your own models and parts (specific requirements)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures to be implemented if possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Enabling thrust/delta-V to be read by MechJeb and other popular addons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent known/suspected issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The game may allow you to save while the AdvSRBs are thrusting; I have not tested resuming this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-May not work correctly with mods installed (I think MechJeb and Kerbal Engineer will not evaluate the AdvSRBs correctly)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Segments MUST be placed the correct side up- a possible loop failure may cause the engine to not thrust, MassFlow to be excessive, or both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-B size boosters are very wobbly and prone to breaking apart.

To be honest, when I had started the coding of the part modules, I made the density of the rocket fuel to be similar to the regular solid rocket fuel. But the thrust calculations are based on mass flow rate and the way resources are requested is based on volume units. So I was having a hard time developing the modules while also not screwing up the math (mostly decimal places). Further, I had not been able to find a way to get the density of a type of fuel programmatically, so I was making a mess of things with incorrect unit conversions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think at this point for most users \u0022units of fuel\u0022 is arbitrary in any case. Like when they changed the RCS a few updates ago there was a bit of an issue, but people have adapted to understanding intuitively what one RCS tanks of each size will do in space. For this mod, as there is yet no mechjeb integration; if people want to determine delta-V by hand, knowing that this segment contains 3.75t of fuel is simpler (by a bit at least) than having to subtract loaded mass from dry mass to get the fuel level (though I admit that this is not a huge burden).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the only real reason to use a volume convention is to make parts scaled similarly to each other. But I feel that people who are making mod parts will be okay if I include some \u0022suggested volume per mass\u0022 in that documentation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point between v.2 and v.3 I will probably consider the issue more thoroughly, but at least until I get the burn time calculators running, I will leave things as they are so that they are more intuitive to develop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the density of APCP btw, as that\u0027s basically what I got my Isp range from, so if I do decide to convert the densities I\u0027m likely to use it.

So for a certain amount of propellant, the faster you burn fuel, the higher the thrust generated at the expense of burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple way to think of how fast something burns is based on its surface area being burned. Liquid engines you can think of as having a fixed surface area for combustion, so no matter how much fuel you have, the rate of burning is the same, and therefore thrust doesn\u0027t change. Solid rockets burn fuel all the way to the top of the stage through a hollow channel in the segments.

I had to fight the same fight. ModuleEngines actually handles it all automatically, using thrust and Isp. F = dm Isp g0, so it computes the mass flow from the rated thrust and the specific impulse at the current ambient static pressure. (Wrongly, it turns out, but I\u0027ve got a plugin up that fixes this for people who are bothered by it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it does all the arithmetic to handle propellant flow in a fairly simple way. The density of the fuel mixture is just \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A3 \u00C3\u00C2 f where f is the propellant fraction defined in the ModuleEngines config. So if reactant #1 has a density of 5 metric tons per liter and reactant #2 has a density of 13 metric tons per liter and their ratio is set up in ModuleEngines as 0.60 and 0.40 respectively, then \u00C3\u00C2m = 0.60\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D5 \u002B 0.40\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D13 = 8.2 metric tons per liter. Then it takes dm from the thrust equation (mass per time, so metric tons per second), multiplies by the length in seconds of the current frame (giving us mass), then divides that by \u00C3\u00C2m (mass per volume, so metric tons per liter) to get the total volume of reactants required for that frame. Then it just multiplies that volume by each reactant ratio in turn to get the volume of each reactant to consume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe arithmetic is tedious to get right the first time, yeah, but once you get it right, you never have to worry about it again, because everything that \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E change \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC resources, mixture ratios, reactant densities \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC are all set in config files, and the math is the same as long as you don\u0027t go changing units on people. ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kujuman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kujuman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFurther, I had not been able to find a way to get the density of a type of fuel programmatically, so I was making a mess of things with incorrect unit conversions.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s exposed through an API directly.

Specific impulse is \u003Cem\u003Erelated\u003C/em\u003E to what kind of propellant you use, but it\u0027s also related to the geometry of your rocket nozzle. Remember that F = ve dm \u002B (Pe \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Pa) Ae, and Isp = F / dm g0. In order to make a good choice about what specific impulse to give an engine, you\u0027ve gotta take into account the diameter of the nozzle and the exhaust pressure. The diameter of the nozzle is a constant; it\u0027s part of the 3D model, obviously. And you can make a sensible choice about exhaust pressure by asking yourself what altitude this motor was meant for. For an SRB, an exhaust pressure of half an atmosphere is sensible, because they\u0027re meant to burn during ascent. So in vacuum you\u0027re looking at a pressure thrust component of half an atmosphere applied across the area of your nozzle exit; that \u003Cem\u003Eadds to\u003C/em\u003E the thrust you get from the momentum of your exhaust. At sea level, you\u0027re looking at a pressure thrust component of \u003Cem\u003Eminus\u003C/em\u003E half an atmosphere across your nozzle exist; that \u003Cem\u003Esubtracts from\u003C/em\u003E your momentum thrust. That\u0027s why motors have different specific impulses at sea level and in vacuum in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint of all that is simply to remind you to remember that specific impulse is a function both of propellant and of engine nozzle geometry \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and also that rocket science is fun. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OopsThatNotWork","CreatedById":45740,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T16:12:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm interested as long as the texture changes lol.

Also contains a parachute for safe splashdowns downrange!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Gimbaled Nozzles: Nozzles are gimbaled to help steer vessels. While they have no thrust of their own, their Isp helps determine the thrust for the entire stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Custom Resource: KSF_SRfuel does not flow, cannot be pumped, and burns evenly through the entire stack. Here at Kerbal Science Foundation we value your sanity, so 1 unit of this resource weighs 1mass unit. Easy! And no more will \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSRBs\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 be able to use fuel lines\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6you know who you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fixed Burn Times: If mass flow is fixed at a set time, then how does Isp work? Thrust! Low Isp results in lower thrust than a higher Isp, just like on the fictional world of Earth!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to use: Attach as many AdvSRB segments as you would like one on top of the other. The height of the stack determines its thrust. At the bottom of the stack add an AdvSRB Nozzle. Without a nozzle, the segments are useless. The nozzle will only activate through the regular staging process, and its icon is the standard SRB icon. Note that there is no fuel gauge drawn in the staging stack, so you should use the right click \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CT\u002B\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 indicator on the nozzles to determine how long they have been burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rUIOoJd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rUIOoJd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mass flow of the new booster segment A3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion v.1 July 1, 2013 Initial Release\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion v.2 July 3, 2013 Update\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion v.3 July 4, 2013 Update\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew Features\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Added sound and visual effects-they scale with thrust output\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Added 3 new action groupable actions to nozzles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Ignite: Starts the AdvSRB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Abort: drops Isp to 1/15 of \u0022normal\u0022 value, simulating an abort mode where the throat is blown out to drastically reduce chamber pressure (it might be realistic...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Separation Gimbal: Will attempt to gimbal engine 3deg (towards the red arrow at the bottom of the nozzle) to aid in booster separation (this is kinda iffy right now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBug fixes/tweaks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Fixed Isp not being correctly calculated for first 1km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Right click menu is now formatted\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l4y3HULl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022l4y3HULl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures to be implemented before final release:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Full effects: heat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Engine damage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Additional Booster Sizes and burn configurations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-How-To guide, on how to develop your own models and parts (specific requirements)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures to be implemented if possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Enabling thrust/delta-V to be read by MechJeb and other popular addons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent known/suspected issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The game may allow you to save while the AdvSRBs are thrusting; I have not tested resuming this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-May not work correctly with mods installed (I think MechJeb and Kerbal Engineer will not evaluate the AdvSRBs correctly)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Segments MUST be placed the correct side up- a possible loop failure may cause the engine to not thrust, MassFlow to be excessive, or both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the pack is still in development, do not rely upon parts to remain available or function the same way after an update.
