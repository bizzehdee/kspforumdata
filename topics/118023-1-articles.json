The plan was to land on Ike, mine ore, and then leave for Kerbin when the tanks became full. I did this manoeuvre with Minmus on the way out. However, I can\u0027t seem to land on Ike - the craft lithobrakes at roughly 100 m/s every time.\n\nWhat is the most fuel-efficient way for a given craft (I can\u0027t rebuild it on Duna for obvious reasons) to travel from Duna to Ike and not crash? (My landing site is about 6 degrees below the Dunar equator if that helps)."},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T13:17:51Z","Content":"There are 3 main maneuvers to get from Duna to Ike: takeoff, transfer, and landing.\n\nTakeoff\n\nSince Duna\u0027s atmosphere is so thin, you don\u0027t need to gain a lot of altitude before pitching over.
