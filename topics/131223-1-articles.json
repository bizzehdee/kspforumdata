Also, V-tails are always problematic, especially V-tails made from little wing and control surfaces instead of an all moving tail. You\u0027re asking two tails (or even worse, two small control surfaces on two tails) to do the job of three with a rather unsophisticated fly-by-wire control that is KSP SAS, so avoid v-tail at all cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly are your horizontal stabilizers made from four control surfaces, two of which is back to front relative to their normal orientation?
