I run the game through steam, so the first thing I tried was validating the game cache, which did indeed find and replace one bad file, but the error reoccurred about three or four hours of play later. I\u0027m not certain what causes it, as by the time I\u0027m aware something has gone wrong I\u0027m most of the way through a launch completing contract objectives. Validating the cache continues to be an effective band-aid, but it\u0027s real irritating to have to drop out and fix the game in order to finish a mission.\u003Ca href=\u0022https://pastebin.com/8uATsuZG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E Pastebin here\u003C/a\u003E of (what appears to be) the relevant part of the\u00A0log the last time this happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running windows 10 64-bit build 16299, though on reflection I think I have not been selecting the option to launch KSP in 64 bit mode.
