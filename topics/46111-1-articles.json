It does mean that you windup hauling hardware to the target that you don\u0027t necessarily need, but easier logistics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETargets with larger delta-V transfer requirements may also need a \u0022service\u0022 stage, an intermediate piece that sits between the drive and the lander for the sole purpose of providing extra fuel. This may or may not be advisable depending on your docking port setup; definitely don\u0027t add a service stage if all you\u0027ve got is a medium-sized clamp-o-tron for docking on both ends unless you like wobbly ships. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy own interplanetary fleet was wiped with 0.21, but in 0.20 I had six craft. I\u0027ve been slowly building it back up in 0.21 (been spending too much time on challenges) and I\u0027ve got a series of interplanetary drive designs at this point (the Thunderbolt 7 series). The latest addition to the fleet is the Thunderbolt Very Heavy 7, which successfully flew for the first time on Friday - it\u0027s a large probe-core with a large batt and two medium solar panels, a RCS tank with a hell of a lot of blocks, a Jumbo64, 6 outboard X200-32 tanks connected to the main tank with fuel lines, and seven LV-Ns. The thrust sucks (particularly since the centerline NERVA tends to overheat to critical) but unloaded she gets 11,000 m/s of delta-V.
