So finaly can play with all the belowed ones... \n\nBUT as soon as I start this way my \u0022fullscreen\u0022 feature is lost.\n\nEither have to play in a \u0022frameless window\u0022 Which DO have frame therefore in FullHD It is covering more space my monitor can handle. Therefore I cannot see 10% of the navball. not to mention I cannot open it up in map view.\n\nI do not like the concept of playing in the second available size something like 1700x980 or such. \n\nAt full screen I get a bottom left quarter of the screen only. So barely can see the 1/3 of the main menu. \n\nIs that a correctly working method of forcing opengl with a real full screen? \n\nI already tried messing with the launchers confugration capabilities even settings inside the game. \n\nTried alt\u002Bentering back and forth. \n\nI\u0027ve got almost the latest gaming rig awailable: 780gtx gef 16gb ram, I7 latest proc. latest driver updated with gef experience automatically.\n\nA windows 7 64bit.\n\nPlaying on KSP 32bit unfortunatelly as 64 is not supported by the best mods...\n\nI THINK this bug is not a mod related issue, but didn\u0027t tested it. \n\nI do write here because I have a heavy modded install. (best, tested, common mods only all v0.90 fully compatible except B9aero)\n\nSo think I can not getting official support on this.\n\nAnd maybe someone has had the same annoying bug and know some workaround. Or just know rendering techniques or windows better than me, and have a solution.\n\nThank you in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T13:59:22Z","Content":"have you tried \u0022 -force-opengl -popupwindow \u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T14:05:17Z","Content":"Unity3D seems to have changed their fullscreen behaviour prior to 0.90.0, fullscreen mode does not take over the graphics adapter any more and instead we get a \u0022fullscreen window\u0022, this is better when alt\u002Btabbing between Unity3D applications such as KSP and other applications.\n\nYou can find the [**Unity3D command line arguments here**](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html) by the way."},{"CreatedByName":"Ricardo79","CreatedById":128863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T14:15:00Z","Content":"OOoHHHH YEAH ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThanks both of you.
