A couple more things to bear in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Keep the front of your rocket streamlined. Drag on the front of rocket = bad, drag on the back = not so bad. The front end should be smooth, pointy, and not have radially-attached stuff sticking out. If you need to put up something very draggy and awkward-shaped, consider putting a fairing around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Really, really don\u0027t go too fast too low. (This is different from pre-1.0, which had very different aero rules.) Aerodynamic drag spikes upward dramatically when you pass Mach 1, which is a bit over 300 m/s at sea level and gets faster at higher elevations. A good rule of thumb, keep it under 300 m/s until you get up to 10 km altitude, then floor it. Going too fast too low is bad for two reasons: First, the extra drag means you\u0027re wasting a lot of fuel. Second, the dramatically increased aero forces mean that if your rocket has any tendency towards instability, it will get drastically magnified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest, easiest thing to do is to add fins to the bottom of the rocket, as far down as possible. If that doesn\u0027t work, use bigger fins.

Reason:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Decouplers are not fuel-crossfeed-capable. Therefore, if you have a rocket with a top stage, then a decoupler, then a bottom stage: the bottom-stage engine won\u0027t (can\u0027t!) drain any fuel from the top stage, and will drain fuel from the bottom tank only. (Which actually helps stability, since that will move the CoM upward.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you have a single tall tank, it doesn\u0027t drain the \u0022top of the tank first\u0022-- KSP has no concept of mass distribution within a fuel tank, it just lowers the overall mass of the tank while leaving the tank\u0027s CoM in the same place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, the moral of the story:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Try to avoid stacks of in-line tanks if you can. It\u0027s better to have one tall tank than several small tanks stacked one atop another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you have to have a stack of tanks, be aware of this drain-from-the-top-down issue, and deal with it (for example, as Mastikator suggests).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
