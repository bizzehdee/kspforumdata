Of course such a feat would be most terrifying so I don\u0027t think I will attempt it soon. Those silly scientists did require that it have a number of \u0027sensors\u0027 on it, but they also agreed to add a remote control unit so that on days when my vertigo is acting up I can just fly it from the ground.

It\u0027s not perfect but is a marked improvement over the Albatross while retaining most of it\u0027s unique design that makes it look just amazing and really interesting. In fact back when I first got the full game in 0.18 the first stock plane I flew was the Albatross because it was just so interesting looking. Even back then I realized it was pretty bad so I immediately tried to make an improved design while retaining the character. So thank you for a competition that finally inspired me to go back and finish that dream!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ojimak","CreatedById":57539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T17:19:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gm537\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gm537\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EExcerpt from Bob Kerman\u0027s Diary: \u0022I must say am very happy with the Kalbatross. While I was very worried about building some new contraption I had gotten quite fed up with almost dying every time I flew that \u0027Albatross 3\u0027 that Jeb designed. This new one has only one engine to make it slower, so that Jeb won\u0027t want to steal it, and the engineers say it will still fly all the way around Kerbin. Of course such a feat would be most terrifying so I don\u0027t think I will attempt it soon. Those silly scientists did require that it have a number of \u0027sensors\u0027 on it, but they also agreed to add a remote control unit so that on days when my vertigo is acting up I can just fly it from the ground. Neat! Having flown it a bunch, and even getting in once, I really appreciate the increased maenuever... turniness, and the amazing brakes!

Roll, pitch and yaw are all slow but very easy to control, and she resists going into a spin quite strongly. I\u0027m quite proud of her take-offs - so far as I can tell she is literally impossible to tail strike. I found that the best way to circumnavigate with her was to climb at 45 degrees until about 20000m, and then aim down to 10 degrees, 4x timewarp and balance the throttle on the intake air. When the nose hits 30 degrees, come out of timewarp and point it back down to 10 degrees. Conveniently, this is also the perfect time to hit full throttle again! She \u0027bounces\u0027 off about 27-28km in high-altitude flight. She is not a slow aircraft - over 1000m/s all the way around Kerbin. Landing was the easiest I\u0027ve ever done - it was a pleasure. She\u0027s a very laid-back aircraft which will just keep going if you let go of everything - even with SAS off - the upswept wings take care of that. Flameouts are no problem with the single central engine. The SAS module is right in the centre of mass, so it has plenty of influence. You can slam on the brakes from 60m/s without killing the pilot - though she might tip. The wide undercarriage makes for good stability. And for final proof of her noob-proof-ness: This was my first ever circumnavigation!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E - Is she time acceleration proof?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4x warp with no negative impacts.
