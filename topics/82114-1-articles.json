In this version I tried to make somewhat relevant part costs but honestly the cost of fuel far outweighs the part costs. I also added some new fairings as well as a fairing mounting plate for payloads. The previous version of Sea dragon used 13.75 meter parts but I upped the scale to 15 meters to make it more realistic in Kerbal scale. The parts have similar stats since the last version but they have all been completely remodeled and re textured. The second stage pressure fed Mjolnir got increased thrust, as well as the vernier engines which are now more powerful than mainsails and look much better than the old ones IMO. The textures are a bit bad in some places and the collision meshes are rough on the engines, but I think this is a big improvement over the last version! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gNw2C\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I made the mastodon more efficient because the actual design specified a turbopump fed engine, while the upper stage (mjolnir) was to be a giant pressure fed design. Turbopumps are pretty much always more efficient, they are however much more complicated, expensive and have a ton of moving parts that can fail. The upper stage was designed for simplicity and safety I\u0027m assuming, as there is no gimbal or complicated turbopumps to fail.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T22:02:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDownloading to see what changed, new models look good.

Enabling surface attachment for parts which are not supposed to be surface-attached (vernier engines, fairings) makes it harder to position them correctly while serving no clear purpose. I would suggest you disable it for these parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. In KSP the strength of attachment nodes is derived from their size. Given how large your parts are, their attachment nodes should probably be much larger than they currently are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. It would be nice if the fairings decoupled to the sides instead of to the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t take this criticism too hard, my intention here is to help improve this already very interesting mod.
