It is in development, so we cannot expect everything we want now. Which is fine with me, because many mods fill in these gaps. Some just add fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also understand that people often request these things implemented into the game. I do it too. However, as we know, some features will not be implemented into the game, others are planned, and even more haven\u0027t been thought of by the devs yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, while many people play stock, that is not for me, because of said mods. Take mechjeb and kethane. Kethane gives me a way to make it home from a mission in different ways (say, without orbital rendezvous) and mechjeb lets me launch a rocket (that I\u0027ve launched manually a thousand times before) without being there, so I can do whatever else I fancy at the given moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings me to my concern: stock players seem to abhor the idea of getting handy little mods to do the things they want, and hope the devs implement these things into the game, or ask for them. Is there something that we aren\u0027t seeing that you do from way up there on your horse? The things you want, for the most part ALREADY EXIST. Why would you ask for them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially parts. Have you not seen the hundreds of part packs that fill any deficiency you could possible imagine in the game? Get one before you complain the game is missing something. Plugin you think should be in the game? Maybe you should GET IT rather than asking the devs to put it in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, somethings might not have mods. But, mods can be created much more quickly than the devs can respond to your deepest wishes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how could you see something wrong with mods? They make up for deficiencies NOW rather than waiting and complaining. They add functions that may or may not even ever make it into the game. They give you new options for gameplay, and you don\u0027t even need to add any extra parts. Some just do handy little tricks like show you a landing prediction, or add faster time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods, in my opinion, ARE the game, and I have found that after playing without, I do not enjoy the game nearly as much as with mods. There isn\u0027t even a satisfaction for me from carrying out rarely successful missions for anyone with only stock parts. Limiting yourself because someone else has it that way is naive and senseless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf mods do what you want, and you play stock, you have no real complaint. You are only limiting yourself, waiting for things that may never happen to the stock game, and in the process annoying the hell out of everyone who has ever used or created a mod that does exactly what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T20:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Squad developers have deliberately opened up KSP to modders, this was not some afterthought, Felipe and the rest know that a game with modding support and a strong modding community can be a greater game than it could be without.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some reasons why players might eschew addons though, compatibility of craft files and saves with other players is one, the challenge of accomplishing flights with a restricted feature set is another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddons can allow just about anything to be added to the game, and some do see them as a means to \u0022cheat\u0022, despite KSP\u0027s (currently) single player status and the fact that many addons exist that make the game harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople should remember that the way they derive pleasure from KSP, and indeed from other games, is not the same as the next player, who finds other things fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u0027re\u003C/em\u003E having fun, then that\u0027s great, but there\u0027s no need to dictate to others how they should enjoy KSP, stock or modded, it doesn\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly your own flight, and let others fly theirs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xetalim","CreatedById":64539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T20:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I agree with this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WillHop","CreatedById":67486,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T20:13:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour view is understandable, and I also play with mods on my save because I think it makes it more fun, but there\u0027s no need to start the stock vs mod war, there are enough arguments about Mechjeb alone.

RT2 introduces both the neccessity of a working satellite relay and a control delay which makes stuff like unmanned landings more difficult. Or the Life Support Mods, which introduce basically an additional layer of resource management. Or Deadly Reentry, which can make aerobraking/reentry with big vessels really interesting. Also, most of this is configurable, so one can choose his/her own difficulty.
