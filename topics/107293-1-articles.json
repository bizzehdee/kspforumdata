This got me into a situation I don\u0027t quite understand ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI want to develop an addon which communicates with a REST service on a server. The server is written in nodejs and responds with json formatted data. To test the communication without always waiting on KSP to start up I wrote a separate little console application and everythings works great.\n\nNow moving to an actual KSP addon I get an exception and the confusion starts:\n\n[Exception]: FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly \u0027System.Runtime.Serialization, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089\u0027 or one of its dependencies.\n\nI use the DataContractJsonSerializer type to (de-)serialize json data, which is causing the CLR to look for the System.Runtime.Serialization assembly. Looking at KSP\\_Data\\Managed I realized that this assembly is in fact missing.\n\nWhat are my options from here?\n\nMono has an implementation of this assembly but I don\u0027t know in what version of Mono it was added and I also can\u0027t find out what version of Mono KSP (1.0.2) or Unity (4.6.4f1) is using.\n\nThanks for any help.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nlol, right after posting this I found a working solution, but I\u0027m not quite sure if it is the \u0022correct\u0022 or best solution:\n\n- Compile against the .NET Framework 3.5 not 4.0 because the DataContractJsonSerializer was moved from System.ServiceModel.Web to System.Runtime.Serialization in 4.0.\n\n- Copy System.ServiceModel.Web.dll and System.Runtime.Serialization.dll from Mono to KSP\\_Data\\Managed. I copied it from my Unity installation from: Unity\\Editor\\Data\\Mono\\lib\\mono\\2.0\n\nI am still confused by what version of Mono is used and what version of the .NET framework that relates to."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T22:26:23Z","Content":"Mono 2.x heavily patched by unity.
