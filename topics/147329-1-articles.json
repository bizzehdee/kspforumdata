It is simple for command pods but for anything else, its trial and error. One time in a career mode game I built a re-usable booster stage. I had no idea of how many parachutes I would need so I put on twelve chutes. When the booster was returning from space, half of the parachutes burned off in reentry heating. Lucky I put on twice the number of parachutes I needed so I still recovered the stage. But imagine that I had not enough\u00A0chutes?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir_Fanch","CreatedById":165732,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-09T09:42:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest both RealChute and StageRecovery, AFAIK they are both currently working, but I haven\u0027t loaded up my KSP in a couple of weeks. RealChute will give you modifiable parachutes and far more options of deployment, and StageRecovery will tell you roughly the touchdown speed of a stage if the parachutes are deployed correctly (NOTE: If you\u0027re burning your\u00A0parachutes up it is most likely you are deploying them too early, when the air density is too little for them too work, but high enough that friction with the air molecules causes the re-entry burning).
