It\u0027s just adding in lines between the points. That\u0027s still three dimensional. Unless four dimensions is the line itself...?\n\nThat\u0027s where our 3D-accustomed brains stop understanding. Take a look at the #dim part of the picture. There are dimensions X, Y and Z represented as axes in 3D space, each one of them perpendicular to all the other ones. You can define a position of a point in this space with 3 numbers (coordinates).\n\nBut, when we add the fourth dimension, W, it has to be perpendicular to all the other dimensions as well. And that cannot be truly represented in a 3D space (we ran out of 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angles we can use), much less in a 2D space of that picture. Mathematically, you just add the fourth coordinate, and everything is fine. But visualising it is really hard.\n\nIt\u0027s the same thing as trying to truly represent a 3D cube on paper, just one dimension higher. You can\u0027t really represent a cube on paper, because you are only working in a 2D space. The picture only has width and height, but no depth (each pixel only has X and Y coordinates). Your brain can somewhat visualise how the cube looks like in 3D, but that\u0027s only because of percieved perspective and because it knows how a cube really looks like - the picture itself is still only 2D. (EDIT: So not only the fourth example, even the third example is kinda... wrong. In a sense that it is trying to represent something it can\u0027t)\n\nNow try to imagine the 3D cube represented in 1D space. You probably can\u0027t, and neither can I. Just like the 4D tesseract in a 2D space. (The gif gives an illusion of a 3D space, and there the 4D tesseract actually looks kinda decent - just like the 3D cube on a 2D paper).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T02:50:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 02:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deutherius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T03:02:45Z","Content":"Wouldn\u0027t 4d just be a change in 3d? \n\nAdding lines connecting all the points doesn\u0027t really add a dimension.
