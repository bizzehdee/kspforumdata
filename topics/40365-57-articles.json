WOW! I haven\u0027t tried this (haven\u0027t had the time to DL and test yet. Definitely going to) but it looks fantastic! The effort put in and the variety resulting from all this looks very impressive. Unfortunately I missed this mod.

I feared when I made the mod that the fact that I was including a warp drive would put people off and make people dismiss it. There was never a real plan to creating this other than to add some kind of path to the future of space travel in Kerbal Space program, technologies that are either realistic or at least have some kind of scientific basis to them, even if we really have no idea at this stage if they can actually work - the alcubierre drive is a good example of that. It has grown fairly organically from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Patupi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Patupi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know science is an upcoming project in the stock 0.22 that\u0027s due... whenever, but the science upgrades in this might be done more like a traditional tech tree with some minor modification. I take it you still have to click \u0027upgrade\u0027 on a component to upgrade it to a new version? Why not move this functionality to the science lab itself?\u003Cp\u003EIE a lab would now have two buttons. One \u0027Upgrade science facility\u0027 and \u0027Upgrade components\u0027. The first would use science accrued, and basically would make the lab the \u0027next level\u0027. How many levels it should have would be a good question. The second button would display a second menu with a list of components the lab could upgrade. Along side each item would be a \u0027highlight\u0027 button that would make the actual item highlighted in the same manner (perhaps a different color?) as when you move the mouse cursor over it. That way you could tell which of the vessels currently docked to the science facility you are affecting. Next to this button for each item on the list would be multiple \u0027upgrade buttons\u0027. (EDIT:forgot to add, if the science facility isn\u0027t high enough for this tech this upgrade would be grayed out)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple? Why start with antimatter reactors being able to be built from scratch? It\u0027s rather advanced tech after all. Start with something else that could be upgraded to antimatter (a specialist reactor? Maybe inertial confinement fusion? Barely believable that that could be upgraded to an antimatter reactor) Basically any item could be upgraded to it\u0027s next option (nuclear reactor Mk1 to Mk2) or to something else (nuclear reactor Mk1 to Toroidal Fusion Mk1... yeah, not a good choice. Totally different tech, but you get the idea). Thus a tech tree of sorts is born. Not every thing would have multiple options, but anything you think would be too advanced for Kerbalkind to start with could be put as an upgrade on an existing piece of equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis component upgrading could use a second resource (development rather than science? As in Research and Development) or could be time based. IE when you click \u0027upgrade\u0027 to whatever you have chosen it changes to something else, a default \u0027non functional\u0027 version of the unit to represent the ongoing work. Then, as long as the component stays docked to the science lab, it will be upgraded after a fixed span of time. At the end of the time it would be replaced by the finished item.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping that in 0.22, I will be able to create some new tech nodes and basically expand the research tree to include these technologies.

Since I\u0027m comitted to having rocket engines that actually don\u0027t require more energy than they consume, I\u0027m constrained by an absolute limit on the performance of the nuclear rockets.

Alternatively I can mail you privately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-G\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS - in the meantime, before I figure out how to post spreadsheets, suggest the following as ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, thermal rocket mass = 6 is a major area where you are unfairly hurting performance. its drastically hindering T/W ratio of small reactors. The 0.625 reactor is just pathetic. Simplest method of fixing it is set the weights to zero and purely govern the performance of the NTR by the reactor (which you are essentially doing now). My modded values take this step. However, there is a nicer more elegant solution I\u0027m still playing with. However, its a hard code thing you would have to implement, I can\u0027t do it by moding your part values. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the idea is you modify the thermal rocket part such that its weight covers the size of the expansion cone, but more importantly, includes the heat exchangers and pumps moving the reaction mass past the hot reactor coolant. So, basically small thermal rocket parts weigh much much less than big thermal rocket parts, BUT they are limited in the amount of thermal power they can pump through them at once. So you put some value into the thermal rocket part that is equivallent to a throttable fuel flow rate (the way chemical rockets work in ksp) where the \u0027fuel\u0027 is thermal power. The rocket part can only throttle up so high based upon whatever value you give it in that field in the part description. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically if you hook up a 0.625 size jet to a 3.5 size reactor, it can only move (in your current setup) 1.125 thermal power through it, irrespective of the fact that the reactor has 1500 thermal power to spare. That limits its thrust. But it weighs alot less. So little rockets using little reactors still have reasonable thrust to mass ratios, and everything is self consistent.Also, if you do the same thing with generators (use thermal power to run them, and throttle them), then hooking a big rocket and a big generator to a single reactor means you can run your rocket full throttle or your generator full throttle but not both.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-09T01:07:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2013 01:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Seyvern\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jakedasnake","CreatedById":84878,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T00:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I try to use the thermal turbojet, the \u0022active\u0022 animation is running even when the engine is deactivated, and will flame out immediately flame-out no matter how many air intakes I have.

Let\u0027s say we decided to scale things based on the stock NERVA in terms of T/W, we\u0027d need to up the power output of some of the reactor sizes by more than 10x in order to do this. Often, power generating nuclear reactors in space are often sitting around the 1MW/ton mark but scaling up fairly rapidly with increased mass, so those are the sort of values that we see for the small nuclear reactors in the mod but the big ones scale up to much larger values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I really need a solution that isn\u0027t just changing thrust values because that neccessarily entails changing reactor powers (by a lot).

Or is there no Science done around Kerbol because it\u0027s a star and not a physical planet?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoneyFox","CreatedById":19237,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T02:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have some codes for sun sail... and I\u0027m thinking if i can share that to you so that you can consider merge that into your mod package?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T02:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have some codes for sun sail... and I\u0027m thinking if i can share that to you so that you can consider merge that into your mod package?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d definitely be interested to take a look, I was considering coding up a solar sail but thought it might be tricky to put in due to the huge solar sails needed to get a decent thrust going.

Everything in the mod conserves energy, I think it\u0027s really important to maintain that distinction when we have so many things that are actually depedent upon power and energy in the mod. I very much doubt the Kerbal universe doesn\u0027t conserve energy so in this respect upping the reactor energies is better, we know Kerbal stuff is dense, so we can fairly safely do this a bit. If we up it too much though, let\u0027s say we did increase everything by 10x, where do we put the antimatter stuff then? Do we have a 3.5m antimatter reactor that generates over 1TW and consequently have an engine with say 3.16*more thrust and 3.16* more isp? If we leave antimatter where it is, it\u0027s still better than the fission components but where do we put fusion parts? There is no gap anymore.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what do we do with the DT vista, which can now be powered by a much smaller unupgraded reactor?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is, the nuclear parts don\u0027t exist in a vacuum. Any change to them affects everything else in the mod in a really complicated chain reaction of dependent interactions. I could fix this by basically rebalancing every number in the mod to some arbitrary value but I\u0027m not so interested in this approach, one of the things I\u0027m really interested in is reading some papers about emerging propulsion technologies and basing some calculations off what I discover and putting them into the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not completely blind to gameplay concerns, I do plenty of scaling here and there for the sake of making things work. Magnetic field antiparticle trapping is probably one of the things I\u0027ve scaled up the most from real life but this has the advantage of being a lone mechanic with nothing else depending upon it, that gives me so much more flexibility to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of thermal rockets, I can\u0027t really just tweak the values without messing everything else up, so I look for an alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t feel compelled that the antimatter reactors all start solid core, since this is a more advanced technology than the nuclear reactors. The idea was that giving a selection of reactors would let you have control over the kind of performance you wanted, so if you wanted ludicrous thrust for some reason, you could use 8 small reactors with 8 rockets while 1 medium reactor and 1 medium rocket gives you a different profile and again 1 large reactor and 1 large rocket gives you a third different thrust profile. Obviously this is a bit hampered by the mass of the thermal rockets but hopefully you see what I was going for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eok figured out the spreadsheet thing. google docs to the rescue. Here is a possible solution, can\u0027t tell if you will like it or not, but it conserves energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, lets start with the spreadsheet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AstvgPENUcE2dE1Ca2xnWGNvQkVKOGtfRU1RUUY3Tmc\u0026amp;single=true\u0026amp;gid=0\u0026amp;output=pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AstvgPENUcE2dE1Ca2xnWGNvQkVKOGtfRU1RUUY3Tmc\u0026amp;single=true\u0026amp;gid=0\u0026amp;output=pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AstvgPENUcE2dE1Ca2xnWGNvQkVKOGtfRU1RUUY3Tmc\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AstvgPENUcE2dE1Ca2xnWGNvQkVKOGtfRU1RUUY3Tmc\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you check out that spreadsheet, you notice what I\u0027m doing is altering the \u0027engineering efficiency\u0027 of big reactors vs. small ones. End result, all the NTR\u0027s have thrust to weight ratios that range from ~19 to 29 (bigger ones are more efficient TWR). They range in power output from 16MW to 3500 MW (for solid core reactors) and are therefore within the range that you were using within a factor of 2. And they conserve energy between reaction thrust and energy generation. Notes are embedded in the spreadsheet. You could change the exponent coefficients to tweak the values, obviously. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t mess with AM but you could do the same thing there to the same purpose. And, as much as I\u0027ve read up on NTRs, i have no idea what the actual engineering effiincies are in scaling up or down reactors, so for all I know, these might be relatively accurate \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (aside from the fact that the Thrust to weight ratios are all hosed compared to real life, but thats stock!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Seyv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS playing with the relative mass ratios between reactors and heat exchangers, and you can get some cool effects there if you make the exponents slightly different. Might bed worth exploring. IRL\u0026lt; im not sure what the relative \u0027mass\u0027 ratio is between the machinery associated with the reactor and that of the heat exchanger. I suspects its pretty close to 1:1, perhaps even with the heat exchanger equipment coming in with more mass than the reactor.

Solar Sail in RL needs to have massive size, much larger than VAB. Currently I\u0027m simply using a 10x rescaled Comm-88 antenna model (it\u0027s still very small) with some over-powered parameters to make it work. It can generate 1.0kN thrust when facing directly towards the sun. The solar sail also has a magnet-sail mode (yeah I know it\u0027s actually quite a different thing, but well...), which will consume electric charge to accelerate/deflect particles around to gain additional thrust. To make it useful, the thrust was around 3~4kN IIRC, of course on LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll push the code onto some open source-code base later and will PM you the address. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gmeine921","CreatedById":68886,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T03:25:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Erandom idea, would it be possible to add in the dangers of a nuclear accident. ie, some big freaking explosion if say a nuclear reactor happened to be on a craft that met an unfortunate end. probably something difficult to add, but an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
