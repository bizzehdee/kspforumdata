So I had a thought and I\\\u0027m sorry if someone had thought of this already but what about having a kind of sub-sections or version specific sections for add-ons such as one being titled something like \u0027version .14 compatible updates\u0027 and \u0027.15 compatible updates\u0027 and so on. This was just a thought I had while browsing the add-ons page. It\\\u0027s not a big deal I just thought that it would make it a little easier to find updates. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T01:04:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually not a bad idea, myself personally would love to see an add-on repository, like the repo\\\u0027s available in most Linux distributions, with a built-in mod enabler as part of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have gotten used to the Ubuntu updater telling me when a new version of a particular piece of software is available, and have become lazy when it comes to checking the programs site directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blinkin","CreatedById":6248,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T13:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would love something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA updater that would notify you about new version including a summary and a change log would be perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bit like how Wordpess handles updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
