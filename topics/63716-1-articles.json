Perfluorocarbons are better greenhouse gases than CO2 by factors of 10^3-4 when present in the right mixtures. Once enough are released to also release some of the trapped CO2, the Co2 will add to it independently causing a runaway greenhouse effect. This effect will peak twice throughout the process, the first being the CO2 release stage, and the second being the stage at which some of the Polar ice begins to melt. The ice-melt will boil rapidly and produce water vapor, which is actually a very effective greenhouse gas in its own right. The ultimate effect of this could by massive increases in atmospheric pressures and possibly lakes and seas of liquid water, opening the way to biological introduction and Gaea-type stabilization.
