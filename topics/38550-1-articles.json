It looks like rockets won\u0027t use RCS for rotation now, is that correct? With RCS on, when i press Q/E, the ship is slow to respond and there\u0027s no resource drain on Monopropellant or visualization of RCS thrusters firing. WASD still works for pitch/yaw, but it looks like roll is not working. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Can someone verify?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: scratch that. It looks like there is a very small drain on Monopropellant, but no visualization and the effect is very weak. Flying a large rocket is almost like flying one in 0.20.2 with no RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-24T20:48:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2013 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sardonyx\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T20:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have fine control on?

The Yaw/Pitch controls seem to use double the amount of Monopropellant when activated and the ship moves effectively. The Roll is just very sluggish and no there\u0027s no visual indication from the RCS thrusters that they\u0027re firing, but the Monopropellant usage does go up slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you know the keys for fine control on / off?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"draeath","CreatedById":25709,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T21:14:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECapslock, by default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook bottom-right, if you have red/orange ticks your in coarse mode, green/blue ticks mean fine mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sardonyx","CreatedById":74982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T21:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022draeath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022draeath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECapslock, by default.\u003Cp\u003ELook bottom-right, if you have red/orange ticks your in coarse mode, green/blue ticks mean fine mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re referring to the YPR ticks?
