If an engine is not burning, it is not paying for its own weight. Of course it\u0027s not possible or even always advisable for every engine to be firing, but you always want to minimize the dead weight you\u0027re carrying. So burn all the engines in your example at launch, but there\u0027s an additional trick most players use, which is to run fuel lines from the outer tanks to the inner one. The outer engines will run out of fuel sooner and you can eject their weight sooner, leaving the middle engine to keep going with a topped-off tank. This is the \u0022asparagus\u0022 staging you will hear people taking about, because the clustered columns of tanks once reminded somebody or other of a thingy of asparagus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. There are many ways to carry rovers, and it mostly depends on the size of the rover. For a big one, it might make sense to build is as a lander-with-wheels, whereas small ones can be conveniently dropped off the bottoms of little descent rockets. Some players do like to build shells around them, but in the current version of the game, there\u0027s no benefit to this and it\u0027s just for looks. In fact, it makes the rover heavier, and is counter-productive, which doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t be fun to do anyway. As CamelotKing524 says, it\u0027s also possible to mount them in pairs on either side of a landing ship, which neatly avoids the problem of trying to balance an asymmetrical rover on a symmetrical rocket. But while I have used this approach at times as well, don\u0027t forget that it does mean doubling the payload weight, which requires the whole rocket to be proportionally larger. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Once the outer engines turn off (which\u0027ll happen when their tanks run dry), you stage, and now the inner tank (which\u0027ll still be full) takes you to orbit. Now, I said \u0022usually\u0022; there are a few exceptions to this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn one hand, there\u0027s no point in having a ridiculously high thrust at the start, since you\u0027ll be limited by atmospheric drag. Go too fast, and you\u0027ll just be wasting energy offsetting the drag. So, depending on your design, it might be better to leave the center engine turned off until the outer engines shut off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, one of the nice things about outer tanks is that they give you a good stable place to attach struts when lifting an awkward payload (like a space station or big rovers). Separating them in-atmosphere is, therefore, a bad thing; an empty fuel tank has only 1/9th its original mass, so depending on your design it might be better to just leave them on, empty. (Or, don\u0027t put the fuel lines across, so that the outer engines continue to burn all the way up.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on the gripping hand, asparagus setups require a lot of struts and such just to stay stable, plus separatrons to pull them apart when the time comes, and so on. If you\u0027re careless with your design, it\u0027s easy to watch your separating side stages knock the engine off the central component, which pretty much always ruins your mission. If you can, it\u0027s often just better to use a smaller number of stages just to prevent the issues that can come up at those points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; For rovers, it depends on the size. Small unmanned rovers can be lifted just like a capsule, at the top of a rocket stack; the hard part is landing them safely, but a skycrane setup works beautifully there. BIG rovers, on the other hand, are more like space stations; if you lift them in one shot, you need to pay very close attention to how you balance them. I landed a 120-ton mobile fuel refinery/base on Mun the other day, and that was really rough. In the end, what I did for myself was make a giant (~3600 tons) one-size-fits-all SSTO booster, the Bucket, that can lift any awkwardly shaped payload into orbit (or beyond); it\u0027s shaped like the bucket it\u0027s named after, i.e. a \u0022U\u0022 shape, so that payloads can be held inside it in a stable manner by attaching struts to the sides. It can lift 450-ton payloads to a circular low Kerbin orbit or push them almost entirely out of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, so a dinky 120-ton rover was no problem at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that being said, there are several mods that create either internal cargo bays or disposable payload fairings (a separating cone/cylinder with the rover/satellite inside it), in case you want a rocket that actually looks like a real rocket (i.e., the rover doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s being duct-taped to the top of the rocket). Right now you just don\u0027t need that, but once we get the improved aerodynamics model you\u0027ll need something like this. The really huge rovers won\u0027t be practical to lift this way, so we\u0027ll have to find some other way to get them to orbit, but small ones will just migrate into those sorts of containers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Generally speaking no, it\u0027s not practical to make an unbalanced design. ASAS can correct for very minor asymmetries, but its tolerance is very tight; designs that might appear to be balanced will still find themselves pulling to one side once the thrust kicks in. KSP is just not built for the level of precision you\u0027d need to make this sort of thing work consistently; with very careful planning you can get an asymmetric design to stay stable, but the stock data tools just don\u0027t give you the information you need for this. And KSP doesn\u0027t have the sort of controls the space shuttle did, where the angle of its engines would automatically shift when the SRBs detached (since the angle you\u0027d have to thrust at would now change, due to the changed center of mass and center of thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can always try it, and you shouldn\u0027t completely give up on the idea just because it\u0027s hard, but just be aware that those sorts of designs are just VERY hard to get right unless you do the math yourself outside of KSP. For instance, I had an early spaceplane with two sets of engines that carried a payload satellite on its back; once the payload separated, I\u0027d turn off the upper pair of engines, since the lower ones would be in line with the new center of mass. It was very hard to tune these by eye, so in the end I just pulled out some scratch paper and calculated where I\u0027d have to place engines to provide the right amount of torque pre-separation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T21:58:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can thoroughly back the asparagus staging method.

If fuel efficiency and delta-v capability are your only concern, then the LVT-45 would be the clearly superior choice; the way the math works out, independent of any considerations of mass (for simplicity\u0027s sake, at the moment), The Mainsail can only get about 89% (330/370) of \u0022bang for your buck\u0022 of the LVTs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, we also have to consider the forces acting on our rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Mainsail provides about 1500 kN of thrust. 3 LVT-30s only provide 645 kN. A Mainsail plus a full \u0022Jumbo-64\u0022 fuel tank weigh 42 tonnes. 3 LVT-30s, a tricoupler, and a \u0022Jumbo-64\u0022 weigh a hair over 40 tonnes. (This is before you factor in any payloads that may be sitting on top of this stack; again, we\u0027re keeping the math simple for now.) To find out if this setup will actually lift our rocket, we need that other equation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur rockets exert a force pushing up on the rocket (\u0022thrust\u0022). At the same time, gravity is also exerting a force pushing downwards (\u0022weight\u0022). The ratio that will tell us whether or not our rocket will lift (and roughly how quickly) is called the \u0022thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022 (TWR), and is relatively simple to figure out. We already know the thrust; to find the weight, you just take the mass and plug in Kerbin\u0027s surface acceleration (9.8 m/s^2, just like Earth\u0027s), then multiply the two to get the force of weight. We end up with about 412 kN of weight for the Mainsail configuration, and 392 kN for the 3x LVTs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to find the TWR, you just divide the thrust by the weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor our Mainsail setup, 1500 kN / 412 kN ~= 3.6 , which means this thing is going to shoot up like... well, a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor our 3x LVTs, 645 kN / 392 kN ~= 1.6 , which will still lift off the launchpad quite quickly, but not nearly as quickly as the Mainsail. This might actually be a good thing in the lower atmosphere (where you\u0027ll encounter most of your drag, but that\u0027s a topic for another discussion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, that\u0027s just for the engines and fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we double the masses involved (which also doubles the force exerted by gravity, because of the way the math works out) to simulate a payload, then our Mainsail now gets us a TWR about 1.8.

An engine lifting 80% of its own weight, for example, is ADDING 20% of its weight to the load being lifted. If you exceed terminal velocity, drag due to air resistence may be so strong that it\u0027s worth reducing thrust anyway, but it\u0027s a tradeoff, and generally you should be running as close to full thrust as possible. This is with regard to takeoff in atmosphere, I should clarify. In vacuum, it\u0027s less critical, but there are still good reasons for generally using full thrust. For one thing, it\u0027s most efficient to expend dV at precise times/locations such as periapsis, so the longer the burn lasts, the less efficient you are being. 2) Right now, there\u0027s not much advantage to SRBs. They burn out too quickly to contribute much to your whole journey. But if you look at the specs, their big advantage is that they are much cheaper than liquid fueled systems. The idea is that SRBs will be a financially viable choice when the full campaign mode of the game is introduced, mostly for a quick, hard shove to help you get up to an efficient ascent speed right off of the pad.

That\u0027s also why lower-thrust but higher-efficiency rockets are often better for your lifting stage if you can get away with them. Of course, too little thrust -- even if it\u0027s enough to lift you off the launch pad -- can also be wasteful, since you\u0027re not outpacing the pull of gravity enough to justify burning that much fuel.
