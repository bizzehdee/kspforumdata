When I started using RO it took me like ten tries to put a little Sputnik-thing onto orbit. Anyway its been awhile since I used mechjeb for autopilot, but doesn\u0027t it let you set your desired orbit altitude?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T15:49:05Z","Content":"It does, but it completely fails at doing it...around 110 Km, it goes into a complete nose-down orientation and I lose my apoapsis instead"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T21:42:41Z","Content":"I would suggest posting in the [Realism Overhaul discussion thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98033-Realism-Overhaul-Discussion-Thread?goto=newpost) for maximum exposure.\n\nAlso: [Here is a tutorial for using Mechjeb with RO](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/wiki/MechJeb-Ascents)."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T21:57:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I would suggest posting in the [Realism Overhaul discussion thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98033-Realism-Overhaul-Discussion-Thread?goto=newpost) for maximum exposure.\n\u003E Also: [Here is a tutorial for using Mechjeb with RO](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/wiki/MechJeb-Ascents).\n\nI actually did earlier but never got an answer until earlier today"}]}
