I tried to look it up but all I found was the \u0022speed required to leave a body and negate its gravity.\u0022 However, I was looking at a Delta V chart, and it is 8,600 m/s Delta V to orbit.

It\u0027s dependent on altitude. As your speed increases in an orbit, the orbit gets more and more elliptical until it \u0022breaks open\u0022 at the apoapsis and becomes hyperbolic. That speed at which the orbit stops being elliptical is escape velocity. Escape velocity at Kerbin\u0027s surface is about 3500 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T20:34:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery simply put, it\u0027s the velocity beyond which any object shot straight up will never come back down. It is dependent on radius from the center of mass (aka, altitude), and it IGNORES ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS. You have to be slower than the escape velocity to be in orbit around an object.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Djsnowboy267","CreatedById":34545,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T21:10:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys, that\u0027s what I had thought.
