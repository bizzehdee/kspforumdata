Stock only\n\n2. All the usual stuff about no cheating or fiddling i.e. no physics or part-changing mods, no infinite fuel, no kraken drive, etc. \n\n3. You can use Hyperedit to get your craft to the surface of Duna\n\n4. Your Kerbal must be **seated** in a can, capsule or service bay for the trip\n\n5. The only thrust can come from stock \u0022Dawn\u0022 engines. No RCS, no LF/O engines \n\n6. Pre-lift-off, in-flight and orbit (with Pe/Ap shown) shots required. \n\n7. No bending rules for the sake of it - my decision is final (unless you come up with something inspired ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif))\n\n8. You can use the big solar panels from the Squad Asteroid mod if you like. \n\nI\u0027ve had a go and it\u0027s quite do-able.
