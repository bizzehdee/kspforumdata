The bug report is here, along with a picture:\n\n[https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1096#issuecomment-120767897](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1096#issuecomment-120767897)\n\nThe visual effects that stock KSP does for going fast in atmosphere, the burning and the shockwaves, are being applied to some of our objects that are meant to be entirely holographic visual aids and not really \u0022there\u0022 in the game world. These objects are not 2D GUI items glued to the screen, but are simply 3D rendered semitransparent Unity primitives that lack colliders so they normally don\u0027t do any interactions with the world. Specifically they are LineRenderer objects, used to draw vectors in 3D space.\n\nThe stock game appears to be drawing areo effects for all Unity 3D primitives in the game, regardless of whether they are physically interacting with things (have colliders) or are purely holographic (have no colliders). Since these are NOT classes that KSP themselves invented, but are just low level Unity primitives (LineRenderer) I don\u0027t expect them to contain any members, be they properties or fields or methods, that I can use to turn the effect off for them. The effect is something SQUAD invented, so I don\u0027t expect it to be mentioned on a stock Unity class like LineRenderer.\n\nHow the heck do I suppress the effect for these objects?\n\nIt\u0027s not breaking anything, as it\u0027s purely a visual effect only, but it looks really wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T08:11:14Z","Content":"You need to change the gameobject layer. \n\ngameObject.layer = 15;"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T13:04:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You need to change the gameobject layer. \n\u003E gameObject.layer = 15;\n\nThanks, I\u0027ll give that a try.\n\nI really wish SQUAD had used an enum or mnemonic constant integers for the layer numbers, to make it clear how they meant for them to be used, so instead of saying \u002215\u0022 you could say \u0022UI\\_LAYER\u0022 or some such. You could then also get a listing of all the layer numbers and what they mean, instead of having to rely on the modder community reverse-engineering what they are."},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:56:32Z","Content":"Just tried it - this fixed it.
