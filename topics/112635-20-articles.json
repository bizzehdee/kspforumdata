But, I made the video below to show you where the thought process is going. Some things to keep in mind when viewing this:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - This is merely a proof of concept. It\u0027s still in the very early stages.\n\u003E - The \u0027boxes\u0027 you see won\u0027t be in the final product. This is just so we have a visual reference while in development.\n\u003E - Many things are not yet working as they should. While linear drag is something we can set, drag when at an angle doesn\u0027t exist yet. So, turning vessels doesn\u0027t work well, which is why this video is all straight line sailing.\n\u003E - Many of the things you see in the GUI won\u0027t be adjustable via the GUI but will be via the config.\n\u003E - There are other options in the config that you don\u0027t see on the gui.\n\u003E - No, we have no idea as to when. Dice is doing this in his spare time.\n\u003E - We have not tested this with tweakscale. While it does work on parts ranging from my clippers to Dice\u0027s carrier I won\u0027t make any promises that we\u0027ll even test it with tweakscale. I know you guys want big boats but to me, tweakscale is like a band-aid.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/KtuZwGkxO9Y?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E .\n\nThat looks amazing.

Just saw the question and forgot to answer.\n\u003E I\u0027m currently working with Unity 5.1 and am writing code using the 5.1 dll\u0027s. AFAIK, there are no changes to the way the code works, merely changes in the way it\u0027s accessed. It means, a lot of mods that are written prior to 5.1, should the modder upgrade, will find they have to rewrite large chunks of their code.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m pretty sure though that the way water works in KSP is the result of Squad\u0027s coding. I\u0027ve seen other aquatic games/sims written in Unity and their water is nothing like KSP.\n\u003E \n\u003E So, if there\u0027s going to be any changes, it\u0027ll be because Squad either wants to change it or has to change it.\n\nWell, it\u0027s no surprise that there will be a lot of work to do to update the mods. Hopefully SQUAD makes the transitions as smooth as possible.\n\nAs for the water, I have no idea where they got the origional water coding, but hopefully they don\u0027t change whatever water sim they put in. Maybe someone can ask (me probably) at the next squadcast."},{"CreatedByName":"sepboeren","CreatedById":151219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T15:48:17Z","Content":"will you make more navy based parts? also, would it be possible to make hulls that float without having to be practically indestructible?"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T15:58:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E will you make more navy based parts? also, would it be possible to make hulls that float without having to be practically indestructible?\n\nIf you mean weapons, he\u0027s said that he isn\u0027t doing that."},{"CreatedByName":"Thatdude253","CreatedById":140179,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T16:43:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you mean weapons, he\u0027s said that he isn\u0027t doing that.\n\nI think what he means is hulls that resemble modern or past warships.

Military vehicles specifically need to be constantly improved to counter the competition, using things like the custom BD armory contracts (forgot the name) really adds in that need to improve and redesign. I would honestly prefer that this pack remains civilian only anyways so that the scope of content does not become to large and end up in the same situation as b9.

I could try a new deck - it is, after all, a flattened cuboid, how hard can that be to model?\n\nThere\u0027s a number of new advances in the game (e.g. cargo bays, ISRU, EPL, allista\u0027s Hangar mod, IR, KIS) which could extend what modular parts could be added to it.
