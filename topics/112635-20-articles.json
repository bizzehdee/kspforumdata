Just saw the question and forgot to answer.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently working with Unity 5.1 and am writing code using the 5.1 dll\u0027s. AFAIK, there are no changes to the way the code works, merely changes in the way it\u0027s accessed. It means, a lot of mods that are written prior to 5.1, should the modder upgrade, will find they have to rewrite large chunks of their code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure though that the way water works in KSP is the result of Squad\u0027s coding.

Military vehicles specifically need to be constantly improved to counter the competition, using things like the custom BD armory contracts (forgot the name) really adds in that need to improve and redesign. I would honestly prefer that this pack remains civilian only anyways so that the scope of content does not become to large and end up in the same situation as b9.
