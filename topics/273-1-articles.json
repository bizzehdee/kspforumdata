Only allow stacking in the bomb config so IF someone tries to use the bomb without the coupler he would have to put it sideways on the top of his rocket and this would not be very usefull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a thought.. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rdfox","CreatedById":1818,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-30T15:05:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBelated, but a thought--why not make a custom radial coupler that has purple top and bottom nodes off to the side, and attach the fore and aft parts of the bomb to that with purple nodes? On many combat aircraft, after all, the weapon pylon is released along with the bomb... (just a thought from someone with zero experience making addons since the days of MSFS 4.0 and the Aircraft and Scenery Designer.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
