The inclination you get after circularizing around Duna is more relevant to your orbit around Duna, but not the Sun. When you escape the Duna system almost all of your orbital velocity remains in line with Duna\u0027s orbit and any vector you got from the polar orbit is a minor rounding error once you leave Duna\u0027s sphere-of-influence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat will have a bigger affect on your return trajectory will be the relative inclination of Duna\u0027s orbit around the Sun compared to Kerbin\u0027s orbit and where that puts your ascending and descending nodes around the orbit of the Sun. And whether or not you burn to escape Duna when your prograde is in line with Duna\u0027s orbital path or at a wide angle from it.
