I managed to get the first part down ok, then the next bit was the launch the second module and try to get it near the first. I\u0027m actually pretty happy because I got closer than expected, but also a bit sad because it\u0027s 800meters away! Is there a way (using KAS or anything else) to get the two pieces close together as they are already on the surface and I can\u0027t launch them again (no fuel, they\u0027re just habitation modules on legs!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T17:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith really low gravity, comes really low friction.
