These gas generators would simply run at a certain speed according to pressure demand, or at maximum if they cannot keep up with that demand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other side, you would have \u0022sink\u0022 parts which could either generate thrust (RCS or primary nozzles) at various rates of consumption, or generate other resources like ElectricCharge or ShaftPower for arrangements like APUs, stationary generators and turboshaft engines. The sink parts would periodically consume ExhaustAir or BleedAir resources to do their work, and these would be topped up by the generator parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe player would not have to worry about any of the internal plumbing, just about having enough LF and IntakeAir to keep the gas generators going, and installing enough gas generators to supply their nozzles with exhaust air. In a typical \u0022intake-compressor-nozzle\u0022 arrangement where each part is matched 1-on-1 with its corresponding set, that would match up perfectly. However, attaching mismatched engines with more demanding nozzles would, for example, push an underpowered engine to its limits, consuming excessive fuel and causing overheats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Panther afterburner can also be simulated in a sink (rocket) part which consumes both LF and ExhaustAir as propellants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m already cooking up some modded parts which use this principle, including a high-thrust VTOL engine and a stationary APU.

Both subsonic ramjets and turbojets can share the same exhaust nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScramjets would work in a similar way but only generate ExhaustAir with supersonic airflow, and their exhaust nozzles would be horribly inefficient when you go subsonic with them (making it a better choice to close the intakes/exhausts and switch over to subsonic jets if you have both). You can even go crazy and make the scramjets overheat when you try to push too much air down their throats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven a hybrid enigine like the RAPIER/SABRE would function like it *actually* does, with the precooler cooling the air so the jet will not overheat. A seamless transition where a scramjet is injected with more and more Oxidizer at higher altitudes would also be possible. Or nuclear jets, fusion jets, arcjets, anything that burns your favorite fuel and generates the ExhaustAir at the appropriate rate would be fair game. The same goes with consumer parts like generators, turboprops, life support (air conditioning) or maybe even ship turbines. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, there is a big difference between a turbojet and a turbofan: A turbojet will only use its exhaust air as thrust, while a turbofan uses a part of the exhaust air to drive the massive fan (much like a turboprop), so in game mechanics terms, a turbofan would generate thrust from both ExhaustAir and IntakeAir at a proportional ratio (the bypass ratio), while a pure turbojet nozzle is basically a rocket that runs on ExhaustAir.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-18T09:11:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2016 09:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stoney3K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
