Tragically for them, the realchutes deployed at 22km and FAR decided they got ripped off by aerodynamic forces. All in all, not what you\u0027d call a successful mission as such but the next version should go better.

The first stage is also much shorter, it burns only for 4 minutes. Second stage is kind of similiar to ULA\u0027s Centaur upper stage with 2 engines, only the thrust and isp is a bit lower (3rd tech level). It\u0027s capable of delivering 6 tons to LEO (Delta II could deliver 6.1t) and around 2 tons to GTO (DII - 2.2tons).

Playing KSP in the RSS environment, with the RPL tech tree. I just finished Vengard and I must say, so far, its a really really good experience. I didnt thought that, after the original KSP size didnt had any challenges left, the game could be THIS fun again. I especially like the new probe centred science system in M19e. Very good indeed. Please continue this road!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I find odd at moment, that still after solving the engines issue, I have the problem that my rockets are too powerful. Because I cant throttle down, the engine motors scratch at the 10g mark during ascent, which is not very good. Nathan, you said that early rockets have the problem of being not powerful enough.. I have rather the problem that they are too powerful. Ok, I have only little payloads of 0.5 - 1t, but still. If I try to make full use of the rocket motors at their respective tier, they are too powerful or the rockets become too noodly. For higher payloads, I dont really have the technology, because with 1.5m procedural fuel tanks, its hard to make heavy rockets. A solution was posted before, but I think you should rebalance the procedural fuel tanks sizes for the next iteration. 2m width x 2m length (currently 1.5x1.4 m) on tier 2 and 2m width x 4m length (currently 1.5 x 4m) on tier 3 might be appropriate. That doesnt sound much, but since the volume increases squared with the base area, going from 1.5-\u0026gt;2 gives a 80% increase, which might be enough. Also then, it is possible to use the 2m diameter engines, which is not easily the case at moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESemmel\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mirean","CreatedById":109246,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T21:57:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Semmel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the latest version of Realism Overhaul and RPL and I don\u0027t experience the same things you do \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it was quite a pain at the beginning to get to TL1, but after that, it was really, really easy.

If the stage burns less of its fuel compared to total remaining fuel of vehicle, the TWR will not change so drastically. \u002B for the upper stages, you don\u0027t need a TWR 1.5\u002B. I usually go with starting TWR of 0.8\u002B and it\u0027s just fine. With this setup, you shouldn\u0027t get above TWR of 6 in any part of the flight \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I almost forgot, you can apply the lower TWR even to the first stage - if you take a look at my delta II launcher above, if I fired only the main engines, I would get around 0.6 sea level TWR.

But if you do like i told you, you can stretch them bit more freely and it is not cheating. So, once more, when you are placed a stretchy tank on your craft, save, exit VAB, go to science building, click the last opened engine node there (nothing else), exit science building and return to VAB, now you should be able to quite freely to alter the size of the tank.
