I will chronicle them by excitement level, starting from the top:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Efinally\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0have a release date. And, seeing as it\u0027s going into Early Access, instead of full launch, it\u0027s likely that is the final date (knock on wood, though). That\u0027s something to be excited for, as someone who has waited since the announcement. Also, the game is looking really good, in my opinion. I think that the visuals are phenomenal, including all of the atmospheric effects, terrain detail, and material shading for parts. Definitely a step up from KSP 1 (without mods, of course). The base gameplay seems to be solid, and I\u0027m looking forward to a (hopefully) more performant, smoother experience in KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, this is where my excitement wanes. For instance, I\u0027m not sure if it was because the game was running in a smaller window size during the gameplay captures or not, but the UI seems pretty cluttered. I\u0027d post an image, but I can\u0027t seem to figure it out right now, but if you go to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/XAL3XaP-LyE?t=593\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E9:53 in the video\u003C/a\u003E and pause, the UI takes up a pretty massive amount of space. Again, not sure it\u0027s something having to do with aspect ratio or not. Either way, I hope there is some scalability for the UI, and that this isn\u0027t finalized. I will say, I do like the style of the UI for the most part, so kudos.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy biggest issue, though, lies with the intense change in direction that has left me somewhat whiplashed. I\u0027ll start by saying I have nothing but respect for the KSP2 devs, and it\u0027s clear that they have put a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Eamount of effort in to making this game, and it looks like it\u0027s paying off. However, I can\u0027t help but be disappointed with all of the promised content now being pushed back for future updates. Now, before anyone says anything, I recognize that a delayed game/feature is a more complete game/feature, and I believe it. I\u0027m sure it was a difficult decision to make for the devs, and I respect and understand the decision to further develop these new ideas. I can\u0027t say I\u0027m really happy about it, though. For instance, the last KSP 2 Episode released was\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eabout\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0interstellar travel, and now it will not be in the game until the planned third update. The science system won\u0027t even be in the game until the first update. All in all, the change to early access is, to me, a bit disappointing. The part that really stung the most, though, was the heavily delayed multiplayer aspect. I want to reiterate that it\u0027s a good decision to delay it for polishing. However, one of the things I looked forward to most was playing KSP 2 with a friend when it came out. No longer. This left me very disappointed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I won\u0027t end this post on a sour note. I still can\u0027t wait for the game to come out. There are a plethora of improvements from KSP 1 that can be easily seen, and I\u0027m truly looking forward to buying it on day one, as much as some of this new information has surprised me. All of what they have been talking about is still coming, though not when I had expected. I hope they are true to their word when they say how important community feedback will be, because if they are, this will surely be an amazing game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-21T17:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224188592\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666368480\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022192535\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MARL_Mk1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, MARL_Mk1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in 2019-2020 during a \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112420-shadowzone/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022112420\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112420-shadowzone/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ShadowZone\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(I think it was?) with Nate Simpson, he mentioned something along the lines of \u003Cem\u003E\u0022We\u0027ve been trying multiplayer internally and I\u0027ve never seen anyone laugh so loudly\u0022.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nShadowZone might be able to correct that quote word by word, but all in all goes to say that their internal builds already have most of those features already implemented, just not in a release-ready state.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYo are just acting like they are scamming people by promising things that will never come, when it\u0027s a fact that they are not.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is not Star Citizen, or any of the trillions of Early Access survival games that scammed people by paying youtubers like FrankieOnPc back in the day.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatt Lowne already said in his video that during his talk with Nate, he mentioned Early Access won\u0027t be pre-Alpha, or Alpha, or Beta, so we can take from that that they are literally using the Early Access program as it was meant to-- A pre-release access for the community to shape the bigger features of the game by providing feedback.

Also something I highlighted in the video I released today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also had a chance to chat with Nate about the Early Access and what will be in it. Those infos are going into a video I\u0027ll release on Sunday. Had a bit of a hell week and barely was able to get my early access announce video out. I recorded my talking head until 2:20am ...
