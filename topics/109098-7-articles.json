So, either more wing or less weight. Deploying properly set up flaps will also lower stall speed. As for increasing pre-stall AoA...that\u0027s a bit more complicated, I think. Lower stall speed will probably imply higher stall AoA, but there are some subtleties of wing shape involved that I don\u0027t fully understand.\n\nFor the steepness of the pitch moment...the more rear-biased the lift on the ship (relative to CoM), the steeper the line. A steeper line implies more stability, but requires greater control force inputs to disrupt that stability (which is necessary for manoeuvring, and is also a bit necessary just for level flight). So, to shallow it out, either more lift at the front (bigger wings or shift them forwards) or less at the back (smaller tailplane or shift it forwards)."},{"CreatedByName":"Dentzu","CreatedById":143715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T01:50:41Z","Content":"Mach 20.2 - FAR, OPT Space Plane Pack, Instell Incorporated, QuizTech Aero, Intake Build Aid, Crzyrndm\u0027s B9 pWings patch. \n\n[http://i.imgur.com/Tsd2hqF.png](http://i.imgur.com/Tsd2hqF.png)\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure this is impossible in stock, and only remotely possible because of how powerful the Instell engines are.

Stability is well...its decent once your up to speed, but until then it has issues, and the first few seconds after launch are reliant on the gimbal to keep things in check. Almost entirely lifting body with only as much control surface as I could add without increasing wave drag - those tail fins reduced it quit a bit actually.
