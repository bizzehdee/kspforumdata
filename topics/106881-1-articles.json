Needless to say, when playing hard career mode it is a real drag to find that the Kerbal you just sent out the hatch has no jetpack control! Moreover, if I\u0027m in a situation where I can go out to that menu and try to fix it without killing all my Kerbals, I find that the interface is all messed up, and it won\u0027t let me fix it until I quit the game entirely and re-load it with the controller plugged in. This has resulted in quite a bit of annoyance for me, and has never been a problem AFAIK in any previous version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a related note, selecting \u0022settings\u0022 from the in-flight escape menu not only doesn\u0027t give you the option of re-specifying axis bindings, it also snaps the screen resolution to a different value, that cannot be changed, which in my case made the navball completely invisible, bringing another perfectly good flight to an untimely end. Anyway, it would be great if this presumably unintended behavior could be patched at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(update)...Upon reading down the forum a couple of pages, I found another thread where ThatDude624 described a very similar problem yesterday, involving both the messed-up axis assignment interface and the screen resolution glitch, so you can count me as another person experiencing the same bug!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T15:23:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 03:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:57:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame with joystick controls.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
