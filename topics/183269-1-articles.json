Too many rockets have tossed their engines into the ocean, too many tanks scattered on the grasslands after staging, to many factories are producing toxic waste during the process of producing Oxidiser.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore a new law was passed and starting from today, all rockets, launchers, rovers, planes, SSTOs, etc. are required to only use Liquid Fuel as their main propellant. Also all the bits and pieces have to be recoverable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, another law has been passed after President Krump has visited \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and decided that colonizing Duna would be the perfect PR stunt to get him re-elected second term.

Colony-Parts don\u0027t have to apply to this, however they are required to be docked to something applying for this rule at all times, until landed!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- You have to build a transfer vehicle to get to Duna and back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- You have to build a lander to get some payload down to the surface of Duna. All non-colony items have to be able to return into LDO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- You have to build a base at Duna. These are the parts that may stay on Duna.
