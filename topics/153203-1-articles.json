I found out that I like playing KSP on the sofa and the XBO version (I guess it\u00B4s still on 1.1.3 or so) works pretty nice even with the gamepad. but the vanilla isn\u00B4t fair enough for me. So the idea is using my notebook with the TV, connecting a 360 gamepad to it and find a way to make it work the same way as it works on the XBOX. The user interface is 1:1 the same as it\u00B4s for the PC version but unfortunately I can\u00B4t configure the gamepad properly. I can\u00B4t bind some functions to the buttons and I can\u00B4t\u00A0configure intervals like:\u00A0Tap X\u00A0= X ; Hold X = Y. Is there any chance to get such a working XBO (similar) file and make it work? Thnx!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
