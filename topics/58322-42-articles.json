Just wondering do you know about how you can be about 500 meters from a heat source/fire on the ground and your aircraft just starts exploding it seems the heat range is huge!

Thanks for the great mods!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really depends what made the fire. At the moment all the fires are broken down to two effects smallfire or largefire.
