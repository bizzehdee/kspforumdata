Pretty sure I was when trying to run it on 32 bit, but when running on 64 bit that really shouldn\u0027t be an issue, and I\u0027m getting the crash on there too, I tried removing a few mods, and get as far as the load screen with the little solar system icon in the lower right corner before it dies, sometimes it crashes without a message, sometimes with, but I\u0027m having trouble decoding this log. It\u0027s pretty big so here\u0027s a pastebin.\n\n[http://pastebin.com/dmjUDC65](http://pastebin.com/dmjUDC65)\n\nAny ideas??
