And there is a story behind this all. So if you want to know more about it, feel free to read. The other thing you peeps should note that it is completely fictional, and nothing is supposed to be realistic, its semi-fantasy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EBack-Back Story\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Ameschland Universe came to be all the way back in 2013 when i made a Minecraft world named Dutch City, i got inspired by a YouTube video of people building a city. It became on of my best Minecraft worlds ever made and i started building up from that. In the same year, i started to make another universe called the Iconel universe, wich was later merged into the Ameschland Universe. The Iconel Universe is bassicly more Sci-Fi and fantasy because of interplanetary travel and things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ETimeline\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2017-2045, Pre-Ameschland period.
