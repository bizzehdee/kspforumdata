I have a vision for a KSP mod, based upon a game I played many many moons ago which, if fully utilised, would require:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew KSP facility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew technologies at the end of the techtree\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear missions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t program but I can model, having cut my teeth creating buildings for SimCity, if I can just remember some of my chops...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my questions for those smarter than me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the facility I have an external model I\u0027m working on but am unsure how to integrate this into the game, can anyone steer me in the right direction? also, can the internal VAB and SPH models be changed??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was planning on using the Karbonite resource system (if possible) but if I want to add additional resources is this a simple matter of tweaking the definition file or is it more complex than that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my plan to work I will need a couple of new items at the end of the tech tree. Again, is this just a matter of tweaking a definition file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhilst the mod would be mostly open ended and you could do whatever you like obviously to progress through the story, such that there is one, I would need linear mission progression. Can I do this just by having a flag of completing a previous mission? is there also an idiot\u0027s guide to defining missions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking of just putting the idea out there and seeing if other people wanted to do it but am determined now to try and give it a go myself, so any help would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T13:18:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi the questions I can answer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy external model i\u0027m assuming you mean a building or structure rather than a game editor part, the only current way to get buildings into the game is Via the KerbTown mod, very simple to do as well .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources demand is dealt with in the cfg and the resource definition , check folder Squad Resources for how they are defined, do note however there is currently some support for an open resource system (ORS) in which definitions would be unified rather than one modder having resource X at a mass of 1 and another at 0.1 , which can lead to some nasty problems I\u0027m told.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding to tech is simply done in the cfg although for career games I believe the requirements may be a little more involved , but not much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECant help with the missions though, good luck with your project\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
