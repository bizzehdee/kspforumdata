If you want to transmit these experiments all in one go, you end up putting almost 1 ton of batteries that serve no other purpose than to feed the antenna for certain transmissions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to be able to transmit over a longer period of time, as my EC generation allows. Now, I know that I can turn on \u0027allow partial tranmissions\u0027 on the antenna, but that leads to significant data loss. A fix for this could do one of 3 things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\ntransmit data as available, not draining the batteries below a certain (tweakable?) percentage.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nhave a \u0027transmission limiter\u0027 slider on the part action menu, allowing us to manually controll the speed between packets, similar to an engines thrust limiter option.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nsimply remove the science penalty for partial tranmissions. This would be less than ideal, as one could not reliably controll a probe during a long tranmission due to constantly running out of electricity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI am comfortable with ksps cfg system and modulemanager, but have never touched ksp .ddl modding, nor really any sort of coding beyond bash/python scripting and automation. If no one else wants to give it a shot, could someone point me in the right direction for getting a linux toolchain set up and where to find documentation for ksp-spesific calls?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-04T16:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t speak to the linux toolchain but the only documentation I know of is on either the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/index.html\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Space Program Documentation\u003C/a\u003E page where all the API are exposed with a little (read tiny) bit of documentation, or the source code that modder\u0027s release with their mods.
