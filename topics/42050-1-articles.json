The central, second stage is not, but is way less than the 50% of booster mass non-reusable required by the challenge to count as a re-usable vessel. It is rated as a 28 ton lifter, able to put 28 tons in an 80 km orbit, but actually has more fuel than needed for that. This I use to rendezvous different sections together and to de-orbit the 2nd stage booster after delivering the payload. The second stage burns up on re-entry and is lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd stage booster:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Duna%20Challenge/Catalyst%202nd%20stage.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Catalyst 2nd stage.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post the full flight schedule in a little bit but the basics are that a two payload vehicle is launched first, docks, then heads unmanned (unkerbaled?) to duna on the first launch window on day 55. This is the Scout ITV (Interplanetary Transfer Vehicle) and the DTS (Duna Transfer Station). The station is an emergency back up to hold 8 Kerbals incase of trouble and could be used as a transfer back to Kerbin with an ITV later on if needed. It also carries two Kethane scanning satellites to map Duna and Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDTS-7 with it\u0027s own integral aerobraking heatshield and two Kethane probes mounted on top:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Duna%20Challenge/DTS7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DTS7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the Scout ITV loaded with 3 mountable heatshields that are left in Kerbin orbit for later missions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Duna%20Challenge/Scout%20ITV\u002B3Heatshields.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Scout ITV\u002B3Heatshields.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I\u0027m getting the DTS setup for it\u0027s journey to Duna.

I\u0027ve not got a lot of Kethane on the equator on Ike, but it\u0027s not as critical with a low mass body like that. Duna, this time around anyway, has quite a few equatorial K deposits. I\u0027ve got two tentative landing sites marked out in the darker \u0027seas\u0027 that tend to be a little flatter terrain (though not as flat as the flats on Minmus unfortunately). Time is almost due to launch the Beta 2 payload which I hope to get to tomorrow some time. Then on to day 178 for the next launch and assembly of the Beta mission in LKO. I\u0027m likely not going to use 6 mini lander probes. I could mount them, but it\u0027s more convenient to mount 4 on the body of the Destiny Lander simply to avoid clashing with other components on the frame and keep some kind of balance.

Unfortunately the K-miner rover had stability issues in testing, and I eventually did away with it entirely and put the Kethane mining apparatus directly on the Destiny. I have transfer rovers that can ship fuel or oxygen between vessels on the surface, but fuel is only needed between Destiny landers and perhaps the orbital tug. The tug has the thrust to land, and I included some light landing gear just in case. I don\u0027t intend to land it except in emergencies, but it could if it has to. The Destiny Landers should be able to refuel the tugs (and everything else) in orbit. The transfer rover at present isn\u0027t needed much. It\u0027s main purpose will be to shuttle crew and oxygen around. The Hab landers don\u0027t have fuel tanks and the Destiny landers don\u0027t need fuel shipped to them as they can mine their own Kethane.
