Also picked up some of the files throughout the last couple of pages (not sure if I was suppose to) and finally I was able to get the Shuttle into a stable and reasonable orbit without much trouble. It handled a lot better than before, not oscillating out of control or anything during ascent. Re-entry was also phenomenal with a smooth decent that went without issue. The aerodynamics are loads better than I remember them being on the .90 release and some of the first 1.0 adaptations. The only issue I found was that there were no RCS jets that came out of the nose section (I checked and made sure that those jets were activated and I had monopropellant). I used the one piece model if that helps. Other than that small issue, amazing work everyone.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T10:06:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Finally got to test out the new update.
