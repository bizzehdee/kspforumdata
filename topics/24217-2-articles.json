The former is a cosmetic issue, but the latter actually affects how the capsule handles. I\u0027d suggest also changing the engine power in the .cfg from 400 to 200 or so. Leaving it at 400 has, for me, made the capsule basically uncontrollable...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) If you have an existing Dragon Rider in flight, rescaling will wonkify it. Again, mostly cosmetic with one exception: the Dragon Brain will be floating above the docking port, and will keep the capsule from docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Big_Ron","CreatedById":58256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T17:01:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmmmm, i might have to look in to it i cant stand an un-finished model,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T17:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E50 thrust is way more than enough for a capsule that size, with 300 units of fuel.
