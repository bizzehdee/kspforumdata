Any ideas on how this can be done?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Actual lights rather than emissives. Possible? I\u0027d imagine it requires KerbTown to support a module config linked to the lights in Unity somehow, so assuming that KerbTown will support it, again how to get them to switch states from day to night and back again rather than having them something switched on and off in a part by a player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeace!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T15:49:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably needs a plugin to get at the time of day state and link that to the emissive alpha values of the models.
