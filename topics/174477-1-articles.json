It is a must have. I have something like 62 mods loaded in that 1.4.2 version and everything is smooth as silk frame rate wise. In 1.4.3 however, parts packs have cut the frame rate in half or more from 1.4.2 to 1.4.3. I did troubleshooting and it is parts packs, including this one \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0that have made the drop from smooth 60 (capped) to 25 or lower, but I have the same setup (mods wise) and have even removed some mods for troubleshooting as well as lowering my options for the same purpose. This is not a bug report\u00A0or a gripe, but is more of a question to people in the know and to an evidently highly skilled modder. The question is, what would make the parts packs effect the frame rate to such an extent from 1.4.2 to 1.4.3?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-01T03:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour question has been moved to the support subforum since multiple mods are involved.

I do believe that I have discovered the culprit regarding the high loss of frames in 1.4.3 and it has nothing to do with parts packs besides the regular impact they can have. It turns out that I was dealing with an issue with Kopernicus, OPM, and/or their dependencies. It is apparent that the dev is aware of the issue and is working on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
