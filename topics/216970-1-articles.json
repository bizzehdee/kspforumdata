To keep it going, engineers had already sacrificed heaters and other nonessential parts that drained power. But engineers have now found a way to tap reserve power from a safety mechanism that regulates the spacecraft\u0027s voltage. \u0022The move will enable the mission to postpone shutting down a science instrument until 2026, rather than this year,\u0022\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-voyager-will-do-more-science-with-new-power-strategy\u0022 style=\u0022border:0px;color:#5076b8;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ethis past week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-05T21:46:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224278583\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216970\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221682908348\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/30/2023 at 10:32 PM, mikegarrison said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.npr.org/2023/04/30/1172921603/nasa-voyager-2-2026-backup-power-space\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.npr.org/2023/04/30/1172921603/nasa-voyager-2-2026-backup-power-space\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Voyager 2 releases it\u0027s inner \u0022energizer bunny\u0022.\u00A0 Again.\u00A0 NASA rules at this mission extension hacking beyond any others\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-05T22:33:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the thing is, they over-build these probes as much as they can because just launching the mission at all is so expensive.
