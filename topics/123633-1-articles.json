It seems like it has something to do with radial/mirror. I\u0027m unable to finish most of my ships because this keeps occurring a lot. I\u0027ve had this problem with and without mods. In the video I do have tweak, kas, kis, and, robotics, though I am only using stock parts, but I did use tweak to scale. Whenever this occurs the part just flashes when I try to attach it, but won\u0027t attach. If I delete it, all of the UI breaks and I can\u0027t do anything, but Alt \u002B F4 (which I have to do in the video). Sometimes I am able to leave the hanger and come back if I just set the part aside, but the whole ship is broken when I come back. The video shows this a little better. After the 1 minute mark the problem occurs. I try saving and starting a new one. There\u0027s artifacts after that. I try to load what I saved. The load does not change the name at the top. Around the 3:30 mark you can see the issues that I\u0027d normally have if I were able to to leave the hanger and come back with the engine being weird. During the video you can\u0027t see my mouse, but after the problem happens anything that highlights I am spam clicking on to try and use it but nothing happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternate post in steam forum: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/app/220200/discussions/0/490123938430083442/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/app/220200/discussions/0/490123938430083442/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T08:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI experienced this issue a lot until I updated to 1.0.4.
