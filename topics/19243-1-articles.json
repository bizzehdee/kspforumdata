I get an idea, throw it together, test it, then refine it beased on what I learned during testing. Most of the numbers stuff I already know in my head, so I am fine just winging it, though I do sometimes do some pre flight math, occasionally even writing numbers down if there are a few to remember. An example you be calculating how much Minimus will move though its orbit in the time it takes my rocket to reach that altitude, so that I know where to aim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a mission I am doing now, as both a rescue op and preparation for more capable return craft, I might need to do some power to weight calculations, and for once build a craft that can do exactly what it is supposed to, and nothing more, which might require a more specified flight plan.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
