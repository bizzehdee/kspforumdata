Though I play in normal mode, with saves etc. The first major bug I ran into was yesterday, at some point during a launch the ship bugged and said it was landed, even though it was in orbit. Though I attribute this to possible part clipping, as I had 2 tanks/engines side by side on the dual adapter and their RCS ports were clipped inside each other (clipping not turned on in the editor). Though I did rotate them so they didn\u0027t clip and I think the launcher still said it was landed after a certain point. Haven\u0027t run into the problem since, so I\u0027d have to test that specific launcher again I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it could have also been some random combination of mod code at the right/wrong time that caused it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, just remembered I did have some small issues when parts were over-heating, usually the game freezes after staging (when sepratrons points too close to a tank), but after a few seconds it starts going again. After having this problem early on I learned to use F10 to turn off the over heat gauges and don\u0027t have any major problems. I usually don\u0027t remember to turn them off until after it freezes for a second.
