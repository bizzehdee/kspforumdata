The two are on EVA teathers, so I was thinking in 1.11 EVA repair and construction are being added and that they should add a way to customize EVA packs. For example, you could have a long haul thruster pack which is an EVA pack that has more propellant, or have a \u0022backpack\u0022 were the pack has extra inventory spots. You would likely find it on the EVA suit selection page were you can mix different EVA pack add ons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk back to the teathers, the kerbals could have a hook that teathers hook on to, pods could have built in lines but aren\u0027t that long while you could add radial mounted lines that come in short, medium, and long lines. How it would work is the kerbals go EVA and right click or X on Xbox and what ever is on PS, when you do this the option of attach or dettach teathers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Le Lynx","CreatedById":208381,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-30T09:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery good idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspnerd122","CreatedById":199169,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-30T15:43:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYES\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWE NEED THIS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
