I have an rtx 2070 with gsync. GPU Temps are 50c, so very safe, and cpu temps are 70 degrees c. I have the latest NVIDIA drivers. Other games are not experiening artifacting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the things im seeing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. When launching a craft or orbiting Kerbin, the background galaxy and stars flicker significantly, but the craft itself doesn\u0027t flicker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The Kerbal pictures in the bottom left corner sometimes become partially black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. In the main menu there are no stars and the background is completely black with Kerbin being rendered perfectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts on what could be causing this? No mods, fresh installing, hard career, both DLCs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"serp777","CreatedById":201378,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-13T04:30:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those that run into this same problem, I believe it was a conflict between gsync and vsync being enabled. GSync was enabled for all games, but in the KSP graphics settings vsync was enabled. Disabling it seemed to fix the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
