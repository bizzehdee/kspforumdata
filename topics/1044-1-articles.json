I got even more excited when I heard about the upcoming MacOS build, it\u0027s very rare to see games like these released for anything other than Windows. (Better yet, with what I\u0027ve been seeing in the suggestion boxes, KSP is going to eventually turn into the spiritual successor of Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Race Into Space. Hopefully it\u0027ll be just a hair easier...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m an engineering physics (basically Physics \u002B Electrical Engineering and some Optics) major, about to start his final year of courses this fall, although I\u0027ve always had an interest in the space program since hearing about the glory days of space travel from my father when I was a little kid. I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ll aim for a job at NASA Glenn or at Lincoln Electric, it depends on how the next couple of months go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and the pliosaur thing? Yeah, that\u0027s just kind of random. *laughs* I can do a bit of space art, though, it\u0027s something I dabble in from time to time. Maybe messing around with KSP will help inspire me and get me through the creative slump that hits in August.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-25T22:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
