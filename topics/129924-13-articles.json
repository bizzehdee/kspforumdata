It should be the final big destination, after you\u0027ve visited everywhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from new planets, I\u0027d really like to see improved terrain. Way more craters and tall mountains on Duna, maybe even a large valley somewhere on the planet. It\u0027s these things that make the real planets cool, it would be awesome to explore things like them in KSP. It would give a reason to build bigger and better rovers that can traverse complex terrain too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA game mechanic I would love to see is things that can affect the duration of missions. For example, decay on RTGs, which could be realistic - when we time warp in KSP it is possible to skip forward quite a few years, some of my missions are up to 7 years or more. That\u0027s more than enough time for these power sources to become less efficient. Another thing I\u0027d really love is dust and other elements on certain planets (such as Duna) that could effect solar panels. This could tie in with weather (which is also an important thing in my opinion), which could clean off the solar panels periodically, but not very often. If you didn\u0027t get a weather event for a while and your solar panels got too dusty, that would be the end of the mission. If you had kerbals nearby, or it was a manned mission, they could clean the solar panels too (much like you repack chutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not expecting any of this in 0.22, or even 0.23, but I think some of it would really boost the realism and benefit the game.
