What will the game play like when it\u0027s complete? I\u0027m sure the dev team have a clean idea of what they want with the game. Will it be a space tycoon like game where you get contracts to put satellites into orbit, establish colonies, mines on other planets, take supplies to space stations etc? Go prospecting yourself for good mining areas on planets (great use for EVAs btw.) or find good tourist locations to build your space stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pacing of the game allows for control of many different rockets at the same time, since it takes days for a craft to get into the desired spot you have all the time in the world to keep switching between dozens of different crafts if need be, so running a large scale space tycoon can be accomplished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think since pilots can level up, some skills could exist that - when unlocked - allow them to pilot simple missions themselves. Such as ferrying resources to orbit, or shipping supplies to space stations. For example, Bob Kerman has \u0022dock at station\u0022 and \u0022land on Mun\u0022 skills unlocked, and he can get supplies from a space station to a Mun base. This could eliminate the need for personally running repetitive missions all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince research is planned, there could be some special materials you have to mine that are needed for more advanced parts. There could be like 5-6 of these and of course none of them can be found on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, just some ideas I think can make the game deeper and more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any ideas/wishes about how the final game should look? Maybe the devs will like a few of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"simplemunrockets","CreatedById":22495,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T15:21:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe devs have said that Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Race into Space is an inspiration, so you might want to play it and see how it feels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: \u0022inspiration\u0022, not \u0022clone\u0022.
