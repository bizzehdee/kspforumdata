Any science from anywhere can be used to progress through the tech tree. A crew report from space high above Minmus can be used to unlock an inflatable heat-shield, or a rover wheel type, etc. This issue hurts immersion a little in my opinion, and has a lot of potential to be fully fleshed out, much like the other areas of science are, as we\u0027ve seen in leeks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think multiple science types could be used to overcome this issue. 3 types of science; surface, atmospheric, and general. 1 general, and 2 specialised categories would add some more logical progression to the tech tree, while also keeping things simple enough for new players to pick up quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESurface science:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCollected from surface based experiments, like surface samples, drillings, landed state temp/pressure readings, etc. This science would be used to unlock surfaced based technologies, like landing legs, lander engines, ladders, lander cans, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAtmospheric science:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCollected from air-based experiments, like high/low atmo crew reports, atmospheric analysis, temp/pressure readings in flight, etc. This science would be used to unlock air-based technologies, like heat-shields, wings, cockpits, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGeneral science:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be collected from all experiments, and would be used to unlock all other parts not covered by the other 2 categories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne experiment could also collect multiple types of science, and tech nodes could require multiple types of science to be unlocked, giving some extra complexity to later game science collection. If a planet has an atmosphere, a surface sample could give a lot of surface science, but also some atmospheric and general science; A high atmospheric temperature scan could give a lot of atmospheric science, some general science, and no surface science. All experiments would give some general science, and all tech nodes would require general science to unlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneral science would still be the focus of tech progression, but specialised parts would require specialised science, to hopefully add more coherency and logical sense to progression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DancZer","CreatedById":90711,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-05T16:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting idea and has a great potential.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lowi_Sace","CreatedById":224820,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-06T10:27:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nscience could also help in providing information about planets. Like (orbital) probes and Telescopes can provide information about admosphere hight and thickness, terrain (height), temperature and where recources are located. All this information could then be shown in the tracking station. Some informations could be shown in graphs (like admospberic thickness) and some with different map/planet view options. Like a heigh view, thermal view and a view options that shows recources. This could help you to plan a mission or where to construct a colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanets could also in time become clearer in tracking station (start out being pixelated and later have them there with great detail).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMultiple types of science could also be nice, but should not be to complex in my opinion.

The generic science points means that if I want to go to Eve, but I want an inflatable heat shield to help me, I can explore dres, eeloo, anywhere, and get what I need to go to Eve. If I had to collect atmospheric points however, then I\u0027d have to go to laythe and.. thats about it. Generic science points means that if you want to progress in the game in a specific direction, you\u0027re not limited in how you do it, with specific science points you now have a much narrower route to go down to get what you want. I think this is one of the better proposals I\u0027ve seen for specific sciences, I do like that you kept around generic science and kept the amount of sciences minimal, however I think the very freeform nature of all science being generic fits ksp the best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-14T07:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if you reversed that design?

I like that thought. And maybe science that you gather with your initial runs with the basic tools in each category will be required for further advances in that specific category. IE doing basic ground science can be done with science gained from any category, but to do more advanced ground science you\u0027d need (or at least want for the best efficiency) results from your basic ground science first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you can choose to specialize down a specific path a bit more, while still having the option to start trying out alternative science styles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
