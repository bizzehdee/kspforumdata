I couldn\u0027t find anything about it online.

Objects move through space-time at a constant speed. The speed of light. What changes is how much of that is along spatial directions. Because gravity is properly described as space-time curvature, the maximum local velocity will always be the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, you can exceed speed of light when passing a rotating black hole.
