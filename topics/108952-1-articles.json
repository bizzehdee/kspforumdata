7.5m diameter. 7.5m was the biggest fairings I had from the FASA pack, so that\u0027s where it became useful for me. I do intend a bunch of smaller fairings, and probably some \u0022down to pattern of N times 3.75m diameter parts\u0022 fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProjectrho, William Black, and myself are all getting our info from Mr Lowther\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.aerospaceprojectsreview.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.aerospaceprojectsreview.com\u003C/a\u003E and I am aware of their work. Making things function in KSP is a different beast than making a 3D model (although, there\u0027s clearly related work). And that\u0027s why the engines currently face directly down. I originally (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BA6qghy.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/BA6qghy.png\u003C/a\u003E) had them facing along the plug. This introduced some issues in KSP that I\u0027m still looking at correcting for, but I basically wanted to get the thrust numbers and direction correct before revisiting the angles for the rocket nozzles. I DO want to go back to that, in my opinion it looks awesome. But KSP thrust direction is the same as the visual effect direction, independent of any other bits, so there\u0027s issues with this. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and the new heat shield with integrated retro rockets now also has integrated probe core functions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Krakenfour\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Krakenfour\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it a massive truncated aerospike with integrated Airbrakes?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat pretty much describes the Nexus booster.

They also provide reality braking stopping power, just like KSP\u0027s aerobrakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there were between 4 and 12 of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to model this, there\u0027s 12 shell parts that can be either a plain outer shell or a flap. There were actually two types of flap as well, the other being pretty much the whole side panel. I have that modelled in blender, but not moved over to Unity yet. So it\u0027s just plain panel or the shaped aerobrake so far. I wanted to get the pistons working before fiddling with more than one flap type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerospike/plug system used 60 rocket nozzles instead of 10 or so, so there was less need to approximate a match to the cone using flattened nozzles. The aerospike is hollow because it\u0027s massive (with the weight to go along with that), and in an atmosphere, air passing through the hollow cone would help to provide a partial barrier and make the truncated plug act like a much longer spike. I don\u0027t have any firm details on the air flow through the cone on the Nexus, and I don\u0027t know if that was part of the design, but it seems to match. It seems like the saner way to build a very large aerospike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said before, I will be re-angling the rockets. I want to get the visual effects right, then after I have that, run some maths on how much that angling (in my estimation of how KSP works) will affect the thrust, and see if that holds true or not. Then adjust total thrust again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe control rockets are in blocks of 6, each block has 400,000 lbs thrust, which is out of step with William Blacks notes, so I\u0027ll need to double check my numbers. Maybe it was 400,000 lbs per nozzle, which would be 2.4Mlb, and about the 8M he\u0027s assigned to the controls. He\u0027s been commenting on my dev work over in the G\u002B KSP group, so I\u0027ll bug him as to where those numbers come from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is KSP, so you can add as many as you want, so 3 at a minimum to be able to angle any which way, and up to as many will fit. they\u0027re normal rockets though, so they suck a bit at low altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T01:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo is this a SeaDragon on steroids?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T03:22:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo what exactly is the purpose of something so massive, is it to loft entire interplanetary missions in one shot, put multiple refineries worth of fuel into orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T03:30:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TiktaalikDreaming\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TiktaalikDreaming\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-info snip-\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing some number crunching on the data I found, the control rockets should output 2,000,000lb thrust per block, which is ~333,333lb thrust per nozzle (but that doesnt matter because they\u0027re so comparatively small that one effect \u0026amp; thrust transform will work).
