Liquid bipropellant rockets should be more in the 25-50x range.\n\nOther design notes on the Kerbal X Heavy: each stage has bout the same delta-V, with the lion\u0027s share coming from the higher-efficiency upper stage (which is extended -- a pair of X200-16\u0027s / a X200-32, vs the single X200-16 of the original)."},{"CreatedByName":"lork","CreatedById":76776,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T12:31:19Z","Content":"I have one last question, does this mod works with the latest update of nearfuture propulsion?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T18:46:00Z","Content":"From a brief check of the new tank mass fractions, it works in the sense that nothing gets sent into negative masses or anything.  That said, there have been changes to the various tank mass fractions.\n\nThe xenon tanks have a more stock-like mass fraction, so they still get treated fairly.\n\nThe argon tanks are about 30% heavier than they used to be, which is now heavier than is predicted to be achievable.  I suspect that this was done for game balance reasons -- the argon tank mass fraction now matches the xenon tank mass fraction (tank mass = 78% fuel mass = 56% overall mass) -- but in reality, because the argon atom is so much lighter than the xenon atom, it just doesn\u0027t pack as densely at similar temperatures and pressures as xenon.  (The reason to consider argon vs. xenon is that it\u0027s more abundant and thus cheaper by orders of magnitude, which may offset the need to use more of it depending on the mission.  Not a big deal in the stock solar system, but in RSS...)  I\u0027ll include a fix for this at the next release.\n\nLiquid hydrogen tanks have been removed (and weren\u0027t being patched by recent versions of SMURFF anyway), and in Nertea\u0027s dev thread, there\u0027s some discussion going on about rebalancing them, including differentiating short-term lifter tanks and long-term orbital storage tanks via boiloff and mass ratios; we\u0027ll see how that goes.\n\nI have no idea about lithium -- presumably it can be stored as a solid quite efficiently, but it needs to be vaporized before being fed to the engines, which is hard enough on Earth and more so in microgravity, which will push up tank mass considerably.  I\u0027ll leave those alone until I can get a better idea about lithium engine technology."},{"CreatedByName":"komodo","CreatedById":102065,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T19:47:18Z","Content":"It took a minute to realize you were talking of NF Propulsion, then it clicked in ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T03:27:09Z","Content":"[@Kerbas_ad_astra](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/126593-kerbas_ad_astra/) [@komodo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102065-komodo/) I just realized I should mention. I don\u0027t think ROMini does this, either. Need to rescale any override drag cubes when the parts rescale.\n\nHappily I wrote some code in RO to do this, which you\u0027re both free to use ( [@komodo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102065-komodo/) you should do it in a script, since that avoids having to pre-specify the number of cubes ).

I might be able to get away with rescaling just command pods (filtering by looking for ModuleCommand and a comma in bulkheadProfiles - that is, two different sizes), since I\u0027m not aware of any (stock or mod) which use MODEL nodes or custom drag cubes, but then some of the old radial sizes don\u0027t map to proper new sizes (1 and 2 get mapped to 1.5 and 3, which is OK, but 0.5 and 3 get stuck in limbo).  Compatibility is also a concern -- growing the pods is one thing, but I don\u0027t know enough about KSP\u0027s inner workings to say how everything attached to them will react.\n\nThis leaves mass as the other lever to fix ballistic coefficients.  Heat shields are way heavy (1300 kg for 2.5-meter stock shield vs. 850 kg for the 3.9-meter Apollo shield and 272 kg for the 1.9-meter Mercury shield), so there\u0027s room to improve there.  Command pods are not as consistent as fuel tanks and engines, which makes me hesitant to tinker there, but a 50% cut across the board will bring capsule ballistic coefficients in between the Apollo/Orion/Gemini values (450-500 kg/m^2) and Soyuz (800 kg/m^2) -- stock parts lead to values of 1100\u002B kg/m^2, and a 50% cut to pods and shields will reduce that by not-quite-half (since parachutes, docking ports, etc. aren\u0027t being patched).  Not all crew parts are balanced equally, but cabins are ~0.4-0.6 tons per Kerbal and command pods are ~0.6-1.3 tons per Kerbal.  The Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo capsules were ~1-1.8 tons per human, and the 747 (minus engines) is about 0.4 tons per passenger, but humans are about twice as large as Kerbals.  Not all components of a life-supporting craft can scale quadratically or cubically with size, so I\u0027m okay with fixing the mass buff to 50%.  (After the deductions for internal monoprop tanks.)\n\nThis is all subject to lots more testing on my part.  When I played with RSS in 1.0.4, I had several (single-digit number) successful recoveries from LEO and the Moon and one failure on a lunar-return trajectory (failed to decelerate to a safe chute-deploy speed, if I recall correctly) -- not a whole lot of data (no suborbital flights at all), and I\u0027m not a typical player.  I\u0027m planning to make a release tomorrow with just the argon rebalance for NFT, and then we\u0027ll see when I get time to stand up a 1.0.5 RSS install and start lobbing pods around."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T14:25:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Joco223 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a mod that limits number of ignitions on engines but its without real fuels?

With stock pod and heat shield masses, pods generally slow down to a safe speed (~260 m/s) at around 2 km above sea level. This makes for a harrowing reentry over water, requiring Jeb-like reflexes and attention to the speedometer to open the parachute right when the speed is low enough, and will likely make overland landings infeasible.  The 4K couldn\u0027t even manage that -- it plunged into the water at over 300 m/s.  On the other hand, with pod and heat shield masses halved, pods of various sizes were slow enough between 4 and 6 km (except the 4K, but even that one made it at 2500 m when it outright crashed before).\n\n(This is what drogues are for, but the player doesn\u0027t get them until Advanced Landing at level 6 of the tech tree, so they really shouldn\u0027t be assumed to be available, especially for early suborbital flights.)\n\nNext up is orbital reentry testing, both from low orbit and high-energy return (e.g. lunar).  Based on the suborbital testing and comparisons I made above, I\u0027m determined to cut the masses; I just need to verify that the heat shields still do their jobs when they\u0027re put to the test.\n\nAlso coming down the pipeline: the patches are going to be FOR[zSMURFF], since SpaceY\u0027s Cryogenic Engines patches were running FOR[SpaceY-Expanded], overwriting the thrust buff when they deleted and recreated the engine modules (SP comes after SM)."}]}
