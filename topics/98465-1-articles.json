Line up for one of the flats, (I went for the greater flats). start with the plane pointing retrograde in orbit, upside-down (landing gear towards the sky). Burn retro so that my trajectory meets the flats just after the near end. Pitch down so that the nose is pointing 45 degrees up/backwards, still upside down. Deploy landing gear. at about 150m altitude, burn until my vertical velocity is between -5 and -10 m/s. At this point I am doing about 120 m/s. Pitch \u0022down\u0022 (nose goes over the top) so that I am in a slight nose-up landing attitude, use RCS to try to keep vertical velocity below 10 m/s, and hold down RCS in retro direction to try to kill as much speed as possible. Touchdown takes place at about 105 m/s. So far, I\u0027ve attempted it 4 times, but I haven\u0027t managed to keep control after touchdown, each time I yaw a bit, a wing tip goes down, makes contact and provides a spectacular fireworks display, but I\u0027m sure it can be done. Anyone else managed this? Is there a better approach?

While on Kerbin or any atmosphere based celestial body you\u0027re going to have air resistance plus ground resistance to slow yourself down, on a place like minmus you can only rely on the ground friction.

There are lots of relatively easy solutions to the problem \u0022land something on Minmus\u0022. That\u0027s easy, I\u0027ve done it tons of times with built-for-the-job craft. I also agree that landing tail-first with a space plane is probably the easiest way to solve the problem of getting a space-plane onto the surface of Minmus. These are all well and good, but the challenge I set myself was landing a spaceplane on Minmus, using the flats as a nice open flat runway, in a way that resembles a plane landing on a runway. I wanted to do this not because it\u0027s the best way to get a space plane onto the surface of Minmus, but basically because I thought it would be cool. In achieving it, I can confirm it is definitely cool, and Jeb approves. My advice to others trying to achieve the same thing is to keep landing speed to below about 80 m/s, and vertical speed at touchdown below about 10 m/s, and to make absolutely 100% certain that you are absolutely pointed in the direction of travel when you touchdown, because any slight yaw angle will cause your destruction. Also, bring lots of monopropellant or a retro engine to slow down with, because brakes don\u0027t work well on Minmus. When taking off again, it is possible to lift off the surface simply by burning your engines on a straight horizontal takeoff roll, but unless you pitch up, chances are from the flats, you will not clear the higher terrain beyond.
