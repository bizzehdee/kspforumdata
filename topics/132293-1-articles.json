A few of the adjustments are sort of traditional for video games (ie. no quicksaves). But most of it is basically just adding more grinding to the game (reducing science awards, reducing contract payments, making parts cost more, etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt occurred to me that a real \u0022difficulty\u0022 process would be adding more gameplay complexity, not just more grinding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Simple: Nothing but thrusting and fuel. Infinite electricity. No re-entry heating. No monetary cost. No science. All engines, tanks, capsules, parachutes, structural parts, landing legs, ladders available right from the start, but nothing else. Basically a simple sandbox. [Similar to the sandbox game, but not with all the parts.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Easy: Same as above, but add science requirement and tech tree. Add Kerbal experience and skill differentiation. Still free. Still infinite electricity. [Similar to the science game.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Normal: Add electricty (and all the parts associated with it). Add re-entry heat (and all the parts associated with it). Add money. Add contracts for exploration and science. Researching parts still free. [Similar to the career game in an easy mode.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Harder: Add life support (and parts associated with it). Add tourism. Add parts and contracts for bases and stations. Researching parts costs money. Add research lab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Hardest: More complicated life support (and associated parts)? Add com relay system and parts. Add more complicated mission requirements (like to establish a base, keep it going for X amount of time, research X amount of science in a lab, rove a certain distance, etc.). Parts need to be prototyped and tested (maybe they have two stages of efficiency and only get to the second stage after being used several times). Part failures can happen during testing. Designs that have been prototyped and used before are cheaper; customized launches with designs you have never made before are more expensive. Etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I know that individually most of this stuff can be done with mods and roleplay, but that\u0027s the point. It\u0027s doable. And it\u0027s a real progression of difficulty and gameplay, not just more grinding of the same \u0022land in a new biome, collect the science, fly home\u0022 stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-17T00:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2016 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T03:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis certainly sounds better than \u0022Do the same things with less money and get less science\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T04:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what happens after a few hours in Easy mode, when a player realizes he is getting the hang of it and wants to build bases and stations?

Sure, there are a lot of details to be figured out and tweaked, but the general idea of adding complexity instead of grindiness is great. It\u0027s always been one of the main problems of career mode that the \u0022difficulty\u0022 is mainly more grinding.

Doing simulations is a compromise on my end too. Most of my launches are \u0027fake\u0027, but this way at least the real ones are really tense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure I -could- play a hardcore game without such feature, but it would require me to triple-check everything and not to take take risks or untested solutions.

For example if I adding a subassembly messed up the staging and the rocket decouples the launch tower, and just slams into the pad and explodes, i\u0027ll revert, or if there is a bug in the VAB that causes a part to randomly fall out (had this happen a few times).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in my eyes, i deserve to lose a crew for stuff that is my fault and is realistic in the game context.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some reason I had a kerbal outside my jet while crusing, and she fell to her death, it wasn\u0027t a bug it was just me being dumb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr more hilarious was on EVA on a suborbital, and realizing the ship was deorbiting, and using the EVA pack to try and catch the ship but it kept on getting further and further away, I was chasing it james bond skydiving style, alas right before I almost reached it, it really started hauling ass and the kerbal and ship were lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr how about just a really dumb ship design that turns into a snake and breaks in half on takeoff, it\u0027s not a bug, it\u0027s just bad ship building, If I really wanted that crew to survive I hope there is a launch abort system!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut really ,the reason I WANT to play with consequences (But not so much that it destroys the game) is because of situations like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built my first SSTO MK2 space plane, it after many failed experiments that didn\u0027t get into orbit I made a MK2 liquid fuel only SSTO with LV-N for orbital maneuvering, I Was so full of Hubris that I said \u0022Now to make a REAL cargo space plane\u0022. SO I build this giant monstrosity, \u00A0I can\u0027t remeber if it was using MK3 or MK4 parts, I think MK4. Long story short, It\u0027s climbing and climbing higher and higher, everything seems fine, untill... it wont climb any higher, this thing can barely turn at all, and I want to say around 30 or 40k it starts tumbling hard, it\u0027s just uncontrolled stall death spiral, Not enough command authority to recover any control i\u0027m just dropping like a stone, thousands of kilometers fly by as this giant monster of a ship just tumbles to the seat... But then... slowly I start to gain control, i\u0027ve stopped the tumbling but i\u0027m still falling like a rock, i\u0027m stable but aiming straight down, 3000k to impact! Slowly... so slowly.. i\u0027m just nosing up a tiny bit at a time, still falling fast, and finnaly with just a few hundred Kilometers to go I level out an start climbing again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in reality, It was almost certainly going to be a messy death for the crew, through some luck and some skill I recovered it, but if I just played it as a simulation, or just revered at the first sign of trouble, I think I would have sold myself short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for me part of the fun of the game is life or death challenges, sure i\u0027ll revert if it\u0027s a really cheap annoying bug or a simple oversight (like you said I don\u0027t really want to do a full flight checklist) but I just wish there was a way to have the financial restraint of career mode, where you need to mind the cost of a ship, it\u0027s mission, limited parts unlocks, without being too worried about failure. I\u0027m not looking to have a kerbal holocaust, I just want to play it straight, and sometimes you loose astronauts, but just because people die in space, the mission goes on. Early air travel and commercial airline flights were very dangerous by todays standards, I want my early attempts to have casualties, it\u0027ll be a good motivator to invest in surviability and unmanned drones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, I don\u0027t want to go bankrupt buying crew that cost more than a rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBACK ON TOPIC!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m, all for non-grind based difficult as mentioned!

The kerbals need to become autonomous if the player wishes (allowing them to be tasked with certain routine operations, like resupply). Time needs to be meaningful, and something more like budgets, and other costs (abstracted, I have no desire to micromanage that). The gameplay would be adjusting what you can do with what you have, or are given. You\u0027d LIKE to send kerbals to Duna, but you just cannot afford to, you\u0027ll need to skip the next couple launch windows, though maybe you can send a probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy \u0022random\u0022 solar system is for a career mode that is about \u003Cem\u003Eexploration\u003C/em\u003E.

If the first time you could make out features of Tylo was your first flyby, it would be kind of exciting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestions regarding a \u0022Space Race\u0022 mode are another kind of gameplay, that incentivizes the player to take calculated risks to \u0022win\u0022 given objectives. Totally different play than stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that the broad goal of career needs to be looked at. IMO, career/campaign modes exist to present the player with novel problems to solve that exist within/because of a context. In a military game, you get stuck fighting a bad engagement where you are not remotely matched sometimes, while other times you luck out and come across an inferior force. Using that analogy KSP is always the same. Failures might add needed variability... you can get your Apollo 13 moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
