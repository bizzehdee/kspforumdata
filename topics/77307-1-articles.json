It will allow the player to choose a safe landing zone or just looking for fun/interesting places to see. Taking picture while having a low orbit on the hidden face could get few science point either for exemple\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T20:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes!

Space telescopes should do more (and allow us at least to Dres and Moho accurately) but we should have to send a probe with a telescope to the outer planets to get good images of them. It seems that getting into the SOI on a flyby would be good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when we have to use telescopes to narrow down orbit data we should have to send a probe to the outer planets in addition and only have a vague idea of where the planet is until that point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bean","CreatedById":70878,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T11:28:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScansat kind of covers this role right now, but I wouldn\u0027t mind the introduction of a camera system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fly me to the moon","CreatedById":113600,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T22:08:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bean\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bean\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EScansat kind of covers this role right now, but I wouldn\u0027t mind the introduction of a camera system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EI have just tested Scansat, so far it seems a good mod with lots of info and a cool map \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Ehere\u0027s what the mod does according to the dwl page : \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ERADAR Altimetry Sensor : The basic RADAR scanner.
