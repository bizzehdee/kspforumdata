It can\u0027t erase the fact that nonzero pressure (very nonzero pressure, a hundred kilopascals worth of nonzero pressure) exists at sea level. All an aerospike nozzle does is ensure that you have a nearly-optimal expansion ratio at any given pressure. In effect (tl;dr) that means an aerospike will do \u003Cem\u003Enearly as well \u003Cstrong\u003Eas it can\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E at any given ambient pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, here\u0027s the deal. A rocket engine works like this: propellants combust in a combustion chamber. That combustion has a pressure. The result is then fed through a narrow throat out into a nozzle (the thrust chamber), where it expands while going downwards. That creates thrust. Thrust is optimal for a given ambient pressure if that nozzle expands the exhaust such that, at the nozzle exit, the pressure of the exhaust is the same as the ambient pressure. However, Isp is governerned by how much expansion occurs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means for example that a combustion chamber with low pressure works acceptably in vacuum. This is because even low pressure exhaust can be expanded lots, since ambient pressure is zero and you\u0027ll never hit that. However, a low chamber pressure engine is crap at sea level, because you can\u0027t expand very much at all before you hit ambient pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s one reason, intuitively, why rockets don\u0027t work as well at sea level: there isn\u0027t very much to expand. The second reason is even simpler (and ties into the first of course): at sea level, or indeed in any atmosphere period, \u003Cem\u003Ethe air is piushing back at the exhaust. \u003C/em\u003EIn vacuum, nothing is pushing back, so you get the full effect of the exhaust. At sea level, there\u0027s a hundred kilopascals pushing back at the exhaust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, why an aerospike? As I discussed above, in order to get the optimum Isp for that chamber pressure and reaction efficiency, you need to expand the results to ambinet pressure. However, if you do that with a simple bell nozzle, you only are optimal for a single ambient pressure; at all other pressures (i.e. all other altitudes) you will either be expanding too little (any pressure lower than the design pressure) or too much (any pressure higher than the design pressure). An aerospike gets around this by varying the expansion. It will \u003Cem\u003Enever be as efficient as a bell at that bell\u0027s optimal pressure\u003C/em\u003E--the \u0022fake\u0022 nozzle is not quite as efficient as a real one, so you take a slight loss across the board--but it will be rather more efficient than that bell at \u003Cem\u003Enon-optimal\u003C/em\u003E pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, let\u0027s move to the aerospike ingame. You\u0027ll note that it basically follows the above: It is never quite as efficient as the optimal engine in any given regime. It\u0027s slightly less efficient than the Mammoth/Vector at sea level, and it\u0027s slightly less efficient than the Poodle in vacuum. However, its true advantage is that the falloff in efficiency\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003Eat pressures \u003Cem\u003Ehigher\u003C/em\u003E than sea level (i.e. Eve) is much, much more gradual than bell engiens\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo sum up: No, the aerospike is not a Magic Engine (tm) that can someone get around the fact that at sea level there\u0027s a shedload of air being shoved at you, making chucking high velocity gas out the back less efficient. Indeed, it is not as efficient getting around that as the best bell-nozzle engine, nor would it even be as efficient as a non-optimal bell-nozzled engine \u003Cem\u003Ewhich had a higher chamber pressure than the aerospike\u003C/em\u003E. However, it \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E manage to minimize the losses from having a non-optimal bell \u003Cem\u003Eno matter the ambient pressure\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
