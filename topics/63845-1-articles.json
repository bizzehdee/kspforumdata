This would be immesurably useful in flying ships that split apart or come together, or just fly separately, but in which more than one ship needs to be controlled at once. One particular example would be using an aircraft to launch a spacecraft: you set the primary controller to the aircraft cockpit and the secondary to the spaceship command capsule--at first only the primary controller has control. The aircraft launches into a high arc that takes it outside of usable atmosphere, then they undock and suddenly the secondary controller gains control of the rocket, but the screen stays focused on the center of mass between the two initially. Now the primary controller can fly the plane back to KSC or wherever and land, while the spaceship ascends off to orbit. Once the two craft get very far apart from each other, the screen splits seamlessly and allows each to keep their eyes on the craft they are controlling. The screen split distance is dependent on the camera zoom level until they get far enough apart (maybe 1km) and each controller can control their own zoom level while the view will remain split regardless of zoom level. Finally, the computer must treat each spacecraft as separate control points, and be loading and centering two separate grids on these craft. If only one was treated as the center of activity, the other one would get eaten by the kraken once it got far enough away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think what this requires from a programmer\u0027s standpoint is the ability to load and render certain game functions in duplicate form, allowing one duplicate to begin to separate from the other (when the craft separate) while maintaining game continuity between them. Time warp would obviously be controlled only by the primary controller, and would be subject to the limitation that all currently controlled ships must be in a warpable state before time warp can be entered. I\u0027m not sure if dual core processors and 64-bit unity/OS are needed/recommended for this but I assume they are, so there\u0027s another hurdle potentially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDisclaimer:\u003C/strong\u003E this is not a suggestion that multiplayer be added, it is a suggestion of how to accomplish adding multiplayer capability to KSP. I don\u0027t understand the mechanics of programming all this in, but I can see what goals need to be met and I know there are several video games (Call of Duty, for instance) which use this hotseat method to excellent effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-21T03:09:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2014 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
