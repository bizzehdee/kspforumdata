For 1.0, we have a poor choice about that. There is the DERP Pod by RoverDude and some inflatable for Life Support or Crew. \n\nWhile it\u0027s so important to optimize space and weight for a \u0022real\u0022 space program, it would be good to have a series of inflatable part, including also fuel tanks. \n\nWhen we have to build large interplanetary ships, we must do many launches, with huge payloads, while maybe with a single launch we can send in orbit a couple of fuel tank and some crew storage.\n\nAnyone interested in that?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T06:30:29Z","Content":"Of course, but basically it\u0027s more parts, and for now we are waiting for the 64bits update that would make much easier to add them.\n\nMyself I\u0027m also waiting for them to redo completely the Tech-Tree into something that actually serve gameplay.\n\n[/snarky snarkiness]"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T12:53:21Z","Content":"I agree"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralGuacamole","CreatedById":144627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T01:00:24Z","Content":"I agree"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:35:01Z","Content":"Sure, it sounds like an interesting idea. It would presumably function sort of like the OX solar panels - small and relatively sturdy when packed, but does not provide any of its usual functionality until it is deployed, at which point it becomes more fragile and cannot be repacked."},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T07:38:00Z","Content":"Exactly!
