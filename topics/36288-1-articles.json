I used way to much fuel. I know there\u0027s gotta be a more efficient way. With Engineer redux I waited for the proper phase angle when Eeloo came closest to the sun. I\u0027m not for gravity assists so I build ships capable of burning straight out. I follow the burn data given by that website that does the math. ( forget the name..its late. On a phone.. ) And it says I need over 2k d/v to make the burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I shoot straight out of the SoI. At the descending node I make a correction burn to intercept Eeloo. Success..except I ended up in a polar orbit. Then the landing craft flames out after the deorbit burn. No fuel..forgot to cut the crossfeed. Anyway they all died so besides that I\u0027m basically looking for general tips for the next trip out. How do you go about the ejection burn? When to compensate for Eeloo\u0027s inclination? ( before SoI, after, midway? ) and how can I shoot for a nice prograde equatorial orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"painking","CreatedById":69085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T05:20:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a little curious myself. I make a point to carry more fuel than I need since I don\u0027t know how to fine tune my intercept inclinations, only how to get closer. I got in a about 50Mm orbit around Eeloo that was also polar but polar was exactly what I was aiming for so it was ok, but I had enough to fuel to go equatorial if I wanted. My guess would be to make sure your intersect is behind Eeloo, and start the inclination changing burn as you get close to it, so you can line up it equatorially. Maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T07:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese days I often aim for a very low periapsis when going to the outer planets (well, Jool. Haven\u0027t got as far as Eeloo yet), and make sure I get the relative inclination as low as possible at the ascending/descending node. Then I can fix the orbit up to be equatorial with very little delta V just as I change SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably need a bigger burn with Eeloo, as it has a smaller SOI, but the planet is much smaller too, so you won\u0027t have to go as far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all relies on you changing SOI near to the equatorial plane of the planet, but that tends to fall out if you concentrate on utterly nailing that inclination burn, which Engineer Redux can really help with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T09:40:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI normally use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elaunch window planner\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEjection burn - I normally start by creating a burn with the required DV then dragging it around the orbit until it ends up in the right direction, escaping Kerbin parallel to Kerbin\u0027s direction of travel.

I use that to fine tune my approach to the target in order to get an equatorial, prograde orbit.
