They have unveiled their Dragon V2 (manned) spacecraft. Which, with it\u0027s counterpart- the SpaceX Falcon 9 reuseable boaster will be reused by landing on a specific site after the launch. Either a barge or on land. \n\nHowever I have a question about SpaceX\u0027s capsule... as it stands to be along side Boeing\u0027s space capsule as the manned transport vehicle to LEO. SX plans on having it\u0027s capsule land via ENGINES and no parachutes on its return.\n\nI personally find this (although a \u0022cool\u0022 idea) a all together BAD idea. It is risky- and it costs more per capsule... and capsules CAN be reused using the old parachute landing method. To give a new perspective- this new SX capsule with be the ONLY manned spacecraft to return to Earth and NOT use a parachute. As the Mercury capsules used them- so did Gemini, Apollo, AND the Space Shuttles after making contact with the runway (granted a drogue chute and not used like the others- it still was used). The Russians even used them for the Soyuz (The Vostok spacecraft did not use them but at the same time the pilot ditched the spacecraft before landing using personal parachutes).\n\nA normal spacecraft has several advantages over SX\u0027s most recent design:\n\n**Parachutes**- guaranteed to work, as long as they deploy, and if they don\u0027t you pack reserves.\n\n**More reliability**- To date (as far as I\u0027m aware of) we have lost 0 pilots to post-re-entry (i.e. After the re-entry effects have diminished)... leaving the classic capsule style as the best option.\n\n**Just as accurate**- If SX\u0027s boast is that it can make a specific landing site, then it\u0027s wrong! As capsules can land in specific places as well! As long as it\u0027s in the capsules orbital path. Sure it has more control over landing but then you run into issues...\n\nIssues with SX\u0027s design:\n\n**More parts to fail**- with more systems and MORE engines to fire- you increase the possible failure rate and likely hood and with the engines being your ONLY hope of landing failure of ONE rocket could cause you to have off-center thrust which can cause MANY issues. \n\n**Uses the MAX LES setup**- Instead of the well known tower escape device (commonly known as LES/LAS (Launch Escape/Abort System)), SX will use a dome device which fires multiple engines to have the same effect of launching it up and away from the launch vehicle... however using that setup is (again) more to fail. As your firing multiple engines rather than one in a common LES/LAS setup.\n\n**More expinsive per use**- The SX setup will cost far more per use and construction per capsule than any other (potentially including the new Orion capsule)\n\nBenefits of the SX design:\n\nReuseable- Being able to be recovered at a specific landing site and less parts lost on landing.\n\nSo am the only one who feels this? Or am I mistaken on this and not seeing something ingenius that makes this worth while?"},{"CreatedByName":"JedTech","CreatedById":104003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:45:34Z","Content":"Because this:\n\n![dragon%20landing.gif](https://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5387ed0a6bb3f7dd3fc3e61f/dragon%20landing.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:51:32Z","Content":"NASA wants parachute landings, and they\u0027re the only existing customer for Dragon.

They pretty much have to land on water due to only being able to hit a target miles across. And salt water wrecks everything it gets into contact with making reuse uneconomical due to everything needing complete refurbishment like the shuttle boosters.

Despite the technical difficulties up to that point, Komarov might still have landed safely. To slow the descent, first the drogue parachute was deployed, followed by the main parachute. However, due to a defect, the main parachute did not unfold; the exact reason for the main parachute malfunction is disputed.[6] [7]*\n\n*Komarov then activated the manually deployed reserve chute, but it became tangled with the drogue chute, which did not release as intended. As a result, the Soyuz reentry module fell to Earth in Orenburg Oblast almost entirely unimpeded, at about 40 m/s (140 km/h; 89 mph). A rescue helicopter spotted the descent module lying on its side with the parachute spread across the ground. The retrorockets then started firing which concerned the rescuers since they were supposed to activate a few moments prior to touchdown. By the time they landed and approached, the descent module was in flames with black smoke filling the air and streams of molten metal dripping from the exterior. The entire base of the capsule had burned through and by this point, it was obvious that Komarov had not survived, but there was no code signal for a cosmonaut\u0027s death, so the rescuers fired a signal flare calling for medical assistance. Another group of rescuers in an aircraft then arrived and attempted to extinguish the blazing spacecraft with portable fire extinguishers. This proved insufficient and they instead began using shovels to throw dirt onto it. The descent module then completely disintegrated, leaving only a pile of debris topped by the entry hatch. When the fire at last ended, the rescuers were able to dig through the rubble to find Komarov\u0027s remains strapped into the center couch. Doctors pronounced the cause of death to be from multiple blunt-force injuries.*\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_1)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T04:11:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 04:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mrfox**"}]}
