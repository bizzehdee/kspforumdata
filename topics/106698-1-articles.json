They have unveiled their Dragon V2 (manned) spacecraft. Which, with it\u0027s counterpart- the SpaceX Falcon 9 reuseable boaster will be reused by landing on a specific site after the launch. Either a barge or on land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I have a question about SpaceX\u0027s capsule... as it stands to be along side Boeing\u0027s space capsule as the manned transport vehicle to LEO.

It is risky- and it costs more per capsule... and capsules CAN be reused using the old parachute landing method. To give a new perspective- this new SX capsule with be the ONLY manned spacecraft to return to Earth and NOT use a parachute. As the Mercury capsules used them- so did Gemini, Apollo, AND the Space Shuttles after making contact with the runway (granted a drogue chute and not used like the others- it still was used). The Russians even used them for the Soyuz (The Vostok spacecraft did not use them but at the same time the pilot ditched the spacecraft before landing using personal parachutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA normal spacecraft has several advantages over SX\u0027s most recent design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EParachutes\u003C/strong\u003E- guaranteed to work, as long as they deploy, and if they don\u0027t you pack reserves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMore reliability\u003C/strong\u003E- To date (as far as I\u0027m aware of) we have lost 0 pilots to post-re-entry (i.e. After the re-entry effects have diminished)... leaving the classic capsule style as the best option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJust as accurate\u003C/strong\u003E- If SX\u0027s boast is that it can make a specific landing site, then it\u0027s wrong!

Only with more performance hit, because you don\u0027t drop it partway into the flight. Personally I always liked the solid escape tower idea - like the standard capsule shape it was one of those first ideas that just stuck because it works so well.

Despite the technical difficulties up to that point, Komarov might still have landed safely. To slow the descent, first the drogue parachute was deployed, followed by the main parachute. However, due to a defect, the main parachute did not unfold; the exact reason for the main parachute malfunction is disputed.[6] [7]\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKomarov then activated the manually deployed reserve chute, but it became tangled with the drogue chute, which did not release as intended. As a result, the Soyuz reentry module fell to Earth in Orenburg Oblast almost entirely unimpeded, at about 40 m/s (140 km/h; 89 mph). A rescue helicopter spotted the descent module lying on its side with the parachute spread across the ground. The retrorockets then started firing which concerned the rescuers since they were supposed to activate a few moments prior to touchdown. By the time they landed and approached, the descent module was in flames with black smoke filling the air and streams of molten metal dripping from the exterior. The entire base of the capsule had burned through and by this point, it was obvious that Komarov had not survived, but there was no code signal for a cosmonaut\u0027s death, so the rescuers fired a signal flare calling for medical assistance. Another group of rescuers in an aircraft then arrived and attempted to extinguish the blazing spacecraft with portable fire extinguishers. This proved insufficient and they instead began using shovels to throw dirt onto it. The descent module then completely disintegrated, leaving only a pile of debris topped by the entry hatch. When the fire at last ended, the rescuers were able to dig through the rubble to find Komarov\u0027s remains strapped into the center couch. Doctors pronounced the cause of death to be from multiple blunt-force injuries.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T04:11:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 04:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mrfox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
