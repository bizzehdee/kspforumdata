Have turned it off a few times. Just started using the Vector. Awesomely powerful but the gimbal about tore my craft apart. Went a little wet noodle. I know I can right click and adjust. My question is any tips on how/where to set it? I know pretty vague, hopefully you understand what I am asking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T18:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Vector has a pretty big gimbal range compared to all the other engines. You can right-click and limit the gimbal range (just like limiting the thrust).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you aren\u0027t opposed to add-ons, I\u0027ve also created a small mod that allows you to mess with gimbal movement speed.

Almost grabbed it earlier. Vector - I know it wasn\u0027t necessaily intended to be used as I did but, during the circularization burn the movement was so fast and so extreme the Navball marker was making a circle around prograde.
