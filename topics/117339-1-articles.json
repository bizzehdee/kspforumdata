Perhaps it\u0027s the same bug with fairings. Here is my attempt to explain what\u0027s happening:\n\nAfter [this](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/327-On-Cargo-Bays-and-Part-Occlusion?page=6#comments) explanation (\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So taking a step back, what we really need is a solution that hits the \u0027predictability\u0027 zone, where if something *looks* like it should be contained, it should be contained. The emphasis is on the word \u0027looks\u0027 there, you\u0027ll see why in a bit.\n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s how we tackle the problem of detecting containment: \n\u003E \n\u003E \\* The cargo bay first detects all parts inside a spherical radius that entirely encloses it. Those are the nearby parts that will be tested. This detection method is independent of vessel relationships, being solely dependent on the position of parts. A lot of the parts in this first list will be outside the bay, and that\u0027s fine. We just do this to avoid having to iterate through every single part in every single vessel.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Next, we compute a centroid point for the part, based on its renderer bounds. That centroid is then a product of the part\u0027s visual mesh, not dependent on attachment position, center of mass or even colliders. It\u0027s the *visual center* of the part. This is now our reference to test the part in a visually accurate way.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* We then rule out any part whose centroid lies outside the merged visual bounds of the cargo bay itself. This is just a sanity check to avoid performing needless calculations on parts that are clearly outside the cargo area already. The *merged* bounds are a bounding box we calculate off all renderer bounds, to encompass the entirety of the part. This is necessary as cargo bays (or fairings) can potentially be made out of multiple objects, meaning multiple renderers, and multiple bounds, hence the need to merge them.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* So, we now end up with a much shorter list, comprised of nothing but parts which are in a reasonable range to warrant further testing. Now it\u0027s time to really check whether we are in or out of the bay.\n\u003E \n\u003E [a quick note here to explain that all this is done with the assumption that the bay doors are closed. If they are open, no part would be considered as shielded by that cargo bay, so that\u0027s something we can safely not worry about]\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* The test itself is simply a raycast, from each part\u0027s visual centroid to the bay\u0027s own centroid. Now, the thing with raycasts is that they can (and do) hit any parts along the way, and we don\u0027t want that. We are just concerned with the bay itself and each part, in isolation. This testing then is done against only the bay\u0027s own colliders. \n\u003E \n\u003E \\* From this we can now determine if a part is inside or outside of the bay with a pretty decent level of accuracy. If the raycast reaches the bay centroid without hitting anything, we can be quite sure it\u0027s inside the bay. If it hits anything, it must by necessity have been a wall of the bay itself, and therefore must be outside the bay. \n\u003E \n\u003E Now, you may be wondering then, what of the open sides of the bays then? Surely there is no wall there. Indeed there isn\u0027t, but that doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t add a \u0027wall\u0027 that only exists to catch a raycast. Trigger type colliders will do just that in fact, so for all testing purposes the open ends of the cargo bays are effectively closed. This still lets you pass though the open spaces normally, but catches the raycasting so we have a fully enclosed volume which defines the cargo bay.\n\n) the game determines a part as occluded in cargo bays after the following tests:\n\n1. Is the parts reference point within the sphere of the cargobay? The radius of the sphere can be found in the cfgs: MODULE[ModuleCargoBay] -\u003E lookupRadius. It seems to me, that the origin is the center of mass of the cargo bay, because the radius has mostly the same absolute value as the y-axis-value of the attachment nodes.\n2. If 1. is true the part has to have a clear line of sight to the origin of the sphere, no other parts are accounted for.\n\nIf both tests are true the part is occluded if the cargo bay is closed.\n\nNow the problem is, that in some cases the lookupRadius is too small. We\u0027ve to consider the absolute value of a 3-dimensional vector from the origin of the sphere to the farest point inside the cargo bay. \n\nHere you can see what happens under test 1. for the large Mk2 cargo bay (pay attention that this is only a 2-dimensional circle, KSP uses a sphere):\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/JuYlb)\n\nAs a result there are two solutions for this:\n\n- don\u0027t attach parts near to the edges of the cargo bays\n- increase lookupRadius in the configs\n\nDuring my tests I\u0027ve recognized another thing, which might lead to the **warp bug**:\n\nIt seems that either the sphere of the cargo bay or the reference point of the parts or the collider of the cargo bay changes depending on the orientation of the craft. In the pictures below I\u0060ve built a craft with clipped intakes near to the cargo bay. On the runway and at the most angles I could open and close the cargo bay without problems. But at an pitch angle of ~30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 the game decided that the intakes are suddenly occluded after closing the cargo bay.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/Utze8)\n\nThe observations above and the jumping flux values (already mentioned in other threads) lead me to assume that the jumping values are just a symptom of undefined states for parts, either occluded or not or non-constistent states between two iterations or when (un)packing a craft for default warp. Possible that physics warp causes the game to skip some iterations?!?\n\nFor the last assumption pls keep in mind, that I\u0027m not a programer and I\u0027ve no clue how KSP works internally. So perhaps I\u0027m wrong with the warp bug, but the spheres are partly wrong for sure.\n\nedit: I forgot to mention, that the conv. flux and rad. flux sometimes disappears for non-occluded parts between mach 1 and mach 2. Not sure why...\n\nCrafts for testing:\n\n[Mk2-cargobay-battery test I](http://workupload.com/file/rRAbflYI)\n\n[Mk2-cargobay-intake test II](http://workupload.com/file/0OG0LMlW)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T23:41:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 11:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by funk**"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T20:11:55Z","Content":"I assume this happens with service bays too?

Further you won\u0027t have your ore tanks filled up, so the thermal mass of the tanks is low.

For example a part is occluded , but shouldn\u0027t or vice versa. After investigations so far the occlusion bug is caused by:\n\n1. Incomplete spheres of the cargo and service bays and probably fairings (has to be tested). I\u0027m working on a MM-Patch to increase lookupRadius of the bays to reasonable values.\n2. Inconsistent or non reliable points of reference for parts which are inside the spheres.\n3. Problems with colliders of the bays\n\nI had some issues with a spaceplane a while ago. Parts suddenly explode during reentry due to overheating. Usually I\u0027m using 4x physics warp during reentry. I had to descent with open cargo bays (which was suprisingly easy:)). After the tests above I decided to load the craft again to investigate the issues. I\u0027ve successfully rebuilt a simplified, but similiar stock craft to reproduce the **super heating bug** (expression stolen from Claws awesome stockbugfix thread,thx), which describes suddenly exploding parts during 4x-physics warp. [Test-Craftfile](http://workupload.com/file/BqGmxmyF)\n\nThe following results and questions showed up during testing:\n\nocclusion-bug:\n\n- the occlusion tests are proceeded once, when the cargo bays have been closed or when the vessel is leaving non-physics warp. That means a part can be occluded before entering non-physics warp, but isn\u0027t after leaving non-physics warp.\n- occlusion, especially at the edges of the spheres, depends on the orientation of the craft. It will have to be tested/explained, if this is caused by a changing reference point of the tested part or if the colliders or search spheres of the bays are changing.\n- The MK3 Cargo Bays may have some problems with their colliders, I could occlude parts, which had at least 1.25m distance between their own colliders and the colliders of the bays.\n\nsuperheating-bug (all regarding my testcraft):\n\n1. occurs during 4x-physics warp, if a child part is occluded but its parent part isn\u0027t. Doesn\u0027t effect every occluded part.\n2. the parent part has to have a few child and grandchild parts.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPeyqAM9xH4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nMy hypothesis is, that occlusion causes the formula/iteration for cond. flux to crash. Because this doesn\u0027t effect every occluded part there have to be more indications to determine what\u0027s going on, but at this point we will need more information... anyone ideas?\n\nMeanwhile there is a workaround for it: \n\n1. search near the exploding part for a part which is occluded, but its parent isn\u0027t.\n\n2. move the ship around (reorientate) and open-\u003Eclose the bay nearby or enter-\u003Eleave non-physics timewarp\n\n3. check, that the part isn\u0027t occluded anymore, else try 2. again in another orientation\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T23:44:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by funk**"},{"CreatedByName":"funk","CreatedById":118840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T10:18:28Z","Content":"As a first step, I\u0027ve written a MM-patch, it can be downloaded [here](http://workupload.com/file/bxpjnjPt) (Copy to /Gamedata, [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-1-5-6-%28Jan-6%29) is needed).

Second thing I was mentioning earlier, is that there might be problems with the colliders especially the Mk3 ones. So that the second test mentioned in the OP isn\u0027t accurate. I\u0027ll investigate...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I can conform that the fix doesent work for me. I have a Spaceplane with some mystery goos and material bays inside a mk2 Cargobay small and they overheat very very fast.\n\u003E Playing with Kerbal Construction Time SSTOs are very important, so this bug really annoys me.\n\u003E \n\u003E How do parts overheat? if i edit the goo container to not have any drag, could that be a temporary solution for the problem?\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT:\n\u003E \n\u003E What i did notice, when editing a save file and looking at a specific crat which has a cargobay, i cant find any lookupradius or drag sphere of the cargobay part. The only modules on the parts are:\n\u003E \n\u003E is it possible that the functionality in the original part cfg is not applied on constructed ships or are they simply not inside the save file?\n\u003E \n\u003E cheers\n\nI don\u0027t think that removing drag helps with that. Perhaps anyone familiar with heat mechanics can explain how it works. For the lookupRadius: I suppose it\u0027s been used from the config files, but this would mean, that the updated configs should work for existing crafts. Maybe I\u0027m wrong here. Can you provide a craft file, pls?"},{"CreatedByName":"Grossbeer","CreatedById":118283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T15:26:08Z","Content":"Here is the Craft file:\n\n[http://wikisend.com/download/388334/Hawk](http://wikisend.com/download/388334/Hawk) I Cargo test.craft\n\nAlthou i have several Mods installed, most notably: SETI (for the radial Science Experiments) and FAR.\n\nThe Equipment is very centered around a Beam inside the Cargo bay, so there schould not be a Problem with the Sphere, so im kind of clueless.\n\ncheers"},{"CreatedByName":"funk","CreatedById":118840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T17:03:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Here is the Craft file:\n\u003E [http://wikisend.com/download/388334/Hawk](http://wikisend.com/download/388334/Hawk) I Cargo test.craft\n\u003E \n\u003E Althou i have several Mods installed, most notably: SETI (for the radial Science Experiments) and FAR.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Equipment is very centered around a Beam inside the Cargo bay, so there schould not be a Problem with the Sphere, so im kind of clueless.\n\u003E \n\u003E cheers\n\nI may be wrong, but doesn\u0027t FAR occlude all parts within the voxel hull?

It\u0027s always the same behaviour, a part overheats, because it\u0027s occluded while its parent isn\u0027t.
