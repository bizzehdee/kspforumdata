It will slowly spin faster and faster. There used to be a limit of around two rotations per second, but it is now unlimited,, so it will continue spinning faster and faster. This is why space trim is not advisable. (except if you have asymmetric thrust)\n\nAs for planes, trim is very useful, mostly the \u0022up/down\u0022 trim. Usually a plane will either want to slowly dive or slowly climb. Using the trim, you can make it so the aircraft flies level. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThey can also be used for controlling super-sensitive craft.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T04:49:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Endersmens**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sobriquet","CreatedById":137022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T05:15:39Z","Content":"I have been playing this game/simulation since I don\u0027t know how long, and still I learn something new about it when I least expect it.\n\nkudos Squad . . ."},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T07:27:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For some inexplicable reason my craft thinks it\u0027s under acceleration even when the engines are shut down.
