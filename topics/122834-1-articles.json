Now clone as copy or reference your center engine object. Add a poly select modifier (this will ensure everything stays selected up the stack. Do not add any edit poly modifiers above this in the stack) now add an xform modifier. Click on it in the stack and go into the xform modifier gizmo (default ctrl\u002B\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E move the gizmo in the x or y direction(as far as you want to have the extra engines from the center of the cluster, can be adjusted later again) go out of the gizmo sub object. Go to your snaps settings (rightclick the magnet icon on the top of the toolbar) select the angle snap angle and set it to 50 degrees(*i think*for 6 extra engines) or 22.5(*i think*) for 8 extra engines. Click the key a to activate angle snaps . Then e to activate the rotate tool. Now hold shift and rotate your reference cloned engine one snap worth. Make it an instance and select 5 or 7 copies. Now you have 6 or 8 engines plus the one in the middle. And any changes you make to the one in the middle will be reflected in the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also just instance a single engine(shift\u002Bmove). Drag it to x or y where you want it. Activate the rotation tool. select the coordinate system dropdown and select pick. Now click on your center engine model object. And click hold the pivot center icon (next to the coordinate system dropdown) select selection center (last option) now shift\u002Brotate with angle snaps active and create 5 or 7 instances. I dont prefer this method as it is not as flexible but it works well and is a bit simpler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: clone the center engine as reference like before. And add poly select and xform. Move the xform gizmo out in x or y direction now setup the angle snaps as in the last method and activate angle snaps(a key or the second magnet icon) and add a symmetry modifier. Go into the symmetry gizmo and rotate it by one snaps worth. Now copy and paste the symmetry modifier and repeat until you have engines all around(ps. You may need to deactivate slice if your engine has stuff sticking far out of it) You can still adjust the position of the engines with the xform gizmo as before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second question im not sure if you mean a model object or your thrust transform. If it your thrust transform then just create a helper object and align it(select it and alt\u002Ba and click on the object to align to) to the center engine object. Clone it and Activate snaps but turn on the axis constraint in the snaps options. Turn on your move tool (w key) and move to the x or y direction while in view of a center vertex of the engine object. It should now be aligned to the engine bell. Now rotate it while holding shift 5 or 7 copies. Now click on the \u0022select and link\u0022 icon (on the left side of the top toolbar. Hover over to see tooltips if you are not sure which one it is) click and drag/drop the helper object to the engine model object it is sitting below. Repeat for all the engine models. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you mean a model object you can follow the above method and after you are done use the select and link tool to parent each of the objects to the corresponding engine model.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-12T04:09:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2015 04:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halo_003","CreatedById":76050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T04:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat worked perfectly, thank you!

But this does not allow you to change all the offsets at the same time like the xform method. I dont usually use the array tool for this kind of stuff but it can be useful in some cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second thats the way i would do it too (except i would still use axis constraints to place the pivot at the top. Tho if you have/create a tri fan on the top you could snap to the center vertex of that) i chose to explain it in a more generic way for the op. Also as explaining how to get the pivot to the top would add another block of text that might discurage the poor guy:sticktongue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: i had answers for the bonus questions in my original reply but my phone lost power while editing...bummer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here it is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus 1: no. The attachement rules are done all in the part config file. it is however possible to create named helper objects in max and using them as attachement points by using the node {} in the part config. Tho im not sure if all the bugs are worked out of that system yet. Not sure what you mean by \u0022so you can build the actual rocket in it first\u0022 but you can preview how all different parts look together by using the align, snaps and select and link tools described earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus 2: max has a built in particle system as well as a nice plugin available to create realistic flames etc called fumefx. But neither is compatible with ksp/unity,takes a while to setup and wont look like it will inside ksp so i dont see the point in going through the trouble of setting it up for a simple preview(especcially when you can just export to unity and add the kspparticleemitter and test it out there)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus 3: for engine designs google is your friend.
