Preferably, these parts should be scalable as there really isn\u0027t a requirement for size in contrast to the LHA and LCU parts previously mentioned. I\u0027m not talking about Tweakscale support, (though that is a valid alternative) but an actual scaling system for these parts imbedded into the code that does not need Tweakscale as a dependency. I wouldn\u0027t be mad if there wasn\u0027t such a thing in such a mod, but it would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, I had my mind on dinghy parts, and similarly to the LHA and LCU parts, these would need to be limited in size. I was thinking, if dinghy parts were ever in a mod like this, that the hull would have enough room for at least five Kerbals and a protective windshield. Unlike any of the previously mentioned parts, however, there wouldn\u0027t need to be a dedicated, enclosed part to act as a bridge or island.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-25T00:20:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2024 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 25\u0022\u003EJune 25\u003C/time\u003E by Av8tor8a\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
