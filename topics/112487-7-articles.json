The size of the population is not the problem, the State of Texas alone has 79,535 center line miles (127,999 Km) of roadway. The US interstate system requires a marker placed every mile for both emergency purposes and for use in designating exits. So given the 3,233 miles of Interstate in Texas alone, it would require 2080 markers if you placed one marker on each side of the highway every 5km. The average cost for a mile marker sign to be installed is approximately $500-$700 each. Now include the signage for exit, speed limit, distance signs, etc. There is a problem of scale,not to mention Federal, State and Local governments. with the mass conversion of the U.S. from imperial to metric.
