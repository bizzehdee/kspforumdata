I\u0027ve not been able to figure it out either. If you want exhausts like that your best bet is a boolean operation.

The edge should snap to it. Press enter then press a twice then ctrl\u002Bw remove doubles.\n\nYou can also do it easier by applying the bridge operation as above then select the unwanted edge and press delete And dissolve edges.\n\nfor the second one youll want booleans.
