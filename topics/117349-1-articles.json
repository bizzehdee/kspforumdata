It\u0027s a sounding rocket that you can recover, to be used for one purpose and one purpose only. Actually now that I think of it you can use it for temperature scans on all layers of the atmosphere, anyway...\n\nWhat it\u0027s good for is that it has an antenna, a Thermometer and enough charge to send that data twice (for whatever reason) and land safely.\n\nIt has an uncanny ability of always returning 96.3% once it\u0027s recovered. If you manage to get any other number (0% does not count!), please, take a screenshot. I launched this thing at least 15 times today for all those Science from space near Kerbin missions (now you know its purpose if you haven\u0027t guessed already) , and it did not deviate from that, not once.\n\n![view.php?pic=1toci8\u0026s=8#.Vbvqh_mqqko](http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=1toci8\u0026s=8#.Vbvqh_mqqko)\n\nIts operating cost is 326 credits and it will bring you to the neighborhood of 90km Apoapsis. As much as it seems unlikely, you\u0027ll survive the re-entry.\n\nInstructions:\n\n0. Have the Thermometer, Radial Parachutes, Stayputnik and the Z-100 Battery Pack unlocked.\n\n1. Fire the rocket with whatever time-warp you want.\n\n2. Collect temperature data.\n\n3. Send the temperature data to Kerbin.\n\n4. Slow down thanks to the rocket\u0027s massive drag on return\n\n5. Open the radial parachutes at a safe altitude.\n\nWarranty void if altered in any way. (Doesn\u0027t get outside the atmosphere with a goo unit or a materials lab)\n\nWorks exactly the same if you replace the Thermometer with a Barometer due to them sharing the same mass and mechanics. If you do that you should add another battery which does not impact the rocket\u0027s abilities much.\n\n[Download](https://www.sendspace.com/file/zsfxwe)\n\nHope this thing helps at your early career games!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T21:53:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by More Boosters**"}]}
