It\u0027s a sounding rocket that you can recover, to be used for one purpose and one purpose only. Actually now that I think of it you can use it for temperature scans on all layers of the atmosphere, anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it\u0027s good for is that it has an antenna, a Thermometer and enough charge to send that data twice (for whatever reason) and land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has an uncanny ability of always returning 96.3% once it\u0027s recovered. If you manage to get any other number (0% does not count!), please, take a screenshot. I launched this thing at least 15 times today for all those Science from space near Kerbin missions (now you know its purpose if you haven\u0027t guessed already) , and it did not deviate from that, not once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=1toci8\u0026amp;s=8#.Vbvqh_mqqko\u0022 alt=\u0022view.php?pic=1toci8\u0026amp;s=8#.Vbvqh_mqqko\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts operating cost is 326 credits and it will bring you to the neighborhood of 90km Apoapsis. As much as it seems unlikely, you\u0027ll survive the re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstructions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.

If you do that you should add another battery which does not impact the rocket\u0027s abilities much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.sendspace.com/file/zsfxwe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this thing helps at your early career games!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T21:53:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by More Boosters\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
