It makes it incredibly hard to read. \u00A0I fly with a real AI and even way back in the day I can tell you they weren\u0027t pixellated. \u00A0I am guessing the low resolution makes it even harder to use. The same goes for the inconsistency with text. \u00A0Sometimes it is nice and crisp and other times a really weird font that is not pleasant to read/decipher. For example the manoeuvre node text box \u0027Required deltaV\u0027 is squished and very zx spectrumy or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E info around the Navball. \u00A0Then to contrast the altitude on the Navball is nice to read.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I don\u0027t like the location of the nav ball either. A lot of time is spent flying off this so my head is no longer pointing at the neutral position in the center of my screen. Instead I am off axis and down. \u00A0Could there be an option to position it in the center so my neck isn\u0027t tweaked so much ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parts manager is quite obtrusive. \u00A0If I want to just view one part I still have this huge window up. \u00A0It is useful in its own right but a lot of the time the whole stack isn\u0027t required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T15:37:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 03:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Andy 156\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecorrected screen size\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tekaoh","CreatedById":184557,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T14:31:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed. I find the pixely fonts and ui design hard to read. I also don\u0027t really like the new fuel meters in the staging area. I find it harder to see at a glance where my fuel level is at when I\u0027m anticipating a staging point. Not enough contrast. And the nav ball is literally the most important thing on my screen when I\u0027m flying. I\u0027d rather it be in the center where I can glance at it more naturally. When I\u0027m launching my eyes hardly look at my actual rocket at all and instead glance between nav ball and fuel meters. Right now they are literally as far away from each other as possible, which kind of stinks.

The Dot Matrix UI effect is not a good look, I feel like they were looking for a retro feel but it doesn\u0027t really look retro. Maybe offer options for different styles of UI. But what I think absolutely needs to be addressed is the overall look of the UI is not consistent. There is a mix of smooth continuous linework in vivid colors in the same widget with the Dot Matrix effect. Looks bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
