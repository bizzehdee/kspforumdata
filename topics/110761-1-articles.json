The same close-in orbit went as smoothly worse with the manewem docking, I tried to use these new \u0022piloting skills\u0022 BTW how to train Kerbals i mean how they get experience i need mostly pilot one, the scientist and engineers are very much useless, sorry Bob and Bill :-( During most critical phases (launch, re-entry (albeit the re-entry are not so dangerous as i thin it would be, kerbonauts are very much safe to safe IMHO ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E (maybe i\u0027m psycho or sadist, maybe both ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) )\n\u003E \n\u003E But i think we need something like Gemini not Lander Can.\n\nPS. Does is possible to train kerbonauts for simoleons... oh dear simoleons! i should say rather Kerboleons ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) i have to little sleep i working yesterday in Poling Station during Polish Presidential Election"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T01:01:05Z","Content":"[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorials#Real_life_missions](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorials#Real_life_missions)\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Apollo_11](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Apollo_11)\n\nAnd no, you can\u0027t use funds to train kerbals-- the only way to train them is to go out and do things (e.g. get to Kerbin orbit, land on various celestial bodies), then come back to Kerbin for experience points."},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T02:11:32Z","Content":"i mean realistic how to create new parts i mean stock fairing"},{"CreatedByName":"eonmoon","CreatedById":137279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T04:08:45Z","Content":"you cant pay for training, however there is a kerbal academy in the MKS mod by roverdude, which can train your kerbals to two stars in orbit and three landed but not on kerbin ( minmus for me soon ) however they need a teacher of that class thats been trained already to teach new kerbals (quick and dirty to lvl 3 needs a kerbin orbit, mun landing, minmus flag planting and a quick dip out of kerbins SOI."}]}
