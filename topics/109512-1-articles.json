And what is better way to figure out any aerodynamic system than by flying a self-made abomination of a plane that is basically a collection of all types of crew cabins clumped together into a vaguely flyable shape?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as I flied my freaks around Kerbin crashing them and expending innumerable Kerbal lives, I came up with a little narrative. So I decided to document one of such flights for my and my girlfriend\u0027s pleasure and thought that maybe somebody here might find it interesting. So, here it is, Mother Goose\u0027s Maiden Voyage.
