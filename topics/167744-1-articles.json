there\u0027s simply no way I\u0027ve found to map those buttons in a way that feels good.\u00A0 The common consensus seems to be to map the yellow buttons to the right analog stick, but that really feels off to me, but it does seem to be the way a lot of people do it.\u00A0 How much this affects you will greatly depend on the game though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had good success with mapping up C up and down to the two leftover face buttons on the right side of a standard controller and then mapping C left and right to the two shoulder buttons. I map R to the right trigger and Z or L (because they\u0027re never both used as primary buttons) to the left trigger with the other one mapped to a \u0022Select\u0022 style button or a stick press. I find this setup works really well for games that use the C buttons for additional actions (like Ocarina of Time) rather than as a directional input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-24T03:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223226650\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167744\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221511478903\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002210883\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Nuke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think its also legal to rip games that you cant buy anymore, as these are considered abandonware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy rip i presume you mean download?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside of cases where the rights holders have actually given permission for their stuff to be distributed (which has happened fairly frequently as some of the \u0027abandonware\u0027 groups have made considerable efforts to clear things in this regard) I really don\u0027t think this is the case.\u00A0 Copyright doesn\u0027t expire just because someone is not profiting off of something.\u00A0 And let\u0027s not pretend in an era of ebay and a healthy second-hand sales market that it\u0027s impossible to buy many of these games, it\u0027s more an issue that the rights-holder will not see any of that money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-24T03:47:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223226789\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167744\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221511494282\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278711\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pxi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 minutes ago, pxi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy rip i presume you mean download?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside of cases where the rights holders have actually given permission for their stuff to be distributed (which has happened fairly frequently as some of the \u0027abandonware\u0027 groups have made considerable efforts to clear things in this regard) I really don\u0027t think this is the case.\u00A0 Copyright doesn\u0027t expire just because someone is not profiting off of something.\u00A0 And let\u0027s not pretend in an era of ebay and a healthy second-hand sales market that it\u0027s impossible to buy many of these games, it\u0027s more an issue that the rights-holder will not see any of that money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni was under the impression that copywrite law actually required rights holders to actively defend those rights, where failure to do so results in defacto forfeiture.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-24T03:49:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223226796\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167744\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221511495252\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002210883\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, Nuke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni was under the impression that copywrite law actually required rights holders to actively defend those rights, where failure to do so results in defacto forfeiture.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s at this point you\u0027d have to be a copyright lawyer to answer that, but I was under the impression that what you\u0027re referring to actually involves trademarks, not copyright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
