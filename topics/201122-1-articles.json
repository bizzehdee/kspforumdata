When I use the \u0027launch to target plane\u0027 function, then engage the autopilot, the game warps to the launch time, the engines activate and the throttle\u00A0goes to 100%, but the vehicle doesn\u0027t leave the pad - no flames, no noise, nothing. It just sits there. MJ2 shows that it\u0027s \u0027launching to target plane\u0027 but nothing is happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMJ2 works properly for the other launch options.
