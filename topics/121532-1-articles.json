I\u0027ve tried solving it parametrically, but even the horizontal part get to a dead end: the velocity vector depends on the acceleration vector, which depends on the velocity vector\u0027s pitch, etc etc etc. It\u0027s a loop that reminds me of how computer code handles this situation, with new value = previous value \u002B change in value. But it can\u0027t be this complicated. NASA used gravity turns way before computers could handle long simulations, so there must be an analytical solution.
