Just go out, grab the data, and enter the command pod. Like magic all your data is in one easy to return place! Been that way since 0.23 I think. Works the same with crew reports, btw, which let\u0027s you grab more than one at a time (take crew report, eva, grab all data from capsule, reenter capsule, take another crew report somewhere else). Only condition is that you can\u0027t have two of the same exact data in the same pod (so you can\u0027t have two surface samples from the same biome, for instance).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
