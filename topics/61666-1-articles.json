The second farthest planet and only gas giant in our solar system, three of its moons are the size of planets, one of these, Laythe, is unique in a special way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it was first observed through a telescope many years ago, it was immediately noted its similarity to Kerbin, our home planet. With what appeared to be liquid water on its surface, and lots of it, so much that most of its surface was water, and covered in islands, ranging from small to large and anything in between. It appeared to have no life on it, since the islands looked like pure sand, it was like a world straight out of science fiction, just waiting for life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2004 KASA pointed a telescope at Laythe to collect data on the reflected light to determine its content, apon reviewing the data on the atmosphere, the scientist immediately stormed out of the room and ran straight to the directors office. The data on the reflected light showed characteristics of oxygen in the atmosphere, pointing evermore towards the possibility of Laythe being habitable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is our mission, to find out wether Laythe is habitable or not, many things say it is, and many things say it isn\u0027t. It is way too far from Kerbol to be warm enough to have liquid water, so something else has to be heating it up, or trapping the heat from Kerbol, it appeared to have an atmosphere almost exactly like Kerbin\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EAll systems online.\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 a computer like voice said, that was our AI, Mechjeb, he was created as an autopilot, he does any maneuver almost perfectly, and if you didn\u0027t know better, when you heard his voice you\u0027d probably think he was Kerbal, \u0022All systems are functioning correctly.\u0022 Mechjeb said. \u0022Alright, when can we expect Jeb and Erbal up here?\u0022 I asked. \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EKSC is preparing the landers for launch at this very moment, Pan.\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I told you to call me Dead, not Pan.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not easy living with the name \u0022Deadpangod3\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EWhoops, my mistake.\u003C/strong\u003E.\u0022 Mechjeb replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, while we wait, I\u0027m going to rest in my bunk.\u0022 Bob said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t fall when you get into the centrifuge.\u0022 Bill said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still couldn\u0027t get over the fact that I was here, with Bill and Bob, two of the three men aboard Kerpollo 11 when we first went to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.
