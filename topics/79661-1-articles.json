Whenever it try to complete a contract that requires me to activate a part under certain conditions, I cannot stage that part. Other parts will still stage correctly, just not the one I need. The only thing I can figure is that one of my mods is interfering with the call that KSP uses to determine if the part was staged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone had anything similar occur? I could include my modlist, but it\u0027s big enough that I don\u0027t believe it would be all that helpful. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate - After testing, I can confirm that I am still able to complete contracts which are not staging dependent. For example, a contract which required me to return science from space around Kerbin completed exactly as it was supposed to. Also, the bug seems to permenantly disable the staging of a part, but only once \u0022successful\u0022 parameters are met. I.E., I can stage a BACC booster before it has met the contract conditions, but once it has, the only way to activate it is with action groups or the right click menu, neither of which complete the contract. This disabled state persists even when the contract conditions are no longer being met.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESOLVED\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like it was Kerbal Joint Reinforcement (or some interaction between KJR and another mod; I have enough that I cannot begin to rule out the possibility \u0026gt;.\u0026gt; )\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-27T18:43:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2014 06:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by JDCollie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDCollie","CreatedById":103176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T05:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo one? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"impwarhamer","CreatedById":80499,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T13:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emaybe this should be in the bug report section?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDCollie","CreatedById":103176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T17:59:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022impwarhamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022impwarhamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Emaybe this should be in the bug report section?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat . . . is probably a good idea. \u0026gt;.\u0026gt; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould a mod move this for me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
