The first test launch of NASA\u0027s Orion capsule has been bumped in the name of US Security. Citing an \u0027urgent need\u0027 to launch recently declassified satellites into orbit, the USAF has commandeered the Delta IV originally slated for Orion\u0027s test launch in September for their GSSAP satellites. Orion is now slated to launch on the Delta IV originally slated for the USAF in December.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really understand how a couple months can make that much of a difference in USAF satellite security, but it\u0027s a bit annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least we\u0027ll be able to play with some NASA parts in KSP soon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.universetoday.com/110450/us-air-force-space-surveillance-satellite-bumps-nasas-long-awaited-orion-launch-to-dec-2014/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESource article\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rdfox","CreatedById":1818,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T14:24:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven how Vladimir Putin is acting like even MORE of a comic-book/James Bond supervillain than normal, I\u0027m not at all surprised. If he keeps stirring the pot in eastern Europe, there may be open warfare going on in that part of the world by September--and if that happens, we may well be dragged into it, should he attack, say, Poland (a full NATO member).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has ALWAYS been a possibility with launches from CCAFS and VAFB, which is one of the reasons why NASA chose to build Complex 39 on an entirely separate piece of property (the Merritt Island Launch Facility) that was entirely NASA-owned. While they still would use the Eastern (now Atlantic) Missile Range tracking facilities downrange, those could easily support NASA missions and Air Force missions with minimal turnaround time (i.e., virtually none); launch pads, however, had to be occupied for an extended time before each launch, and refurbished after each one, meaning that the Air Force-owned launch complexes needed to have the option of the Air Force commandeering them--and the boosters on them--for military use at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage of renting facilities from someone is you don\u0027t need to pay the full price to buy, build, and maintain them. The disadvantage is that if their owner needs them, then you\u0027re gonna get bumped down the priority list. By choosing to fly OFT-1 on a Delta IV, NASA knowingly accepted this possibility. (And honestly, I\u0027d have been shocked if the OFT-1 vehicle had been ready to fly in September, anyway; I don\u0027t think ANY NASA manned spacecraft has been ready for launch on its original schedule date for the first test flight. Shuttle, for example, missed its target by two YEARS...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
