It\u0027s down right scary. I wonder what kind of madness would go into trying to create a set of auto-transition modes for the different stages of a launch so that a launch autopilot could be attempted. I suppose you\u0027d need to write a plugin to out those presets into the staging list so that mechjeb could auto-stage them. hmm...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T10:37:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHahaha \u002B1 for actually attempting to look at the whirling madness of the triebflugel. Launching is quite simple (though as the designer of the contraption, that\u0027s to be taken with a grain of salt).Spin rotors to max RPM at \u0022flat\u0022 pitch relative to the horizon. Once rotors are whirling like mad, gradually tap the correct pitch control key to add \u0022collective\u0022. You should see the ship ascend slowly. Tap the key to increase lift and gradually transition to about 40m/s ascent rate. For the orbital test I ascend vertically to about 4000m and fire off the rocket engines. Keep pushing pitch as the ship accelerates and the rotors will act like a giant propeller and add a modest bit of efficiency. At some point around 100-120m/s, to prevent loss of control, feather the rotors fully to act like fixed wing mode. It\u0027ll be quite obvious when to transition to fixed wing mode because the pitch will be so coarse there will be no purpose spinning the center section.I didn\u0027t specify which key to increase or decrease pitch... if you notice the rotors can be made to spin either way but I usually prefer anticlockwise direction where ; decreases pitch and \u0027 increases pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T15:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could send that up in space and have it considered a space station!
