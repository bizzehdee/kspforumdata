Lots of the Rockomax tanks and a couple from MH go into there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat mods are you using? If none, I\u0027d suggest exiting the game from the menus (don\u0027t alt-f4, actually exit all the way out the \u0022normal\u0022 way) and then - if you\u0027re using Steam - validate your local files, then restart. If you\u0027re using mods, I\u0027d remove all the ones that may modify parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
