Just make science from probe samples worth less than science from crew. Make it take multiple missions and/or hours of grinding with a probe to get the same science output as a single well-planned manned mission. That way we can still design and build our cool robotic sample return missions, but it would motivate bringing Kerbals along, and it would also be more realistic, since a single manned mission to Mars would have been able to do everything we\u0027ve done on the planet with all the other robotic missions combined many times over. I hear people from JPL say this kind of thing all the time (but they just want astronauts on Phobos controlling robots in real-time on the surface since JPL makes robots).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mode7","CreatedById":40585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T07:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CalculusWarrior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CalculusWarrior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m of the opinion that probes should not be able to do such surface analyses (or at the very least, very limited ones) as then it completely removes any motivation for the player to include kerbals on their ship designs.
