When on EVA, however, you can get a rough idea of the kerbal\u0027s mass by using rocket pack to get some speed, and colliding head on with capsule, or some other light object, and seeing how the speeds of the two change after collision. Having tried the \u0022get out and push\u0022 solution to trajectory correction after running out of fuel in orbit, I can definitely say that a kerbal is considerably lighter than even the Mk I capsule. But I have not done the math to try and find the exact value.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T22:30:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey weigh 31 kg when on EVA \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/15504-The-mass-of-a-kerbal\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/15504-The-mass-of-a-kerbal\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T01:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith their size 32 kg is pretty realistic.
