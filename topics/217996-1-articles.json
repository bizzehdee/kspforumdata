At least not short term.\u00A0 The project had delays over and over, maybe for good reasons, maybe not (we won\u0027t know). And there\u0027s plenty of precedent of sequels that got delayed for a very long time (Duke Nukem) and even cancelled (Half Life 3). So, not in a sense of \u0022we need money\u0022 but rather \u0022the game will \u003Cem\u003Enever \u003C/em\u003Eget published if we don\u0027t force them\u0022 a hard deadline was set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe we\u0027re actually talking about the same thing (you mention [3], after all, as a separate possibility), but I\u0027d say \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ebecause they felt it would never launch without a hard deadline\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E that deadline was set a lot earlier (the \u0022fiscal year 2023\u0022 in a financial report a year earlier) and I suppose the discussion late 2022 went a bit like \u0022\u003Cem\u003Esorry we can\u0027t make that deadline\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 followed by \u0022\u003Cem\u003Efind a way to make it happen.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Reverting back to a release with most features stripped out must have been a painful and awful process, but it would give a chance to have less bugs. Imagine we had the \u0022full\u0022 release with a half-baked science, colonies and interstellar implementation. What we have now is far more manageable and it\u0027s already a fluffing mess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect most of the code actually \u003Cem\u003Ewas \u003C/em\u003Erewritten from scratch, simply because we wouldn\u0027t have as many bugs as we have now. That also explains the long time frame. That we see similar bugs as in KSP1 doesn\u0027t surprise me. Most of the bugs seem to be logical errors, and if code is supposed to do the same thing it\u0027s easy to make the same errors. That\u0027s why starting from scratch is such a mixed bag. Yes, you leave behind spaghettified Frankencode that evolved over a decade, but you also leave behind all the fixes for weird things no one thought of at first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s all understandable that IG doesn\u0027t tell us the whole story. No corporation will happily hang out their dirty laundry. It makes them look bad and rarely anything good comes out of it (remember not just customers, but investors read those Mea Culpas as well). The downside of that is that through all deceit and misinformation (looking at where we are four months after the release it\u0027s incredibly hard to be \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E salty about what we\u0027ve been told and what is delivered) we now really don\u0027t know where we stand. A year from now we can look back at this and either say \u0022they did come through in the end\u0022 or \u0022we should have seen the implosion coming.\u0022 Time will tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-25T20:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t mean to be harsh, guys, but this is the same discussion that takes place every time the developers come out with a new dev notes.
