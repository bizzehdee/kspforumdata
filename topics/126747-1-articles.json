Upon opening the side menu (I\u0027m reading this on mobile, don\u0027t know if this is an issue on desktop), there is a submenu named \u0022forum\u0022. Upon opening said submenu you will find two duplicate items labeled \u0022 forum\u0022 and \u0022forums\u0022 which both return you to the main page. Just wanted to report this issue so that it might be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
