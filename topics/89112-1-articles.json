Now, the velocity that the Krakensbane uses as a dividing line is somewhere between 700 m/s and 800 m/s (for instance, a k-drive will propel your ship without using fuel if used at more than ~750 m/s, but if turned on at lower velocities, it will instantly stop your ship, possibly ripping it apart). Does anybody know what the exact dividing line is?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T03:49:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard from reliable sources that it\u0027s 750m/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T18:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy tests, if I remember correctly, indicated that it was exactly 750 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
