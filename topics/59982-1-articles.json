I have a little suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not add Aurora into the game for the north and south poles of Kerbin along with some other celestial bodies. It would also be a great way to gain science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027d be a common aspect of the game which happen every 2-3 days which will make it hard to predict when they next occur. A new scientific equipment could allow the measurements of the Aurora and send back data to the Kerbals on the ground and gain SCIENCE! (*cheers*)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong with them adding Science it could also allow for better screenshots and more visuals to look at while in the game. Imagine making a space station and flying over the aurora down below. It would be truly amazing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA side note from this would be changing some aspects of the sun for example Solar Flares and Randomised Sun Spots!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork13","CreatedById":100102,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T01:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdding auroras would mean solar flares should also be added, and I doubt they are going to do that, but besides that, I like the idea!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
