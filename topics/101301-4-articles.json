Still basically in the grid mindset, and a bit frustrated on how annoying it can be to zone new areas, but overall it\u0027s quite fun. Favorite bit: setting up public transit routes, with bus stops that don\u0027t require demolishing houses or building anything but a depot (if we could only get on-road subway, that\u0027d be even better, but I can see why it\u0027s good to have metro need to build the stop). One of the main annoyances I had with IV was that I couldn\u0027t channel sims into multiple modes of transit (e.g. bus to the subway stop, subway to a rail station, rail across the city).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one thing I\u0027d most like to see is a way to not start from scratch each time. In 4, there was the big city tutorial (medium-sized but unpleasant city, which you could follow the instructions for but which you could also build on to improve), and there was regional demand (i.e. instant mega-demand that let me take a city to like 500k in 40 minutes or so). Managing and improving a big city is different from growing a small town, and I\u0027d like to be able to do the former without really needing to do the latter first. I know Workshop has premade cities, but something officially endorsed would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively: Anyone have Workshop stuff to recommend?

The snapping tool does what it is supposed to do and does it well. If you want to build your squares full to the brim, SimCity style, you are going to need to take precautions. One of those would be to outlay the outside road first, so it spans the full border. That way you cannot get surprised later, though you might still run into issues when you access more plots. Longer lines make for smaller deviations. Another would be just to use roads that do not fully touch the border until you unlock the plot next door. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you comment is that this is no SimCity 2000 when it comes to snapping, you are absolutely right.

One great tip is to set your industry zone to farming, as that doesn\u0027t create any pollution. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to traffic problems, raise your highway up one level off the ground and run off/on ramps every 3-4 blocks along your main roads. This lets traffic that wants to take the highway (I.E. Anyone who wants to get anywhere) get there without greatly affecting the rest of the roads. OH another stupidly awesome method of solving traffic AND making good money is bus routes. If you make the highway the only way to get to your industrial zones from your housing, you can run bus lines all over city from your residential zones and reduce the number of cars on the road while at the same time, making ALL the moneys.
