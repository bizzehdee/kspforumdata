Still basically in the grid mindset, and a bit frustrated on how annoying it can be to zone new areas, but overall it\u0027s quite fun. Favorite bit: setting up public transit routes, with bus stops that don\u0027t require demolishing houses or building anything but a depot (if we could only get on-road subway, that\u0027d be even better, but I can see why it\u0027s good to have metro need to build the stop). One of the main annoyances I had with IV was that I couldn\u0027t channel sims into multiple modes of transit (e.g. bus to the subway stop, subway to a rail station, rail across the city).\n\nThe one thing I\u0027d most like to see is a way to not start from scratch each time. In 4, there was the big city tutorial (medium-sized but unpleasant city, which you could follow the instructions for but which you could also build on to improve), and there was regional demand (i.e. instant mega-demand that let me take a city to like 500k in 40 minutes or so). Managing and improving a big city is different from growing a small town, and I\u0027d like to be able to do the former without really needing to do the latter first. I know Workshop has premade cities, but something officially endorsed would be nice.\n\nAlternatively: Anyone have Workshop stuff to recommend? Particularly something like a medium-sized city that needs to build up and be improved, not built out?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thankfully you can still build in a grid fashion using the snap tool.

OTOH, it is making it easier for me to build parks and trees and such, so not all bad."},{"CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T16:46:52Z","Content":"Well... so much for my praise of their snapping system. This here is EXACTLY what I was talking about: [http://i.imgur.com/pW8JpTv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pW8JpTv.jpg)\n\nWhen you start building (starting at the right side) you think: \u0022Oh great! The game intelligently snapped the road so it runs perfectly parallel to the map\u0027s edge. This means I can continue extending the road all along the whole square of the map.\u0022 Heh... NOPE. You fool, your road actually has a 0.5 degree misalignment relative to the map\u0027s edge. So you inevitably end up rolling out of bounds, even though all your roads are otherwise perfect.\n\nNote that it does still snap roads, but it snaps roads relative to the already present roads. This means that my entire city is perfectly straight relative to itself, but the whole city is off-kilter relative to the map\u0027s edge. The ONLY way to fix the problem shown in that screengrab is to either rebuild the entire city and try again (and... again, there\u0027s no guarentee you\u0027ll get it right the second time because the snap only snaps relative to other roads, so far as I can tell you can\u0027t lay down a fresh new road and snap it to the map).

This here is EXACTLY what I was talking about: [http://i.imgur.com/pW8JpTv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pW8JpTv.jpg)\n\nTo be fair, this is not really a problem in the sense that is only is a problem because you feel it is a problem and does not work with your very specific building style. The snapping tool does what it is supposed to do and does it well. If you want to build your squares full to the brim, SimCity style, you are going to need to take precautions. One of those would be to outlay the outside road first, so it spans the full border. That way you cannot get surprised later, though you might still run into issues when you access more plots. Longer lines make for smaller deviations. Another would be just to use roads that do not fully touch the border until you unlock the plot next door. \n\nIf you comment is that this is no SimCity 2000 when it comes to snapping, you are absolutely right. Since just a tiny proportion of my roads is straight, I am happy it is not ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T17:43:51Z","Content":"Good game, and runs well on my system.

This lets traffic that wants to take the highway (I.E. Anyone who wants to get anywhere) get there without greatly affecting the rest of the roads.
