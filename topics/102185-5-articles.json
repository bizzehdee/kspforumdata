In the meantime, a workaround if you wanted to use the mission patches would be to copy those from \u0027KerbalizedDecals/Textures/MissionPatches\u0027 into \u0027KerbalizedFlagpack/Flags\u0027 and they will then show up. As I mentioned before, I\u0027m currently upgrading the texture resolution on a lot of things, so there may be pixelization on the bigger scale decals.\n\nThe long decals are just the wrong ratio for them to work with stock at the minute.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-03T09:47:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2020 09:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by DirtyFace83**"},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyFace83","CreatedById":131509,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-03T10:58:49Z","Content":"Some new things:\n\nAfter reading Margo Kerman\u0027s blog post in her new job, this had to be included:\n\n![3eF39W5.png](https://i.imgur.com/3eF39W5.png)\n\nWhich then logically led to this:\n\n![UcbGj1a.png](https://i.imgur.com/UcbGj1a.png)\n\nWhich made this necessary:\n\n![6JbD8d9.png](https://i.imgur.com/6JbD8d9.png)\n\nAnd then while looking for those, this Swedish agency had to go in:\n\n![FZSWzAN.png](https://i.imgur.com/FZSWzAN.png)\n\nAnd finally, the Indonesian agency LAPAN has changed its logo to a better one it seems, so that had to change:\n\n![yDuVA3r.png](https://i.imgur.com/yDuVA3r.png)\n\nThere are lond decal textures to go with each (and a couple more that didn\u0027t have one have been added, along with a texture resolution update for the agency decals."},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyFace83","CreatedById":131509,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-03T20:09:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/19/2020 at 4:02 AM, KraterKreator said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@DirtyFace83](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/131509-dirtyface83/) These are great.
