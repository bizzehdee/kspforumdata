When I next tried to play, the game runs normally but my good save gives the above error when I try to open it: Error accessing this save, and below it says Argument cannot be null.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you know of any way to retrieve the save? Some line I can edit to revert to the last saved state? Please let me know if you need any other info to help me diagnose this issue. I was pretty invested in this particular career game.
