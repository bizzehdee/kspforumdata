I suggest something like the movie Apollo 18 with the rock-spider-like life form that gets in someone\u0027s helmet. I also recommend using pre-rendered scenes like the older Resident Evil games. I don\u0027t know whether that would be a difficult thing to achieve in Unity?

You\u0027ll have to argue very very hard with me to convince me how \u0022actual\u0022 fear can be introduced into a cartoony game with sweet innocent green goblin faces, but I can\u0027t vouch for others mentality.

It probably does as a rule of thumb since everybody is different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I\u0027m not that much of a horror fan. So I have 2 reasons not to want it. While I think it\u0027s not part of KSP 1.x.x anymore, we have had our horror in the past. So if you want to see one, this one simply reminds me of silent hill right away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022maxresdefault.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W8tjPPNvomg/maxresdefault.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the faint at heart, the kraken on Bop could be terrifying aswell. Personally I think your a pussy if you do, but pussies pay money, and they\u0027ll stop paying if they\u0027re scared, so no horror in KSP. Statistically the player base has grown since the kraken glitches were removed from the game. We can only assume the deletion of bugs and specifically the krakens demise has contributed to the growth of players. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EDon\u0027t tell me it\u0027s because of this, that, such and so, I know.

Most of these seem to revolve around the inventory slots and the fact that Jeb will have only six slots while Val will have eight. This is true but allows players to vary the challenge of the experience. Just to confirm, you will no longer be able to save as often as you like by pressing F5 but will in fact need to find a typewriter and use one of the limited number of ink ribbons scattered around Kerbin and the Mun.
