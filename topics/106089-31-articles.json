I suppose we\u0027re already almost there, with the only remaining trade-off being cooling vs cost \u0026 maxTemp. It\u0027s tempting to suggest removing LH modes from stock tanks altogether, though I understand many would object that cryo engine launch stages would look a bit silly with the exposed foil tanks. I guess I don\u0027t have a great solution at the moment, but I\u0027ll think it over and get back to you if I come up with something.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-25T07:07:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2017 07:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Fraz86**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rodger","CreatedById":153575,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-04T03:56:49Z","Content":"How about a tech tree upgrade to add cooling to all tanks?"},{"CreatedByName":"braxfortex","CreatedById":133204,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-04T18:50:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 1/2/2017 at 3:27 PM, MeCripp said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You might try\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E     \n\u003E     @PART[*]:HAS[@RESOURCE[LqdHydrogen],[~ModuleCryoTank]:Final\n\u003E     {MODULE{\tname =  ModuleCryoTank\tFuelName = LqdHydrogen\tFuelTotal = #$../LH2$\t// in % per hour\tBoiloffRate = 0.05\t// in Ec per 1000 units per second\tCoolingCost = 0.08}\n\u003E     }\n\u003E \n\nPlease forgive my ignorance [@MeCripp](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/96203-mecripp/).

Opinions?\n\u003E \n\nIt is what i have been doing all along. Every tank capable of storing cryo fuel is also capable of electric cooling.\n\nHaving only a few tanks  (as pretty as they are) capable of permanently storing cryo fuels puts, what i feel is, an unnecessary limitation on using cryo engines. I really like the engines but the tanks provided just don\u0027t fit into every design i want to use. Probably the biggest problem is the lack of cooling for procedural tanks which i use very often.\n\nSo yes, please add cooling to more tanks by defoult.\n\nHowever, in the meantime since there is interest in this i will post my hacky way of achieving this...\n\n1.
