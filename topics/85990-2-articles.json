One of the great things about KSP is how you can direct the flow of \u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E experience, so if I want to get all my science from Duna, or Eeloo, or where ever, I should be able to. Being able to unlock the entire tech tree from within Kerbin SOI is not a balancing problem, it\u0027s a personal problem for people to overcome. It also makes it easier on new players to progress within the game, which I think is a fantastic thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T19:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FleetAdmiralJ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FleetAdmiralJ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eit would be something they would have to look at closely because they didn\u0027t want to make the game to difficult for new users who may just recklessly build whatever rocket and hit go (which things like NEAR and FAR may not like as much as stock)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatching your garbage tower take off like a dog strapped to a vacuum is half the fun of KSP.
