This craft is maneuverable as it\\\u0027s able to perform sharp turns, glide, and pitch as required in a stable manner. It is outfitted with two parachutes for quick braking, and has plenty of fuel for high orbit operations.\n\n![screenshot288.png](http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/461/screenshot288.png)\n\n**Required:**  Stock 0.15 only\n\n**Download:** [http://www./?a76bm5x1ccadivr](http://www./?a76bm5x1ccadivr)\n\n\u003E ![screenshot250v.png](http://img835.imageshack.us/img835/3172/screenshot250v.png)\n\u003E ![screenshot196p.png](http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/9447/screenshot196p.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot230e.png](http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/6505/screenshot230e.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot237q.png](http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/4739/screenshot237q.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot239x.png](http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/2521/screenshot239x.png)\n\nEnjoy!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T17:38:40Z","Content":"How do you end up doing your de-orbit burn?\n\nI was testing out de-orbiting with my little shuttle craft:\n\n\u003E ![screenshot29p.png](http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/8284/screenshot29p.png)\n\nWas able to land at KSC from an orbit of 80km with my initial periapsis at 43.6km above KSC."},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T19:19:10Z","Content":"From a 150k circular orbit, I burned retrograde about 45 degrees before KSC so my PE would be about 5km above KSC, this shuttle lets me turn around if I overshoot or I can glide forward if I undershoot the landing area."}]}
