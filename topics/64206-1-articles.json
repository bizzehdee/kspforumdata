In 3d Studio Max, you apply a modifier on the model called UV-unrwap or UV-map (the second one is a semi-automatic procedure). For Cinema4d it all done through the UVcoordinates Tag.

You can then separate the UV islands (distinct areas of the UV map separate from other pieces) based on those materials/colors and quickly select them in Gimp/Photoshop with your select tools. With the areas selected, its just a matter of filling them in with the fill tool, and then adding some details on top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf in doubt for texturing, look to real life for inspiration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for more technical look at texturing, the polycount wiki is a good place to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Textures/Mapping/UV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Textures/Mapping/UV\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Payload","CreatedById":4540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T21:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wish I could help you sir but my Texture skills are severely lacking. The one thing I can tell you is that UV unwrap is the most important thing. I tend to unwrap using a test pattern to be sure that I don\u0027t have any really bad stretching going on. Also unwrapping in Blender is easier to me than the commercial counterparts, but you will still find yourself manually unwrapping individual faces quite a lot. That is where learning to use the different transforms can really aid you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually cheat the artistic bits using procedural texturing in blender but KSP doesn\u0027t play well with more than one material per mesh. I find that you have to unwrap with all the same material and fit everything on to one texture sheet unless you separate the meshes in blender first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
