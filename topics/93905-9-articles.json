Leakage of Hydrogen during the cloud-level portion of the mission dose not look to be much of a concern, the duration is just too short and if more lifting gas were needed then a secondary Nitrogen balloon can be inflated inside the blimp to supplement it, it is common for blimps today to have secondary interior balloons of denser gass at the for and aft to control trim and N2 balloons could serve this purpose. What kind of total energy storage would you get under your proposals, and how much mass is saved vs assumption of best-of-breed Lithium Ion battery storage? One nitpick, get rid of AC/DC inverter and just use DC motor for propeller, lower mass by a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transport of Hydrogen during the trip to Venus would be the primary problem, but again this is a challenge that a Mars mission is generally believed to have as well. Though in the Mars case I believe that extracting moisture from the Mars atmosphere will prove to be superior to stored hydrogen brought from Earth. Like-wise the collection of the SulfuricAcid droplets on Venus will be more practical then transporting it from Earth, but this is not viable for the initial inflation of a blimp, the Hydrogen must be on board the ship at the time it makes atmospheric entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom numbers I found the peak density of Acid droplets is a 45 km altitude, a mere 7-10 km below the operational altitude and within the tensile and thermal capability of things like a Zylon cable the density is 25 mt per Million m^3 of atmosphere (note that this is 5% of the density of an Earthly cloud). If this atmosphere is drawn in at a rate of just 1 m^3 a second (a very low rate) then the droplets are condensed out by passing the atmosphere through a fine screen (of gold so no it will not be destroyed by the acid, for that matter plate everything in gold, it\u0027s ridiculously cheap and easy to do) then over 2 mt of acid would be collected a day. The acid mix is thought to be 25% water, we might simply separate that out and dump the acid, or if it were deemed worth the effort water extraction could be raised to ~40% of gross droplet weight by chemically converting the acids hydrogen content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo water availability on Venus seems to be no problem when one actually looks at the numbers that are relevant (cloud density not overall atmospheric density). I would imagine that a specialized blimp-ship for doing this would be developed a \u0027cloud trawler\u0027 vessel that would dangle the collector unit on the end of a tether with the vessel equipped with radar to find and navigating around searching for the thickest clouds to optimize collection rates. The acid mix would be stored in the collector and perhaps once ever day or two the collector is hauled up and the acid transferred to a tank in the blimp gondola. When the Trawler itself is full, in perhaps a week or two it dose a fairly standard mid-air-refueling style transfer to another vessel (it extends a hose with a cone, other vessel inserts a probe), with the other vessel housing the equipment to process or use the water or acid mixture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voyager55","CreatedById":70945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T02:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould be kind of cool to say \u0022I\u0027m flying a blimp over Venus\u0022 yet it\u0027s a pretty pointless mission.
