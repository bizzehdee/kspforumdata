Perhaps such a mod exists, but given that the stock game keeps getting better all the time, my impression is that trying to take the game back to older, less-good versions\u0027 behavior is not super high on most mod authors\u0027 priorities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your goal is a less laggy station, going back to 0.90 behavior wouldn\u0027t help you anyway. The new behavior in 1.0\u002B does add to the total mass and drag of your ship, so that you can\u0027t exploit it anymore like that video. However, it\u0027s done in a way that isn\u0027t any more computationally expensive. Your space station would be just as laggy in 0.90.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, if what you want is to be able to do physically unrealistic exploits like that video, then that\u0027s easy. Just write yourself a snippet of ModuleManager config to make things 1/10 the mass, or 100 times the thrust, or whatever other change strikes your fancy, and you can get up to all the kooky hijinks you want. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-30T06:09:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2016 06:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
