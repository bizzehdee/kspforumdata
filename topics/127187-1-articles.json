I\u0027ve been looking through my profile settings and I\u0027ve not seen it...

The real answer is that there isn\u0027t a set size. Because it\u0027ll dynamically reshape how much is shown based on the dimensions of the user\u0027s browser.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSignature is under \u0022Account Settings\u0022 and not in profile. There\u0027s a list of five or so buttons across the top and the far right one is \u0022Signature\u0022. Unfortunately, it doesn\u0027t really give you any idea how big the sig is, so you have to sort of play around with it a bit. I recommend having another page open with a post of yours that you can refresh (such as this topic) so that you can see how it aligns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-06T22:35:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2015 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
