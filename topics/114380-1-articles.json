When I have a small radiator installed on the vessel it will cause overheating and explosion of a single part. Sometimes is the probe core, sometimes it\u0027s the battery, or a solar panel. Seemingly no reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry if this has been reported already, the other heating thread seems to be related to older versions of the game, not so much to the radiator interaction. This is a new game with 1.04 ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it is the radiators causing it because when I take them off, nothing explodes. It doesn\u0027t help that I\u0027m not quite sure how the radiators and the new heating system works since it is not explained very well... Does it reduce heating from re-entry? Do all vessels produce heat?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway yeah. Any work around? I\u0027ve already redownloaded and re-applied physics.cfg but it doesn\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a craft file for one of the ships that experiences the problem : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/ya768ff9jwvslte/Rescue_a_Kerbal.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/ya768ff9jwvslte/Rescue_a_Kerbal.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fchurca","CreatedById":64090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T19:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried it in space or just in the launchpad?
