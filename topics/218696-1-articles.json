That is whimsical thinking though when one considers what AI actually is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArtificial intelligence is programming code language mixed with a learning model that essentially gives it the ability to make choices based upon it\u0027s programming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does not... and I repeat, does not have free will.

Either you\u0027re a god or you think you can speed up evolution which supposedly takes eons of time to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrankly... the only way I see mankind making any sort of AI won\u0027t be actual AI but rather a kind of human/computer hybrid.... brain in a jar kind of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ethics of that are a wild mess of course, and if Oppenheimer had trouble sleeping over the A-bomb the guy who puts living brains into some type of computer or AI device is probably going to have trouble sleeping at night too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you even make a brain and technology interact?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep. I think the biggest game changers would be if one could create a matrix-like situation where the brain thought they were living in a real world but were really living in a matrix like simulation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really doubt we would even have a matrix simulation that could simulate real life so well a human mind would not quickly realize something is off. Even if you could how many failures and brains go crazy before you get it right or you go bankrupt? You cannot afford to make several repeat mistakes with property so ridiculously expensive as a prototype human/computer hybrid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the easier route would be to just build terminator-like robot bodies with brains and human grown and grafted on skin for a sense of touch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically a hybrid of robo-cop and the Terminator. That way the cyborg would not need an elaborate simulation and could still exist in the real world.

They could be a living library or a scientist or just about any job and do it better because they eat less and won\u0027t have to rest as much as a normal human.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see them ever replacing humanity due to the fact that they would be crazy expensive to create, but by doing so you could tailor make cyborg workers that could be uber compared to a normal human worker due to information access (a database in their computer) and enhanced strength and endurance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-31T01:02:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2023 01:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 31\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-31T01:50:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure about the basic premise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you define sentient in this context?

You also consider that without Sentiency, there will be no \u0022free will\u0022 - or the opposite? Without \u0022free will\u0022 there will be no Sentiency? In a way or another, you closely tied them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I have a problem with \u0022free will\u0022. Defining Sentiency is already hard enough, but defining \u0022free will\u0022 is almost metaphysical. For example, (and I apology for the comparison, but it\u0027s the only thing that I could think of), a victim of microcephaly is sentient? They have \u0022free will\u0022? A person with Down Syndrome is sentient? They have \u0022free will\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, going even deeper on this rabbit\u0027s role: our ancestors, the Neanderthals \u00A0(it\u0027s a scientific fact that humans and Neanderthals had babies together, I have some of their genes as it appears), do you think they were sentient and had \u0022free will\u0022? And about\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Etheir\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0ancestors, the\u00A0Homo Heidelbergensis (God save the Wikipedia!), they were sentient and had \u0022free will\u0022? Or yet their ancestors, the Homo Erectus? Had these ones algo had sentiency and \u0022free will\u0022? Going further and further on the Genealogy Tree, when we will find an ancestor that wasn\u0027t Sentient neither had \u0022Free Will\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we agree that all of the examples above have Sentiency and have \u0022Free Will\u0022, we need to consider that perhaps an 100% artificial machine, even if with lots of disabilities and limitations, may achieve that also - even if by completely different methods. Both the\u00A0\u00A0Sopwith Camel and an eagle can fly, but not by the same method - and what to say from Concorde and Space Shuttle?

Give Engineering enough time and we got the Space Shuttle, we can\u0027t just rule out the same for AI without relying on Religion or Metaphysics (but, interesting enough, this doesn\u0027t necessary means that Religion and Metaphysics could not be right on this one - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDemocritus\u003C/a\u003E predicted the Atom, didn\u0027t he?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout a Cyborg, well\u2026 I am not sure if a Cyborg will still have Sentiency and Free Will, unless an incredibly advanced AI machine could have it too.
