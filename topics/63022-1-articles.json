You can get away with less than half the mass if you are more efficient with how you build, especially on the upper stages. You can reduce your TWR on any stage that is only going to be used in orbit and that will shrink the total launch mass a lot. Go with 1 nuke only for your interplanetary transfer. It will take a while but it\u0027s worth it. Also consider using a separate lander so you don\u0027t have to put the whole ship down. That will also have a huge effect on your launch mass. If you get the ship small enough a dozen struts will be enough to hold the whole thing together. Consider using Kerbal Engineer to see how much delta V you\u0027re getting from each stage. I hope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T22:41:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToo many struts in wrong places.
