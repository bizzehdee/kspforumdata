The NomOMatic 5000 has a supplie output ratio of 0.000132, which I believe means that at 0% wear (which you will be at with your mods) the NomOMatic will only put out 0.000132 supplies per second, which works out to 2.8512 supplies per 6 hour kerbal day. Kerbals consume 10.2 hours. Unless you had some recyclers on there, that looks like it will be your problem.
