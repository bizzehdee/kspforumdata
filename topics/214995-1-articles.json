This wasn\u0027t the first time this happened. As someone pointed out in the YouTube comments, I was in time warp but didn\u0027t realize it. Watching the video more closely (at 15:30) it appears as soon as I used a period in the text description, that key also triggered the time warp change. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/MF4UDDlaljg?t=930\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022background-color:rgba(2,2,2,0.06);border:0px;font-size:16px;padding:0px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022 title=\u0022https://youtu.be/MF4UDDlaljg?t=930\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/MF4UDDlaljg?t=930\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion:\u00A0\u00A00.1.0.0.20892\u003Cbr\u003E\nDate discovered: 3/12/2023\u003Cbr\u003E\nOS: Windows\u003Cbr\u003E\nInput: Keyboard and Mouse\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpected result: Text editing in flag descriptions and other similar UX/UI should not pass forward to game controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T18:41:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same \u201Cpass through\u201D for control inputs occurs in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E when typing a capital M can bring you directly to the Map view, or in the Tracking Station when - if you had recently been controlling a vessel - renaming a vessel and hold SHIFT when typing in the new name will trigger the throttle of the vessel you were just controlling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it appears to be a generalized UI bug where inputs are not isolated into text fields but still act as flight/mode controls for the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Also - you should edit the text formatting in your post - it appears as light gray-on-white, which is terrible for readability.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dakota","CreatedById":225122,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-22T16:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/217807-ksp2-patch-notes-v0130\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThis has been fixed as of v0.1.3.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
