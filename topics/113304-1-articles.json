It could never have been cheap and reusable in its existing form."},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T06:48:00Z","Content":"The way I was thinking was if it had worked as it was intended to. Obviously the shuttle as it was couldn\u0027t have been modified to that original goal without extensive upfront costs."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T07:10:35Z","Content":"Probably a number that would give optimal time for turn around. Maybe 8, so each shuttle gets one flight per month. Unless two flights per month per shuttle is okay, then 4."}]}
