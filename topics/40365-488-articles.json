Doing so would also open the door to allowing these atmospheric-accumulators to work when the craft is unloaded- much like Tritium Breeding (and nuclear fuel decay) currently does; and Antimatter Collection, ISRU mining/refining operations, and Science Labs all *should* (and do, to various degrees of effectiveness, depending on the current version and bugs...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
