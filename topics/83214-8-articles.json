I personally would would recommend OpenSuse, CENT, (K/X/L)Ubuntu, or Mint for beginners, depending on the desired use and your computer background. (OpenSuse and CENT are best for people with corporate computing background, while Ubuntu varients and Mint are best for people with home-desktop background.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I see myself as an absolute Linux beginner, but I have 25 years experience as a software developer, so it is not the matter of understanding. But Linux is an absolute different beast than Windows. And while it was not a problem to install 4 different Linux distros and play around with them (either in a virtual machine or on stick), it it took me 2 days to simply set the keyboard to a non-us locale (had to set the keyboard layout on three(!) different locations, and still the login screen has a us-eng layout, arrgh).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"terminalmonky","CreatedById":95476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T05:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have one for the group.
