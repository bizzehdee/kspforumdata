Yes its true squad kinda sorted their parts funny. But that has NO bearing at all on the tree itself. The stock tree is perfectly fine imo...there is a fair amount of nodes and the progression of them is fine. At best we need mods to adjust the location of parts within the tree...NOT THE TREE ITSELF!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd these problems have arisen with only a couple custom trees out there....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Munchkin9","CreatedById":78683,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T02:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would be interested in mods that take the game into more futuristic technologies. That would definitely require the tree to be expanded. Plus other mods that add things completely unrelated the the current technologies (Robotic Parts) just don\u0027t make sense being slotted into the existing tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case considering the mod-friendly-ness of the game it would make most sense that they give us as much access to everyone system as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
