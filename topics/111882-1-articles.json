Completely unrealistic in that the ships were manned and that the aliens did exactly all they shouldn\u0027t have done, but hey, it\u0027s sci-fi. On a more plausible scenario, the same aliens would have dropped a couple KBO\u0027s on Earth to create a short nuclear winter, at the same time as they seeded LEO with debris to take out all our space infrastructure, and probably dropped a few more precisely targeted kinetics on big industrial and population centers before they even got past the asteroid belt and to where we could take a good look at them, for good measure. If they had any sense, \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E would be the first indication of hostile aliens in our solar system, stuff blowing up in orbit and the skies darkening with shoot as the forests burn... if you are lucky and not close to an impact site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, you have to wait for a couple hundred years for the dust to settle before you can claim your new pristine ape-less planet and start growing alien crops. But then again, why do you need planets if you can cross interstellar space, their primary extermination mission would already be fulfilled anyway (there is no other plausible justification for interstellar war at this point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Still, zeroth rule of sci-fi, nobody wants to read about the adventures of a missile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
