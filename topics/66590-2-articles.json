This varies of course if you\u0027d rather give yourself a fuelcell or two, or pack food, or water, or dedicate a segment for part storage or collecting C02. The smaller quadhub only allows half the capacity of course - but when typically paired with a single Kerbal munching snacks in a MK1 pod resources will always last a little longer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yN3SnJE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yN3SnJE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wedges are small, a quarter of a 1.25 sized tank, but contain cylinders and equipment comparable in scale to real life.

Your mod will still function perfectly well if someone decides NOT to download KAS, it will simply not have that feature which will suit those who do not like to download other mods. It will also eliminate the problem you mentioned earlier about lining up the containers. I also believe that the functionality in question is part of the KAS API and relatively easy to program in.

It\u0027s taking a while because I want to make sure that the method I use is well documented and repeatable with other parts. Capacities and resource usage rates are all based off real world examples, which I use to create spreadsheets for part production.
