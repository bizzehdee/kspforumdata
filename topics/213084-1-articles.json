Vehicle traveled downrange and achieved its target apoapsis before exhaustion of fuel in the first stage. Testing of the Reaction Control Thrusters showed much greater than expected performance, a fact which did not go unnoticed by the craft\u0027s pilot. Pilot subsequently requested permission for a M\u00FCnar transfer burn, which was rejected outright. The Reaction Control System was then remotely disabled to prevent any potential pilot interference. The electrical system showed the expected performance, though it was perhaps a bit overbearing with its repeated notifications of obscured stellar inputs into its solar collectors. The craft was permitted to complete roughly three quarters of an orbit before it was instructed to reenter. Entry burn and separation of the second stage was completed without issue. Evaluation of the projected reentry location revealed similar incorrect predictions as in prior Ur Universe constructs, and did not take atmospheric drag into account. No reentry heating was observed. Craft safely splashed down in the ocean at a safe speed under parachutes.

Craft was ejected into interplanetary space, yet did achieve the desired fly-by of the M\u00FCn. Pilot was agitated, but performed his job admirably despite undesired outcome. The pilot was not recovered, and will remain in his capsule until such time as this universe is abandoned or he is rescued. Should Bob Kerman be safely returned to Kerbin, he will be extracted to the extra-universal facility for evaluation and comparison with Ur Kerbal of equivalent specifications. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230224163144_1_alpha03-launch.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.25\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp2/project2-01/20230224163144_1_alpha03-launch.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230224165627_2_alpha03-onorbit.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.25\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp2/project2-01/20230224165627_2_alpha03-onorbit.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230224170406_1_alpha03-mun-flyby.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.25\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp2/project2-01/20230224170406_1_alpha03-mun-flyby.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCraft: Alpha 03\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunch Date: Year 0 Day 1\u003Cbr\u003E\nCrew: Bob Kerman\u003Cbr\u003E\nStatus: Limited Success, Continuing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETask 4: Landing on the M\u00FCn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGoal: Project Completion. Kerbal placed on surface of the M\u00FCn and returned safely to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis task involved the creation of two new elements: A lander for landing on and returning from the surface of the M\u00FCn, and an orbiter for the crew to launch in and return to the surface of Kerbin. Previous designs were discarded in favor of larger size classes of spacecraft. It was decided to launch the lander and the orbiter on two separate rockets and rendezvous in low Kerbin orbit, after which the second stage of the orbiter would be used for the trans-M\u00FCnar-injection burn. The orbiter was designed to have sufficient \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to complete the capture into M\u00FCnar orbit with the lander docked, and to escape M\u00FCnar orbit alone upon completion of landing. The two-stage lander had sufficient \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E in the landing stage to reach any equatorial location, and in the upper stage to return the capsule and crew of one kerbal to a rendezvous orbit with the orbiter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETask 4 Phase 1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunch of the lander into its parking orbit was conducted by an onboard probe and without a live crew. This operation presented the first major difficulties of this new universe. It was discovered during the launch that the first stage of the launch vehicle was reluctant to detach from the second stage, despite being physically and visually separated. Some experimentation and reversal of time showed that the use of engine plates (mostly) alleviated the issue. Otherwise the launch was unremarkable and the craft successfully achieved its parking orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230224224348_1_dustlander-launch.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.25\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp2/project2-01/20230224224348_1_dustlander-launch.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230224224754_1_dustlander-launch.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.25\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp2/project2-01/20230224224754_1_dustlander-launch.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft: Dust Lander\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunch Date: Year 0 Day 4\u003Cbr\u003E\nStatus: Success\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETask 4 Phase 2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunch of the three crew members into an intersecting orbit with the lander revealed similar issues with separation of first stage from second stage. Adjustment of engine plates possibly resolved this issue after multiple reversals of time, events apparently unnoticed by the three crew members.

Prior experience with the maneuver node burn predictions were taken into account. The burn was started at the specified time, conducted for the specified length, and resulted in the predicted change in velocity.

No specific landing site was chosen; the only requirements being an equatorial location on the daylight side of the M\u00FCn with a clear unobstructed view of Kerbin. The crew elected Geofski as Dust Lander Pilot (due in no large part to his lower status on the seniority roster). Geofski transferred successfully into the lander\u0027s crew cabin and made preparations to separate from the orbiter and begin his descent. It was at this point the instability of the universe began to reveal itself, requiring multiple reversals of time. [Project Lead\u0027s Note: this constant manipulation of the new universe\u0027s timeline may have contributed to its increased instability, despite safety assurances from The Machine.] One particularly alarming instance saw the Dust Lander propelled at relativistic speeds into the Dust Orbiter after the lander extended its landing legs, resulting in total loss of both ships and crew.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was also during this phase that it was discovered objects could become \u0022stuck\u0022 in space, instantly losing all of their orbital velocity. They would maintain their altitude and position over the surface of the M\u00FCn provided they were not directly observed; observation resulted in the resumption of gravitational acceleration, ultimately ending in the reversal of time to a point prior to the unavoidable demise of the craft and crew.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe landing attempt proceeded once sufficient manipulation of the universe and timeline produced a viable sample. Further peculiarities were observed during the descent, such as the lander engine reporting zero available delta-V despite periodically offering accurate fuel readings. Further examination of the descent stage fuel tanks gave unreliable and occasionally non-existent values for fuel capacity. As such, the landing was performed with no indication as to the amount of remaining fuel, a remarkably stressful situation which did not go unnoticed by the pilot Geofski.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230225005759_1_dustlander-descent.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.25\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp2/project2-01/20230225005759_1_dustlander-descent.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230225010151_2_dustlander-descent.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.25\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp2/project2-01/20230225010151_2_dustlander-descent.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230225010222_1_dustlander-surface.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002296.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp2/project2-01/20230225010222_1_dustlander-surface.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding was successful and safe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeofski was unable to exit the lander and did not successfully plant a flag for reasons which have not been adequately explained at this time.

Intercept information was not available for the best trajectory to launch into to the reach the orbiter, so Geofski was required to \u0022eyeball it\u0022. During ascent, the pilot observed a large, partially-exposed rock arch in the distance, south of his trajectory. The reported location of this arch agrees with our observations of a similar arch in the various Ur Universes. Further exploration of this feature is encouraged. A close rendezvous orbit was achieved despite the complete lack of orbital tracking or interception predictions, which is a testament to the navigation and piloting skills of Geofski Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther instability of the universe was observed during the rendezvous between the Orbiter and Lander.

Once the exact cause of this violation of conservation of momentum was confirmed, it was decided that Geofski would perform the entire rendezvous and docking procedure on his own. This was a procedure for which the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of the ascent stage of the Dust Lander had not been budgeted, and required precise actions to prevent exhaustion of fuel resources.
