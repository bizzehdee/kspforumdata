The game wouldn\u0027t be able to display things usually displayed with targets, such as intersection points, ascending/descending nodes, or closest approaches because Kerbin has no trajectory at that point. The only thing it could do would be to display direction towards Kerbin on navball. And I find that kinda pointless because if you want to get to it or from it, burning towards or away from it is the worst way of doing so.

I mean I have found work arounds, but in many instances when you are on approach from a long transfer, or a transfer to an object with low gravity, having most of your tools suddenly stop working when you have only seconds to make adjustments and maneuvers is annoying. I mean I understand what you are saying, but it is bunk. The SOI isn\u0027t a finite sphere in space that suddenly changes physics close to a planet, it is simply the threshold where the planet is the dominant source of gravitational influence. Every planet\u0027s gravity can reach across the entire solar system, the only thing diminishing the influence at that distance is the presence of stronger influences. I understand that in the game, the SOI is a point where the local influence is strong enough to where representations of your relative vector is better expressed locally rather than in the context of the SOI of the sun. But in the game, the SOI of the sun seems to be partially ignored. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of the sun\u0027s SOI, how come it doesn\u0027t count as an SOI for any of the tools? Many of the tools refuse to work because you and the target must be in the same SOI, when in fact you and your target are both in orbit around the sun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize that some this has to do with the modal way different aspects of gameplay are being represented for simplicity. But in orbital dynamics the modes are not exclusive, and one doesn\u0027t stop when the other starts. But I guess that there is a lot about the orbital dynamics that have been simplified in order to make the math appear to be able to run in real time. To make people like me happy, the modally exclusive tools that use the word \u0022target\u0022 should shift to using the name of the SOI central object, and should continue to work in the new mode, even if their function is now somewhat limited by the fact that the target is assumed. Perhaps not all of the tools could keep working, of course, but they shouldn\u0027t all stop working. I get it that for usability, the game needs to simplify physics, and ignoring external factors outside of the SOI is a way to economize the math. But I disagree with the tools simply stop working because their \u0022home mode\u0022 is no longer in play. I\u0027ll just remind myself that this is version .22, and we don\u0027t even have aerodynamics yet... So there is an implied 78% of the software roadmap missing from the game, based on the idea that version 1.0 is the first \u0022complete\u0022 version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that you can sometimes use orbital tools instead, but sometimes the orbital tools assume you are in an actual closed orbit, so they can do really bad things to you, or apply math that produces the incorrect result. Flying by hand is fine when you have a simple ship and everything is working in real time, but when you are seeing half a second of physics per frame, flying by hand simply does not work for finer movements, the tools are the *only* way to produce fine grained results when it takes .1DV of change, and the 3 seconds it takes for the ship to respond to your throttle up and down can yield results ranging from 0 to 20DV. Only using the tools can I get that small adjustment to get my interplanetary heavy cruiser packed full of parts packaged for multiple moon destinations around Jool into the correct aerobraking altitude, so that I can save the bulk of my mass for the fuel needed for other maneuvers. I can and do use the orbital tools for this, but I have to inspect each action, because half of the time an action will do the opposite of what it is supposed to when my orbit is still open. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize I\u0027m just a beginner, the people that have been doing this a while had to spend a lot more time without the tools in the first place. I\u0027m also causing some of the problem, because when I fly a ship with 21 mapping probes, my parts count is about 4 to 6 times the parts count that I see people complaining about in the forums. My engineering workstation is able to make the game work slightly beyond to the limits of the software, and I\u0027m exceeding those limits enough that gameplay is difficult. Sometimes after I load my ship in the VAB, the VAB can\u0027t finish drawing the walls, but that is mostly for big missions like the Jool mapping mission. Once I complete my first aerobraking maneuver, I break the ship up into smaller sections, and gameplay is normal once again when the mission vessels are far enough apart from each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at some point, I may want to build a space habitat, for colonization or galactic travel. Exceeding a couple thousand parts that can\u0027t be welded into single assemblies is likely on such a vessel. So I\u0027m hoping that the game\u0027s part matrix efficiency can be improved over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is I realize I\u0027m my own worse enemy, and I could avoid some of the bugs and needing the tools as much if I stuck to smaller craft. But there is no challenge if you make everything easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really expecting any answers here...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T06:14:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this a Kracken thing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
