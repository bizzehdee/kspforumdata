If you are using Windows, check your trash can. Often deleted files go here. Simply right click on the trash can (or whatever icon you use), then select explore. Once inside, if you see anything that says Mk1.... then right click on it and select \u0022restore\u0022 and presto - you\u0027re back in business.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that didn\u0027t resolve the issue, redownload and install KSP again. It will not delete any of your downloaded mods and often will include the latest game tweaks. One thing I would recommend is when you get your mods the way you want them, keep a backup copy handy. If you\u0027re looking for the old Mk1 cockpit that looked more like a fighter craft than a Lear Jet, there\u0027s a mod out there that contains it and other outdated or discarded original parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can find the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1277/Discontinued%20Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDiscontinued Parts mod by NecroBones\u003C/a\u003E here, or if you prefer, install it through CKAN (recommended).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T23:03:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you bought KSP on Steam you can let it redownload missing files.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust open the Steam client, go to library and right-click on KSP.

By default, Steam is supposed to replace any damaged or deleted file from the game\u0027s basic core, to include stuff in the Game_Data folder. The last time this happened to me was a few months ago and one of my *favorite* parts to use, the stock air brake, had disappeared. I had to go into my archived Game_Data folder and copy the missing part!
