I previewed this one extensively on the \u0022work in progress\u0022 thread, so it won\u0027t surprise most of you. It did, however, impress me a lot! As I said there, development went exceedingly well. The new Vernor engines kept the stack controllable the whole way in the first try, I eyeballed delta-v perfectly, aesthetics fell into place like the parts were designed to be fit that way (some heavy clipping and cursing was still needed to get that boat-tail, but much less than usual in such things) and modifying to include a mod payload bay worked perfectly with only a few hiccups along the way (separate download, the first one is 100% stock). It even landed on its first landing test! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/AyXJZGB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AyXJZGB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AyXJZGB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is, however, quite faithful to the original, mind you, which makes this a craft for either veteran players, or those that don\u0027t mind having a lot of FUN!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 learning. Just like the real thing, and I enumerate the similarities this way because there are too many for a single phrase, or even a paragraph: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It doesn\u0027t thrust where the navball says you are pointing. The thrust vector points actually 5 to 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA under it, depending on the stage of the launch. It\u0027ll start at between 5-10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA when the SRBs are running, then when you drop them you will be thrusting about 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA offset (doesn\u0027t make the gravity turn easy to judge, let me tell you). Then when the orbiter is on the OMS engines on its own, the thrust vector goes just on the lover tip of the \u0022-V-\u0022 navball sign, which is handy for in-space maneuvering, you can still be precise on rendezvous burns at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The T/W curve on the launch is more or less similar: it needs the boosters to lift off the ground, and in fact when you drop them you will have to take your time before starting the gravity turn, since you still drop to T/W \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E over one, yet by the time you are reaching orbital velocities you have to throttle down because the verniers can\u0027t keep up with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It requires a short of preflight checklist. To save on orbital fuel (and yeah, another point, the OMS engines run on monopropellant, no oxidizer on the orbiter), you have to turn off the RCS system by hand through action gorups (double tap, because like the landing gear it doesn\u0027t work the first time), and you also need to engage RCS and SAS at all times during launch \u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E until you ditch the ET.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The ET must be ditched short of orbit (unless you fly really, really well), the maximum orbit is not really that high actually, and the orbiter has only about 3-400m/ delta-v depending on RCS usage and payload or lack of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It requires a tricky roll maneuver right off the pad, and while it has plenty of control authority on the pitch axis, the lack of yaw verniers makes getting used to it a must. You WILL screw up the first launch unless you are lucky, fast and experienced, but when you know what to do at each step it is \u003Cem\u003Ealmost\u003C/em\u003E easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Glides like a brick to a quite hard landing in the best of cases, and has the crossrange to make it to KSC only if you can already see it when the reentry flames stop. You need to go down steep to conserve speed, then flare up at the last second, or you will see a lot of booms when you hit the ground with \u0026gt;15m/s vertical speed. Getting it on the runway is not trivial for me, but I assure you, I have done it several times, even landing her in rough cross-country at some (not much, I admit) elevation. I\u0027m not itching to try again that last one, though, it bounced quite spectacularly. Stick to sea level and flat terrain if you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-While generally well behaved when \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Efalling with style\u003C/span\u003E \u0022gliding\u0022, with plenty of control authority regardless of being empty or full, you can flip her out if you get a really high angle of attack: that configuration isn\u0027t the most stable one in the first place, and therefore like the real one it likes flying upside down. It is, however, perfectly recoverable if you do flip her out of control, and you will probably do so in a futile attempt to slow the vertical velocity. That won\u0027t really work until you are pretty low on the atmosphere, at under 8-10kms. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Unless you put some solar panels or use the solar panels in the payload in the modded version, it has no power generation equipment, meaning it runs on battery power like the real one (OK, fuel cells, but we don\u0027t have those in stock). Meaning if you start cartwheeling in orbit like a jet fighter or stay too long up there, you will run the batteries out and have to rely on \u0022manual mode\u0022, keeping attitude control with the RCS system (and eating into your deorbit and maneuvering fuel). Manage your resources!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-And speaking of resources, particularly those financial, what about Funds? Well, it is also like the RL version in that it \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E save some. In fact, a lot, since the orbiter landed on the runway is worth about 50% the price of a new launch... But the whole thing is almost \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A190,000 to put on the pad, and I have a lot of rockets \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E SSTOs that go for less than \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A145k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, very faithful to the original in all respects, and incredibly fun to fly! I call \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of those features, and I\u0027m sure you guys will LOVE them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I think aesthetics deserve their own department.

You want to know the best part? There are NO cubic struts in the whole build, and only the single fuel line running between the ET and the orbiter. The wonders of using Ed Tools while building! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that takes me to the next comment, BTW... how much do you think this beauty will slow down your machine? Well, if you pick up the modded version, that could actually happen slightly if you have a very potato computer, that one is slightly more \u0022part intensive\u0022 at 130. BUT... the stock version, at \u003Cstrong\u003E80 on the pad\u003C/strong\u003E, puts many rockets to shame (yup, a bit of OCD here ^^\u0027). Yeah, 80, not 800. I challenge anyone to do better, and if they do (with reasonable aesthetics)... well, then I owe them \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E, and they can start by doing with my pride as they like, there won\u0027t be much left. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EUpdate: The new upgraded version is a bit more wasteful, at twice the parts of the old one.

While mine is still controllable and landable, especially after I added a bit more lift (in the right axis) and structural rigidity, it has gained the roll stability of...

She doesn\u0027t fly, she soars! That is, she glides a bit better now if you discount the fact that it is quite squirrely in roll. But you no longer really need to conserve speed to do the final pull up even, so very land-able. I\u0027ve done it without dropping the payload first! And my T/W fears turned out to be for naught: it seems I had neglected to check out whether all engines that were already there were indeed receiving fuel.

You can save that RCS for attitude control, because now that it has probes and payload bay action, you are going to run out of batteries easier. A lesson on the importance of T/W during launch, since I added no propellant and quite a bit of mass.

To open and close, I\u0027ve also added action group 4 to turn off the reaction wheels on the body of the shuttle, that way you can move the door to open position and lock the pivot before the rest of the shuttle really starts turning seriously.
