No. Sure many people will quote John Greenleaf Whittier. It would be disappointing that many bugs and game play issues would not get fixed.\u00A0But KSP would still exist.

When you do business with a company, their employees are relevant to your business. Many times companies are bought up simply to acquire the employees (most often IP).

You\u0027ll also note that earlier in the other thread on this subject I said that 1.2 felt like a complete game. You\u0027ll also note that I defended squad and give them credit for even starting this KSP project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow... as to the idea \u0022\u00A0What you paid for was the released version of KSP and it dropped with KSP 1.0, you didn\u0027t pay for a service, the development of the game...you paid for the RELEASED GAME and you got it\u0022... this is a bit dubious. As with all pre-releases, you buy a game unfinished with the expectation of development and certain features. Any purchase is in fact a form of contract. You can\u0027t just drop the 1.0 label on anything and say you\u0027ve fufilled your obligations. A recent example of this is No Mans Sky where the game they paid for isn\u0027t the game they got.
