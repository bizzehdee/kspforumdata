I have hundreds of hours in game and have made many many planes, space planes, etc. This is only a recent issue. Even community-made planes run out of intake air within seconds. These are planes that I have flown and worked perfectly before, but now all of a sudden don\u0027t any more. My builds have plenty of intakes, power, fuel, etc. Nothing is obstructing the engine or inhibiting air or fuel flow. I can see the intakes sucking in air, but when I throttle up, it\u0027s all gone in seconds. Is there some sort of bug? What is the issue?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-22T08:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/198368-mr_sapostropheez/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022198368\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/198368-mr_sapostropheez/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@mr_sapostropheez\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would really help if you could \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173756-quick-guide-to-posting-pictures-on-the-forum/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eupload an image\u003C/a\u003E with the intake information showing and give a list of mods.
