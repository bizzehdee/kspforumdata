There\u0027s two ways off the top of my head I can think of doing this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Set up the stage so that it is spent while still in a sub-orbital trajectory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Apply retro-burning rockets (either SRBs or liquid stages, though both are heavy and obtrusive unless you have mod parts available like the clearing SRBs in Silisko\u0027s mods) which should hopefully nudge the debris into a decaying orbit (if the debris is low enough).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, debris isn\u0027t going to be a huge problem unless there\u0027s loads of it. If you build stages with debris reduction in mind then you should only really have debris on highly elliptical orbits (from trans-object injections) or orbiting celestial bodies other than Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T15:41:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Keiichi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Keiichi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut some may consider these methods too easy.
