In the first scenario, 100 kJ more kinetic energy was imparted to exhaust than the second. So the same amount of kinetic energy was produced, just a different portion was divided among exhaust and ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027ve misunderstood anything in my assertions, please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow how do I interpret extra kinetic energy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis looks like only a small difference, but it seems like the inverse square law of gravity to distance allows it to have a huge affect. As I move away from the planet, my kinetic energy is being converted to gravitational potential energy. So I can essentially I can go further. 1250 kJ takes me the same distance in both cases, but in the first that will be the apoapsis(assuming non-escape velocity, and a infinitely thin ellipsis such that I am 0 m/s at apoapsis) and in the second I have 100 kJ left over and will be able to go much further. Since gravity is inverse square to distance, that small 100 kj of extra kinetic energy will translate to a huge amount of extra distance, correct? My velocity would be much lower at that point, so I\u0027d be covering less distance over time, but I would speculate that the inverse square of gravity means that it will take exponentially longer for that kinetic energy to be converted to gravitational potential energy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could determine my velocity when 100 kJ is left by solving for velocity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100000 J == (1kg * v)\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003E/ 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev = 447 meters/sec\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout calculating exactly how far from the planet I am at that point, I know the influence of gravity is exponentially smaller(maybe wrong phrasing) due to inverse square law. Therefore it seems like with a big chunk of my velocity remaining, I will be able to go much much further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in summary, while an extra 10% starting velocity only ended up with an extra 8% J kenetic energy (100 kJ / 1250 kJ), the effect in terms of distance would probably be amplified much more, maybe exponentially.
