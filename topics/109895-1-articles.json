In the first scenario, 100 kJ more kinetic energy was imparted to exhaust than the second. So the same amount of kinetic energy was produced, just a different portion was divided among exhaust and ship.\n\nIf I\u0027ve misunderstood anything in my assertions, please let me know.\n\nNow how do I interpret extra kinetic energy?\n\nThis looks like only a small difference, but it seems like the inverse square law of gravity to distance allows it to have a huge affect. As I move away from the planet, my kinetic energy is being converted to gravitational potential energy. So I can essentially I can go further. 1250 kJ takes me the same distance in both cases, but in the first that will be the apoapsis(assuming non-escape velocity, and a infinitely thin ellipsis such that I am 0 m/s at apoapsis) and in the second I have 100 kJ left over and will be able to go much further. Since gravity is inverse square to distance, that small 100 kj of extra kinetic energy will translate to a huge amount of extra distance, correct? My velocity would be much lower at that point, so I\u0027d be covering less distance over time, but I would speculate that the inverse square of gravity means that it will take exponentially longer for that kinetic energy to be converted to gravitational potential energy. \n\nI could determine my velocity when 100 kJ is left by solving for velocity:\n\n100000 J == (1kg \\* v)^2^/ 2\n\nv = 447 meters/sec\n\nWithout calculating exactly how far from the planet I am at that point, I know the influence of gravity is exponentially smaller(maybe wrong phrasing) due to inverse square law. Therefore it seems like with a big chunk of my velocity remaining, I will be able to go much much further.\n\nSo in summary, while an extra 10% starting velocity only ended up with an extra 8% J kenetic energy (100 kJ / 1250 kJ), the effect in terms of distance would probably be amplified much more, maybe exponentially. It seems like in practice this is what happens, but not sure if my speculative \u0022why\u0022 that happens is on the right track.\n\n**Velocity Neutral Burns**\n\nI understand why retrograde burns also benefit from this effect, since it is still a change in velocity and so energy change is governed by the formula. But what about a burn that doesn\u0027t change velocity such as a radial or normal burn? Mathematically it seems like the oberth affect wouldn\u0027t apply, since there is no change in velocity during the burn. (I thought these didn\u0027t change velocity, but it seems in practice they do, but I suspect that\u0027s only due to the radial/normal stability not keeping me perfectly aligned, correct? A perfectly aligned normal or radial burn should not change velocity?)"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T03:44:15Z","Content":"1. Your assertions are essentially correct. You just need to keep in mind that exhaust starts out having kinetic energy already. So in the extreme case of the ship moving faster than exhaust velocity, the exhaust is *slowed down* due to engine operation, and it\u0027s kinetic energy is *reduced*. That means the ship\u0027s kinetic energy gain can be higher than chemical energy available in burnt fuel.\n\n2. Because kinetic energy is quadratic in velocity, it\u0027s easy to convince yourself with the help of Pythagoras\u0027 Theorem that Oberth effect for radial and normal burns is zero. Only pro/retrograde component of dV benefits from it."},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T05:09:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Velocity Neutral Burns**\n\u003E I understand why retrograde burns also benefit from this effect, since it is still a change in velocity and so energy change is governed by the formula.

You will leave Kerbin ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nI have two ways i like to think about Oberth effect:\n\nLogically:\n\n(a) since gravity accelerates you back towards the planet at a **rate** (it kills m/s per **second**), you want to climb away as fast as possible to minimize the amount of **time** you spend in the gravitational influence\n\nMathematically:\n\n(![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) since gravity wells are ENERGY wells rather than (delta) VELOCITY wells, you want to escape with as much energy as possible since kinetic energy is quadratic-- you will end up with more velocity left over. \n\nSome applications where Oberth effect has no bearing:\n\nbasically, anywhere you need a change in velocity (and not a change in energy). For instance, landing. Burning at peripasis provides no boost in efficiency. If your surface velocity is 1000 m/s, you need at least 1000 m/s to land.
