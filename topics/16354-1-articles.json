With that in mind, the Des-Explorer series [working name] was designed with a mission \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV of 8-10 km/s. I expect this to be sufficient for most-all single-stop interplanetary trips.

GLOW is approximately 187 tonnes. I\u0027d like to keep this below 200 tonnes, but I would also like to get 3 untouched tanks into a 70 km x 70 km orbit. Adding additional parachutes (on separate stages) might be useful for landing on the Mars analog, or the watery moon. Or Eve, if I don\u0027t mind the one-way trip. Surprisingly, I may need additional landing legs. Also, for taking off from Eve, a reworked final stage or two. (I expect the aerospike to be the only functional stock LFE at the bottom of its atmosphere)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cooly568","CreatedById":17763,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-12T05:49:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m waiting!
