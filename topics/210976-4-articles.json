I remember Sim City which didn\u0027t quite bring the same level of depth, and caused many scandals, but still it added curved roads, 3D graphics and a few other things. The initial release of KSP 2 adds no new mechanics, and removes many from the game before it. There is only the vague promise of future updates that will potentially add back in what was already in KSP 1, along with a whole lot of other things that would better fit any old sci-fi game than a game grounded in real world science. Interstellar flight is the biggest one of these, since humans will likely not be capable of this for a very long time. This isn\u0027t even near future for us, we haven\u0027t even begun to experiment with it. It doesn\u0027t fit the theme of KSP, and never will, but they added it in because they couldn\u0027t figure out how to add depth to this game, without forcing a playerbase who mostly hasn\u0027t gone any further than Minmus, to now travel light years away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have zero interest in interstellar flight, or interstellar engines, or anything else that is really so futuristic that it\u0027s still science fiction, in a game which became my favorite because it kept things grounded in reality and current levels of technology. KSP 2 is completely disconnected from the game before it, it has completely different goals and I\u0027m disappointed that the developers haven\u0027t even attempted to continue this focus on realism that made this game stand out from all the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really think\u00A0 you must stop for a secodn\u00A0 and check\u00A0 if you see KSP as that because you decided it is and is painting it in your mind to force that result\u00A0 or you\u00A0\u00A0 really really think KSP\u00A0 is\u00A0 completely disconnected with KSP 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotice that\u00A0 the vast majority of people do not see KSP 2 as being disconnected at all with KSP 1, just extending further at the \u0022endgame\u0022.\u00A0 Sometimes the majority of people are wrong, but\u00A0\u00A0 usually\u00A0 if you are\u00A0 seeign something that\u00A0 basically no one sees, it might be good to get glasses (i.e\u00A0 calmly revisit your asserted\u00A0 convictions )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224208121\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210976\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221670854256\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[snip]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s funny, the first thing I did yesterday was build something in space that\u0027d rotate quickly and fling payloads to higher orbits.

Fusion reactors have been around since about the 50s/60s. They weren\u0027t power generators, but instead used to create new materials, but power generating fusion reactors are coming online in the next few years. In the near future, which is about 100 to 200 years, I\u0027m sure someone will put a fusion drive on a space ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInertial confinement drive - Laser fusion reactors exist and have been tested for years now.

Scaling it up is just a matter of time and materials it seems to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, all these concepts have concepts that have been proven. I will admit, taking one technology and turning it into another is difficult and completely not the same, but with a little work, I\u0027m sure all of these concepts could be produced, and would be practical. At least, more practical than other forms of travel, such as warp drives or colony ships or deep freeze ships. I think a ship using an inertial confinement fusion drive that will get us to Alpha Centauri in 5 to 10 years is a lot more practical than a ship that uses chemical engines that will get there in 100\u002B years.
