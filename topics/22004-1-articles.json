My logic goes like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. we can deal with Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere because it has a runway and we can do spaceplane stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Laythe has an atmosphere suitable for jet operations, but no runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The most runway-like part is a wing, and it\u0027s relatively easy to crash big spaceplanes gently with hoverjets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m seriously tempted to try to either mod-dock runway portions together after moving them to Laythe, creating some unholy fusion of a pontoon bridge and an aircraft carrier, or just let them float next to each other, overlapping boards to ensure all gaps are ramps up rather than gaps down. Since waves aren\u0027t implemented, they ought not to drift too terribly in the 1x time between local reassembly and spaceplane landing, yes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, assuming this is not inherently impossible to hold together (ha!), how well would a bunch of strutted-together wing-shaped boards take a spaceplane landing? Do different physics apply to part-part collisions than to part-ground collisions? And how is floating implemented?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whatshtisthis","CreatedById":42775,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T10:51:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, you can spend the time getting to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trekkin","CreatedById":23636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T11:43:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Whatshtisthis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Whatshtisthis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlternatively, you can spend the time getting to land.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is possible, yes, but not ideal; there aren\u0027t any really good landmasses that I can see that are in a good position for equatorial flights out that work well with where Jool is.
