By definition, this is the velocity where V^2/R = g. If you leave the spacecraft alone, it will orbit in a circle. If you try to calculate the thrust angle needed to balanced gravity from phi = asin(m*g/T)=asin(1/TWR) you will arrive at a non-zero thrust angle from the horizontal/prograde. This is clearly not correct since at orbital velocity, one can burn at horizontal since gravity is canceled by centripetal lift term. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have made a 2-D Cartesian model that integrates the second-order equations of motion (for position and velocity in x- and y-coordinates). The mode assumes infinite ISP engines, such that mass is constant (not a function of t) for simplicity, and is always equal to 1. For these conditions, if we neglect centripetal lift, the angle, phi, above horizontal needed to cancel gravity would be constant since TWR does not change during flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe governing equations of motion are: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea_x = T*cos(pi/2 \u002B theta - phi) - g*cos(theta)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea_y = T*sin(pi/2 \u002B theta - phi) - g*sin(theta)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe angle, phi, is calculated from: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ephi = asin(g/T);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trajectory is as shown below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e0A5h2X.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022e0A5h2X.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is clear the spacecraft lifts off the planets surface since the angle is steeper than needed due to centripetal lift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if we calculate the angle from:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ephi = asin((g-v^2/R)/T)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trajectory is as shown below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dr8uFMH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Dr8uFMH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is clear that the spacecraft stays on the surface, as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T20:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022armagheddonsgw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022armagheddonsgw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELD has already addressed this, but to clarify: in my example, \u003Cstrong\u003Eyour V^2/R term is the only non-zero term present\u003C/strong\u003E in a_r - and it\u0027s negative (technically positive, but a negative sign\u0027s stuck in front of it in a_r)!

If you are using Cartesian coordinates, and you calculate phi using asin(m*g/T), you will steadily gain height for finite TWR. If you subtract phantom term (centripetal lift, centrifugal lift , whatever you want to call it, etc...) you will not gain altitude. I have redone my results for the Mun (instead of Kerbin). The result is essentially the same: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Phi is calculated from asin(m*g/T):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UMlG3qL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UMlG3qL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Phi is calculate from asin(m*(g-V^2/R)/T):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WZfx8Z4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WZfx8Z4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, as others have said, the difference is small since centripetal lift term only becomes significant near orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, as you and others have noted, the final altitude gained becomes increasingly less significant for higher and higher TWR (since in the limit of TWR = infinity, phi = 0 for both equations):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3js7F9S.png\u0022 alt=\u00223js7F9S.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-26T04:33:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2014 04:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T04:27:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022armagheddonsgw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022armagheddonsgw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, now that we\u0027ve sorted out the issue with \u0022centripetal lift\u0022, I figured I might put my degree to use and have a crack at equation 17 like OP actually wanted \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E (apologies for the incredibly ugly text notation):\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat did we decide about centripetal lift?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T04:37:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022arkie87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022arkie87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat did we decide about centripetal lift?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, LD seems to be satisfied with Iskierka\u0027s explanation.
