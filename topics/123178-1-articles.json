When you build your next rocket and reuse that booster plane, there would be no cost associated with building it since you are reusing it. The only cost would be for the fuel to refill it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T12:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether you recover and re-build, or just store it aside somewhere and re-fill it, it\u0027s the same cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly $40k booster plane with $10k of fuel, land back on the runway for 100% recovery value. $2k of fuel left, so total value is $32k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could either refill that for $8k, or recover for $32k and build a new one for $40k, a difference of... $8k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI if you want to fly both halves of your plane look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlight Manager for Reusable Stages\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"seanth","CreatedById":79989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T17:18:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hab136\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hab136\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhether you recover and re-build, or just store it aside somewhere and re-fill it, it\u0027s the same cost.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECool.
