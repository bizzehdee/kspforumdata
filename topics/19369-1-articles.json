It has six engines, which means that it is quite fuel hungry and it is notoriously difficult to land. On the plus side, the cockpit can detach and has a parachute attached to it just in case something goes seriously wrong. It is also very stable in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img341/7549/k1fw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k1fw.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img38/9625/k1flightfw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k1flightfw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EK-2 STOL\u003C/span\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.lemurlogic.net/downloads/KSP/K-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe K-2 was developed as a high-altitude fighter that could operate from short runways. Although it has a good climb rate, its ability to operate at high altitude was hampered by the verticle lift engines not being designed for such a task and the aircraft being too heavy to operate without them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img214/7200/k2fw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k2fw.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img854/5747/k2flightfw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k2flightfw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EK-3 VTOL \u0022Hurrier\u0022\u003C/span\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.lemurlogic.net/downloads/KSP/K-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe K-3 is the only true Verticle Takeoff and Landing aircraft to have been developed by KAL. It can take off from anywhere and can land anywhere (apart from water) and its verticle lift engines can be turned off mid-flight to save on fuel. A skilled pilot can also hover the aircraft just a few meters from the ground using its two veticle lift engines. As well as the ability to take off and land verticly, it can also take off and land like a normal aircraft (though landing like this is not recommended as engine-stikes are common). The only downside of this aircraft is its inability to get to high altitudes. A number of this aircraft are on order for the Navy and the Marines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img542/7532/k3fw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k3fw.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img507/4200/k3takeofffw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k3takeofffw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img821/92/k3flightfw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k3flightfw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-17T15:52:45Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2012 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Niall\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDownloads added.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazurkri","CreatedById":16624,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-17T12:29:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice....now give us .craft files so we can test for ouurselves!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Niall","CreatedById":49750,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-17T15:53:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lazurkri\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lazurkri\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENice....now give us .craft files so we can test for ouurselves!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere you go! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
