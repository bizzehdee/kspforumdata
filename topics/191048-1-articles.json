Between August and May/June (my predicted release months) is a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of time. 9-10 months, to be exact. We\u0027re halfway through the wait, and hype seems to be getting lower and lower. People seem to be caring less about KSP2\u0027s amazing features, and even I have stopped getting shivers down my spine when I think of planetary bases and interstellar exploration. (But maybe I just need to listen to the trailer at full volume again, that seems to do the trick for me.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy theory: these are connected. Star Theory might have released the trailer and announced the game too early. Because of this, the excitement people have been holding for the first few months seems to be slowly decaying, lowering the number of serious discussion posts and\u00A0leaving room for the \u0022wow this game is gonna be horrible\u0022 posts to seep through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Star Theory announced it in January, they could tell us the release date just when we started getting bored of being hyped, and we might\u00A0get re-hyped and an exact time to look forward to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if 9-10 months is the typical stretch of time between trailer announcements and game releases, but if so, then the video game industry has it all wrong. They will lose hype too early before release, just like KSP2 is experiencing, and when they release the exact date, they might not gain enough hype to get enough popularity further on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if I\u0027m totally incorrect here (in which case, be sure to let me know why so I can learn and revise), but I think the choice in releasing the trailer wasn\u0027t the best of ideas. Let me know what you think about this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rejected Spawn","CreatedById":172225,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-16T17:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP2 section\u00A0of the forum\u00A0has only really died down because we have run out of new information long ago, the ratio between interesting information sharing and bored/impatient folks just flat out posting very questionable\u00A0filler has passed the critical turning point where many forumites have just given up on sticking around.
