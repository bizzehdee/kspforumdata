It carries nuclear missiles, and patrols the Pacific ocean as a deterrent to a nuclear attack. It also carries 155 crew (15 officers, 140 enlisted). Ignoring the fact that a submarine doesn\u0027t really \u003Cem\u003Ework\u003C/em\u003E like a spaceship, it can provide a window into how living on one might \u003Cem\u003Efeel.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst up: the psychology. The crew must be able to handle living underwater with 154 other people for months at a time. As such, they have to be psychologically conditioned. This is basic knowledge for many of you, of course, but it shows that the way that, say, Mars One is recruiting isn\u0027t going to cut it. They will need to go through a military-like training program to be properly conditioned. They need to know how to follow orders. This may seem a bit harsh, but if we tried a Mars One type recruitment program for the \u003Cem\u003EPennsylvania\u003C/em\u003E, things would fall apart fairly quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, a mission probably isn\u0027t going to have as many people as the \u003Cem\u003EPennsylvania\u003C/em\u003E, so that helps somewhat. But the large crew brings up another thing: supplies. Now, of course, the submarine gets it\u0027s air from the water, so we\u0027ll ignore oxygen. Food is a bigger concern for the purposes of this post. Anyone who\u0027s been in the military or even has remotely studied life in the military will tell you that food is provided through Meals Ready To Eat, or MREs. These things don\u0027t taste very good, generally, but they are small, compact and light. Now, if we combine this with the food designed for space we already have, we get a food supply perfect for long distance interplanetary travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many other things that make long distance space travel problematic which the \u003Cem\u003EPennsylvania\u003C/em\u003E solves. And any Mars capsule is going to be a fair bit lighter than the sub, even taking into account oxygen and materials. So, I ask you: do you think we should take the example of the \u003Cem\u003EPennsylvania\u003C/em\u003E? Or is there a fatal flaw to this plan? I\u0027m curious to see the answers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T18:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI certainly agree.

So I cant possibly imagine the thought of being stuck in a tin can so far away from Earth that it can barely be distinguished from the stars in the background.

The inability to surface. Now I know subs can stay underwater almost indefinitely, but they can surface at any time they wish, barring war time maneuvers or equipment malfunction, and this is a very big psychological boon to the crew, they know they can surface any time they want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA crew aboard a spacecraft can never \u0022Surface\u0022 they will be in an extremely hostile environment in a vehicle that trades vessel integrity and stability for less mass, its practically a metal balloon. Add on to that, any piece of galactic debris moving at a sufficient speed could be the equivalent of a cannon ball hitting your metal balloon, and you might feel better standing in the middle of a live firing range at an army base than in a spaceship for a year or more. Not to mention if something goes wrong on the spacecraft, there will be no rescue. At least with a sub there is a chance the crew can be salvaged should something horrible go wrong with the sub and they cant surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I say sub life is probably a cake walk compared to that, except during war time, im betting then its pretty much the same or worse because you are so much closer to home.

It can be reached by support ship or aircraft at any time. They can surface, bail out, and be rescued if necessary. There are also physiological factors, like the lack of microgravity and the quality of food (you can afford a proper galley and larger shorter-life food supplies on a submarine, whereas space crew will have to eat zero-g rations with a long shelf-life).

No, the Navy does not serve sailors MREs (although it has been discussed to reduce crew requirements). but MREs would be a great model to base space food on. They have a shelf life of at least seven years if stored properly, and if you strip it down to the bare essentials (just the food, no spoon, heaters, TP, etc.) you can bring the weight down to about 1.5 pounds per meal. And they\u0027re not that bad, they taste about like a microwaved TV dinner. Although after a couple months I\u0027d probably be craving a salad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for psychological conditioning, the only thing they have for submariners is that it is an all-volunteer force. They can\u0027t make you serve on a sub. That seems to weed out most of the head cases, although you still get some guys who think they can take it but decide later that they can\u0027t. They just get psych evals and wind up elsewhere. Or they end up cracking and taking a swing at someone (which I saw happen only once in four years on the boat). Then they get knocked down a rank, lose a lot of money, and wind up elsewhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that the most important thing they could do for astronauts on long-term missions is to keep them busy. On the boat we always had something that needed doing. Watchstanding, operating the plant, training, emergency drills, paperwork, doing minor maintenance underway, planning major maintenance when we got in port, etc. When I had free time I either read in my bunk or watched a movie. I\u0027m sure today I\u0027d bring a laptop along and be playing video games all day. But keeping busy helped keep your mind off of where you actually were. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think that an important morale booster for long-term missions would be to keep their mind on the goal.
