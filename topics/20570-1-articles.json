We specialise in all kinds of craft, whether it be manned rockets, planes, or even satellites, we aim to be the leaders in space technology. We also used specialist mods in order to create craft designed to help map out the solar system and Kerbal. Today, we will give you the oppourtunity to look and invest in our specialist crafts. Unless stated, we always use the ISA MapSat for mapping purposes, and MechJeb for Navigation purposes.

It\u0027s main purpose is to map the whole of Kerbal, in order to help future missions. It is suggested to use a polar orbit (i.e. head north/south) at either an apoapsis of 85km or an apoapsis of 120km, dependant on how much you want to warp. We use state of the art NERVA Engines for efficiency, and Solar Powered Ion Engines, meaning that this satellite has \u0022unlimited\u0022 power. The Asgard KerbalSat is equipped with the following extra mods/plugins:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovaPunch Remix Pack - Unmanned Module Only\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectricity Plugin \u002B VB Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Century Gothic\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ERockets\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAffinity 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Affinity 1 is our first ever 3 Man Rocket.

Comes with two parachutes to assist landing, and is also packaged with a stock version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXperion 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Xperion 1 Is a 1 Man Spaceplane with the same purpose as the chrysalis one, except it is designed more for short haul flight, and is powered by Two High Atmospheric Jets. This is a good plane for learner flyers, as, due to its\u0027 starting angle, takes off with only full throttle. It is also packed with a parachute and decoupler attached to the plane, which means that an emergency cockpit ejection (ECE) is viable. The plane also packed with another parachute for landing (Note: The Landing Parachute opens first, so press the spacebar three times in order to activate the ECE.). Comes packaged with a stock version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectric Lightning 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Electric Lightning 1 is a tribute to the \u0022English Electric Lightning\u0022, a real life plane that was originally a fighter jet for the RAF, which can reach the height of the atmosphere on earth - and has also had one special passenger before, to the name of Professor Brian Cox! The Electric Lightning 1 follows a similar design to the English Electric Lighting, and has one high atmosphere jet engine. This plane is currently available in a stock version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHercules 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I might be insane, but kerbus christ this plane is mad.

Yep, that\u0027s why Jebediah Kerman loves this plane. It can reach 110km (110,000m) high - High enough to go into space! This plane is \u003Cem\u003Eliterally\u003C/em\u003E a spaceplane!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight Instructions for Hercules 1 (Yep, it\u0027s that dangerous xP)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, you want to go full throttle, and immediately pull up (the plane cant take off by itself). Remember to jettison the front wheel by pressing space (this will be explained why later) If you want height, pull up to almost vertical, give or take 5 degrees (the 5 degrees can help with directing the craft, as tilting without thrust wont move the craft). The rocket will burn out before you get even close to the 100-110km area, but dont worry, it should still get there. You might want to move the craft into the return phase at this point - this is done by pointing the craft downwards (although not directly down). When you begin to enter the atmosphere (50km - 60km), keep trying to pull up. You wont however pull up until very late - so you\u0027ll have to persevere. At around 6km (which is quite low), you should begin to pull up to level, but nothing past that (thats why you jettison the wheel!). You should slow down to that of landing speed (40 m/s), with landing just like normal. Landing parachutes are provided - use them when you are on the ground or very close to it, else your plane will immediately go down. If you think your going to hit the ground at any point, press space until you decouple the cockpit from the plane, and then activate the parachutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHiring and Orders:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently looking to hire!
