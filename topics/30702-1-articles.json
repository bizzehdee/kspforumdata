This came to my mind when I was finding where to put radial parachute on large (rockomax) SRBs to safely land them down (need to figure where the centre of mass is, to land it near horizontal to prevent crashing as chutes disappear in the moment that part touches the ground, which is sometimes too soon). I know that game doesn\u0027t support this (yet) and they just disappear after some distance from main rocket, but it is one of my rules, try to safely land all things back for future reuse. So I\u0027ve strapped the radial chute to SRB, went to test it, and when I saw it spinning around the chute, this had to happen.
