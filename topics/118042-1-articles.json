Direct X is an API package and the differences between them are additive, not replacements (i.e. Direct X 11 has everything in Direct X 9 plus some new stuff, there are a few rare exceptions though). However, though the API is the same, the way it executes the methods in the API has changed, which is why the performance is much better in Direct X 11 for the same task. Long story short, it is unlikely to see any significant difference between DX11 on Windows 7, 8, or 10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs sal_vager said, Unity has to \u0027know\u0027 about DX12 before it could even force it to be used, even if it does contain the same DX11 API calls.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T18:27:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T19:16:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks folks. Unfortunately i have discovered that the AA when using open gl has now completely gone, resulting in nasty jagged edges everywhere. Unless i have messed up the command lines somehow. I am thinking i may wait until the U5 update to play again, until then, i will be messing about with settings to see if i can remedy this. Also i cannot access the main menu settings anymore once in the full game, i cannot access the buildings, and i cannot click on the menu buttons... very curious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe menu/building access problem lies within texture replacer.
