Can you also provide the following info- version of KSP (and DLCs if you have them),\u00A0a list of mods, with versions if possible, and what you were doing in the game when the exception occurred. Does the exception still happen if you reboot the game and load your save again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you change something recently which resulted in this happening, a mod installed or updated or the game itself updated to 1.10(.1)? That\u2019s a frequent cause of exceptions like this. If you got KSP through Steam, it\u2019s pretty easy to roll back to an earlier version, but you should copy the entire game out of Steam\u2019s control to avoid updates breaking mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd welcome to the forums!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
