Those are exactly the types of companies who do NOT do this. Early Access is a risk, not just for the player but for the company. If it fails, they fail. So really it\u0027d be \u0022Joe\u0027s Batteries\u0022 and Joe himself would be one of the 3 people working on it.\n- In your example, buying the 1.5V battery does not give you free access to to the 120V battery when it is ready. Or at least it doesn\u0027t imply it. Also, in Early Access for your $20 you\u0027d get the 1.5V battery, then a 9V when it\u0027s ready, and then a 50V when they nail that down, and finally the 120V.\n- Frequently Early Access stuff is either better than what\u0027s available already (except buggy) or so different than everything out there that the fact that it\u0027s not complete is mitigate by its uniqueness. 1.5V batteries are pretty common. This\u0027d be more like a self-recharging 1.5V battery for $20, but it takes a month to recharge and they want to make a 120V battery that self-recharge in 5 minutes.\n\nThat all said, you have to take things on a case-by-case basis. I\u0027ll never buy EA from DoubleFine again, but Klei? You betcha."}]}
