This can be tricky, but once you have it, you\u0027re in a good place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tsiolkovsky rocket equation tells you the delta-v of your rocket, which will be Isp * 9.81 * ln( m0/m1 ) Where Isp is specific impulse in seconds, m0 is full mass of the craft, and m1 is the dry mass (ie all fuel used up). To figure out how much mass of fuel you\u0027d need, you would have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em1 * ( e ^ (dV / (Isp * 9.81) ) - 1 )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this isn\u0027t super useful when designing a spacecraft. For one, you can\u0027t just simply add more fuel mass on its own. If you need more fuel, you need more tankage, which adds dry mass. Second, you\u0027re likely to build a rocket in stages, dropping dry mass over time as you go. This is why a mod like Kerbal Engineer Redux is useful. It will tell you how much delta-v you have in your rocket in each stage, helping you build what you need and plan it out. You can see how the numbers change as you move things around and add more or less fuel etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lynch","CreatedById":136598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T02:36:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at my Thread for further instructions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[h=2]\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125893-Kerbal-Rocketeering-101-By-Professor-Lynch-1-0-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Rocketeering 101 - By Professor Lynch [1.0.2]\u003C/a\u003E[/h]\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
