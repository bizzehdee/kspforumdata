So I\u0027ve managed to get to the Mun without looking at map mode at all before (using about 8km/sec of delta-v from launch due to messing it up quite a bit). Roughly speaking, what it looks like is that the Mun starts a bit ahead of you, then falls back (you\u0027re going around your orbit faster than it is at that point), and then appears to \u0027catch up\u0027 from behind as you reach apoapsis. I\u0027ve tried to use this idea for interplanetary trips, but even if you wait for a launch window and keep track of how much delta-v you use up to get the burns close, the accuracy needed is a bit too large to pull it off with a single shot. Instead I think the best bet is the \u0027get the apoapsis right, keep periapsis a bit tighter in, and wait to catch up\u0027 method - of course this means several decades of going around Kerbin.
