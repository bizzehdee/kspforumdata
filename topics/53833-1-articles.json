Mainly just for the hell of it, I don\u0027t currently have any payloads that big. I\u0027m getting close (got it up almost into orbit when the second last stage that\u0027s worked a million times knocked an engine off), but for some reason I keep getting breaks between orange tanks. I\u0027m using double stacks of orange tanks in a thrust plate configuration, here\u0027s an image to show it better:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZOJow8Q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZOJow8Q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, it looks crazy at this point, but I can revert a bit if I figure out what the problem is. It\u0027s always the double stacks in the row that fail (the 3 forming a T shape on the outside are fine). Originally the double stack was connected with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 struts \u0022stitching\u0022 between the top and bottom tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 struts at the top to the next inside tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 struts at the top to the next outside tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 struts at the bottom to the next inside tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 struts at the bottom to the next outside tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 strut out each side at the top to the next symmetrical tank (or a more inside one if it\u0027s too far away)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 strut out each side at the bottom to the next symmetrical tank (or a more inside one if it\u0027s too far away)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I started getting the failures, so I added the crazy girder structure in the middle there (two criss-crossed connections to each inside, outside, and symmetrical tanks). I figured that was massively more than enough to stop the top and bottom orange tanks from disconnecting. I also added 4 more struts between the top and bottom tanks for the ones that seemed to fail the most. Still I get 2-5 failures before the first stage is done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize that the ship is ridiculously massive (over 2000 parts), but it seems insane that it fails that much with that much reinforcement. I figure there has to be something I\u0027m missing.

The beam/plate thrust plate is still cross stitched the same but I removed the top angled bar, as well as all the cross stitching between the symmetric tanks. What I found is that now the failure always happens at one of the 6 tanks attached to the center tank, and it\u0027s a failure between jumbo and jumbo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like all the thrust on the outside means it\u0027s pushing inwards at the top of the top tank, and pulling outwards at the bottom of the bottom tank. This is shearing the two tanks apart. My basic idea is to somehow connect the bottoms of the outside tanks to the bottom of the center tank, but I can\u0027t think of a good way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I do have all the thrust vectoring disabled except for the middle 7 engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T01:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having difficulty understanding your description of the new failure. Can you put the craft file up somewhere? I won\u0027t be able to check it out soon (currently at work), but in about 5 or 6 hours I can take a look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, from what I can gather you do seem to have a good diagnosis there. The thrust plate helps a lot but it doesn\u0027t fix everything, because it does flex a little. It is therefore still better to try and put more thrust under the heavier parts of the rocket, and less thrust under the lighter parts. Since the central column is always the heaviest this means decreasing thrust to weight as you move further radially out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to accomplish this is to add \u0022drop tanks\u0022 (with no engines, or only small engines) to the outside ring of the plate. This keeps the edges \u0022weighed down\u0022 and prevents them from flexing as much. It\u0027s also very efficient because it means your TWR keeps increasing as you stage. A common problem for asparagus designs is that TWR fluctuates between increasing and decreasing as columns get light and then engines get dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you have at the moment is the inverse of this: a lot of additional columns on the outermost ring providing more thrust there than in the middle. You could move those further in and instead of attaching them as a T-joint, attach them more like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  C\u003Cbr\u003E  |\u003Cbr\u003E /|\\\u003Cbr\u003Eo | o\u003Cbr\u003E  o\u003Cbr\u003E  |\u003Cbr\u003E  o\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E(C = core)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would centralize your thrust more and reduce flex in the plate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also looks like some of your payload columns have no thrust directly below them. It can of course be hard to get thrust columns there because of space and safe ejection issues, but it does mean that these payload columns that are not supported directly by thrust will be introducing a lot of shear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-21T02:01:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2013 02:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T04:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should never under any circumstances, stack orange tanks on top of each other like that.

Especially allmhuran, I never got a chance to send you the craft file but I appreciate the offer. I tried a couple designs that failed for various reasons and learned a lot. I stuck with the thrust plate design, and moved to single orange tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried one with 4x symmetry that just kept wrapping around. Amazingly compact and modular, but due to the wrapping it always spun like crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then tried 4x symmetry straight out, then added more tanks to the sides of the 4 lines wherever there was room. Unfortunately it was impossible to route the fuel since KSP doesn\u0027t like going 2 tanks -\u0026gt; 1 tank -\u0026gt; 2 tanks. I also had a big problem with the sepratrons not working well enough and pieces getting exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I did the same thing but left out the center tank further out so I could route the fuel evenly. I also redid the sepratrons. It works beautifully except that it\u0027s 1750 parts and I have to launch at 1 FPS. And it seems that mechjeb has real trouble controlling ships with that kind of lag. When I take manual control though, it actually controls really well when the engines are on and is very sturdy. The stages separate perfectly even when spinning out of control wildly due to mechjeb \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout further adieu, the finished product:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YKbUAi9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YKbUAi9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, there aren\u0027t even that many struts holding the payload in place. If you look closely at the visible fuel lines you can kinda see the path they take, basically from the far corner down the side until the middle and then back out to the corner of the next row. The nice thing about having room for so many engines was that I could start with all skippers, open up mechjeb and tweak TWR by replacing them with mainsails wherever needed. The stability would probably allow for another layer, but there\u0027s no way my computer will \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anybody wants a copy of the file, let me know.
