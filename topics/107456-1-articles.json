Its why its generaly recomended to go over the SOI at 10x or less. 50X usualy isnt too bad but 100X or higher will generaly give some different orbit than what was predicted before the SOI.\n\nBack to the OP\u0027s situation however you only need about 3.5-4k dv to hit mun from LKO in an hour. If you can get a craft with 10k dv or so into orbit you could potentialy get there and slow down for the intercept inside a 2 hour time window. High speed intercepts like that are rather tricky and you might have to do a non standard launch depending on KSP\u0027s alignment in relation to Mun(aka may need to go almost strait up and keep burning) to avoid haveing to waste time going around the planet once."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRex94","CreatedById":114868,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T09:52:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sometimes if a craft goes through the SOI transition while at moderatly high timewarp its orbit can wind up doing weird things such as autocapture.

I wouldnt relish trying to hit an orbit behind Mun with a mission profile that required a direct burn from the launchpad with no time for manuver nodes, just dead reconing. Even knowhing how to push the vectors it takes a ton of dV to shift your vector if your initial aim wasnt corect when your at 3-4k relitive."}]}
