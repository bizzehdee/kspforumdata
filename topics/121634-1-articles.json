I\u0027m currently running KSP-1.0.4 under Ubuntu 14.04/Mono (which took some work to set up), I\u0027m a very well grounded C programmer, have done some small work in C\u002B\u002B, have never touched C\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201E\u00A2\u00C2\u00AF. My initial focus would be making small changes to behaviours of stock parts, to get an idea of what\u0027s going on under the hood of KSP, then on to loftier goals. I\u0027ve looked at some of the sticky threads here, and it seems like everything is thrown at you willy-nilly; I\u0027d like something a bit more structured, if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T06:50:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll you need to know in order to get started is seriously right --\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94638-Mod-Development-Links-Compilation-START-HERE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehere\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, try to get familiar with Unity and Blender/3RD/Maya/etc, because you will be using these programs if you are wanting to do parts mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps you get started \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-25T06:59:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2015 06:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by liquidhype\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T07:21:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell if your more of a programmer than and modeler, you should simply try to understand the source code that is made avialble by any Mod that comes with it own set of dll files.
