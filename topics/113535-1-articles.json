Its rather annoying to have to make the same change to staging over and over and over...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T22:41:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jkool702**"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T21:05:10Z","Content":"In my experience it does save it. Try adding an empty stage at the bottom of the staging list and then hitting space (usually twice) until the empty stage goes away, then try a quicksave and reload. When you change the stages in flight you need to hit stage once before the changed list becomes active, maybe it\u0027s not saving it because the new list isn\u0027t active yet."},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T22:42:32Z","Content":"That worked, thank you. \n\nI changed the post to solved, however having to use an empty stage (or any stage, but many times itll be empty) to get the staging order to save definitely isnt straight forward..."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T23:02:58Z","Content":"oh cool, glad that worked. \n\nYeah, you\u0027re right, it\u0027s not exactly intuitive. I guess I just do it automatically \u0027cos I\u0027ve been playing so long it\u0027s just become one of those things you do! Infact now I think about it, yeah, I always hit stage once after editing the list in flight so it\u0027ll be ready for when I need it, so that\u0027s why it\u0027s always saved it for me. \n\nI would still class this a a minor bug."}]}
