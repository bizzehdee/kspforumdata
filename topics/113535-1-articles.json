Try adding an empty stage at the bottom of the staging list and then hitting space (usually twice) until the empty stage goes away, then try a quicksave and reload. When you change the stages in flight you need to hit stage once before the changed list becomes active, maybe it\u0027s not saving it because the new list isn\u0027t active yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T22:42:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat worked, thank you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI changed the post to solved, however having to use an empty stage (or any stage, but many times itll be empty) to get the staging order to save definitely isnt straight forward...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T23:02:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh cool, glad that worked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, you\u0027re right, it\u0027s not exactly intuitive. I guess I just do it automatically \u0027cos I\u0027ve been playing so long it\u0027s just become one of those things you do!
