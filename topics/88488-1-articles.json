Say a mission is worth 400 rep base but your close to maxed so you only receive 4 rep. Rep to funds would be pointless if your only have 4 to convert. If you have a strategy set to turn 75% of rep into funds when you do that contract it takes 300 off the top to convert to funds and the remaining 100 goes to your rep and is probably only worth 1 point in reality. The contracts are worth that NNN reputation, its not the contract givers fault your reputation cant go any higher.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
