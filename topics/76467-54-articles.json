Hopefully one of them can fix it. Solution at this time is don\u0027t use the flight computer:( as I will not condone reverting to older version of RT2.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell using the flight computer is how I want to control my unmanned vehicals because it feels more realistic. I think I rather switch back to to the previous version (Remote Control 1.4.0) and play RO 6.0 than 1.4.1 and not be allowed to touvh the flight computer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-17T08:44:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2014 08:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadRocketsCo.","CreatedById":101686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T11:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@RedAV8R yeah, I am really sorry!

I have gone through the engine stats, and sizes and masses of parts, and everything seems to match real life, but kerbal engineer gives the delta-V as around 7,900 m/s, which is only a little more than LEO speed, and thus nowhere near the 9.4k needed with gravity and drag losses. What\u0027s going on?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because Atlas uses a \u00221.5 stage\u0022 system. After T\u002B 2 minutes 15 seconds, you\u0027re supposed to drop the booster engines. That\u0027ll ensure you have enough dV to reach orbit. Engineer can\u0027t account for this type of staging, so it\u0027ll display lower dV with any rocket that uses this system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T13:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@BadRocketsCo.:\u003C/strong\u003E Well...That\u0027s what I thought.

That\u0027s just for starters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, with the STOCK configuration, the symptoms you describe match, the engine itself gimbals, but the thrust does not....which leads me to believe that you have something conflicting with RO causing RealEngines NOT to make it\u0027s modifications.
