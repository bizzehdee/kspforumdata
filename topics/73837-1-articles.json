There is a green bar and a blue bar. The green bar shows the amount of science if you were to return the experiment to Kerbin, the bottom blue bar shows how much you get for transmitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/9/9d/Mystery_Goo_report.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Mystery_Goo_report.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis shows that you would gain 10 science for recovering the experiment to Kerbin. However, you only get 3 science (30% as shown on the blue button) for transmitting. Transmission is a maximum percentage you can gain, which means if you do the same experiment again you will NOT gain another 3 science. The actual amount will be much smaller, but the remaining science is still available if you were to recover a duplicate version of the experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The rules for exactly what experiments are repeatable and all that are in the wiki page. SciJr and Goo act differently than the others, but I don\u0027t want to bog down the thread.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you don\u0027t have enough electric charge to complete the transmission, it gets interrupted. I can\u0027t recall if you get partial science or not, but I know running out of juice in the middle of transmission messes things up (intentionally). When you watch the little window in the top left, it will let you know there isn\u0027t enough electric charge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T23:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing short on electric charge can cost you science, as the data gets transmitted in dribs and drabs when charge becomes available, and those dribs and drabs don\u0027t seem to add up to the full figure.
