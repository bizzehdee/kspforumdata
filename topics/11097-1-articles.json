Start burning when Minmus is over the horizon (exactly like the Mun). Burn prograde until your Ap reaches Minmus\\\u0027 orbit. Then position your ship in a Normal attitude (Pointing straight up or straight down on the elliptic plane) to move the inclination of your orbit up or down so that it intersects with Minmus\\\u0027 orbit.
