Instead i do it the same way as a orbital rendezvous. \n\nI go above minmus orbital path so that it catches up to me. Then I align my orbital plane with the planets orbital path, then i retroburn when the planet is close enough to lower my orbit and fall into its gravity.\n\n(Be sure to make good use of the patched conics.)"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T03:49:47Z","Content":"If you\\\u0027re starting with a fresh persistence file, you can treat it like a m\u00C3\u00BCnar transfer.

Start burning when Minmus is over the horizon (exactly like the Mun). Burn prograde until your Ap reaches Minmus\\\u0027 orbit. Then position your ship in a Normal attitude (Pointing straight up or straight down on the elliptic plane) to move the inclination of your orbit up or down so that it intersects with Minmus\\\u0027 orbit. By then, you should be seeing the patched conics display your encounter with Minmus\\\u0027 SOI."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T07:22:55Z","Content":"One thing not to do is to go via the mun.
