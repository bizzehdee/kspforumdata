Hell, I dunno. My rockets ain\\\u0027t perfect. But there are a few things that are simple truisms. Things that are simply correct. And while try and error can be fun for a while, sooner or later you want to get a rocket that\\\u0027s simply \u0027good\u0027. Since I now have moonworthy rockets, I guess I did something right. Everyone\\\u0027s invited to add to this, of course, I do not have the monopoly on rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPhysics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore we get into the details, a few physics facts. Namely, center of gravity, point of action and how they matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECenter of gravity, point of action and how they demand symmetry in your rocket\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe center of gravity is the point in your rocket where it would be in total balance. It\\\u0027s the point where, if the rocket was resting on that point, you could give it a nudge and it would freely follow that nudge without gravity having a say, because left and right, up and down, front and back, they\\\u0027re all equally heavy and perfectly balanced on this single point. That is always one single point in space, and unless you have a very oddly shaped rocket, that point is somewhere inside your rocket. Sadly, this point is usually not the point of action, i.e. the point where your engines create thrust. If it was, that would be sweet, since we could push the rocket wherever and however we want (ignoring air resistance, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the next best thing we can do is to put that point of action \u0027behind\u0027 the center of gravity and point its action vector towards the center of gravity. Or, simpler put, put the engine behind the mass and thrust in the other direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat sounds obvious at first has some implications. First, your point of action, actually the vector sum of your thrust vectors, for you nitpickers, HAS to be lined up with your center of gravity. In other words, your rocket has to be symmetrical to be stable. You can try that for yourself. Get a broom. Put the endpoint of the handle on your hand, with the brush up, and you will notice that you can balance it. You will also notice two things: First, it\\\u0027s easy to balance it as long as you work hard on it, and it can very easily tilt to one side, and if it does it falls FAST. And second, it\\\u0027s surprisingly more easy to balance the broom with the brush up towards the ceiling rather than having it resing on your hand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would now put a lot of pressure on that handle, you could thrust that broom upwards without it falling to the side (trust me, it would work). That\\\u0027s basically how our rocket works. Now attach something to the side of the broom and see how this works out for you. If you try to balance the broom the same way, it will fall to the side where you tacked something onto it. Unless you hold it at an angle to the side... looks stupid if it were a rocket, doesn\\\u0027t it? If you would thrust that broom upwards, it would not only fall to that one side, it would actually start to spin around the x-axis and do \u0027loops\u0027... or crash, which is more likely since gravity is playing in this game as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the first thing to keep in mind is to keep your rocket symmetrical, at least to the point where the center of gravity is always above the combined point of action (if you have more than one engine, you have more than one point of action, which can be summed up to a total point of action and an action vector). In physical terms, that point of action has to be lined up with the center of gravity, with its vector aligned with the hypothetical axis that exists between the cog and the poa. In simpler terms, the point where your rocket would be in balance has to be behind the point where the combined force of the engines pushes, and the engines have to push towards that center of gravity, i.e. their thrust exhaust has to point away from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat also means that \u0027inwards\u0027 thrust stabilizes the rocket, as long as the thrust is equal from all sides. It forces the rocket to stay in its current direction, but it also means that you are wasting fuel since you have engines thrusting \u0027against\u0027 each other. Think of it as the toe-in of your cars steering wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMass vs. weight\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you\\\u0027re on Kerbin, they\\\u0027re interchangeable. Your mass is directly related to your weight. It\\\u0027s a bit different in space. Weight is the result of mass being accelerated, either by gravity or by movement. And while you\\\u0027re weightless in space (well, your outwards acceleration from your speed matches the inwards acceleration from gravity), you\\\u0027re not without mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo cut the theoretical crap short, the more mass you have, the more energy you have to expend to change its speed and direction. The heavier your rocket is, the more fuel you have to spend to make it faster (or slower!), provided you do not have gravity to work for you. Usually, in this game as well as when you\\\u0027re overweight, gravity works against you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means, that a mass gets \u0027heavier\u0027 if you accelerate it faster. It doesn\\\u0027t increase its mass (unless you\\\u0027re approaching light speed, let\\\u0027s ignore that for now), but the stress weight puts on the mass increases. That\\\u0027s called g-forces. On Kerbin, you experience 1g. Which is equal to an acceleration equal to Kerbin\\\u0027s gravity at surface level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does this affect your rocket? Well, it affects it twofold. First, the more mass you have, the more fuel you have to spend to get that mass up into orbit. Hence \u0027bigger\u0027 isn\\\u0027t always \u0027better\u0027. We\\\u0027ll get to that in detail later. The other factor is that the faster you accelerate your rocket, the more stress you put on its parts. Some parts are able to sustain that stress. Some are not. It is, in general, easier to build a slowly climbing rocket than one that jumps into orbit at 9g or more, not only because our passengers don\\\u0027t really like having a truck sitting on their chest (which isn\\\u0027t as much an issue so far), mostly the problem now is that the acceleration you put into the rocket stresses the parts that keep it together past their breaking limit. Which means you have to add struts, which add to the mass, which cost you fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThrust-weight ratio\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, it\\\u0027s the result of dividing your thrust (in Newtons) by your weight (in kilograms times acceleration, i.e. kg*m/s\u00C2\u00B2, so... well, also in Newtons). Thrust is what gets you up, weight is what keeps you down. And if thrust\u0026gt;weight, i.e. if your thrust-weight ratio is more than 1, you go up. If thrust\u0026lt;weight, you can put your engines into overdrive and you won\\\u0027t move an inch. For the record, the Saturn V first stage rocket engine had a TWR of 94.1. In other words, it could have lifted itself over 94 times. Beat that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does that mean for our space vehicle? Basically, it means that whatever we put as rockets behind our craft, it has to overcome the total weight of the craft. Which also means that, if you have multiple stages, the upper stages are just dead weight at start. Yes, yes, there are rockets in there and they might have a lot of punch, but they do not add to the thrust at start. Thrust is always only the thrust you ACTUALLY apply, not the thrust your rocket can eventually do in total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that every rocket engine has a TWR of more than one. By definition. Engines below a TWR of 1 need some kind of aerodynamics on the craft to get it off the ground. The question is, though, whether the dead weight sitting on top of it STILL keeps that equation above 1. The F1\\\u0027s 94.1 TWR doesn\\\u0027t mean that the Apollo craft got shot into orbit at 100g. It means that there was a friggin\\\u0027 HUGE rocket sitting on top of that engine and hence it could barely get the whole behemoth up into an orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is that Kerbin has a gravity of about 10m/s\u00C2\u00B2 (much like earth), meaning that a rocket engine rated at 200 max thrust (like the non-gimballed stock engine) can lift 20 units of mass (or 8 stock liquid fuel tanks). Given that a rocket of 1 stock command center, 7 fuel tanks and 1 engine (totalling a mass of 20.5, 7*2.5\u002B2\u002B1) can\\\u0027t get off the ground but with 6 fuel tanks it can, I\\\u0027d say that should be about right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when building your rocket, always add up the weight of the parts you assembled, multiply by 10, then divide by the thrust of the engines, but ONLY the engines that actually thrust. The more you get out of that, the faster your rocket will climb. Considering that engines seem to overheat more readily if they\\\u0027re operated at the TWR limit, try to get to a TWR of at least 1.7 in your first stage. My Mun rocket has a first stage TWR of 2.2, which is plenty but not overdoing it to the point where the g-forces become unmanageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, keep in mind that you will use up fuel as you climb. Your fuel tanks will get emptier with every second your engine fires, making them lighter, meaning, less weight has to be lifted. Plus, gravity decreases with distance squared, which also makes the pull of Kerbin less and less with every inch you climb. Not as much as one would wish, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStaging, and when to do it\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaging usually means tossing dead weight. You jettison spent rocket parts to make your craft lighter. Less mass means less energy required to move the rest of the mass. The obvious choice would now be to stage as much as possible, to carry around as little dead weight as possible. This is not the best strategy, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaging also means that you have to carry around the weight for the staging equipment and, in case of a liquid fuel set, another liquid engine. A spent stock booster weighs 0.36. The equipment to jettison it weighs 0.4. A spent liquid tank weighs 0.3. The additional engine and the staging equipment to toss it weighs 2.8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA compromise has to be found. There is no hard limit to tell when to stage and when not to, what matters is how long you\\\u0027d have to haul around the dead weight (if it\\\u0027s just a few seconds between the booster\\\u0027s end of life and until the other engine of this stage burns out, just keep the booster attached, it\\\u0027s not worth the extra weight for another set of staging couplers. If it\\\u0027s for the rest of the flight, tossing it pays off easily), whether the spent stage prevents you from firing the next (a lower stage burned up covering an upper stage has to be jettisoned, of course) and what the stage is used for (an upper stage is usually in use longer than a stage to reach orbit that is burning at max power constantly, i.e. a fuel tank in upper stages lasts much, much longer). I find the sweet spot for liquid tanks to be around 4-5 for lower stages and about 2 for upper stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAs much thrust as possible to the bottom\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso easy to see, the more thrust you apply right from the start, the less dead weight you carry around. It\\\u0027s usually quite pointless to have a lot of thrust further up if you cannot get off the launch pad. On the other hand, as mentioned above, the more thrust you put behind your crate, the more g-force it has to endure and the more you stress your parts. Not to mention the air resistance which is of course worst lower in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edraaaaaaag\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile we\\\u0027re at it, drag. I hope I got that one right, it\\\u0027s kinda hard to tell how that part really works. Basically, every part you add has air resistance. Doesn\\\u0027t matter once you\\\u0027re in orbit (and hence satellites rarely look streamlined), but it\\\u0027s a big issue until you hit that magical 70,000 meters. I still have very limited data on how drag really works and what affects what, so far all I can say is that it\\\u0027s there and that you should probably take it into account, i.e. creating insanely wide rockets to cram in a lot of boosters to fire at the same time might be a drag. Literally. Especially if you try to fly such a rocket at high speeds. Funny enough, though, those wings seem to work in orbit as well. Don\\\u0027t ask me why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhere do you need the most power?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s a simple one again: From ground to orbit. You will NEVER in your flight have to spend as much energy as in that part of your flight. Getting from orbit to the Mun, landing on the Mun, getting back off the moon, flying back to Kerbin and landing there? Easily done with about 1/6th of the fuel spent to get into orbit. I am NOT kidding or exaggerating here. Remember that Saturn V rocket that sent Apollo to the moon? Remember how friggin\\\u0027 huge that thing was? And what a tiny little bit of it actually went to the moon, with the rest being tossed somewhere along the way? And how that little service module that got them basically from orbit to moon also got them back? It\\\u0027s the same here. You will spend a good 80% of fuel and dump about as much of your rocket before you reach the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELong or wide?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreferably neither. Making your rocket longer is about as bad as making it wider. For various reasons. Wide rockets tend to be bottom-heavy (because, usually, they are wide at the bottom, to maximize thrust at liftoff), making them harder to control because they sway easily, and they are prone to out of control rolling if the thrusters on the outer edges are not PERFECTLY aligned (which they are, well, never), due to leverage. Also, I\\\u0027d expect them to be very susceptible to drag, meaning a lot of power is lost due to air resistance. Wide rockets usually need quite a bit of SAS to keep from spinning out of control. And they are prone to \u0027flipping\u0027, i.e. uncontrollably going upside down because they are easy to tilt and bank. Think of the broom example at the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong rockets are very hard to tilt and bank, making them hard to steer and very sluggish. They also usually suffer from top-heaviness, especially after a good deal of their lower stage fuel is spent, which can result in rockets that are very hard to control and to keep from going \u0027keel-up\u0027, i.e. nose-down without a lot of RCS thrust. Long rockets usually need quite a few wings to keep them manageable and responsive. And even then they are very slow to react and need foresightful piloting. They usually keep their direction pretty well as long as they are balanced and there\\\u0027s a lot of thrust applied, but once you bank and tilt them, they can very easily oversteer, especially in horizontal flight with a center of mass that\\\u0027s very close to the top (as it is usually just before your ascent stage is burned up, with a lot of empty and near empty fuel tanks hanging on your tail). Still, I prefer long over wide rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, with all that, what IS now the best design?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHell, if I only knew...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut from these tidbits we can puzzle together a few cornerstones that give us a good idea what a GOOD design would be, and what would be a BAD one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s a GOOD idea to put every engine that CAN actually thrust at launch to work right at launch. Else it\\\u0027s dead weight we first have to haul upwards. If that gives you too much thrust and your rocket starts to fall apart due to excessive G forces, slap on another can of gas for that liquid fuel rocket, or take off some boosters (yeah, right...). It MAY be a good idea to not run that liquid engine at full power if you get so fast that your friction is killing most of the power you put behind it. Actually, I usually take off with full throttle, only to ease off a little as I climb to keep the speed from going overboard and being burned in friction. But if you have a big rocket, it CAN be a very good idea to make the first stage(s) only of solid boosters, they\\\u0027re very light for their push and even with a coupler on them they have a better TWR than liquid engines. Their main drawback, the inability to control their thrust output, doesn\\\u0027t matter for the first 20,000 Meters since you actually just want to get the hell up there. Do not expect too much from that, a full complement of two solid-only stages underneath every single engine of my actual first stage only got me about half a fuel tank. Yes, half a stock fuel tank is all you get for slapping two rows of solid stages under your rocket. The diminishing returns are stunning!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith bigger rockets, you\\\u0027ll run into the need to add SAS to keep them manageable. Only one ASAS module gives you any benefits, so put only one of them into your rocket. The key difference between SAS and ASAS is, as the description says, that ASAS is more like an autopilot, SAS is more like a gyroscope. In other words, ASAS only works as well as YOU could, or, in other terms, if the rocket is uncontrollable, ASAS cannot control it either. If you have wings (and, IMO, you should have some at least as long as you\\\u0027re hauling a big ass rocket about), you might even be able to forgo the normal SAS modules. My Mun rocket only has one ASAS module and no SAS modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rocket should get thinner as it progresses upwards. From afar, it should look like a very steep pyramide. At least IMO. Top-heavy rockets are usually very hard to control, since their center of gravity is far from the point of action. The further away, the bigger the lever, the more wings and other control tidbits you need to keep it upright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need most of your fuel on your way up. Once you\\\u0027re in orbit, even the trans-lunar shot is peanuts compared to the expense to get into an orbit. It\\\u0027s quite ok to create an unwieldy, but powerful lower stage and create a very manageable and precisely controlable stage for upper orbit that has rather little fuel compared to it. Try different designs here, it\\\u0027s all right to have zero control (aside of \u0027keep it upright by ASAS\u0027) over the rocket for the first 20,000 or even 40,000 Meters of its trip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seanoog","CreatedById":8599,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-18T18:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy head hurts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Good read that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo issues with your observations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I strongly advise posting pictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Of ships designs that express your observations in action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Help advise new KSP players, with ship designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Dummies guide to ship building. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferrit","CreatedById":2929,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-18T19:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENicely written, very informative (a few diagrams might not go amiss but hey)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA tiny issue - the planet\\\u0027s Kerbin, the star\\\u0027s (usually) Kerbol \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivan Ivanovich","CreatedById":8977,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-19T10:52:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbin?
