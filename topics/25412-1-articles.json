I hope that it works out though...\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of the Saturn V, the SLS will use a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-2X\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJ2-X\u003C/a\u003E in its cryogenic upper-stage. Originally the J2-X was based on the old J-2 that the Saturn V used, but the design has evolved quite during development and is essentially a new engine. Also I\u0027ve heard that Dynetics-Pratt \u0026amp; Whitney Rocketdyne want to revamp the mighty old F1 for use in the SLS instead of the RS-25 (the Space Shuttle main engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.aerospaceprojectsreview.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SLS_Architecture_8x10_20120720_full.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SLS_Architecture_8x10_20120720_full.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SLS even look Saturn V, i mean black and white painting:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T06:33:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pawelk198604\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pawelk198604\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe SLS even look Saturn V, i mean black and white painting:)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EMany rockets are black and white even the old Aggregat 4.
