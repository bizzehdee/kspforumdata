Inspired by the C-119 created by Damonjay and CarolRawley, the C-120 was created when engineers attempting to reverse-engineer the Boxcar mixed up blueprints and created this monstrosity instead. The result was a large, delta wing aircraft with less than standard speed and as much manuverability as a london bus. Nevertheless, the gliding properties have proven substantial, the range exceptional, and stability has been satisfactory. It also posesses limited VTOL capability and standard-issue landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img835.imageshack.us/img835/9636/c120cuckoo.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022c120cuckoo.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, during testing, Jeb decided to take it for a spin beyond the atmosphere.
