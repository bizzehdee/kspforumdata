I\u0027ve been playing an unhealthy amount of KSP for the last month or so, and figured it was time to sign up on the forums. When I started playing, I burned through the stock career in a few weeks, and then loaded up on mods for a meatier career mode. I have since been incredibly impressed by the modding community for this game, and that\u0027s a big part of why I\u0027m still as hooked now as I was when I first started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I\u0027ve got a (distant) background in computer science and Java programming, and have recently been taking classes on both Java and C#. I\u0027m not a skilled programmer by any means, but I learn best by having a project that I can work through and teach myself by doing. I\u0027d love to start working on developing mods for KSP (plugin-type stuff, not so much with textures/graphics), so I was hoping some kind kerbalnaut could point me in the right direction to resources for getting started on Unity and KSP plugin development.
