What happen when my main rocket keeps its curse to orbit, can a autopilot guide the booster and landed close to the KSC even if I can not longer see it?\n\nThere is a script for Kos that work like this?\n\nThere are 2 mods that help with booster recovery, the one that I use is \u0022Flight\\_Manager\\_for\\_Reusable\\_Stages\u0022 which is cool but with manual flight is always hard, also I need to do this for both boosters.\n\nThe second mod is \u0022stageRecovery\u0022 but it just recover things with parachutes included in a not realistic way, which is the same than nothing.\n\nIt will be nice to have a mod which we can set some action groups and parameters (as retro burn) and then use the engines to land at certain coordinates.\n\n\u0022Smart parts\u0022 mod can help in this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T15:31:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 03:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngelLestat**"},{"CreatedByName":"parachutingturtle","CreatedById":113739,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T15:07:57Z","Content":"I feel like kOS\u002BSmartParts should be able to do it, but I\u0027m not sure what happens when the vessel gets unloaded when it gets too far from the active vessel.

That might be enough for a landing with parachutes but definitely not enough for a complex powered procedure. Your best bet would probably be a mixture of FMRS to keep the focus on the stage and kOS or Mechjeb to land it for you."},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T19:13:16Z","Content":"Ok, it seems that those are the only ways.
