I am sure it has to be one of the mods, or something lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: First off, because I forgot to mention it above, I always click \u0027Keep Data\u0027. Secondly, I have been doing further testing (I have even removed the ScienceAlert mod to see if that was the issue) and have determined that the problems start after the first bit of earned science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started a new career, picked up the first two contracts, completed them, got 20 science, in total, from my launch, spent it on the first two upgrades. I then upgraded the admin building (something I didn\u0027t do before either btw), got 4 more contracts. I launched a new ship into the air and reached 32km. Two of those contracts were, reaching 25km and testing out realchute conic nose parachute. Both of them were completed before I landed (got green complete checkmarks and clicked the trash can icon). Landed the craft, recovered it. This time, I wasn\u0027t expecting much science (just what was offered by those contracts) but still, greyed out tab and both of those contracts are still listed as \u0027incomplete\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I am at a loss now. Also, just so you know, this is something very repeatable. I don\u0027t know how yet; however, while this is happening in my 32bit Windows version, I decided to test it within my 64bit Linux version and sure enough, new game, new career, same issues. The only thing that is identical with them is some of the mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: One more thing. Since I have the KSP Achievements mod installed, I decided to take a look at it again and noticed not even those are saving after the first flight. So, basically, what I have going on is this;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) First flight works fine. I gain science, complete contracts, and gain achievements;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) All flights after that act like simulations. No money, no science, no contracts, no achievements. Nothing remains completed after clicking \u0027Recover Vessel\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I can also verify it works perfectly fine without any mods. I shall now try the long, arduous journey of removing one mod at a time and testing a new game. Unless someone else has already figured out which mod is causing this, I expect this to take me roughly a week or two lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Even further information for those whom might be able to help. As I was doing some testing, I decided to watch my KSP.log and see what was going on. I shall post some of the things I\u0027ve noticed below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[LOG 06:36:21.606] KK: Funds changed - 11955.4804918169 because VesselRecovery\u003Cbr\u003E[LOG 06:36:21.609] [SR] Adding funds: 1147.73828125, New total: 11955.4804918169\u003Cbr\u003E[LOG 06:36:26.900] Awarding 13241.5248081088 funds to player for contract completion\u003Cbr\u003E[LOG 06:36:26.902] KK: Funds changed - 25197.0052999257 because ContractReward\u003Cbr\u003E[LOG 06:36:26.904] Awarding 73.16 reputation to player for contract completion\u003Cbr\u003E[LOG 06:36:26.906] Added 72.47913 (73.16) reputation: \u0027ContractReward\u0027.\u003Cbr\u003E[LOG 06:36:26.911] Contract (Set altitude record of 25000m.): Altitude record reached!

Here is the entire log (I\u0027ve tried to put this on a pastebin like site, but the entire log file is 3mb and causes browser crashing, so used file hosting instead). I\u0027ve tried to look through it but I am not really noticing anything wrong. I see an error about there not being a KK.cfg file within the save folder, but that is all, and I doubt that would cause this type of issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/ksp_2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.filedropper.com/ksp_2\u003C/a\u003E. It has only the KSP.log within it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Well now, I guess I was just saved a lot of tedious work. Started up KSP to find out there was an update to Flight Manager for Reusable Stages. Decided to look at the changelog and saw this;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev0.3.02\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebug fix: Recovering main vessel leads into mission progress loss\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, updated and tested my game and sure enough, problem is gone. So, this is to Bit Fiddler and the original poster as well, if you have FMRS installed, update it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T20:20:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 08:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikifox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFurther Information \u0026amp; Corrections\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tdubic","CreatedById":87102,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-07T12:38:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have installed mod Kerbalism, this could be reason why you don\u0027t get any science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-07T12:40:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2018 12:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by tdubic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-28T16:39:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome off-topic content has been removed.\u00A0 In addition, note that this gameplay question is from several years ago, so all the people involved have presumably long since solved their issues, and any \u0022helpful\u0022 advice \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enow\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is moot.\u00A0 Accordingly, locking the thread to prevent further confusion.\u00A0 If someone has a relevant gameplay question about \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecurrent\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E KSP, feel free to start your own thread.\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
