So I made a new craft and built it the way I wanted to, and I plan on using Payloader to attach it to another ship of mine using the RAT as the so-called launcher vehicle. So what I did was I attached a new command pod and decoupler to the top of the RAT \u0027launch ship\u0027 and tried using payloader but it wasn\u0027t successful, the reason being that the new command pod was not considered the \u0027main\u0027 command pod.
