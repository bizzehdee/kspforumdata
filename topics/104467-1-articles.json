The model is pretty decent for a beginner. The polygon density looks about right, and it looks somewhat plausible as a structure (I\u0027d add some diagonal struts between both ring pairs, and I\u0027d make the middle rings and middle struts touch the tank)\n\nIf you can do this, you can do UVs.

The UVs will stay the same."},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T13:35:52Z","Content":"So far I haven\u0027t run into any big issues with unwrapping.
