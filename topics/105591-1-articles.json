In a vacuum, we expel the exhaust gases in one direction. The force exerted on the rocket by the expanding gases is what gives it its thrust. However, the center of mass of the system as a whole doesn\u0027t move from its original position. What you need for the rocket to be efficient is to direct all the exhaust gas in a single direction- any expansion of the gases sideways doesn\u0027t contribute to thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet engines (and propellers) work differently- they take in their reaction mass from the atmosphere and accelerate it- in this case the acceleration of the atmospheric air provides the thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to see it, is like a boat.
