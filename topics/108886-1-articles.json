Yes, it\u0027s a very simplified implementation - closer to the sun you\u0027d want to have a risk of damaging parts when hit by particles (See: [ESA Giotto probe](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Giotto_overview)) - but still adds quite interesting factor into the flight dynamics.\n\nVolcanoes would be much different."},{"CreatedByName":"fairytalefox","CreatedById":115320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T11:27:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What I would like to see in this game:\n\u003E \n\u003E - 64bit support.\n\nI assume, you mean \u0022on Windows\u0022.\n\nImpossible without Unity 5.

Addition of resources on a planet surface was definitely a move in a right direction, but there\u0027s so much more than can be done.
