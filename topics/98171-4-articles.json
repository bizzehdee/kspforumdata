Kegereneku - please could you stop dismissing simulations because they \u0027don\u0027t go down to the Planck scale.\u0027 It\u0027s an absurd expectation and just looks silly. No simulation of \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E goes down to the Planck scale. We currently have no idea which physics apply at that scale to even base a simulation on, let alone scale such a simulation up to something physically relevant - like a single proton.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T08:19:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSK, my Planck scale analogy is (1) a deliberate joke (2) precisely meant to mock absurd expectation of realism from KSP, and (3) a hint that video-simulagametor do NOT actually simulate neither atom or molecules individually, collision between molecule and wing...etc. It\u0027s all abstracted through formula.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet I bet that you could fairly easily \u0022simulate event that happen at the Planck\u0027s scale\u0022 (with the same veracity than most simulator) if it wasn\u0027t for the \u003Cstrong\u003Etransition break\u003C/strong\u003E at the point where our damn real physic model cannot link the infinitely small and big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway \u0022simulation video game\u0022 is an arbitrary misnomer used to help categorizing game, while true Simulation and Game are built following distinct reasoning.
