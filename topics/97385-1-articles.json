I\u0027m at it again, messing with things I don\u0027t understand yet. It\u0027s how we learn, right?...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve got a marker object in a part that I\u0027d like to only appear in the editor. I naively thought I might get away with disabling the marker GO before hitting the part tools export button and enabling again with a little code (which I can do as a plain old PartModule no problem).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnsurprisingly, that doesn\u0027t work and the marker still shows up in the editor pane. I think I need to poke some things about in a non-PartModule (probably Part class?) sort of fashion to be able to achieve this. Pointers for where to start greatly appreciated, I\u0027ve only ever worked with PartModules so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, as ever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDP","CreatedById":30775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-21T23:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you aren\u0027t going to use the marker in flight at all, you could simply destroy the gameobject in the onstart method if the start state isn\u0027t editor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-21T23:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI put a few print statements in here and there, it doesn\u0027t look like OnStart runs until the part is picked, so the object still shows up in the part picker pane.
