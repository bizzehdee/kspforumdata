It doesn\u0027t matter how crazy the origin is, or why the Kerbals are there, but I just want to know what people think and have these awesome stories in one place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor myself, I believe in the old theory that Kerbals are descended from plant species, which explains their green hue. It would also explain how they can stay on long spaceflights for periods of time without needing nourishment. Yes, they have snacks, but plants can survive without any specific fertilizer. As long as they can take in nutrients from soils and sunlight to make energy, I think they can survive. An idea that just barely occurred to me is that, as plants, if Kerbals exhale oxygen as a waste product, they would have to wear their suits even on Kerbin so they could have a more concentrated form of the CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u00A0\u003C/sub\u003Ethey need, similarly to how real astronauts\u0027 suits supply them with oxygen. I think that Kerbals are an entirely peaceful, benign race that just want to explore space and learn what they can about the universe. As for the lack of cities on Kerbin, I do think they tend to live underground, mining for nutrients and metals to build spaceships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skylon","CreatedById":175317,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-16T18:56:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is simple and sort of made up on the spot but:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal life was delivered to Kerbin via an asteroid.
