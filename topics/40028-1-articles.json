Now the SAS does hold the heading for the most part, but it always seems to be slightly off (It will hold a position maybe 2 degrees pitch/yaw and 5 degrees roll off from the heading I told it to hold.), so all in all this is something that is really annoying and I can\u0027t figure out how to fix it because the SAS just doesn\u0027t want to hold exactly where I tell it to during initial liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anybody else having this issue at all? And does anybody know if there\u0027s a good way to correct or fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarnis","CreatedById":884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T08:26:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWild guess; The quadcoupler model has a tiny imperfection so it isn\u0027t properly balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done tons of \u0022manual\u0022 quading-up using strut plates and they never cause uncontrolled rolls when installed precisely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CoriW","CreatedById":57866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T08:35:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, I just discovered the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo usually with the Quadcoupler I\u0027ll turn the engines by 45 degrees (Pressing Shift-Q 9 times) so that the engines all have their nozzles facing directly outwards from each other, however because the engines are angled diagonally it seems that the gimbals mess up and begin to induce roll... In other words the solution is to simply not angle the engines by 45 degrees, which I only did for aesthetic purposes anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shuttle","CreatedById":5225,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T10:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/member.php/59578-CoriW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECoriW\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E , wow, I never thought about it!
