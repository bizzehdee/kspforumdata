All you need is patience and experience, and a willingness to fail a lot before you get it right. And after you get it right, because Jool loves to keep throwing you (out of orbit) with (literal) curveballs in the way of moon encounters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s really hard to explain, at least for me, but what you should do is get a ship in equatorial Jool orbit and just play with encounters and maneuver nodes. See what you can do with a Tylo encounter, or a Laythe encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpoiler Alert: You can do a LOT. You can get into a nice orbit of Jool for FREE with a Tylo encounter.
