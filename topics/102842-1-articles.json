It\u0027s not really an Add on (and it\u0027s prefixed with Plugin which gives the wrong idea I think), I think it would be happier living in tools and apps, what do you think?\n\nI just wanted to check about the url because I\u0027d need to update the links to it on the site if it changes, and I want to make sure that those who are following it don\u0027t loose track of it.\n\nthanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T11:49:56Z","Content":"The url will remain the same ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T12:58:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The url will remain the same ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSweet.
