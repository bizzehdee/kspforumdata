Is the nuclear reactor working? Have parts shut down due to overheating or something?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Nuclear reactor works perfectly and is connected directly to the Electric Generator. When I Launch the vessel from the SPH for testing, I usually check the reactor bay if the both are online, and the display says that both the Reactor and the Generator are up even though the Reactor\u0027s not producing ThermalPower when the the Generator is on. And when I do shut the Electric Generator off, that\u0027s when the Nuclear reactor starts producing ThermalPower. And nope, the reactor didn\u0027t overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a photo of the actual vessel with the info display for the engine block:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1k7VrOQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221k7VrOQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
