What was that? Quicksave? Aw, I \u003Cem\u003Ewish\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EI had thought of that. You see, I broke the Kerbal Kode and failed to quicksave. After a bit of panicked tea consumption, I adressed\u00A0the situation. The mothership did not have the fuel\u00A0to raise it\u0027s apoapis enough nor the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. So my ship shuddered it\u0027s way through about two thirds of it\u0027s precious fuel reserved slowing itself down right over the surface of Eeloo. Yes, I was going to land the mothership. Luckly, I hadn\u0027t discovered the mod \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster placement helper (or whatever it\u0027s called) so the engines and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters combined had a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.05, just enough to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only problem with this plan- well.... motherships don\u0027t land. They stay in space. So with out landing gear (not that that would have been much help COUGH COUGH KSP DEVS), my massive 500\u002B part vessel descended to it\u0027s doom. Or... sort of.\u00A0 Two strange coincidences helped this doomed vessel survive it\u0027s decent. One, that there was a rear docking port, and two, that it had three Kerbin reentry pods. So I did what any sane person would do, I took the pod and placed it outside on the rear of the vessel to act as a landing cushion. And that it did. It blew apart to fragments in a magnificent stock explosion. So I had done it! I had landed my overengineered, silly, and kraken-prone vessel on Eeloo.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting back was another issue... *que blunderbirds intro*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbalstar","CreatedById":154159,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-28T04:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat little story \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/201990-capitalist-kerbal/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022201990\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/201990-capitalist-kerbal/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Capitalist Kerbal\u003C/a\u003E!
