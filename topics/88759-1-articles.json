Use the search option to find threads about it, there are hundreds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook for the highest ground close to where your kerbals are stranded, and try to put your lander there. If it\u0027s a long way, you could even parachute a rover much closer to them, which they can use to drive up the mountain to get to the lander. Launching from altitude makes such a huge difference on Eve, as you avoid the thickest part of the atmosphere. You need something like 8500m/s deltav from the highest point on the planet, while it\u0027s more like 12000m/s from sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever altitude you launch from, you need to have a TWR of somewhere around 1.8 at launch. Combining the high TWR with the high dv requirements is the big challenge. The easiest way to approach this is to build small. Really small. Consider command seats instead of a pod.

There are various mods, however, that provide atmospheric engines that will work without oxygen. AFAIK, these are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter: has electric props\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane: has a jet engine that burns Kethane in any atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite: has jets and props that burn Karbonite in any atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Interstellar: has thermal jets that work in any atmosphere at all without needing fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf these, it used to be possible to make Eve SSTOs using both Firespitter and Karbonite. However, these engines have been nerfed recently--it\u0027s no longer possible with Firespitter AFAIK and while it might still work with Karbonite, it\u0027s at least a very significant challenge (I haven\u0027t been able to do it lately). It has never worked with Kethane, intentionally so. So that pretty much leaves KSPI, although you have to be pretty far up its tech tree to have the necessary efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, all in all, unless you\u0027re well-advanced in a KSPI game, there is really no choice but to use a rocket. And this rocket will be a huge mountain of dozens of asparagus stages made of 1.25m parts. It will work but it will be hugely expensive and difficult to get to Eve to begin with. So unless you\u0027ve got a lot of money in the bank already, this option has to wait a while in a career game. But this is no big deal unless you\u0027re using a life support mod so have a limited timeframe. Still, in that case, it\u0027s pretty cheap and easy to just drop supplies to the stranded Kerbals periodically while you\u0027re building up the bank account to build the rescue lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T14:54:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022iflyallthetime\u0022 data-cite=\u0022iflyallthetime\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis thread got me wondering.\u003Cp\u003EDo aero mods FAR and NEAR affect atmos on planets other than Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes!
