This is NOT, i repeat NOT a criticism of KSP\u0027s development speed!

What if KSP aimed to become the longest game in development EVER? Aside from a place in the Guinness book of world records gaming edition, it would be a great experience for everyone involved.

It would also mean not rushing too much or overstressing over a feature- we want you to have as much fun making the game as we have playing it, devs! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I don\u0027t think the development process would really get any longer and more sparse if this was the goal, it would just get more fleshed out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso long story short, by making new features as fleshed out and fun as possible, and by not rushing things too much, ksp could beat the record for longest development time, and fulfill its full potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the devs should go for this.

The version number is not a decimal. For example, 0.10 is not the same as 0.1. The first number for many games is the major release and since ksp is still in development it is major version number 0. The numbers after the decimal indicator the update to the major release.
