Judging by the distance of the planetary Debris disk from the star, and the fact that it has already formed into planets, the age of the star might be around 5 to 50Myr.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only planets officially confirmed to be in Debdeb so far are: Charr, Gurdamma (\u002BDonk, \u002BGop),\u00A0 and Glumo (\u002BMerbel). Some planets are seen orbiting a yellow star, while Gurdamma is seen orbiting an orange-red star (which we know is Debdeb). This could be placeholder or outdated footage. We do know that Nate has confirmed that some of the planets we\u0027ve seen are from different systems.

We\u0027re not sure if it is entirely due to tidal forces alone, or if star proximity plays a part. If they are present in the Debdeb system, my guess would be that they are the 2nd innermost planet we see on on the map. If so, they will likely have high amounts of iron and possibly some carbon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EGurdamma\u003C/span\u003E - It is a young earth, or proto Kerbin, with rings. It has liquid water, but no ice. Gurdamma is officially confirmed to be like Earth in the Hadean Eon. At that time Earth had a very thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, with oceans of liquid water. Gurdamma has no oxygen and it is covered in craters and occasional surface lava. This is also the planet we have the most footage of so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDonk\u003C/span\u003E - It is a moon of Gurdamma which was formed with the ring after a recent collision.

If it is in Debdeb, it would be in the goldilocks zone due to water and trees. The vegetation might be producing oxygen making atmosphere breathable. This could allow for animal life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPuf\u003C/span\u003E - It has an atmosphere and a large crater with liquid water which looks like an eye. If it is in the Debdeb system, the presence of ice caps might put it on the colder side of the goldilocks zone. It does not appear to be tidally locked. Clearly it had suffered a massive collision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EOvin\u003C/span\u003E - It is a giant dry planet with rings. It is larger than Kerbin and has a surface gravity of 4Gs. There is no surface water or ice. If it is hot and further away from the star, it might have a dense greenhouse gas rich atmosphere. There are no mountains on Ovin due to the high gravity. It might also be flinging asteroids from the mid-system asteroid field into the inner planets, like Gurdamma.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ESkutt\u003C/span\u003E - It is a large spinning asteroid with a rocky surface. With one side being covered in boulders and a fast spin, it will allow for some fun landing challenges. If it is in the Debdeb system, it would make sense for it to reside in one of the asteroid fields\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EGlumo\u003C/span\u003E - It is a colorful Saturn analogue with rings. It\u0027s moon, Merbel, is the icy moon we first saw in the cinematic trailer. Its orbit does not align with the ring, suggesting it was captured by Glumo. In addition to ice, it also has some liquid water and atmosphere. There is a chance that underwater life is possible here. Maybe it was a captured planet that is now slowly melting. Glumo is confirmed to be in Debdeb. Due to its frozen moon, I would put it further away from the star. Perhaps it is the planet we see in the far corner of the map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP 2 Episode 5, we got to see an early map of Debdeb.
