So my only option is a mod.\n\nHonestly I\u0027m quite surprised both that Squad didn\u0027t do something like this before 1.0 and that no modder implemented this. But probably something like this, or more likely a subset of features of what I\u0027m talking about already exists, in that case feel free to point me to those mods.\n\nGeneral features would be:\n\n- **Researchers and engineers**, with stats: you train them, and they will work on developing parts, work on technologies, etc.\n- **Parts reliability**: the more engineers work on a part, the more its reliability increases; using it in a mission also increases it.\n- **Failures**: there is *Dang It!*, but it\u0027s random. Failures will be determined by parts reliability. This is a perfect example where this big mod can be split: we already have *Dang It!*, so no need to reinvent the wheel, just create a mod for the part reliability and update *Dang It!* to work together with it.\n- **Space programs opening and management**: instead of building rocket X and flying mission Y and then forgetting about that rocket or deleting it, you decide to open a specific space program and to invest resources/money to it. If you then don\u0027t do the planned missions, you\u0027ll loose reputation and money.\n- **Pending goals**: If you don\u0027t meet certain goals within a few years, you loose the game or loose reputation. Obvious example: the president wants you to go to the Mun in year X.\n- Other things inspired by BASPM, e.g. space race to the Mun against an AI.\n\nThings like upgrading buildings and funds are already there in KSP and can be adjusted to work with the mod.\n\nSomewhat similar/related topics:\n\n[Not just flight crew managment but engineering staff too](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54527-Not-just-flight-crew-managment-but-engineering-staff-too)\n\n[It\u0027s not about resources, it\u0027s about goals](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61961-It-s-not-about-resources-it-s-about-goals-right-So-what-are-the-options)\n\n[Ideas on career mode](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55770-Ideas-on-career-mode)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T17:03:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 255**"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T18:08:28Z","Content":"Some of this is done, or will be done, by [TestFlight](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109901-0-90-TestFlight-v1-2-1-14-Mar-2015-Bring-Flight-Testing-to-KSP%21).
