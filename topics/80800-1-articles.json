I also use ORS in the mods I work on, including Karbonite. Since all of these mods are pretty open to extension (and since I know folks are already extending them!), we are starting to see a lot of mods use ORS. This rocks. ORS was one of those gems of our community that deserved more time in the spotlight than it received, and I\u0027m happy to be helping to change that. But with popularity comes conflicts and random mod-stomping, so I figured it was time for some cat herding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am doing this not as some creepy \u0027control\u0027 thing - rather, it\u0027s because ORS gets REALLY SAD... I mean, we\u0027re talking mind numbingly sad, if you give two resources the same key in the ORS definitions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn excellent example is Water. In the original version of KSPI, the resource name is LqdWater, but the ORS Key is Water. So when I made MKS, I could not have a resource named Water and a key of Water (like I do with the other resources) because Water already existed as an ORS resource key. The result was infinite sadness (and this is why in MKS, we call the ORS resours Aquifer). Fast forward to more recent events. If a modder decides they want to extend Karbonite but use Ore for EL or MKS and they use the MKS Ore maps and resource definitions, these will collide, and our users will be lagged into oblivion. This, unfortunately, is REALLY easy to mess up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd to this, folks sharing cool stuff back and forth. Like, say, Oxygen. One mixup in a config and you\u0027re suddenly changing the mass of ships, and in extreme cases may in fact cause things to be unleashed and children eaten. And nobody wants that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I submit to you both a proposal and a humble request. If we cannot all agree on what the proper density of plutonium is on Jool, can we at least agree not to break eachother\u0027s stuff. To facilitate this, I submit to you the Community Resource Pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is simply a stand alone kit for Modders to use (or not use, it\u0027s your call, but read on first) to avoid sadness. Both for ourselves and our users. It has two parts, and two very simple goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#336699;\u0022\u003EGoal 1: Eliminate lag and crashes caused by duplicate ORS keys.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make this happen, CRP will include a consolidated list of distinct ORS keys and maps, and annotation of which mod is the curator or system of record for that resource. Or, simply put, if KSPI defines \u0027Uranium\u0027, and you decide to also make maps and a resource called \u0027Uranium\u0027 you will cause untold sadness and extreme lag to anyone who uses KSPI and your mod. Same with Karbonite, Ore, Substrate, etc. So our first goal is to have CRP be a clearing house for these. Since all current maps are under permissive licenses, if you want to use uranium, just include the KSPI ones. Want Ore? Grab them from MKS. Want your own thing called \u0027FluffyUnicornDroppings\u0027? Rock on and make your own. Reuse what you can, do no harm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s be clear. If all this project does is achieve this first goal, I\u0027ll be thrilled. It means less issues for our users, better ORS adoption, and a growing library of ORS maps to use for fun and profit. This is 100% good, and 100% beneficial to modders. Because the alternative, and I kid you not, is to lag their systems down to 1fps if people can\u0027t play nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#336699;\u0022\u003EGoal 2: Avoid surprising our users by stomping over resources.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome resources are defined by having ORS. Others are ones that a lot of us use. As someone who tries to play nice, I make it a point to see if any resource I make conflicts with someone else (hence why MKS and EL have the same resource definitions for Metal and Ore). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re going to take this general niceness a step further, and distribute a config file with all of the aforementioned ORS resources, along with a bunch of other ones that modders have agreed to consolidate on. Including ones from Karbonite and MKS/OKS (of course), TAC-LS, Universal Storage, KSP-I (Experimentals), Near Future Technologies, and others. And a few others will tag along where we\u0027ve decided not to break their stuff, even though they are not (yet) active participants in CRP (kinda like santa claus handing out gifts). Examples includ EL (for metal and ore), and Biomass (for.. well.. biomass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this goal is achieved, even for the few dozen resources we already have listed, I\u0027ll be double thrilled, as will users, since being nice is a lot more beneficial than randomly stomping on things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you\u0027re sold, head on down to the bottom of this post for links and goodness.

Most of us just want to play a game. Hence, CRP has no opinion on units, compression, cost, densities, etc. - that\u0027s up to the mod creators. And if something is good enough to be adopted by a couple of mods, then it\u0027s good enough to join the club. In the end, this is curated. But the only considerations on the table are ensuring stuff plays well in our space lego game together, not in nitpicking physics or chemistry, and most certainly not in dictating how stuff should be measured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#336699;\u0022\u003E\u0022But what if I want my own resources?!\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo for it.
