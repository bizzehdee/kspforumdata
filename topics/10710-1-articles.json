I find the hardest part is getting the rotors directly above the centre of gravity. Takes quite a lot of trial and error to get that right. Another issue is when the wings start producing lift it also screws up the balance; the catch is I\\\u0027ve found you do need them for both stability and control.\n\nThe current basic lift model used by KSP makes it very hard to do any vertical landings because they still generate a daft amount of lift at slow speeds. This makes it difficult for you to hover with no horizontal velocity. When the lift model is updated to introduce stall parameters things should be a lot more fun interesting."},{"CreatedByName":"power5000","CreatedById":1159,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-08T07:23:20Z","Content":"yeah i noticed that with my VTOL prototype"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-09T00:04:03Z","Content":"Taking a few tips from Excaliber, I managed to build a working chopper.\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13711](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13711)\n\nIt\\\u0027s much bigger than his, using lateral tanks, but those come in handy for tuning the centre of mass, which is easier to move than the centre of thrust (the rotor).\n\nWhen I tried the Ko-AXE, I found it tended to heel backwards and crash - I didn\\\u0027t see the throttle warning though!\n\nMy own design heels forward slightly, but well within trimmable limits, and requires no SAS, as that makes it a pig to turn.\n\nAs there is no tail rotor, we\\\u0027re forced to use control surfaces to make yaw manoeuvres, and as we\\\u0027re moving slowly, we need a lot of them!\n\nPlacing floodlights on the underside really helped in landing - it gives a much better perception of how far away the ground is. \n\nA few things I learned were:\n\n1) Keep your mass central - I had a MkI that had lateral tanks on trusses, which liked to go into a flat spin. Removing the trusses improved that handling a lot.\n\n2) Keep the mass low. Most of the upright control surfaces are below the centreline of the craft. This may require using hardpoints to lower landing gear, which will lower CoG even more.\n\n3)If the chopper likes to pitch fore or aft, place wings at nose and tail. If it\\\u0027s reluctant to pitch, move those surfaces into the centre.\n\n4) Use plenty of upright control surfaces to prevent spinning.\n\n5) Use a joystick to fly it! You really do need fine throttle control (as the pitch of a chopper directly impacts lift) and you can\\\u0027t do that while controlling the orientation of the craft at the same time without major remapping of keys."},{"CreatedByName":"Twinky827","CreatedById":17455,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-09T04:59:00Z","Content":"I made this bigger helicopter."},{"CreatedByName":"Alias","CreatedById":26725,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T18:45:42Z","Content":"I managed to create a stable easy to fly chopper.

It doesn\\\u0027t have to be far, and it might only work if your attitude is slightly nose-down (thus tilting the rotor forwards to get the angle). All my choppers behave this way, and thanks to the X-wing style winglet formation you used, they handle better than they did.\n\nWhen placing the rotor (or tweaking the front-rear weight bias), I prefer a chopper than will lean a hair forward rather than a hair backwards. It\\\u0027s almost impossible to nail it absolutely neutral, but it\\\u0027s easier to control and land a chopper that wants to go forwards.\n\nI haven\\\u0027t started work on a helicopter ASAS unit yet. The current one is more like an autopilot, but you have to turn it off to make meaningful manoeuvres."},{"CreatedByName":"Alias","CreatedById":26725,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-15T16:44:23Z","Content":"Your helicopters fly great GJ.
