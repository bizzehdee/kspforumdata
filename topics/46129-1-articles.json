The more sensical interpretation is that the gravitational constant is higher in the \u0022kerbal universe\u0022. Keep in mind that the planets are on rails, thus we cannot apply a known force to a body and see how much it accelerates- so the only way that we \u0022know\u0022 the mass of objects is through the gravitational force they exert. We also cannot launch a really huge rocket and measure the gravitational acceleration of some small object towards this huge rocket in space.

Hell, you could even say the mass of planetary bodies is almost infinite, since no matter how many rockets you crash into them, their orbits won\u0027t change one iota.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, the only thing we DO know the densities of are rockets. We can just extrapolate from real life rocket densities what the density of Kerbin, and thus, the other planets, is likely to be, and it is not these super-high values that the KSP wiki bogusly claims.
