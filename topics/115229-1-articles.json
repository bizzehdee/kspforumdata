Whether you use the MPL or not, you still have to go biome-hopping to get the science in the 1st place. So that\u0027s a wash. It\u0027s also enough, by itself, to do the tech tree with just a few well-planned missions (1 or 2 to Minmus, a few more to Mun). This is made possible because EVA scientists can now reset Goo and Material experiments and pods have no limit on how much data they can hold. So now you have a choice. You can just do this and be done with it, using just Bob (who will acquire 2 stars along the way but it really doesn\u0027t matter), and have the tech tree done in time for the 1st Duna window, maybe even the 1st Jool window. Or you can decide to spend a lot more money and a lot more of both game and real time acquiring a large staff of scientists and training them up to 3 stars, then building a huge science base for them, moving all the scientists to this base, and then waiting for months for them to generate the same amount of science you\u0027d already have if you didn\u0027t use MPLs.

You had to do this after visiting each biome, so biome-hopping required either lots of time and fuel to return to the lab repeatedly, or a big ship carrying the lab itself. But now that EVA scientists can reset experiments, a small lander with a single 0-star scientist aboard can hop directly from biome to biome for as long as its fuel lasts, VASTLY increasing science per mission and VASTLY reducing the time and money required to hit all the biomes, with no need for the MPL at all. The rate of science acquisition this way greatly exceeds what an MPL can do, even your 10-seater with all the 3-stars on it, without having to invest in that crew or the lab.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
