I have noticed that for some reason my targets aren\u0027t showing up in the \u0022HUD\u0022. I can see them just fine on the navigation map and the purple marker on the nav ball is there aswell.\n\nAny idea why they don\u0027t show up in \u0022staging\u0022 mode? It makes docking and intercepting a bit more challenging than i would like ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) When i manage to find them i can select a docking port as target but it still doesn\u0027t get \u0022highlighted\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T12:03:58Z","Content":"My guess: you accidentally hit [F4].

Also, targets won\u0027t show up in stage view if they are \u003E99km away, or once you get really close. I forget the exact cutoff for the close range, but it will also turn off the indicator which can be a pain when you are on the dark side.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
