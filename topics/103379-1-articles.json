I have noticed that for some reason my targets aren\u0027t showing up in the \u0022HUD\u0022. I can see them just fine on the navigation map and the purple marker on the nav ball is there aswell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea why they don\u0027t show up in \u0022staging\u0022 mode?

Also, targets won\u0027t show up in stage view if they are \u0026gt;99km away, or once you get really close. I forget the exact cutoff for the close range, but it will also turn off the indicator which can be a pain when you are on the dark side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
