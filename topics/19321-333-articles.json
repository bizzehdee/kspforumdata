Beyond fixing the jittery flight assistants, I would really like to have some \u003Cstrong\u003Esmall fins\u003C/strong\u003E just to lower the CoM a little for small rockets. A really big problem is that SRBs in KSP are crappy compared to real life: they don\u0027t have any gimbal capability, and the pod\u0027s reaction wheels are not enough to reliably keep it from flipping. Also, there is no way to adjust the bore so that the TWR doesn\u0027t get ridiculously high at the end of the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume you mean lower the CoL ;\u0027] Check out RoverDude\u0027s Sounding Rockets mod, it has three extremely tiny to small fins made for exactly this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, adjusting the grain in SRBs is on my mod wishlist.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T08:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOdds are the CoL is moving further back or your CoM is moving forward as fuel drains out of the craft.
