By right clicking on a fuel tank you can turn off the flow for each type of fuel it contains. You accomplish this by clicking the small button to the right of the gauge in the info panel for the tank that pops up. You can do this in the VAB or in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you release your payload, you pump the fuel out of the balance tank and into your normal fuel tanks. This is done by right-clicking on one of the tanks and then Alt\u002Bright click on the other tank. You can then use the buttons that appear to pump fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T12:44:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s correct that you balance an empty transport space plane. But adding a tank for balancing it with payload is a huge waste of weight. Instead the plane is constructed in a way that the payload can be attached so that CoM doesn\u0027t move at all. The doc in my signature has a lot of examples of such transport planes. It\u0027s a tad outdated though since they use the old wings but with all changes to aerodynamics and drag anything built now will be obsolete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T12:54:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile both of the above suggestions are valid, I\u0027m firmly in Doc\u0027s camp.
