The same thing happened to me. After landing on the Mun and launching again, I discovered that my lander had no trajectory visible on Map view. I was able to limp to orbit by pointing prograde, waiting for the apogee counter to hit 0 and burning. Even after reaching a stable orbit, no trajectory lines. I quicksaved and reloaded, still no trajectory lines. I even returned to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, created a new save and then restarted the game, but still no trajectory lines in either the Tracking Station or back focused on and controlling the orbiting lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in the Tracking Center, the Vessel information shows the lander \u0022Landed\u0022 but moving at Munar orbital velocity.
