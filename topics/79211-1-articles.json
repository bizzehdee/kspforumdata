(Considerable given you only need a puff to soften touchdown)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you should test a bit to find exactly what throttle gets you around the touchdown speed you like. Then have an action group for toggling the engines. That will let you jump straight to the throttle you want, just a few meters off the ground. That way, you can land safely with the tiniest possible shred of fuel leftover, and possibly get just a bit more payload into the sky.....assuming you didn\u0027t do that already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m very interested in how much money you recover when landing this thing?

I have enough to launch it in career, so stay posted.
