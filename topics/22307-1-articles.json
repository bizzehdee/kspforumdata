I am reasonably good at orbital physics calculations but I am not a \u0027twitch\u0027 gamer so I prefer to automate time critical functions and concentrate on getting the navigation calculations spot on and design the vessel properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y269/Mihoshi2005/onthemun.png\u0022 alt=\u0022onthemun.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking forward to designing a Joolvian exploration vessel with a landing on one of the moons and encounters with the rest next and if anyone has any idea how I can get the craft I need for this mission into orbit I would be interested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderLOL","CreatedById":55382,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-16T12:58:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome washu \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish I could help but I haven\u0027t got to the interplantary stage, but good luck and use a big rocket. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-16T14:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHiya and welcome aboard! Since you enjoy the calculative aspect of KSP, will reserve my tips for the actual flight unless asked. The ship itself, before getting to orbit, it comes down to once in orbit. Key to transfers is that once in orbit, you will get the same transfer distance using 1 engine as 10 since it all comes down to your specific impulse. In fact, with the nuclear engines for your transfer, fewer is better because of weight. 2.25t per engine. I typically run 1 or two for my return stage, maybe 2-4 for getting there. Only reason for multiple is looks and for a bit to do with patience. Cutting down with this weight will help you get to orbit as well. Anyways, if you are comfortable with what you would have in space, the following is the best booster suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI typically run three stages. I have a single or tristack core of the large boosters. This is my final accent or orbit escape engine. Since in space, engines run more efficient, this is usually limited to two of the large tanks. Attached around these I place radially three tank stacks which have a fuel crossfeed to the core ones. There are different ways to do this, If you have the single stack, you can feed sideways then core, jettisoning the outer engines in the fuel chain as they empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor jool with return, typically a heavy lifter is needed and I will radially do a third rack of 4 tank boosters that again operate like previously, feeding inwards. This setup means that you never really have dead weight. All engines are firing but since the fuel lines always draw from tanks being linefed first, you can jettison tanks and boosters as they empty. If you have enough, you won\u0027t need to run (or want cause the G-forces can break your rocket) then as you progress to orbit, the loss of thrust is counters by the fuel burn and less resistance. Other bonus is since the outer ones are taller, they also can be used to help stabilize the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mustwinfull","CreatedById":41681,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-16T16:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, Washu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell Done for your first successful Mun landing, keep on going and you will eventually be an inter-planetary explorer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun playing KSP and go blow up some rockets!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-16T16:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Washu, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeed help raising a very large craft?
