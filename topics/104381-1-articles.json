First, I back up my old game out of the Steam folder. Then I make a list of mods I want to use for the upcoming version, so I don\u0027t forget any.

Finish up any outstanding loose ends. Then sit down and figure out what mods I\u0027m going to use and what tasks I\u0027m going to set for myself with my new career. One of the big things I\u0027m planning to do in the next version is make an honest-to-goodness surface colony. Not a big ship that lands in one piece, but a modular colony that has to be assembled on the surface with no inherent movement ability. And to make sure that I get paid to do this, I\u0027m going to use contract configurator and the appropriate contract pack.\n\nNo actual mechanics need to be done - I have 8 separate installs, and never run the game out of the default steam location. The only downside (which may actually be a good thing) is that steam doesn\u0027t let me know how many hours I\u0027ve really played.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-18T18:07:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2015 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Norcalplanner**"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T18:11:54Z","Content":"Swear at steam every time something updates that isn\u0027t KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T18:17:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E After the hype starts building up with all the details, videos and screenshots showing up online, I get a new urge to start playing again.
