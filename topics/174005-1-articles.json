Build rocket, two satellites in line separated by decouplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get to the moon, position in the first designated orbit, and release the first satellite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is now my mun insertion stage and second satellite are labeled \u0022[rocket name] debris\u0022\u00A0and are uncontrollable. I made sure and the main part does still have it\u0027s own power, antenna, and OKTO, so why is it acting like dead??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be awesome, as I really dont want to start this from scratch again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-17T21:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums. Sorry you are having problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it has an OKTO, it should never be debris, so we will need you to post a picture so we can look for anything strange.

Go out to map mode and it says debris too... so I go post this question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurns out all i had to do was hit [ one more time, and I never even tried.
