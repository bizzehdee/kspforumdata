Unfortunately I cant load the crafts because somehow there are parts missing. I then went on and deleted the craft files from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E folder so they don\u0027t pop up in the game anymore (I downloaded quite a few). However, when I restart the game the craft files somehow appear in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E folder again and pop up in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t find any other path where the files are located.

The steam cloud will backup you savegame and when you delete stuff from the savegame folder, it will restore them on the next launch.
