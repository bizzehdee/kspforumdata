I usually use the lighter ones(LT-1) because they weigh less but have the same crash tolerance.\u00A0It hasn\u0027t really hurt my game to be gliding around, but it is still annoying and just looks weird. Not even deploying an excavator drill will keep it stationary.\u00A0It is even happening on planets with an atmosphere and gravity. It happens on Kerbin. I hope this has been fixed in 1.2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chimpbone","CreatedById":167310,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T06:52:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222784420\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149161\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475445730\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167649\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dunnfore\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Dunnfore said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nuse the heaviest landing gear\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell that actually worked.
