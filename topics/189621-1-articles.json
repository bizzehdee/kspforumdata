Almost all the radially attached parts are physicsless (they add their mass and drag to the parent part, which in this case is in the straight, slippy stack). Only the two antennas aren\u0027t, and they\u0027re folded up during launch, which should reduce their drag profile significantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...And yet, without a fairing (and a conical adapter in its place), this thing is hell to fly. Any deviation from prograde whatsoever during max-Q instantly flips it, and it\u0027s not much more stable during other regimes either. In orbit, it always has a triple-digit number of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E less remaining than the variant with a fairing, as seen in the second picture. Even though that flares out quite a bit to handle the large dishes, and stretches up quite a bit to accomodate the flotation device, that variant flies like a dream and gets to orbit in a very fuel-efficient manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of my manned missions do not use fairings; indeed, I can recall only one manned launch from my last playthrough (a surface base designed to land on its side) that needed one. But by the same token, I find that most of my unmanned missions at minimum benefit from being enclosed, and sometimes outright require it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
