Up until now, I\u0027ve been content working within the Kerbin system setting up mining outposts and bases (yes, modded) so I never really concerned myself with timing for transfer windows. I\u0027ve scooped up most of the science I can in the kerbin system, and I\u0027m sitting on day 90 and now have to wait for transfer windows. Timewarping through an entire year just feels really odd, even though I know there isn\u0027t much to do in the interim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been restricting myself to 7 day times between launches and I\u0027ve tried KCT though it made me cringe when I realized I\u0027d have to work within even more increasing restrictions. So, I decided to ask the KSP community, How do YOU pace your space program? KCT, Fixed times between launches, time-warp like crazy? I\u0027m curious if there are other methods out there that others like to do that might be nice to try around with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T18:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI try to avoid unnecessary time-warping in my serious save.

Normally I\u0027d be ready for Duna long before a launch window, but 4 years is certainly better than 4 weeks. I landed on the Mun in dim light the first landing, resulting in a tipped over lander (sloping crater wall), and it was non-trivial to build a rescue ship in time given life support and lack of parts.

I figure I\u0027m just going to time warp past them anyway so its just one extra pointless step in my view. Yes its more realistic to require time to build and prep craft between launches but so is waiting for years between launch and mission actualy reaching its destination. As that bit of tedious realism has been sacrificed on the altar of gameplay I see no reason to add another bit just to apply the exact same solution. I figure between FAR DRE and Remote Tech and a revamped tech tree I\u0027ve made enough concessions to realism. I\u0027m going to have offworld ship building soon anyway and thats already going to have build times (extraplanetary launchpads) I\u0027ll just handwave kerbin launches as just abstracting having multiple launch sites and building being done ahead of time at multiple complexes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T00:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wish I could remind myself easily.
