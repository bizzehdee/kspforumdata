As tradition dictates, this means that I must start anew with a clean house- no parts mods, and especially no old saves, because they tend to use old parts mods. \n\nSince I just got a Minmus base working in 1.0.3, I\u0027ll admitted I was pretty miffed. But, since I wasn\u0027t sharing any of this because it \u0022took too much time\u0022, I decided not to be. So, welcome to the Pulp Science Fiction Space Association, as I\u0027ve decided to name my latest career save!\n\nMods I\u0027m running:\n\nMechJeb 2 dev build that \u0022should work with 1.0.3\u0022\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock.... for 1.0.2 (and yup, it works with 1.0.3)\n\nWhatever the latest version of FAR is\n\nDingus 1: \n\n![aiJcBIw.png](http://i.imgur.com/aiJcBIw.png)\n\nEvery space agency has to start somewhere. This one surprised by breaking the sound barrier first time out. And by mostly exploding upon landing. Jeb\u0027s safe, though, so mission accomplished.

Attempt failed due to unexpected structural failure on the upper stage, all pictures of which mysteriously disappeared from the cameras of those attending the launch. Regardless, safe abort was made and revolutionary insights upon the nature of high-altitude flight were discovered. 30 Science gathered. \n\n![r8CQvj6.png](http://i.imgur.com/r8CQvj6.png)\n\nThe exoatmospheric insertion stage of the Dingus 3 apparently burning up, but actually not, thanks to radiator panels.
