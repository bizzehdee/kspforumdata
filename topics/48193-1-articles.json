(Escape ejection burn \u002B Kerbol orbit correction burn) Less then 400 what what you need to get to the Mun. If you\u0027re wanting to start doing interplanetary missions. I\u0027d recommend getting the mod Protractor. Its an excellent tool that tells you when its the best time to burn and -where- to burn in your orbit for the optimal transfer window. So far, in my experience, it seems to be slightly more accurate then the nodes that Mechjeb sets up. You can even tell it to adjust its calculation for your ships current thrust ability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T18:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApproaching it from the other side, you could shave a lot of weight off of that lander, and when the payload gets smaller, every stage below it goes farther.
