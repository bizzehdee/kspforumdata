Within a km of each other, so switched the lander (most manoeuvrable) to RCS, and to docking mode, and moved to within 100m. Then I hit the \u0027control from here\u0027 button on the lander\u0027s Clamp-o-Tron Docking Port. This resulted in a small bump in my camera view (expected), and a message \u0027no target\u0027 or similar. I re-targeted the lab I\u0027m docking with. But now I find I cannot fire any RCS thrusters. I still have plenty of mono, and I see the indicators moving in the docking instruments when I press movement keys. I can switch between linear or rotational. Switching back to staging mode and then docking mode doesn\u0027t help. Even clicking on the original landing can\u0027s \u0022control from here\u0022 button doesn\u0027t help.

When the lander was docked, the RCS ports on the tug worked fine. But when I released the lander, the tug\u0027s RCS would not work, even though there was plenty of monopropellant. It was fairly easy to work around this, but I never did work out why it wasn\u0027t working.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tartley","CreatedById":114167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T20:33:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn resuming the save game (KSP had been closed in the interim) everything worked fine.
