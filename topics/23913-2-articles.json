Right now the tracks need very high forwards friction and very low side friction to turn on the spot and they do have a tendency to slide down hills when you stop sideways. Whether there are working ranges in the existing systems (perhaps higher power instead of higher forwards friction?) or whether the friction needs changing dynamically is something that needs investigating for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of interest what do you think about the suspension stiffness in that video when it goes over obstacles with that load on?
