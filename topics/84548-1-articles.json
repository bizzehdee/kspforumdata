It has taught me SOOOOOO much in the way of, well, rocket science. When I first started playing I thought if you just went straight up hard and fast enough you\u0027d reach orbit. Wow was I wrong. Every aspect of this game has taught me how things in space work, from planetary captures, to the principles of docking, to even the simplest of things such as thrust to mass ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point of this thread though is I was watching the movie \u0022Gravity\u0022 tonight. Because of KSP I was able to point out so many flaws with the movie itself. Granted I did love it and know that Hollywood will never go off of true realism. But there was one scene that really bothered me. It was where where Sandra Bullock was tethered to a space station by some parachute ropes to her leg. She caught George Clooney and stopped his momentum so he didn\u0027t float away. He decides let me go because he says he\u0027s pulling her away. With my knowledge of motion in space all she had to do was give a slight tug on the cable between them and he would have drifted towards her thus saving himself. It drove me nuts watching this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I know, just a movie. Before playing KSP I would have never have known this basic principle.
