Isp is (usually) king.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you will need a certain amount of thrust to get off the ground, or to perform maneuvers in any sort of reasonable time. But, the higher thrust engines tend to have lower Isp (fuel efficiency), so you\u0027ll need more fuel for more thrust, which means you\u0027ll be adding more mass, which means you\u0027ll need more thrust . . . . You see the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd to that the fact that drag will hold you back while in atmosphere, getting exponentially worse as you approach terminal velocity, and past a certain point, more thrust will start to see seriously diminishing returns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. For very light payloads, it\u0027s easy to get up there with rather small engines.

For medium-large payloads I do use a number of Mainsail boosters, but I\u0027ve dropped those by the time I\u0027m through the thicker part of the atmosphere, and transitioned to something with better Isp like Skippers or Aerospikes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T19:34:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing I\u0027d do - take the ships you built in the demo and copy them over to your full version.
