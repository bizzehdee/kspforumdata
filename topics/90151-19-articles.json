The flag goes like this: \u0022-force-d3d11-no-singlethreaded -popupwindow\u0022 (remove quotes) and seems to work for most people. You can substitute the former for \u0022-force-opengl\u0022 if you want lower RAM usage at the cost of performance (or if DX11 doesn\u0027t work). Worked for me so far.\u003Cp\u003EAs for the clouds, EVE works, but if you have memory to spare, try this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83215-WIP-RSS-Visual-Enhancements-%28RVE%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83215-WIP-RSS-Visual-Enhancements-%28RVE%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you sure on the launch flag?

For a lot of people (including me, I tested), it makes 64bit perfectly stable. At least on Windows 8 64bit. Some reported odd things happening to graphics (both in 64bit and 32bit, actually), at least one had DX9 actually run better, but those are isolated cases, likely related to graphic card peculiarities.
