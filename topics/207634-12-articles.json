If we take the Minmus to Duna example, you would want to use the Mun first to bring pe closer to Kerbin, then get the full oberth effect from Kerbin. (I may be wrong, but I believe that is the obvious efficient route to take.) This type of route is not a rare occurrence at all, in the sense that you\u0027re speaking of.

Look at the Kerbin - Minmus - Mun - Duna system from above. Repeat when all are more or less in the same positions relative to each other. As pointed out above. You can get very similar result with little differences in delta v. Problem with Minmus is that it orbits Kerbin once every ~50 days, so you literally have one shot at this per optimal Duna transfer window. And you probably may need to pack a bit more fuel in case it goes slightly suboptimal. (so, let the game look for a window to launch with bigger margin) I\u0027ve been using KSPTOT for a time, and while it takes some time to calculate possible options for gravity assists (as I usually look for interplanetary transfers, not help from the Mun for example), and me being obviously slightly inaccurate with my maneuvers, I always get my things right, even if my fuel usage rises by few percent because I need a correction here and there.

Let\u0027s take the Minmus - Kerbin - Duna route. Minmus won\u0027t be at the same position in its orbit when Kerbin and Duna line up matching the original run, but if you wait 15 days, Minmus will be within 15-25 degrees of its position in the original run, and the route can adapt and thus run - the exact time to wait can be calculated with a transfer planner like the one above.

Generally speaking the system that requires the least ongoing fuss and maintenance for the player is probably the best. Thats what you\u0027re optimizing for. I think its fun to do the first run to set things up, but after that you kinda just want to click \u0022repeat on similar windows\u0022 and have it plot out the launch and arrival dates.

So this sounds like a potentially pretty important system here and, considering we will be eventually working at an interstellar level, so how many of these supply routes are we going to be setting up? A few? Dozens? Hundreds? I think the devs have to be thinking about the scenario of what happens when you reach say...triple digits. At that point, what would be the hit of simulating these vs just checking that some criteria are met and changing some numbers (also, what are the odds of being in range to see a delivery, especially when you start to have a bunch of stations/routes/bases, etc. The cost/benefit of actually simulating it doesn\u0027t seem worth it).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, there are kinda two subcategories here as well: surface to base and base to orbit vs interplanetary and up with planet to moon kind of somewhere in between. On the surface, timing is a non issues, and even orbit windows and lunar transfers are extremely consistent and predictable and take the same delta-v (And I would imagine if you move the base or station, I would guess you have to redo a run (or maybe even have that be a changeable difficulty setting thing even)). When you get to the next level, that\u0027s where it starts to get wibbly. Have they actually said supply runs would be able to be automated going interplanetary, even? It seems like that would be a much lower priority, not even because of complexity, but because of frequency: having your mining rig going back to base twice a day and then sending a supply ship to orbit twice a week is going to get tedious really fast, but even a Kerbin \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Duna Supply route will take several years for a round trip. That\u0027s a whole lot less micromanaging than the lower scale possibilities (and actually, at that point, fully simulating it is no longer as big a processing sink, because you (well...probably. This is KSP after all) won\u0027t have hundreds of ships going to Duna. But in general I would wonder if interplanetary stuff will be automatable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question, I think, is: how is refueling the supply ships going to be handled? Surface stuff is easy, just gotta have power, but it doesn\u0027t matter how efficient or not your ascent and transfers are if you don\u0027t have a way to refuel. So this implies that there could be a prerequisite for unlocking supply routes of having a viable refinery and supply chain set up first, otherwise you would be able to skip a big game requirement. Which is nice, it\u0027s a natural system of progression of starting small and then building up and giving yourself the capacity for bigger and more complicated supply chains\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I understand why interplanetary supply runs are desirable.

The biggest one is transferring materials that you can\u2019t get within the system that you have to import from other planets. For example, when setting up a colony that isn\u2019t big enough yet, you might need shipments of kerbals to get to that critical population and you don\u2019t want to ferry 500 kerbals 10 kerbals at a time.
