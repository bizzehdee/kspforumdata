I figured it would be a thing of having levels at, say, 10, 100, 1000 xp with many types of activity granting XP, with diminishing returns for doing the same thing. As it stands, it seems like there are only a handful of XP points that it\u0027s possible to get, with zero gain whatsoever for duplication. It feels really odd that I can fly 20 different orbital missions with my pilot, but I still only get any XP at all for that first flight. Basically it seems like the game just tells you \u0022nope, there is simply no way to have a pilot worth a damn until you get him to the moon somehow\u0022 which is kind of bizarre and constraining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile you\u0027d want to avoid exploiting easy missions, I would think that players would at least have some option of \u0022grinding\u0022 XP on their astronauts to get their skills up. In fact that seems like one of the main ways an inexperienced player would pull themselves out of being \u0022stuck\u0022 when they have done the easy missions -- at the least they could (slowly) level their guys up a bit to make the more difficult missions easier and more lucrative to complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T22:56:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esherkaner: Remember this is the first iteration of kerbal experience.
