I\\\u0027ve been getting better at it but I have one big problem that never goes away. No matter where I place my parachute in the stages it always deploys when I activate my LV-T30. I\\\u0027ll start off fine with three RT-10s running smoothly. They\\\u0027ll decouple as expected, but then as soon as I start the next stage (I placed the parachute icon way way at the top) my parachute will deploy at the same time dragging my rocket down.\n\nWhenever I try to move my parachute to the top of the list it just jumps down when I start the game above my F logo. How do I resolve this? The parachute is literally the only thing holding me back/"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Duck","CreatedById":1156,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T16:11:36Z","Content":"You probably want to create a separate stage for your parachute. I think right now you are probably dragging the parachute around within a single stage, which doesn\\\u0027t actually affect when it activates. When you mouse over the staging icon list in the VAB you should see little \u0027\u002B\u0027 and \u0027-\u0027 icons appear; these let you insert and delete stages. Make a new stage at the very top of the icon list and drag the parachute icon into it, and it won\\\u0027t activate until you activate that final stage with the space bar."},{"CreatedByName":"Ketran","CreatedById":24557,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T16:29:16Z","Content":"Alright thanks I\\\u0027ll give that a go, I was putting it at the very top of stage 0 with some other things. I forgot you could create your own stages."}]}
