Anyhow, the bug to be reported is the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame Info:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 0.90 Mac Unmodded\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer Mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort Story:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plane was crashing in the ocean, and I tried to eject at the last moment, and clicked EVA multiple times (I had not unlocked the ability to EVA while in flight). Once the plane crashed I was left with two Jebediah Kermans in the water (It was a single seat Aircraft) and I as unable to return to the space centre, recover flight, revert flight, or anything else, forcing me to quit the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong Story:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had acquired a contract to test the pressure of three sites, and decided to use a plane. However while trying to reach the second site, I realised I did not have enough fuel and would run out shortly. Luckily I had equipped my plane with a radial parachute for emergency ditching or recovery. As my plane ran out of fuel I attempted to glide it to land, however it stalled. As it plummeted I activated the parachute but it was still going at ~8m/s. I prepared to eject in case the landing would destroy the cockpit. I frantically clicked the EVA button on Jebediah\u0027s picture because I did not have the upgrades to EVA when off the surface. In the blink of an eye duaring the crash I suddenly found myself with two Jebediahs in the water (and a mostly intact plane, save the engine). I was unable to exit the scene as stated in the short version. None of the possible ways of reverting flight, going to the space centre or recovering the craft or Kerbals worked. All I could do was switch between the craft, Jebediah, and his clone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"McQ","CreatedById":132796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T19:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had the same issue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMac 0.90 unmodded\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA from a Mk1 cockpit yields two identical Kerbals when the mouse is double clicked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the cloning, the craft can\u0027t be recovered and you can\u0027t return to the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
