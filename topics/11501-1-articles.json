You also had to wait like an hour to know if you got it right, because we didn\\\u0027t have time warp.\n\nYour ships either had to be over 50% SAS modules, or you had to be a god at flying. The atmosphere had a hard ending of \n\n35 000 KM, and no atmos gague either. If your rocket was too big, it simply didn\\\u0027t fly because there were no struts to keep it from flopping to bits. \n\nOh, and you had two choices of engine. Either the unvectored liquid, or the solid. That was it. Solids were unsuable because symmetry didn\\\u0027t exist and you had to do everything by eye, and if something was just one pixel off mark then your whole rocket would just list over in flight."},{"CreatedByName":"ping111","CreatedById":8679,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T16:21:26Z","Content":"I was here at 0.9 methinks.
