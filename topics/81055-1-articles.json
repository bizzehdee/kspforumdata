The real aim is to get your friend/family member(s?) to complete the basics of kerbal space program, and maybe some more advanced stuff along the way. They must build their craft on their own with some guidance, and they must pilot the crafts (unless something terrible happens). You can\u0027t say stuff like \u0027Put this there, put that here\u0027 ect. No proof is really needed, it\u0027s just a bit of an activity to with which brings you and your friends and family together. Plus it\u0027s something to do. You wouldn\u0027t bother doing many of these challenges yourself, as you would have probably done them already a long time ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 3 goals for the challenge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOrbit Kerbin\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELand a Kerbal on the mun\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELand on Minmus in career mode (that does mean researching and getting the money)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong with two extra goals, which are just optional:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESend something to Duna (lander, rover, orbital probe, ect.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFly-by (or even orbit around) Jool and investigate a moon\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some achievements for completing missions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 100% newbie (completing the challenge) [\u002B5]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Going the extra mile (complete one of the extra challenges) [\u002B10]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Going another extra mile (complete both extra challenges) [\u002B30]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Dude, how much time do you have?
