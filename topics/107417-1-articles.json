Everything was fine until he landed, then the screen went blank and UI writing went blank (altimeter background was still there). Went back to the Space Centre where the same thing happened but now only the skybox was visible.\n\nRestarted the game and the landed spacecraft, Jeb and the flag I planted had disappeared.\n\nMods / Add-Ons: All Stock\n\nSteps to Replicate (assumed, haven\u0027t tried replicating):\n\n1) Land on Mun (or probably any body).\n\n2) Go back to Space Centre, unlock EVA Surface Sampling.\n\n3) Go back to landed vessel.\n\n4) Exit the vessel.\n\nResult: When Kerbal lands the UI/game becomes unusable, after restart the craft, kerbal and flag will have disappeared.\n\nNo crash log as the game didn\u0027t \u0027crash\u0027 fully."}]}
