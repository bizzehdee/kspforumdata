As a result these craft are very fragile.\n\nFor example the following craft with almost no fuel and no payload needs to land with a vertical velocity of about 1m/s other wise it will fall apart. \n\nCopying the breakingForce \u0026 breakingTorque for 3m parts into the cfg\u0027s for equivalently sized mk3 parts appears to make the craft behave more consistently. \n\n![oGy6ubd.png](http://i.imgur.com/oGy6ubd.png)\n\nExample\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\ncfg from the large mk3 LFO fuel tank\n\nPART\n\n{\n\n name = mk3FuselageLFO\\_100\n\n module = Part\n\n author = Porkjet\n\n rescaleFactor = 1.0\n\n node\\_stack\\_top = 0.0, 5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3\n\n node\\_stack\\_bottom = 0.0, -5.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 3\n\n node\\_attach = 1.63, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1\n\n TechRequired = experimentalAerodynamics\n\n entryCost = 84000\n\n cost = 10000\n\n category = FuelTank\n\n subcategory = 0\n\n title = Mk3 Rocket Fuel Fuselage Long\n\n manufacturer = C7 Aerospace Division\n\n description = Filled to the brim with Rocket Fuel, C7 Aerospace\u0027s supplier Ekson-Kobil have assured us that this tank is absolutely airtight.\n\n attachRules = 1,1,1,1,0\n\n mass = 7.14\n\n dragModelType = default\n\n maximum\\_drag = 0.2\n\n minimum\\_drag = 0.3\n\n angularDrag = 1\n\n crashTolerance = 50\n\n maxTemp = 2300 // = 3000\n\n emissiveConstant = 0.87\n\n fuelCrossFeed = True\n\n bulkheadProfiles = srf, mk3\n\n MODEL\n\n {\n\n model = Squad/Parts/FuelTank/mk3Fuselage/LFO\\_100\n\n }\n\n RESOURCE\n\n {\n\n name = LiquidFuel\n\n amount = 4500\n\n maxAmount = 4500\n\n }\n\n RESOURCE\n\n {\n\n name = Oxidizer\n\n amount = 5500\n\n maxAmount = 5500\n\n }\n\n}\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\ncfg from the equivalent 3m part\n\nPART\n\n{\n\n name = Size3LargeTank\n\n module = Part\n\n author = Squad\n\n mesh = Size3LargeTank.mu\n\n rescaleFactor = 1\n\n node\\_stack\\_top = 0.0, 3.74, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3\n\n node\\_stack\\_bottom = 0.0, -3.74, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 3\n\n node\\_attach = 0.0, 0.0, -1.89, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0\n\n TechRequired = highPerformanceFuelSystems\n\n entryCost = 46600\n\n cost = 13000\n\n category = Propulsion\n\n subcategory = 0\n\n title = Kerbodyne S3-14400 Tank\n\n manufacturer = Kerbodyne\n\n description = When nobody believed in (or even asked for) an even larger fuel tank than the already enormous S3-7200, Kerbodyne stepped up with the sanity-defying S3-14400 model.
