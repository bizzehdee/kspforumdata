The contract itself even says \u0022within a reasonable deviation\u0022. I think the margin is on the order of 5% or so (though I may well be wrong on that) which would be about 200km on the AP and 100km on the PE."},{"CreatedByName":"KASA Space","CreatedById":108702,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T21:11:17Z","Content":"Thank you so much!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAlright.\n\nSo\n\nI got it pretty damn close.\n\nWhy is the deviation wrong? The PE and AP are where they should be (within 10km, and I\u0027ve tried closer).

If you don\u0027t want to keep them there you could de-orbit them and claim the cash back for recovery (if you fit a parachute)."}]}
