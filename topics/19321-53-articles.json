First off, I launch rockets only, so maybe it\u0027s great for planes, but for rockets all I see is that drag loss is essentially eliminated for launches. I launched a totally stock, very simple two stage 2.5m vehicle, once with FAR and a flattop, once with FAR and a nosecone, and once without FAR and a flattop, and the results were 2725 m/s, 2635 m/s, and 1659 m/s, respectively, delta-v remaining after burnout (yes the nosecone actually hurt, probably because the 2.5m nosecone is so heavy). Now maybe eliminating virtually all the drag losses is \u0022realistic\u0022, but it changes the game far too much and makes getting to orbit (which is already easy) even easier, not sure why that would be a desirable change at all but that\u0027s just my opinion.

My best guess is a combination of factors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I use delta wings. All the time. This presents a huge surface area to the air, and that drag intensifies the upwards pitch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I also frequently use large canard surfaces to move my CoL forward. While I\u0027m assuming that rear horizontal fins naturally bring the plane back to 0 AoA, forward surfaces want to intensify any deviation. Same thing with having a vertical stabilizer on your nose. This is because, if a rear stabilizer moves out of the velocity vector, the drag force naturally pushes it back, whereas if it\u0027s in the front of the CoM (CoL?), the drag force wants to make it continue around until it is in back.

I think mainly I\u0027m wondering why we can\u0027t have \u0027semi-realistic\u0027 aerodynamics, where using a nosecone is better than not using one but the level of drag loss is still relatively close to what it is now (which is what I had imagined this mod would be like, not like 100x less drag loss). So if the loss is like 1000m/s now, have using a nosecone drop it to 750m/s while not using one raises it to 1250m/s, but keep it within the ballpark at least.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
