Don\u0027t forget that it only asks for altitude and speed, its not bothered if you do a gravity turn. So, for max performance (max altitude at such a low speed), go vertical all the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are doing it with a live Kerbal and a capsule, and want to recover the RT10 too, don\u0027t forget to put enough chutes on - I used 1x chute per 1.5tons. Or you could decouple the capsule once the contract is done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nETA don\u0027t be too hasty on pulling the chutes either. Sometimes, if you \u0027miss\u0027 the criteria on the way up, you can sometimes do something funky with aero (like turning sideways to make it draggy) and \u0027hit\u0027 the criteria on the way down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-21T20:25:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2021 08:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by paul_c\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MZ_per_X1","CreatedById":199474,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-22T17:07:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis contract is historically bugged.
