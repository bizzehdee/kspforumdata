Have you tried setting the direction to 0, 0, 0? What about negative values?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOut of curiosity, why not just use regular internal seats with a transparent glass canopy? Unless you\u0027re trying to get an \u0022IVA\u0022 you can walk around in...which would be cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an aside, I have tried using decouplers to create kerbal ejection seats, but that ejected the kerbal from the seat at force. Not ideal and not what you\u0027re looking for probably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T09:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the code on the mod for Kerbal to leave a set, is that it will put the Kerbal out of the vessel, in the given direction, it don\u0027t care if is 1 mm or 10 meters in that direction, so for you to be sure, i already try changing the direction do Z\u002B (front in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, or up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E), and even in a very long vessel, the Kerbal jump to the front out of it. So, that manner, my mod (the link in the signature), already have internals, windows, but if i leave seat with windows closed, Kerbal will jump out through the glass. If i open window, it jump out the volume the vessel, and come back inside with gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou already can walk inside the vessel. Go take a look!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
