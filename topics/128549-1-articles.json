That would be nice, sure, but\u00A0I think a fine\u00A0\u0022kerbal\u0022 way to do things is have a\u00A0toggle-able\u00A0camera mode (like the ones you switch through with \u0027C\u0027) that centers\u00A0itself exactly between the two vessels. This would give the illusion of the two moving toward each other and you can be front row to the action that is docking! Just making\u00A0sure it\u0027s\u00A0clear\u00A0what vessel you\u0027re controlling though might be an issue.
