I agree with you that life-support is unlikely, only because it would take a lot of work/balancing.\n\nOther possibilities:\n\n- Clouds (fingers crossed)\n\n- Science over time space station modules, should be easy now that the science over time lab module is implemented\n\n- Terrain scatter with collision boxes\n\n- Command seats that can be manned in the VAB/SPH\n\n- Proper parachutes\n\n- Mapsat \n\nAny/all of these would be fine Felipe, thanks ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T17:55:15Z","Content":"Full support for Brotoro\u0027s suggestions.\n\nEDIT: also, CITIES!
