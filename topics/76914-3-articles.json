I still worry about infiniglide polluting results when using flaps as wings... but it\u0027s significantly less of a concern to me knowing this, it\u0027s likely mostly just providing some bonus lift/speed during the early phases of the launch but at 40k on Kerbin the effects should be negligable. When I used my craft on Kerbin (Still infinite fuel cheating), it achieved orbit easily... so I\u0027m hopeful for you to get a positive result on Kerbin. My numbers unfortunately still stand for Eve though... it\u0027s just not possible to get a pure ion-craft to orbit there.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, nothing new to report today.

DV= 9.81 Isp ln(Mw/Md). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You need at least 8,500 DV to get from the surface of Eve to LEO. Nothing stock in this game can achieve that, even composed of infinite tanks. Especially not with the t/w demanded for Eve. A chemical rocket to do that job would need an Isp of at least 394 atmospheric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As others have said, if it\u0027s possible at all it\u0027ll be using an ion glider. Ion engines can make the DV easily, but they lack the t/w to pick themselves up let alone anything else. So it\u0027s a glider. unfortunately, gliders are grossly DV inefficient since you spend practically your whole launch fighting drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Your fuel becomes time. You know exactly how long your engines will provide thrust and how much drag you can push.
