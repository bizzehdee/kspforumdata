When I did a tutorial on orbit, the ship had small jets of air showing when I adjusted the roll/yaw/pitch. This made controlling the ship a lot easier. The problem is when I play career mode, the air particles do not show \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.

There are two kinds, ones that only thrust in one direction, and ones that thrust in pretty much all necessary directions. Both kinds can be found (once unlocked) in the Command \u0026amp; Control tab in the VAB/SPH. You will also need some RCS fuel tanks in order to operate them, which I believe is under the Propulsion tab. Several sizes of fuel tanks are available; look for anything mentioning RCS or MonoPropellant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T12:39:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ealso,you can click \u0022r\u0022 to turn rcs in flight\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
