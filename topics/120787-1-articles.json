Nor could anything amuse him more than the look on Gene\u0027s face when he buzzed KSC Tower at twice the speed of sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the emphasis was on \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver since that \u003Cem\u003Edamned \u003C/em\u003Ewoman had shown up, nothing had gone to plan. First, she\u0027d beaten his test scores; then, she\u0027d started grabbing flights that a year before, would\u0027ve gone to him in a second. And moreover, command loved her, because unlike him, she had no damned sense of humour at \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENowadays, he was mostly relegated to testing prototype fighters for the military. Which, sure, was fun, but he hadn\u0027t even gone suborbital for three months. Pulling 9G Kulbits and Cobras was nothing compared to the sensation of screaming straight to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost days, he wandered KSC with a mixture of resignation and anger, kicking the odd trashcan when Mortimer wasn\u0027t looking (Jeb wasn\u0027t entirely sure how he kept the program running on the shoestring budget it had, but it had something to do with making pilots pay for everything he could).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe found himself walking towards the briefing room with a certain skip in his step, one that had been missing for all too long. The building was practically deserted - most of the current recruits had been transferred to Kerbin Station for zero-G training - but all the same, he felt more alive than he had in ages, thanks to the rumours floating around KSC. Rumours that there was a new, high-profile assignment for him; Bill had clued him in on a video call last night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe stepped inside, sprawling himself across as many seats as physically possible. He was well past the point of excitement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point, two thickly-accented voices could be heard in the corridor. Jeb turned his head to notice, although deemed himself far too comfortable to actually face the new arrivals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst to step into his view was Wernher von Kerman; a small, slightly-built Kerbal in his seventies, clad in a sweeping white coat. A finely-trimmed moustache accompanied an expression of utter self-confidence on his aged features. Nobody knew exactly where he was from, but all Jeb knew was that the scientist had been with the program longer than he had, and \u003Cem\u003Enobody \u003C/em\u003Ehad been here longer than he had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the second figure moved through Jeb\u0027s field of vision, and he felt his fist clench tight enough to draw blood.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETall, confident, back straight. Striding like a professional, like he used to. First time face to face but he knew her from TV, she was on all the time - \u0027photogenic\u0027, that was what Bob\u0027d\u0027ve said. A small, contented smile on determined features, a yellow ribbon holding her hair in a tight ponytail. Clad in the orange Test Pilot jumpsuit, just like he used to wear. She sat just along from him, not even looking at him, back straight, hands folded neatly in her lap, all her attention on Wernher. Her new, holy patron, courtesy of the fact that she hadn\u0027t destroyed any of his \u0027masterpieces\u0027 yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, as far as Jeb was concerned, if the thing crashed, it was Wernher\u0027s fault, not his.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s been a long time, Jebediah,\u0022 Wernher said, standing at the fore of the room. \u0022Before we proceed, you should meet our newest test pilot. Ms Kerman?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe turned her head to face Jeb, dark eyes scanning him with a certain even disregard. \u0022Afternoon, Commander,\u0022 she said, managing to inject a certain warmth into her voice that almost sounded genuine. It momentarily occurred to Jeb that she mightn\u0027t bear him the same enmity, but he discarded the thought. That wasn\u0027t going to get him anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A pleasure, Val,\u0022 he said, pushing himself into sitting and offering her a hand to shake. Her grip was firm, powerful. He turned his attention to Wernher. \u0022Any reason why the lady\u0027s here, von?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022All shall become clear,\u0022 Wernher said, hoisting a briefcase onto the desk at the front of the room and clicking it open. \u0022As per the only thing you people seem to be remotely good for, I\u0027ve called you here to pilot a new prototype of ours.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What are we dealing with, exactly, sir?\u0022 Valentina interjected; her voice was clipped, sharp, her accent nearly-faded. She was already started to fit in. Jeb felt his blood nearly boil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher rolled out a huge blueprint, nearly five feet to a side, with the same expression one might expect from a proud father showing off his son\u0027s sporting trophies. Jeb pushed himself to his feet, stepped over to the table. Any semblance of military discipline had long since left him, he was realising. Getting sloppy, probably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis eyes danced across the design, the sharp, sweeping lines and the colossal, Kraken-powerful engines. Even the drawing seemed resplendent in its own way, a sleek, indomitable symbol of power. It looked like no aircraft Jeb had ever seen flown before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022My crowning achievement,\u0022 Wernher said, in a tone that suggested he had expected more proclamations of amazement from his subordinates. \u0022Fully-reusable. Two hundred feet long, a hundred-twenty feet wide. Thirty-five \u003Cem\u003Ethousand \u003C/em\u003Ekilonewtons of thrust at peak. Capable of breaking atmosphere within four minutes of launch with a payload of a hundred tonnes. I call it the \u0027\u003Cem\u003EValkyrie\u003C/em\u003E\u0027.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VKq2bLH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VKq2bLH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is insane,\u0022 Valentina muttered under her breath, but Jeb saw the grin spread across it and with no small alarm, realised he had his own. It was \u003Cem\u003Ebeautiful\u003C/em\u003E, bigger and faster and stupider than anything else ever flown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, my dear,\u0022 Wernher said. \u0022It is \u003Cem\u003Ebrilliance\u003C/em\u003E. One expects no different of my designs - you know that; but I digress. Suffice to say, I need it tested.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So why are we both here?\u0022 Jeb asked, glancing up, a sudden sinking feeling in his stomach. Surely, Wernher couldn\u0027t have simply called him here to witness?! It would be inconceivably cruel, showing him a beast of this magnitude, then refusing to allow him to take it up...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, yes, of course. I apologise; I occasionally get lost in my own brilliance, as you can imagine,\u0022 Wernher shrugged. \u0022You see, the \u003Cem\u003EValkyrie \u003C/em\u003Eis built from the technology of a military prototype - XK-THOR, they called it. K.S.A.F. black ops, very top-secret, suborbital bomber type of weapon. It was cancelled after the peace treaty with the Krussians was signed, and most of it buried, but I found the engines and reproduced them. Quite innovative, if I do say so myself.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Your point?\u0022 Valentina said, eyes flickering to Jeb. \u0022I mean no disrespect to the Commander, but I have logged the best scores in the program, and surely, the weight of a spare pilot would be nothing more than a hindrance.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022With all due respect, lady, I wasn\u0027t even trying on those tests,\u0022 Jeb snapped, spinning to face her down, suddenly frustrated that she was taller than him. \u0022I swear to the Kraken, give me another shot at those and you\u0027ll see what a \u003Cem\u003Ereal \u003C/em\u003Epilot can-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Quiet, both of you!\u0022 Wernher shouted, slamming a fist down on the blueprint, before glancing down, as though terrified it might be somehow damaged. \u0022The military are nervous about a Krussian piloting their toy; they want one of their own.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA grin began to split Jeb\u0027s face. \u0022And with Bill and Bob sitting around with their thumbs up their asses on Kerbin Station...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Correct, Jebediah,\u0022 Wernher said. \u0022However, this thing costs as much as an entire air wing of those little toys you run around in for the military. Make no mistake - if you do not return this plane in one piece, I \u003Cem\u003Ewill \u003C/em\u003Eensure that you never step off this rock again. Do I make myself clear?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure, sure,\u0022 Jebediah said, only half-listening at this point; far greater priorities were now at hand, like how the Kraken he was going to make this thing work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, and one more thing,\u0022 Wernher said. \u0022I am not about to let you crash this thing, either. So I\u0027m sending Ms Kerman with you. The two of you will learn cooperate, and hopefully, she will prevent your \u003Cem\u003Erampant \u003C/em\u003Estupidity from destroying my beautiful creation, Jebediah.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERight then.\u003C/em\u003E Well, \u003Cem\u003Ethat \u003C/em\u003Ecomplicated matters some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn one hand, he got to get into space again - and got some thirty-five \u003Cem\u003Emillion \u003C/em\u003ENewtons of force to get him there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, he had to deal with her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn balance, this day suddenly felt profoundly mediocre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ugGS6wU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ugGS6wU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You ready for this, lady?\u0022 Jeb said, affixing his helmet firmly - a matter of religion for him now, ever since he\u0027d been forced to bail out once at twenty thousand metres having forgotten to put one on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Naturally,\u0022 Valentina said, strapping on her gloves as she strode across the tarmac, before her eyes flickered up to meet Jeb\u0027s. \u0022A better question might be, \u0027are you?\u0027\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb laughed, and found himself surprised by that. It occurred to him, staring at the woman as she walked, that there was a spark inside of her. A talent, not unlike his own. He saw it the second she laid eyes upon the \u003Cem\u003EValkyrie\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s blueprints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t make her any less of an ....... for taking his job, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qo1QqLB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qo1QqLB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That thing is massive.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs much as she annoyed him, Jeb deemed it undeniable that in this instance, Valentina was onto something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt hadn\u0027t really hit him how \u003Cem\u003Emassive \u003C/em\u003Ethis thing was until he saw it in person. The cockpit alone was nearly thirty feet off the ground, and the massive flared winglets towered even higher into the sky. Each of its six hulking engine cores was as thick around as a standard Kerbal-X launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You think it\u0027ll get in the air?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ten VTOL engines, six BROADSWORDs and four Scramjets,\u0022 the Krussian woman said, with a sharp laugh. \u0022I\u0027m more worried about getting it back \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E, with that much thrust.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb flipped open his visor, and pulled his sunglasses from a pocket in his piloting gear. He slid them onto his face, and slid the faceplate shut again. Now he felt ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That,\u0022 he said, a smirk dancing across his features \u0022is a problem for \u003Cem\u003Efuture \u003C/em\u003EJeb to worry about.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe strode towards the aircraft, feeling more dwarfed by it every second. He clambered up the ladder, hands wrapping familiar around aerospace steel like they hadn\u0027t in a long time. It was gargantuan, this thing, gargantuan and invincible and beautiful in its raw power. \u003Cem\u003EThis \u003C/em\u003Ewas what he loved about working for the Space Program - mad Wernher might\u0027ve been, but if the man had been sane, this job wouldn\u0027t\u0027ve been \u003Cem\u003Ehalf \u003C/em\u003Eas fun as it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe turned around halfway up the ladder, looking over to Valentina, looking so small and insignificant, studiously fastening the airtight zips on her gloves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022C\u0027mon, lady!\u0022 he shouted, over the distant thudding of waves. \u0022Less slackin\u0027, more flyin\u0027!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen he looked forward, and noted the location of the door. He clicked on the radio in his helmet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gene, you there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022This is KSC Tower, copy,\u0022\u003C/em\u003E crackled back. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022What can we do for you?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Can you ask Wernher why the cockpit door\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eright next\u003C/em\u003E to the frontal ram intake?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a lengthy pause. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022He says it\u0027s to discourage you from bailing out.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Brilliant,\u0022 Jeb muttered, as he clambered inside. \u0022The genius at work...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few seconds later, and they were all strapped in; the control panels were largely simple, filled with advanced-looking touchscreens and LCD displays, along with a whole pile of buttons. Still, he was relieved to see a regular old-fashioned piloting stick in front of the three pilot\u0027s seats, arranged in a triangle at the forward of the craft, along with a pair of engineering stations further back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Whereabouts you from, anyhow?\u0022 Jeb asked, running through the preflight checks absentmindedly; by the looks of it, everything was working as it should\u0027ve, which admittedly, was a nice change from Wernher\u0027s usual designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The countryside, out in Krussia,\u0022 she said. \u0022Cold, icy, but friendly. The place is not as bad as you have been told.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb found himself wondering if she was just running some official line, or if she was genuine. Through the accent, it was hard to tell. From what he\u0027d seen of his own, Krussia was mostly frigid forests and vast plains of tundra.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And you?\u0022 Val asked, as she tested out her own set of controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Southern K.S., thousand miles from anywhere,\u0022 Jeb said. \u0022Grew up learning to fly cropdusters. Of course, my dad put a stop to that after I managed to land one on the roof of the neighbour\u0027s barn, but it was damn worth it, lemme tell you...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe finished the checks a second later, and placed a hand on the throttle, wrapping his hand around it. It had been years since he\u0027d piloted anything with this layout, yet his body felt to respond instinctively to the cluttered interior of the spacecraft. To his right, Val keyed up the primary engine ignition, and in a second, Jeb could hear the low, throaty whine of the Broadswords and VTOL thrusters spooling up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022KSC Tower, this is \u003Cem\u003EValkyrie\u003C/em\u003E, requesting permission for takeoff,\u0022 Valentina said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Solid copy, Valkyrie, you are cleared for takeoff,\u0022\u003C/em\u003E Gene\u0027s crisp, professional tone sounded. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Fly safe, Val. Stop Jeb from doing anything \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Etoo \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Estupid, alright?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I heard that, Gene,\u0022 Jeb laughed. \u0022Don\u0027t make me see how low I can take this thing over the tower.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Want me to revoke your takeoff clearance, Jebediah?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Point taken. \u003Cem\u003EValkyrie\u003C/em\u003E, taking off.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlready impatient, Jeb pushed the throttle to maximum, and for a second, things moved slowly, as the sound of the engines moved from a low roar. The start was gentle, slow, but in a second, the roar of the engines became deafening, accompanied by the static noise of the underbelly VTOL engines, giving them extra lift while the primary engines waited to enter their thrust band.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb felt himself pushed back in his seat as the acceleration increased massively, almost four hundred tonnes of spacecraft tearing down the runway at frankly insane speeds. White titanium flashed like a swan in the warm glow of tropical day. Under the immense vibration of the engines, only the upwards ticking of the altimeter denoted that they\u0027d taken off at all - in surprisingly quick time, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Killing VTOLs,\u0022 Val stated, flicking a switch. The noise of static drowned away, and after a moment\u0027s lurching drop, the aircraft seemed to catch itself on its own lift, and entered level flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d24rIJR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022d24rIJR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022KSC Tower, \u003Cem\u003EValkyrie \u003C/em\u003Eis airborne,\u0022 Jeb grinned, still feeling himself pressed back into his seat as the hulking craft roared towards transsonic speeds. He toyed left and right with the stick, and felt it roll surprisingly responsively. His gleeful toying earned him a look from Val, who then grinned and adjusted pitch; it was no less responsive in that respect, every movement of the pilot translated straight to the craft\u0027s movements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Somebody tell Wernher that I could use this thing to dogfight,\u0022 Jeb said, before grinning and adding, \u0022and should, for that matter.

Suddenly, the speed readings started spiralling upwards - six, seven, eight hundred metres per second, before the craft had even breached five kilometres of altitude. Valentina\u0027s head whipped around as she outside of the front screen lit up orange and white with the brutal shock heating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BuSOM8v.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BuSOM8v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb saw her hand stray for just a second towards the throttle on her side, before a wide grin crossed her features and she pulled it away.

Probably some aerodynamic unbalance that made it necessary to modify.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina, for her part, kept a close eye on the intake air; the second they hit 20,000m, it began to drop off swiftly, and with a quick nod to Jeb, she hit the mode switch.

There was the cracking of the ignition circuits, the electrical discharge echoing throughout the craft, but the roar of thrust was absent. She heard Jeb swear under his breath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Looks like ignition\u0027s dead,\u0022 she said, as she unclipped herself from her seat. \u0022Someone\u0027s going to have to restart those things manually.\u0022 She turned, holding on tight, waiting for the craft to orient itself in such a way that she could fall in the direction she wanted to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, Jeb\u0027s hand planted itself on her shoulder. She stared straight into those \u003Cem\u003Estupid \u003C/em\u003Esunglasses of his as he spoke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Look, I should go,\u0022 Jeb said, voice suddenly bearing the weight of a man twice his age. \u0022I ain\u0027t about to ask you to do something this dangerous. It just ain\u0027t right.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re the famous Jebediah Kerman, right?\u0022 Valentina said, looking him dead in the eyes. \u0022Fly the damned plane.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that, she pushed off, falling straight towards the back door of the cockpit. She slammed against the aerospace steel wall, pain flashing before her eyes from the impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe held on tight to the door handle as the flow of gravity changed again, trying to pull her towards the cockpit glass. A second later, and it was back, the craft spinning around and facing backwards again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe wrenched open the door, then fell through, feeling it slam shut as the craft\u0027s balance changed. She tumbled through the narrow corridor, grabbing onto a handhold at the last second. The air was thick with bloodred emergency lighting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother second and the balance changed once more, and she dropped through the open door, falling past four rows of passenger seats. Through the window at the back of the room, she could see the dark, cavernous expanse of the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EC\u0027mon, Val,\u003C/em\u003E she told herself. \u003Cem\u003EDon\u0027t be the one to mess this up.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe dropped, hitting the edge of the space. Suddenly, the craft\u0027s balance tipped unexpectedly, and she plummeted, slamming against the corner of the passenger bay before she could find a handhold. Pain shot through her arm, straight into her skull, and she heard a distant scream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k0j09pU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k0j09pU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022You alright in there, lady?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E Jeb\u0027s voice crackled into her helmet. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022That didn\u0027t sound like fun.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pain\u0027s just weakness leaving the body,\u0022 she replied, before pushing herself over to the door, ignoring the pulsating pain in her forearm. \u0022I\u0027ll be fine. Where are we?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Twenty-thousand, still doing fifteen hundred,\u0022\u003C/em\u003E Jeb replied. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Let me tell you, things are getting pretty warm outside now. We\u0027re not shedding parts yet, but I have a feeling we\u0027re about to test this thing\u0027s build quality.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe pulled the door with her good arm, suddenly facing the vast expanse of the cargo bay; there was a quiet rush of air as the passenger bay\u0027s oxygen rapidly extracted into the open space. She held onto the gap of the door, then waited until the balance shifted vertically, and dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe hit the ground and sprinted along the tilting floor, making it as far as she could while gravity still worked in a semi-normal direction. A second later, the spaceplane rolled, and she jumped, hit the side wall and kept running, jumping over every pipe and structural spar in her way, desperately trying to not trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single movement could mean a broken leg, and death thereafter, but she didn\u0027t have time to consider that, adrenaline pounding through her veins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDown the other end, she saw what she needed - the engine ignition system, half-obscured in darkness. Gravity went vertical, and she felt herself float, suddenly free-falling straight towards the bottom of the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe grabbed onto a handhold, wrenching herself to a halt, pain shooting through her bad arm. Blinking away stars, she pushed herself forward, clawing her way towards the engine maintenance. She pulled open the panel, looking over the complicated mess of wires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESparks flew at her visor as she tried to key the manual ignition - nothing. A warning flashed up on the display - not enough pressure for ignition. Without an engineer on hand, she had no hope of making repairs, even if there had been time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Ten thousand metres, lady,\u0022\u003C/em\u003E Jeb\u0027s voice cut through the pounding pain in her skull. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022No pressure.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe looked around, seeing the burst RCS pipes to her right, running right below. An idea occurred to her. A spectacularly stupid idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe grabbed the two monopropellant lines, still leaking vapour into the vacuum. The mechanism of operation for the RCS was simple - a small volume of hypergolic fuel was mixed in a controlled volume, generating a thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe locked the pump, and then disconnected the hoses, pulling them up towards the ignition section. There were two small pipes through which to run cleaning fluids through the engines. Fortunately, Wernher seemed to have cheaped out on the design - everything had commercial fittings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Commander, hold on,\u0022 she said, and after muttering a brief prayer to the Kraken, pressed both of them into the cleaning fluid attachments, grunting as pain shot through her bad arm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe hit the RCS release, before thumbing the ignition circuit again. There was an electrical crack, one, two, three times, before -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes! Valentina punched the air with her good arm, as the familiar sound of jet turbines spooling up began to roar through the cargo bay. A second later, she pulled herself back, as the craft shifted itself nose-down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe plummeted, falling through layer after layer of open doors, bouncing violently through the crew tube before slamming into the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe bounced from the roof down, landing back-first on the control console, pain shooting through her body. She blinked away stars, and with no small degree of surprise, found herself looking into a pair of sunglasses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lovely as it is to see you again, I do need to fly,\u0022 Jeb said, and Valentina pushed herself away, strapping herself into her chair with her good arm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flow of gravity shifted as the tailspin continued, the aircraft shifting itself backwards. Jeb\u0027s hand rested on the throttle, studying the navball studiously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second the craft\u0027s orientation hit retrograde, he slammed on the engines at full thrust, and the cockpit was filled with the roar of tens of thousands of kilonewtons of thrust spooling up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe was pushed back into her seat as the craft\u0027s fall decelerated, watching as Jeb precisely shifted the stick from left to right, using the thrust vectoring to hold it stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo her endless shock, it held stable, the craft somehow - and for the life of her, she didn\u0027t know how - pushing itself into a firm vertical orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb held it in place, every movement exactly coordinated to maintain retrograde, the engines \u003Cem\u003Escreaming \u003C/em\u003Eas they tried to hold some three hundred tonnes of spaceplane vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe deceleration ticked down, three hundred, two hundred, one hundred. The altitude was still dropping like a rock, less than a kilometre to go. The world seemed to stop, everything hanging in the balance for a long second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, with a painful groan of titanium, the speed hit zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022VTOL!\u0022 Jeb shouted, and Val reached out with her good arm, punching the vertical thrusters as the craft\u0027s balance pulled it into facing forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, the speed began to tick up - ten, fifty, a hundred metres per second. She flicked off the VTOL, and after a moment\u0027s bobbing, the craft held stable, held aloft by its own lift. Jeb hit stability control, the \u003Cem\u003EValkyrie \u003C/em\u003Efinally pulling into level flight at cruising speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uQc6wGe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uQc6wGe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb took off his helmet, cracking his neck and pulling his sunglasses, turning to Valentina with a grin the size of Krussia across his face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That,\u0022 he said, \u0022was the most fun I\u0027ve had in \u003Cem\u003Eages.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina paused, looked him up and down, considered, and then started laughing too, a smile spreading itself across her features. She pulled her helmet, laughing as she shook out her hair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ll be honest,\u0022 she said. \u0022Done a lot of things in my life. Never fallen from orbit in a tailspin, though. You really are as insane as Bill and Bob say.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There\u0027s a reason why I\u0027m called the \u0027thrillmaster\u0027, you know,\u0022 Jeb grinned, folding his arms behind his head. \u0022And really, lady, I\u0027m offended that you expected anything less.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the longest time, nothing happened, no words passing between them, just the relief of shared breathing. Jeb set course for the nearest continent, intending to set them down in a field somewhere or other; they\u0027d missed KSC by thousands of kilometres, and the Valkyrie didn\u0027t have enough fuel in to make the extra distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J2DlirL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J2DlirL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, the outcroppings of land could be seen in the distance, and Jeb slowly took the massive spaceplane down, the aircraft now handling fine back in lower atmosphere. He spotted a nice green plain, extending landing gear and switching off stability assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Brace,\u0022 Jeb said. While not as exhilarating as pulling an aircraft out of a hypersonic tailspin, Valentina knew full well how dangerous uneven landings had the potential to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane fell slowly, and he nudged the stick left and right, matching orientation with the ground. He hit the ground slowly, doing about a hundred-fifty miles an hour, landing the immense vehicle with the grace of a Kessna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZuPohze.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZuPohze.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Chutes!\u0022 Jeb ordered, and Valentina hit the release, the plane\u0027s drogue parachutes pulling hard at it, slowing it down to a standstill in seconds, before the ground became uneven. Valentina could hardly believe what she was seeing as the vast aircraft rolled gently to a stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe breathed heavily, the pain in her arm worse now but not unbearable. It was natural to incur a few injuries in this line of work, after all, and she wasn\u0027t about to be a baby like the male pilots tended to be whenever they had a rough landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the same, she welcomed Jeb\u0027s help stepping out of the cockpit and climbing down the ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xl6GGTr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Xl6GGTr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027re not dead,\u0022 Jeb reflected as they stood on the ground, both wearing exhausted, thin-lipped smiles. For her part, Valentina was happy enough just to feel solid ground beneath her feet again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I may have been driven mad by the G-forces up there,\u0022 Valentina said, turning to him, \u0022But we should \u003Cem\u003Edefinitely \u003C/em\u003Edo that again sometime.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ll admit, lady,\u0022 Jeb said, \u0022you\u0027re not such a bad copilot, as they go.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Copilot?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E Valentina laughed, \u0022I saved your sorry butt up there, Jebediah.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure, Val, sure,\u0022 Jeb said, pulling the beacon from his flight suit. \u0022C\u0027mon.
