I guess I had a mega Scott Manley night last night. Using the combination of Science Alert and Science Library on a Mun mission with Explore the Mun contract, I came back from the Mun with almost 2000 science. I would recommend using both mods for maximum results. Maybe both mod makers should collaborate to make these mods into one. Reaper, you might want to contact SpiritOffice about that possibility. Both mods together make two good mods into a science getting beast. Fantastic work guys.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
