This is not realistic but it give very steady performance without wobble. You can also pick up Jeb with the magnet :-)\n\n**How to use:**\n\nThe mod adds an attachment node to the CSS, Onepiece and stock cargobay. This is where you should attach the Shoulder part. The shoulder part cannot be surface attached! The Canadarm uses IR for the moving parts and KAS for the effector magnet. You can create presets in the VAB (recommended). To \u0022grab\u0022 stuff with the effector you have to enable the magnet. It is recommended to map this to an action group in the VAB. The arm and the magnet both use electrical power so keep this in mind when using the arm. There is a camera mounted in the effector wich you can use via Rasterpropmonitor. You can also use the supplied subassembly.\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Modulemanager (included)\n- Infernal Robotics ([https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics/releases/latest](https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics/releases/latest))\n- Kerbal Attachment System ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29))\n- Rasterpropmonitor ([https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/releases/latest](https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/releases/latest))\n\n**Notes and Known Issues:**\n\n- Underarm extend is moving inverted in the VAB, works correctly ingame\n- Models are still being worked on, black shadow lines on texture is being fixed\n\n**Download:**\n\n- [https://github.com/Jeast85/Canadarm/releases](https://github.com/Jeast85/Canadarm/releases)\n\n**Coming soon:**\n\n- High res textures\n\nIf you find any bugs/issues or have suggestions, let me know!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* CHANGELOG \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nv0.96\n\n BugFixes\n\n --parts unclickable in VAB and 3d world.
