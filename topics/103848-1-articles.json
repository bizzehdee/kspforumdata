I won\u0027t be posting every shot of the progress because I take an awful lot of them, but they will end up in the trip album.\n\n[Trip Album @ Flickr](https://flic.kr/s/aHsk9kp3Vg)\n\nThe vehicle:\n\n[![16931431150_a34b916174_c.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7684/16931431150_a34b916174_c.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/rNb1AJ)\n\n[![17118989835_04df8ab290_c.jpg](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8754/17118989835_04df8ab290_c.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/s5Kiga)\n\nMod list:\n\n- B9 provided the engines, compressed air RCS, one set of lights.\n- B9 pWings provided all the aero surfaces. FAR provided the actual aero.\n- TT multiwheels provided the wheels.\n- Procedural tanks gave one of the tanks and the conical caps.\n- Firespitter gave the floats\n- IR rework gave the hinges\n- Ven\u0027s stock revamp makes some of the stock parts look a little different.\n- QuantumStrutsContinued gave the strut guns - they\u0027re the grey bars which stop the front floats banging into everything.\n- SCANSat gave BTDT to track progress on the little map, and general mapping facilities.\n- Telemachus was meant to give me a moving marker on a map, but I broke that already by getting it confused...\n- Pilot Assistant gives SSAS. Sundry other quality of life mods like KJR help in little ways.\n\nWhy so fast?\n\n- I like speed! cross-country speed is a technical challenge in keeping the vehicle in one piece, and something of a driving challenge in reading the terrain. And a fairly hair-raising gamble at times\n- I\u0027ve gone fast cross-country before, in fact faster than I\u0027ll probably be going on this trip ( other than at the poles ) - years ago there was a [challenge to drive to KSC2 as fast as possible.](https://flic.kr/s/aHsjKw77kb) No surprise how alike the vehicles look.\n- I also w[ent exploring Kerbin a couple of years ago](https://flic.kr/s/aHsjK2P4YP), so while there\u0027s new things to see because I\u0027m running Kerbinside, it\u0027s not all new. That particular album doesn\u0027t cover anything like everywhere I ended up.\n\nWhy go via the poles?\n\n- It\u0027s different! generally people seem to go round the equator, and that\u0027s at least 50% water. The craft isn\u0027t terribly fast in water - unlike it\u0027s predecessor - so I\u0027m avoiding water when I can.\n\n* * *\n\n**Legs 1 \u0026 2.** - Green and cyan.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The start/finish point is on the beach at the end of the KSC runway -\n\u003E \n\u003E [![16887711078_b98ca46760_c.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7613/16887711078_b98ca46760_c.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/rJiW9o)\n\u003E \n\u003E The guys took a quick boat trip across the bay to avoid a bunch of those hills \u0026 shakedown the aquatic side -\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17074008482_c495740419_c.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7671/17074008482_c495740419_c.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/s1LKSA)\n\u003E \n\u003E Soon blowing their way across the flat country - Jeb is enjoying himself, I suspect Bill is either paranoid or trying not to regurgitate...\n\u003E \n\u003E [![16868069467_8bcdd054d9_c.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7590/16868069467_8bcdd054d9_c.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/rGzgnV)\n\u003E \n\u003E Leg 1 ended after around 1:45 having covered nearly 245km, and a successful shakedown of the craft.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![16453058084_f2375f46e5_c.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7719/16453058084_f2375f46e5_c.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/r4UdXf)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n* * *\n\nThe target for **Leg 2** was the North Polar Biodome ( from Kerbinside ), which is on the ice flat but a way off from the pole itself.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The sun was going down pretty fast, driving crosscountry got considerably harder because the shadows made it difficult to see how steep slopes were.
