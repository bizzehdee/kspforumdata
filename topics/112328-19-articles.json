Obviously, it has far reaching balance implications, but if you make it large, expensive, and hot ...it would probably be planetary only. I\u0027ll be honest, I\u0027m not sure if there is too much of a need for it, but I just hate the idea of a \u0022non-renewable resource\u0022 from a gameplay perspective. Could make it punishingly inefficient if you want (since you don\u0027t need much) and slow, since time means something different to frozen kerbs.\n\u003E     - I\u0027m just envisioning a far flung outpost where, due to changes in the orbit, the climate becomes vastly different and kerbals freeze themselves to get through till it becomes hospitable again. At which time they go about producing Glykerkol (or they had automated production facilities producing it while they were hibernating) for the next cycle. Or something.\n\u003E     - I know the mod is more designed for a \u0022I have a 3 year voyage ahead of me and I want to cut down on the food budget, better freeze the crew\u0022 type scenarios, but with a single part it, some new situations open up.

I really think it needs to be expensive, since you don\u0027t need much of it. I\u0027m not sure how fast it would be...does ISRU work with physics warp? I think the strong point of LifeSupport mods is that the time aspect suddenly means something. If you could just, with a burst of EC create as much Glykerkol as needed, that would pretty much rob the player of the challenge. I think they should be rather slow and drawn out, requiring the player to plan ahead.\n\nLooking at the link above...dat formula.![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif \u0022:0.0:\u0022) I like an Ore \u002B XenonGas maybe, but XenonGas is a nonrenewable resource (without mods), so we\u0027re a back at square one. Water isn\u0027t bad, as it\u0027s a CRP resource and frequently found in Asteroids (with the right mods) or your drinking fountain (TACLS). The only renewable resources in stock are what, Ore \u002B EC (and Kerbals![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)) but that\u0027s a bit boring.

As in it\u0027s a self-replicating liquid/gel that lives on / is found naturally on Ore, and when supplied with a steady current of Electricity over long, *long* periods of time, it doubles/quadruples/etc. Insert pseudo scientific references to bacterial cultures and, ta da, Gykerkol ISRU.
