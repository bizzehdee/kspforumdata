Your keeping with a more in keeping with the caveman style doing a lot with less where as I when with the kerbal more boosters style. I look forward to seeing where you go with this mission.\n\n\u0022The question is why does the undock change vessel focus.\u0022 \n\nI know, you set control from here on the center part but when you stage you end up controlling one of the boosters and have to quickly hit the \u0027[\u0027 or \u0027]\u0027 keys to switch back.\n\nI don\u0027t use \u0027external fuel ducts\u0027 because I\u0027m part limited on the lower middle part. It would be nice and is something I thought about on the mk2 but dismissed it as I was not sure it would work. If I was using a less powerful engine or the booster had more fuel and I needed to run all my engines at full power then then true asparagus staging would of been worth looking into more.\n\nI find it interesting that you used both jet engines and the Spark engine on the cart. I just used the Spark. The lack of action groups or powered wheels really makes it a pain to control. Does the the slow power up on the jet give you the option to go both forward and backwards with out having to right click the engines and turn them on and off? \n\nI had to lower the power of my brakes on my cart as it can fall over if I brake too quick I\u0027m guessing this is not as big of a problem for you as your carts are carrying less? or maybe it is as your wheels are closer together.\n\nIRL commitments means I don\u0027t have a lot of time to work on this but Val will got to Duna soon."},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T16:08:04Z","Content":"Through Bob and Bill experimenting I am close to understanding or at least dealing with the \u0022Vessel lose of focus\u0022.\n\nI had the same issues with decelerating when loaded with a 36 tonne booster train. So instead I reduce braking force on the wheels and use the Sparks and Wheesley to reduce momentum.\n\nThe combination of Spark and Wheesley allows for cruising and quick deceleration by closing the intake and then opening the oxidizer. Also the Sparks are used to back away from the docking port the magnetic attraction can be quite strong. I shut the Wheesley down after the cart is moving and use RCS thrusters to inch my way forward.\n\nI tried using both at once but the jet continues to spool up and eventually you go now where fast. I did experiment and with a short throttle duration the vehicle will inch backwards."},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T00:05:32Z","Content":"Still working on the Laythe lander"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T06:25:39Z","Content":"I find it intresting how we come up with different solutions to the same problem. your ground docking to make a biger launcher so you can send more stuff up in a single go. My approach is multipule launches, First sending up a lightweight core thats just engiens, lots of docking port attachments/booms and fuel lines to draw from the docking ports to the engiens. I then send up a lander module that attaches in front of the core, it is setup so it can draw from fuel tanks docked onto the sides. Then I send up as many fuel tank and sience modules as needed over many launches. Those just hang off the back side of the core from the outriger booms.\n\nOnce I finish assembling it I\u0027ll launch it off to duna and the lander will go up and down hiting ike bioms, swaping out fuel canisters and science moduels as they get used.\n\nalso like you this is post challenge shinanigans hopeing to see if I can get enough points for the rest of the tech tree without unlocking anything."},{"CreatedByName":"K3achas","CreatedById":99468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T19:04:55Z","Content":"My start to this challenge, with only the ten hundred most common words (from simple wikitionary\u0027s list) Up Goer Five style.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Idealy you want to burn a bit before it comes over the horizon by about 30s to a minute. for the easiest intercept asumeing an equitorial orbit pan the map so you see mun\u0027s orbit as a flat ring and see where minmus\u0027s orbit crosses it, this tells you where you want to burn from. If you consider those two intersection points 12:00 and 6:00 wait till minmus reaches about 1:30 and burn from 6:00. you\u0027ll probably still have to correct a bit at your AP to catch the SOI but you\u0027ll be close."},{"CreatedByName":"K3achas","CreatedById":99468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T01:08:52Z","Content":"This is very hard.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
