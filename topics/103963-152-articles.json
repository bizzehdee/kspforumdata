I also once in a while get the purple blip like in davidy12\u0027s most recent picture there. I have confirmed my graphics card settings have nothing special set.

I tried all various KSP settings (fullscreen on and off, -popupwindow, various in-game AA settings) and nothing changed.

Same ocean appearance and lack of sunflare.\n\nIf i go back to Scatterer V0.0233 the sunflare works in all situations under OpenGL.\n\nSo, I will be using either 0.0235 if I can get my RSS/RO/RP-0 within memory limits with DX11 (it looks amazing!) or 0.0233 OpenGL if I can\u0027t.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T03:22:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 03:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by stratochief66**"},{"CreatedByName":"Brigadier","CreatedById":147109,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T03:22:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3/12/2016 at 4:50 AM, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I will check it out.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For the lens flare, it\u0027s still broken for some people.

I just shorten it to a 2km window at 100km myself. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E With OpenGL I get that static-y effect on the water that [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/) said looked like a mipmap issue, and the sunflare doesn\u0027t work. I also once in a while get the purple blip like in davidy12\u0027s most recent picture there. I have confirmed my graphics card settings have nothing special set. The water has always appeared this way for me in OpenGL since scatterer started modifying the ocean appearance. [Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hlwexv03fnapiog/Graphics%20card%20settings.PNG?dl=0). I tried all various KSP settings (fullscreen on and off, -popupwindow, various in-game AA settings) and nothing changed. I also tried this version with just Stock KSP and scatterer, and the same situation exists. Same ocean appearance and lack of sunflare.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E If i go back to Scatterer V0.0233 the sunflare works in all situations under OpenGL.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So, I will be using either 0.0235 if I can get my RSS/RO/RP-0 within memory limits with DX11 (it looks amazing!) or 0.0233 OpenGL if I can\u0027t.\n\u003E \n\nYou can put back the sunFlare.shader file from V0.0233 into 0.0235 and it should get back to working in OpenGL. Mysteriously, 0.0235 fixed the sun flare for some and broke it for others, the hunt continues...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, Brigadier said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E An update.  Although forcing DX11 has not worked for me in the last due to memory limitations, I tried it again and successfully loaded the game and a save.  The flare is back (yea!).  I was forcing OpenGL before.  I still have to investigate the pink square but I suspect that it, too, is gone, since the flare is rendering correctly.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, I noticed a considerable difference in the way the ocean shading is rendered between the two.  If you\u0027d like, I\u0027ll post pictures of the differences.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: I also have less free RAM compared to OpenGL(lost about 400MB) but the average framerate has increased (7-9% subjectively?).\n\u003E \n\nYeah sure, post some pics. And yeah I think OpenGL is in general slower for everyoen than either dx11 or dx9.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Rareden said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A depth buffer is a image that shows how far things are from the camera, black is close white is distant. As you can see from the screen shot theres a problem with mine for some reason, its getting these odd slices in it and it will disappear if the camera gets to a normal distance from your craft.  \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Reveal hidden contents\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![0OqWcLR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0OqWcLR.jpg)\n\u003E \n\nHmm, that is super weird, considering I manually render a custom depth buffer and don\u0027t rely on the built-in KSP one. It\u0027s also pretty blurry and that halo effect is weird. Have you tried a different video mode yet? Are you using any other mods? And I\u0027d also be curious to see what that depth buffer looks like in motion.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 23 minutes ago, Zlodeevi4 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks, but I don\u0027t remember any craft\\_wave (apparently he is really very secret) and don\u0027t know how to turn it off, I never set up this stupid water) just don\u0027t know how to remove this problem with the horizon...\n\u003E \n\nYou didn\u0027t answer on whether you tried without the other mods you\u0027re using or not.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T12:33:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 12:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"}]}
