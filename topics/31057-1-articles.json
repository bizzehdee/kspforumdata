Usually I forget to strut the main engines/tanks in place, so the rocket breaks in half at 20km or so. If the upper stage is powerful enough, you might JUST be able to put it in orbit anyway, and it\u0027s a great feeling when you do. Those Kerbals get to go home tonight!

Then, after several run-ins with the thing it finally dawned on me that it had no docking port \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy logic: part A and part B had been uncoupled by selecting \u0027decouple\u0027 on the docking port.
