But players will think of the lab\u0027s main in-game purpose: cleaning experiments for re-use. Would you consider re-labeling some of these \u0022compartments,\u0022 to refer to cleaning supplies? Brooms, dustpans, Jeb\u0027s old socks (if people would understand these are being used as cleaning rags, lol) - maybe references to major brand cleaning products - use [Proctor and Gamble website](http://www.pg.com/en_US/brands/index.shtml) for inspiration - many of their brands are international ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T01:21:10Z","Content":"sweet. new hotness for our IVA\u0027s.
