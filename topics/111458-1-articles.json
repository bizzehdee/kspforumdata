The purpose of science is to develop new and better rocket parts. Instead of actually testing prototypes like before, now it\u0027s \u0022The Great Blueprint Scavenger Hunt\u0022, turning over every pebble on Mun and Minmus in hopes that some lost blueprint is hiding underneath.\n\nFortunately, there are better ways. First off, get DMagic Orbital Science. This gives you a boatload of additional science parts so you can gather more science per mission. Also, this same mod includes contracts to use these parts, which not only pay lots of cash but include substantial science rewards.\n\nAnd there is also Contract Configurator, which allows you to specify the frequency of contract types, so you can get back to doing actual R\u0026D work. This also lets you get a variety of contract packs to suit your style. This, along with Contract Rewards Modifier should enable you to remove all traces of grindiness and play the game the way you want to."},{"CreatedByName":"Two","CreatedById":144535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T13:47:50Z","Content":"Aside from the KSC \u0022biome\u0022 \u0022exploit\u0022 science farming - which is really tedious - you can just send a space probe to orbit Mun or Minimus and have it send the science data back home.
