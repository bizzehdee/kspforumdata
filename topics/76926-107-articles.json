If you\u0027re talking about actual force it\u0027s quite useless because the affected parts are connected to the actual vessel. When i make my tanks do battle with each other, when one tank shoots another tank in a really heavily armored spot, instead of the shell just bouncing off, the targeted tank just flies off and usually gets destroyed by surface impact. Probably 60% of my vehicle kills have been from surface impacts due to the shells launching them in the air. I have a suggestion, how about a HEAT shell that sends damaging rays only in front of it (And like a real HEAT shell, it\u0027s superheated copper penetrator (the damaging ray) loses it\u0027s penetrating power as distance increases.), and it focuses on destroying parts rather than pushing them away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also been making a radial part for BDArmory and it has some symmetry problems.

I say to reduce the radius enough so that it doesn\u0027t go farther than the width of armor that you have. You should also experiment with the configs if you have time.
