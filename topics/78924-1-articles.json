Squad might give a damn about videoram, and waste texturememory for no reason left and right, but even they realize the polycount problem: When they redesigned the VAB, they went as far as removing faces the player couldn\u0027t see - so for example, ladders at the walls only have faces in one direction - that\u0027s how bad it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"baijuncheng","CreatedById":116313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T11:42:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I have sorted the orientation thing out, but scaling is proving to be a nuisance. I am using 3DS Max, can anybody tell me how I should set the units up? If I set the system:display units 1:1, the model is far too small to work with due to clipping when zooming in.

Some one on the forums had a 900k\u002B part in KSP without any appreciable frame rate drop. I had a 250k\u002B character running on a 2 year old Android phone without frame rate issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStay under 5k triangles is good for most parts; pods and IVAs 10k is no problem. Textures are more memory and drawcall intensive, share as much as possible with the MODEL{} nodes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst and Biggest cause of slow-down are the physics calculations. There\u0027s nothing you can do for that with mesh and textures. Next are collision meshes, use as few as possible, and use Unity\u0027s primitive colliders whenever possible. Large textures can cause memory spikes that may crash the game in 32bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use max as well, I set system unit to 1 meter; display to generic units. set my viewport near clip to as low as possible. That\u0027s enough for anything in KSP unless you are making parts that are in the centimeter to millimeter range, shouldn\u0027t be a need for that at all. But in worst case, scale it up, do all the modeling work, reset it back to 100% scale before export. Make sure the import scale factor in Unity is set to 1 from default. that will eliminate a layer of unnecessary complication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo simplify things for myself I always model 1:1, 1.25m in Max is 1.25m in KSP, etc; and force the rescaleFactor to 1 in the part config file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal maps follow standard procedure. in max you set up a projection modifier on the game-mesh and point it to the high res mesh. from there you can bake out the Normal, AO, and Diffuse maps with Render to Texture dialogue. KSP has shaders that will take advantage of Normal, Diffuse\u002BAlpha. Alpha controls Specular value or Transparency depending on the shader. Emissive shader will read RGB values from a texture for self-illumination value and color.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-23T16:55:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2014 04:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nli2work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"baijuncheng","CreatedById":116313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T23:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is some awesome information.
