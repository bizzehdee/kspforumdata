I used the debug window to add a bunch of science to my account in science mode and I unlocked every single node, but experimental rocketry is still not available in there.  And when I looked at the list of possible engines in the VAB the most powerful SRBs and 5 metre engines were not there.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Spoiler\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![f04abd58f692124fbfffc053cb8e7bc9.png](https://i.gyazo.com/f04abd58f692124fbfffc053cb8e7bc9.png)\n\u003E \n\nEDIT and it also looks like someone else had the same problem but they received no replies.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-07T18:40:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2016 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tommy59375**"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T18:59:41Z","Content":"yes it does, which is why I\u0027m confused.

(or I could ;p )\n\nAnyway here is my KW community fixes.  I made a modification to the original KW by adding the original (non procedural) fairings from the \u0027FAR Compatible fairings\u0027 folder, but the 5m engines were not there before or after I did this so it probably does not have an affect.  I did not make any modification to the KW community fixes to my knowledge.\n\n**[link removed - it\u0027s the same as you would find in the download on the first page]**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-07T19:58:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2016 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tommy59375**\n  \nremoved link"}]}
