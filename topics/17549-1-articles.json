As my first project I decided to launch a space station capable of docking (crudely). It uses landing legs to hitch on to a piece of the satellite (I hope, I haven\u0027t actually tested this in 0.16). In my next video I will (hopefully) rendezvous with the satellite and show off (hopefully) legit docking in ksp. I hope you would be kind enough to check out my video and if you like it subscribe or like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy channel: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/spunky244224?feature=watch\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/spunky244224?feature=watch\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/UgVTBFgypHk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Da_Dumples","CreatedById":32594,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T22:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty cool.
