From creating engine diversity to changing the power curve of solar panels. There are also included a couple of hacks to, for example, add RCS to the mk1-2 pod and lifetime to RTGs. New parts are created by modifying the stock ones too, to provide more options and to fill gaps that the stock parts leave open (Probe-sized rcs parts). The problem with physicsless parts is also dealt with for parts where it doesn\u0027t make sense (like the size 3 decoupler).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is good to note uncountable times that this is a work in progress and there are a lot of things missing, but I\u0027ve been working on this for a while and I really like the results, so I might as well share it with you guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChanges in this CFG\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2Massive engine rebalance, based on giving each engine a role (upper, middle and lower stage engines), every engine has been touched in a way or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2Probe-sized RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2RCS for MK1-2Pod thanks to some dirty hacks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2Huge reduction in reaction wheel torque\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2New 1.25m nose cone based on the 2.5m one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2Part mass/impact tolerance rebalance, now most things break when they should, this still needs a lot of work (lots of parts left untouched)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2Removed physics-less attribute on some parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2RTG lifetime, based on a new resource (that -probably- doesn\u0027t conflict with anything, check comments in file)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe file is also filled with comments for your convenience.
