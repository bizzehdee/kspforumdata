I saw a river and some mountains near the poles, all where they should be. The only planet-editing mod I have is Outer Planets Mod, But I can provide a mod list if needed. Anyone know what might be causing this? Also, it still has Mun topography, like it\u0027s craters. Sadly, I have no idea if this kind of stuff is stored in the logs or even if it\u0027s able to be reproduced. Thanks for reading."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T02:24:58Z","Content":"It\u0027s a Kopernicus issue."},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T02:33:51Z","Content":"Thanks.
