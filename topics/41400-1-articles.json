Just this morning I had launched the space station core and docked on of the space station arms to it, after that I exited the game as normal, then this afternoon when I came back to the game to I launch the 2nd space station arm and when I went to select my space station as a target in map view it was not there. I left the arm in orbit and exited to the space center to see if it was a glitch and if I could find my space station in the tracking station but it was not there either. I also discovered I\u0027ve also lost a satellite that was orbiting Kerbin, and another satellite that was in orbit around the Mun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really quite annoyed by this as I had completed my first successful docking unaided by MechJeb, and I was rather proud of the accomplishment. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn one else experience anything like this?
