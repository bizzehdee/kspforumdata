The Zoology Bay provides two functions. First, it directly generates a small amount of Science per day, but only so long as the animals are fed with Kibbal, a new resource. The Science generation gets scaled by location according to the same multipliers as normal experiments, and decays over time in much the same way as well. The total amount of Science you can get from a given location tends asymptotically towards 1000 times the initial per-day rate. The Zoology Bay can also produce \u0022Bioproducts\u0022 as the animals consume Kibbal at a higher rate. These Bioproducts act much like Eurekas and Kuarqs towards completing the new experiments.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Storage tanks for Kibbal, in 2m and 1m scale.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E A \u0022safety\u0022 for transmitters.

Just less contrast. I always thought Fusty got the labels just right with his FusTek parts. From a distance, you barely noticed the labels, but a bit of zoom and you could read it just fine.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give it a shot, but my concern would be usability. It would be a pain to have to zoom in to pick which experiment to click on if you have multiple different types all at once. The FusTek parts don\u0027t have a function other than looking nice, so subtle type indicators are fine for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
