As Keldaria said, new users go through a period of time where your posts need to be approved by a moderator (to ensure you aren\u0027t a robot). And the posts above I think were meant to be lighthearted at the fact that your original post wasn\u0027t showing. So I\u0027m sorry if you took offense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not actually a new user posting a new thread that causes this confusion (as Keldaria explained). When a new user posts a new thread, the thread is hidden until approved by a moderator, so nobody else sees anything weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat actually happened in here is that you made a post, which was approved, then made an edit to your post. Because you edited it, your post went back into the queue but the thread was still visible. When it happens that way, the thread is seen by others, but they can\u0027t see the post. That\u0027s what all the confusion is about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon your posts won\u0027t go in the queue anymore, and this sort of confusion won\u0027t happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, your rover looks pretty cool.
