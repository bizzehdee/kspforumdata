Accept short burn times and the need for dropping empty rocket stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWant long rocket burns? Accept extremely low thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWant both high thrust and long rocket burn time? Accept high heat loads that will melt your rocket engine, or require so much coolant mass as to negate the benefits of having both high thrust/long burn time. More mass usually means\u00A0less burn time. Or just use antimatter, which could provide enough thrust and long burns... but also could wipe out a small nation or state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProject Orion essentially does high thrust in short pulses of time, over and over again. It also has long burn time, due to having a lot of high thrust to weight ratio pulse units (small nukes or perhaps antimatter bombs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is only one scenario where in my opinion rocketry could rival a pusher plate, and even then, a modified pusher plate design could beat it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn antimatter thermal rocket: The heat would be extreme, which is why only small amounts of antimatter could be mixed with propellant, limiting a vessel\u0027s thrust potential.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn antimatter bomb pusher plate could have higher thrust as it it\u0027s reaction happens outside the vessel and does not have to be contained. So more antimatter bomb thrust, leading to some surprisingly hefty yet\u00A0speedy large vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only potential advantage I can see with rocketry and antimatter is that antimatter is not picky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you ran out of ALL your chemical propellant you could feed the crew\u0027s waste products in as propellant to the antimatter rocket and it would still give good thrust and long burn time. You could even grind up parts of the ship and use it as propellant. Antimatter does not care. Cannibalize the ship. You can even feed unfortunate or dead crew members as propellant for your antimatter rocket. Since it is all fuel to the rocket. Antimatter is what provides the kick and the the endurance of the rocket, less so the propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith pusher plate propulsion this would be a lot harder to do, as all your fuel comes pre-packaged as pulse bomb units. So when you run out of fuel with a pusher plate, you\u0027re done for unless somebody is helping you\u00A0refuel with more pulse units.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour thoughts on pusher plates propulsion vs rocketry?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid I miss anything?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-17T04:41:00Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2019 04:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERival\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-17T04:51:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s still rocketry, the propellant and its energy originate from the vehicle.
