Russia however did not have that limitation and was able to have a slightly wider wingspan. This is why they could fly it with turbofans. It did not fly like a brick as much as the NASA one did. The eventual goal was to have turbo fans on the Buran so it could transport itself to any runway in the world. It could ultimately act like a plane if it wanted too. Another amazing victory of Russian engineering.\n\n![ok-gli2.jpg](http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/spacecraft/buran/ok-gli2.jpg)\n\nThe NASA shuttle could not obtain lift off from a runway which is why its areo test was done on the back of a 747.\n\n![AA5004_Buran_OK-92_real_2.jpg](http://www.anigrand.com/images/items/AA5004_Buran_OK-92/AA5004_Buran_OK-92_real_2.jpg)\n\nAlso this was a concept art of the final design of the intagrated turbofan engines"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyMeToTheMinmus","CreatedById":133119,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T22:21:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As the NASA shuttle flew like a brick it was because the wing span was narrowed so it could fit in the former Saturn V VAB (Thanks Nixon).\n\nI was under the impression that the shuttle wingspan was actually wider than NASA originally wanted because the the Air Force wanted it to have a large cross-range capability?"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T23:15:56Z","Content":"From what I can tell the Buran\u0027s wingspan was only about 13 cm wider than the Space Shuttle\n\nBuran: 23.92 m\n\nSpace Shuttle: 23.79 m"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T23:37:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://images.vfl.ru/ii/1435258307/cdd24aac/9124810_m.png](http://images.vfl.ru/ii/1435258307/cdd24aac/9124810_m.png)\n\u003E I do not know why he (Polis) is needed, it may make it a great upper stage?\n\nThe Polyus was an orbital weapon, although it did not work in real life, hope that answers your question."},{"CreatedByName":"daedaelus","CreatedById":113484,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T22:19:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I was under the impression that the shuttle wingspan was actually wider than NASA originally wanted because the the Air Force wanted it to have a large cross-range capability?\n\nThats what they wanted but Nixon did not want to front the cost for a wider VAB so they settled for less due to cost. The Shuttle VAB is the same building that launched the apollo\u0027s it was just modified but the width of the building did not change. The reason for the shuttle program was to cut costs as a reusable ship (it dident turn out that way) but the NASA shuttle was limited on its wingspan.
