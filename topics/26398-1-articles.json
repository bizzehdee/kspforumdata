Most importantly the space helmet. I\u0027d imagine making one myself would be pretty hard, though possible if only I could somehow find a massive round vase/fishbowl or a partial sphere peice of glass or plastic. I\u0027ve also looked for premade ones online, haven\u0027t had much luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the suit I\u0027ve looked up costumes, found a lot of flightsuits (I\u0027d imagine future spacesuits would be less bulky and more like flightsuits), NASA ones and generic non-spacey ones. I\u0027m not ridiculously fussed about details, I just want the general look. They\u0027re usually at least $70 with postage though.

I think I\u0027m looking for something a bit more familiar than that, though I might use one or two of those techniques. The helmet looked a bit funny but I do like the idea of using bike helmets for the general shape, that could work.

If it\u0027s what I think it is, delivering oxygen, why do they need to be on the front? I would have thought they could be more compact and just attatched at the back. Generally speaking I\u0027d want to go for something generally form fitting but not skintight, like the gemini suit. I\u0027ll probably add some detailing, maybe some extra satchels for storage and a harness like thing for attatching to the whatever you hook onto if you need to be tethered, and a device on the wrist for general data monitoring and communications with a screen and a set of buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe helmet is currently the thing I\u0027m most unsure about how to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: And it\u0027s going to be orange because orange is a nice suit colour and I found a good cotton orange coverall.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-14T09:48:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2013 09:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbface\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
