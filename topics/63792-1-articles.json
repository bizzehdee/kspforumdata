Even when welding them together using the weld plugin I still have some issues and short of welding the entire ship I cannot see that as a solution. Is it possible that the IS parts are enabling collisions within the ship for themselves, without a plugin required for that?

Definitely does seem that two parts in particular are causing issues (2.5m AM Reactor and the Warp Drive 2.5m), I\u0027m going to duplicate them and strip the cfg to see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: None, duped parts with stripped cfg\u0027s still have the same issue, it must be intrinsic to the mesh itself...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd Edit: After stripping cfgs seems it now works... not sure why there were issues... but it works.
