It seems to already work well for the configs, feel free to also dive into the code and add (or fix) things you are missing. There are surely enough known bugs and ideas. Just keep in mind that TweakScale is used in different ways and no one should force his playstyle over everyone else.\n\n[@eberkain](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157548-eberkain/) [@Mikeloeven](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175283-mikeloeven/) there is a merge conflict for the NFT configs, and you both reordered that file, so I see no simple way of merging [this pull request](https://github.com/pellinor0/TweakScale/pull/71).
