I had gotten my ships to within about 500m apart, which was still outside the range at which I could select it in ship view. Even though I could see the square node indicating where the ship was, I couldn\u2019t highlight or select it.\u00A0I was well outside the range where the mouse could select individual parts, they didn\u0027t even highlight to give me the choice. And 500m was way too close to be able to select the craft in map view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOptimally clicking the indicator node in ship view would give me the option to select the craft as a target, and even more optimally give me an option to open up the parts manager for the distant ship, and thus allow me to scroll through and select the part I want as my target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally it would be nice if right clicking on ships in the map view could do the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally there may be a bug with selecting targets as 1 out of 3 times when I clicked select as target on the docking port, nothing appeared to happen? That could have just been user error on my part though.

I think it\u0027s worth repeating here. When 2 or more ships are nearby, then in the map mode it is unrealistic to select the vehicle you need as a target. Icons overlap each other. We need a drop-down list that will list all spacecrafts within a radius of, say... 10 km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VbHMURdmoL0?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Bug #14 - Unable to select desired spacecraft (18.03.2023)\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-20T19:58:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2023 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Breuss\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
