And I\\\u0027ve been making quite a bit of use of the BigTrak mod for the Cart Plugin. With a concealed Mk. 1 Pod inside, it\\\u0027s very stable. With the PuddleJumper fuel tank, SAS Modulle, it\\\u0027s ridiculously stable. You can easily floor the pedal for long periods of time and trust in the SAS to keep you upright.\n\nSo, in the trailing days of V0.14.4... I figured I might as well circumnavigate the Mun.\n\n[![e56Awl.png](http://i.imgur.com/e56Awl.png)](http://imgur.com/e56Aw)\n\nFirst issue was getting it there.

As a result, I wouldn\\\u0027t recommend doing it on a new moon. There\\\u0027d been a reasonable amount of stuff on my Mun, and what I wound up doing was planting stations every sixty degrees, and miscellaneous objects halfway between each of those.\n\nThis ultimately meant that there was usually an indicator dot visible ahead that I could point at to keep bearing, and the various satellites whizzing overhead kept me moderately entertained So let\\\u0027s take the tour.\n\nGWraught (120 E) was just a spacecraft I had in orbit.

To be honest, the whole Larsen Base Disaster storyline was a complete accident. I spent hours trying to land that thing on the Mun, and only today did I realize that the reason Mechjeb kept having an extremely low-altitude freakout was because I\\\u0027d been forced to add the eight outrigger thrusters individually, and as a result, they were as symmetrical as I could make them, but not Symmetrical Enough. After a particularly picturesque smashdown, I decided to go with it.\n\nA descendant of the Larsen Base design is now Ice Station Minmus, which came down smooth on a single liquid rocket. Though without the nuclear reactor, it probably needs solar cells more than radiator sails.\n\n\u003E [![fSt6Il.png](http://i.imgur.com/fSt6Il.png)](http://imgur.com/fSt6I)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wyrm","CreatedById":25210,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T22:59:14Z","Content":"Now you just need to drive back to the KSC! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
