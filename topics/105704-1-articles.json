The two you mentioned will definitely help you do that so get those. Also another two would be Ferram Aerospace Research and Deadly Reentry. The former gives you realistic aerodynamics and the latter gives a much better (and dangerous) heat model for you to cope with on return. \n\nThe craft you build with this are more realistic than those you can get away with in the stock game. The chances of you getting tgem in future if you stick with KSP are very high so I recommend starting now! \n\nThing is, both haven\u0027t been completed yet for 1.0,i expect they\u0027ll be out in under a week, so for the time being I recommend monitoring Engineer and copying the examples the Mechjeb gives you and you\u0027ll have a great starting place. \n\nFor Kolonization then check out all of Roverdude\u0027s packs, they are excellent but make sure you\u0027ve learnt the basics first as the difficulty does scale with each mod you use. \n\nGood luck and fly safe! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:21:26Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums! Given that the update just dropped, you may need to wait a little while for all the best mods to be updated. Engineer is a very good addon, invaluable for tweaking your stages so you get the maximum performance out of them.\n\nRyds, given that 1.0 now has both of those mods more or less made stock, I don\u0027t feel they\u0027re really all that necessary anymore. Of course, if you feel like the new stock aero or reentry system is not realistic/fun enough for you, TrackDayKC, by all means install them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T18:23:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 06:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CalculusWarrior**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:22:09Z","Content":"Get Kerbal Engineer, about the only thing you need to complete the stock experience right now.
