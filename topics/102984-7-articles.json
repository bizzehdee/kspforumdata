The weird part is, the rolling too often ends to occur physically, so I end up falling from the bed - but in the dream it feels that it comes about by it\u0027s own, not from myself. Sometimes I realize that I run out of bed (usually thanks to the hand dangling over the edge - how did I do them in sleep ?) and it\u0027s even more startling - I\u0027d wake up very startled and scared (the other one got me hurt, if I didn\u0027t physically fell I only felt scared). Other days it could be nothing (which at one point I enjoyed thanks to the occurence rate of that falling-rolling dream). Nowadays it\u0027s more about dreaming something I saw (or think about) in the day. That falling still occurs a bit though - some position makes it feels like you\u0027re weightless and it\u0027d startle me.\n\nMaybe unconsciously I discovered the way NASA made those sleep-position induced zero-g ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-17T17:16:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2017 05:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by YNM**"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-25T07:11:04Z","Content":"A long time ago i dreamt that i went to Istanbul.\n\nYesterday i went to Istanbul in Google Earth and it looks exactly like in the dream."},{"CreatedByName":"ProtoJeb21","CreatedById":153551,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-26T00:17:07Z","Content":"Has anyone ever had a dream about getting murdered by racist waterfowl?
