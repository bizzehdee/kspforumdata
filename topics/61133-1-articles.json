All engines should be firing at once, or else you have way too many engines and should throw the non-firing ones away. That is, of course, unless your engines are not meant for this part of the launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust is another issue however.

So if you don\u0027t need the extra thrust, don\u0027t put them on. If you already have them on your ship, burning more engines does not decrease your efficiency because you are changing velocity (DV) faster, and with more thrust, and consuming fuel at the same rate per engine. You essentially are just changing velocity faster, where the only loss is the extra weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T20:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore engines means more TWR (thrust to weight ratio).

If you have small maneuvers you want to perform then sometimes reducing the number of engines firing can help keep you from overshooting your target, thereby reducing the need to correct. Also, if you\u0027re carrying an inefficient engine for some other stage of your journey, then ISP is a consideration. However, if you\u0027re simply not firing them because you think it\u0027s more efficient, then I would agree that you\u0027re better off leaving them behind.
