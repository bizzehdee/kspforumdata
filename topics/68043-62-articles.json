Having a radiator wedge would be a little more complex as you have to pipe the heat to it from wherever, which is not really well modeled in the game. You can set the thermal conductivity of a part, but there\u0027s no way (currently) to build a heat pipe to get heat directly to the radiator.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible kludge solution: have an alternate core part with extremely high conductivity, and call it a \u0022quad/hex/octocore with heat pump\u0022 or something along those lines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, because I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve said it before: love the mod, consider it absolutely essential.
