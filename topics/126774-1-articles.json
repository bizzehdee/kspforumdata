Typically in a Career (Normal difficulty, no custom changes, including keeping reentry heat at 100%)\u00A0I find myself at about the fourth\u00A0tech tier completely researched or close to (I usually hold off\u00A0on Aviation), with few contracts left that make enough money to really get ahead of the costs of missions. I end up having to farm the contracts that ask you to test some part on the launchpad or in atmosphere that generate, surprisingly, much more money than I would think them worth (i.e., test a parachute at 120-240m per second between 3,000 and 11,000 meters, and be rewarded around 20,000 cash for a mission that cost about 1,000 with 100% recovery). Thing is, you don\u0027t always get those contracts, and to make room for those kind of contracts\u00A0I sometimes have to decline ones that want me to do something either beyond my technical capabilities at the time or beyond my personal capability with KSP in general (for instance, I still have to learn how to precisely match orbits, so I\u0027m not comfortable accepting a Rescue mission and run the risk of failing it, for one example).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been gaming the system. For instance, after getting the Stayputnik, I typically strap it on to a cheap small liquid tank with the LV-909, attach that to cheap basic solid rockets (the cheap early tall ones, BACC I think), and blast it off out of Kerbin\u0027s SoI, and have it get captured by Kerbol. It does nothing on its own; there\u0027s no science on it, no extra power, no way to generate power. It\u0027s just a derelict mass captured by a star. BUT, entering Kerbol\u0027s SoI counts as both a Flyby World Achievement and \u0022We Have Enter Orbit Around the Sun\u0022 Achievement in one cheap mission, and each Achievement generates about 30,000 cash, so it\u0027s over 60,000 right there. But it only counts once.
