They\u0027re just decorations now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest that darkness be dark. Pitch black. I make ships with cargo holds and when a kerbal is inside, I can still see fine, even though there are no lights in the cargo hold... Perhaps make it an options? Or a slider to adjust how dark is dark? I think it would add a great challenge to the game because you would really have to spend more time with the placement of lights on ships, not only to light itself up for IVA work, but to light up other ships that you\u0027re approaching to dock with. At this point, it\u0027s just not dark enough imo... If you\u0027re in the shadow of a planet, you shouldn\u0027t be able to make out anything except maybe a silhouette on a bright background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame goes with night time on a planet or moon, it needs to be much darker... I know I could turn the brightness down on my monitor, but that\u0027s not a solution for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T05:36:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, that is very much a function of the brightness of your monitor. You can turn it up enough that you\u0027d see even in pitch black.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, with all the stars around, there is very rarely any \u0022pitch black\u0022 in space. Factor in the moon, the scatter lighting from any nearby atmospheres, and you always have some ambient lighting going on. Not enough to see details most of the time -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4152380/Screenshots/screenshot559.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot559.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- but enough to at least make out the shape of what you\u0027re supposed to be seeing.

You might be surprised to know that the ancient Romans could easily march and even read a book just by the light of the Milky Way in the sky at night. You\u0027d have to be deep into intergalactic space for it to be anywhere near pitch black. Once your eyes have adjusted they are very sensitive to any light at all.

Gee, that\u0027s a very nice... silhouette... you have there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest getting a proper monitor test image that includes a gamma test, and adjusting your monitor brightness accordingly. I know you\u0027ve mentioned \u0022not a solution\u0022 but really, most monitors are not intended to be run at full brightness/contrast. There are also driver utilities depending on your graphics card that can produce a more finely tuned result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne monitor test image, just to make things a bit easier. You\u0027ll be wanting to look at the white-to-dark-grey gamma test blocks.
