Idea is to parachute onto Eve or Laythe and launch back up, OR power down on airless moon and parachute back on Kermin. So basically capsule, fuel tank, engine, gear, parachute. But the engine and chute will fire simultaneously unless I do something, and nothing I\u0027ve tried has worked so now I\u0027m out of ideas. Here\u0027s what I already know doesn\u0027t work:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I tried creating a new \u0022artificial\u0022 (as in no separator) stage and dragged 1 or the other into it depending on which I want to use first. This artificial stage looks good in the VAB and in flight, showing engine and chute separate. However, the game actually ignores it when I go to use it, so both engine and chute still fire simultaneously anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I tried adding separator with chute on top to create \u0022real\u0022 stage. While this keeps the firing separate, it means I can\u0027t use the chutes first which defeats the purpose. Worse, the separator fails when the chute fully opens, causing the rest of the lander to plummet to destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I tried putting the chutes in an action group but they still fire with the engine so this made no difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T16:42:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enote the small \u002B and - buttons at the margin of the staging column.
