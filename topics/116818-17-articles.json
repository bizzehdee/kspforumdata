Having begun modding with no experience of C# nor Unity, finding solutions to an undocumented change takes a long, and frequently, unnecessary amount of time for a trivial change to an already messily coded game. \n\n- Thirdly, my own interest in KSP has vanished, having played through my own historic missions to the early space shuttle age using every realistic detail, including this mod (in its last stable version), only to have the game slowly crawl through at a few fps,where a simple quick save takes almost a minute due to the ridiculously slow config file parsing built into the game even though the save file is smaller than the texture file for the orbital decay toolbar icon. With no sign of modernisation, (a touch of \u0022we don\u0027t care now it\u0027s out of Alpha/Beta\u0022), KSP for me has stopped being the game I started playing almost five years ago. This game is barely built for saving and loading, how can it possibly handle N-Body perturbation and still run any other mod?\n\nHence I decided no more, for the past many months I decided I would make my own unity game, built for 2017/18 and not for 2011 as KSP is.\n\nTherefore I will be taking requests for someone to take over this mod, please send me a message and I can arrange this. \n\nThis would also apply to my Historic Missions had I not discovered that the developers have already bulldozed over the work I put into the pack without a single comment, just a making history expansion with no mention of the community engagement in space history my mod produced - the reason the devs have made the expansion in the first place. I would have thought that over 50000 downloads of historic missions would have deserved a footnote in squads expansion - but as I along with many modders have known : the developers do not care about the modding community, the one thing that\u0027s stopped this incredibly limited stock game from being forgotten long ago. \n\nThank you all for your support and help over the last three years, I hope you can appreciate my reasoning and understand my frustration.  \n\nKindest regards to all, \n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-10T02:31:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Whitecat106 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Updating the mod for new versions of KSP; I am sick and tired of having to rebuild an element of the mod every time KSP updates, with no useful update log from the developers; which pretty much caused the death of my boat navigation mod with 1.0.3.
