Make sure to be methodical about how you do it, because any place you miss will be a spot where the wing can flex. It probably won\u0027t cause the wing to rip apart, but that flexing can affect the flight characteristics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VBlackshadow","CreatedById":83540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T14:11:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESlightly easier to run struts from the fuselage out to the ends of each piece, rather than trying to run them from one wing piece to the next.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
