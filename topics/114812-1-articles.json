He made this list, which instantly rockets him up to the top of the list. Because I say so.

He\u0027s on Mad Rocket Scientist\u0027s friend list, so he deserves a passing mention, right after 45nd unit 34th gaffer CGI department secretary to 5th assistant shader. Being a mod sounds like a hard job, so kudos to him for that. Claims that he was the first to use this feature, if anyone can prove that, nothing could change.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003En)Kenbobo. Do I know him? He\u0027s the PS4 hypetrain driver. He likes Space oddity, and Star Trek, so he gets some mention. He started the 1.0 hypetrain, so like, \u003Cem\u003Ewhatever\u003C/em\u003E.

I was actually able to type his username without looking, so that means that he\u0027s helped lots on the American rockets project, which, since it was started by me, means that he gets some of the awesomeness that\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E rubbed off of ME!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003En)\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EThe Laythe Initiative.\u003C/span\u003EDres.

He builds interesting craft, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003En)Fel. He does... something. And he does it well. If I figure out what he does, I\u0027ll tell you. Pretty sure I\u0027ve never seen him before, so this spot at the bottom of the list is only a bit to high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003En)sal_vager. He\u0027s a moderator, he has a awesome avatar, and he... fights fires. Virtual fires. If you see any virtual fires, tell him. He doesn\u0027t have a profile pic, so he obviously deserves the nth spot on this list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003En)Columbia. He has a Space Shuttle as an avatar, which clearly indicates that he prefers cheap American engineering over quality Russian engineering. He\u0027s on Mad Rocket Scientist\u0027s friend list, though, so he has that much going for him.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003En)Starwhip. He is clearly extremely cruel to stars and should be abolished from this list. *Sniff* Those poor, maltreated, stars.

Has 24 posts, doesn\u0027t care where he is, and agrees with the majority of living humans that twitter is a is a website on the internet. Clearly grounds for expulsion from this list, except he likes trains, and so does Mad Rocket Scientist.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003En)RAINCRAFTER.

Also, clearly deserving of this nth spot on the list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003En)Overfloater. You didn\u0027t think I could find you, did you? He says he floats over, but if anyone would take the time to explain to him that that\u0027s not possible without a hot air balloon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003En)regex. According to someone else\u0027s sig (the only real to get info) he has as many infractions as a troll!

He typed his normal password into the username box, he once impersonated squad, and once made the forums explode with a alter ego with negative rep. Clearly not worthy of the most awesome white bar group, but he\u0027s given me rep twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003En)Kozak. Used to be called \u0022Waffle Master\u0022, and he used to master waffles, so, if you\u0027re a waffle: Panic, and run, not walk, to the nearest exit/airlock/egress point, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003En)LavaCake.
