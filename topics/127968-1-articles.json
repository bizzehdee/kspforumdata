Only caps-lock simply isn\u0027t recognised on my install (1.0.5 on MacOS) so I had to reassign the key (made it keypad multiplication instead). And it appears to apply thrust on a sliding scale that takes your CoM into account. I\u0027ve just been playing around with it and it does make docking a lot less painful if the RCS isn\u0027t really set up to deal with your CoM. I didn\u0027t try without SAS on a wildly off-balance ship, but on a reasonably-but-not-perfectly balanced ship it let me leave SAS off altogether and avoid all the constant corrections after each move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCredit to Snark who pointed this out in another thread recently.

There\u0027ve been a few notable exceptions, which required me to use the Surface mode and dial in a particular pitch, yaw, and roll setting that had been determined in the design of the station, but it worked splendidly: The ship stays rock solid as I move in with the RCS, and I\u0027m not slewing about wildly trying to align with the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotable exception to this rule: Debris removal.
