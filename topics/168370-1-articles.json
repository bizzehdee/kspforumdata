Have you tried to right-click a control point and select [control from here]? There is a AGU(klaw) in the vessel?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-10T20:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found this one confusing as well. Sounds like 2 different issues. Not sure about not being able to transfer crew, but quite often I get the issue where I can\u0027t change my target. This happens when my focus is on a planet or moon. Just hit Backspace to change focus back to your ship. You should then be able to change targets. Perhaps if you can clarify the crew problem, someone will be able to help you with it. In fact I\u0027m sure of it. Somebody always knows. You just have to explain it properly. And screenshots always help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
