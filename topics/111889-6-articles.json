And regrettably I don\u0027t have video. I will attempt to describe the funny in text form.\n\nI had a Kerbal transferring in orbit from a large space craft to a station that was about 750m away. I had fired RCS on the maneuvering pack to intercept the station. Now, a friend of mine and I start talking, and the next thing I know, I hear a \\*THUD\\* (Thank you so much Collision FX ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ) and look up. My Kerbal slammed into the station and the impact was apparently 100% on his face/helmet. So what I saw was the poor little guy tumbling end over end (VERY rapidly ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ) like a football headed for the uprights. It took me a good while to stop laughing and recover the Kerbal ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T11:04:36Z","Content":"![screenshot202.png](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wg5zUovZ2kI/VYP3B4zWVRI/AAAAAAAABc4/qCEHQaqy1kA/s800/screenshot202.png)\n\n\u0022Pardon me, captain; do you have a few minutes to talk about our lord and savior MOAR BOOSTERZ?\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Zzabur","CreatedById":94190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T11:12:17Z","Content":"![7A331FAA206AB45B569514D9499470B3BFD27433](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34122502847463004/7A331FAA206AB45B569514D9499470B3BFD27433/)\n\nIs someone missiong in the vessel?"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T12:07:56Z","Content":"Don\u0027t play on the stairs!\n\n![screenshot30.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20576590/KSP/Funny/screenshot30.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T12:09:45Z","Content":"one from me\n\n![LAdqihg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LAdqihg.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T14:28:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Just some screenshots from, ahem, \u0027testing\u0027 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.
