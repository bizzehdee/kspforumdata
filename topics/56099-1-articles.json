Unfortunately, his ship didn\u0027t end up having enough fuel to take him back to Kerbin (or even get into orbit, for that matter). To solve this, I\u0027ve sent a rescue probe (which may or may not also not have enough to get back \u0026gt;_\u0026gt;) to dock with Jeb\u0027s craft. Here\u0027s the problem: I don\u0027t know how I should set my attitude to meet the rescue ship. The poles are weird and what looks like burning North ends up flipping around and being a seemingly arbitrary direction. I\u0027m having a hard time aligning it with the rescue ship\u0027s (also polar) orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just occurred to me that a polar orbit isn\u0027t like an equatorial orbit in the sense that there can be only ONE place where an equatorial orbit lies (directly over the equator), but a polar orbit is simply an orbit that passes over both poles. There\u0027s no \u0022equator\u0022 that I can align myself with, so while both ships could be in what\u0027s called a polar orbit, they\u0027ll end up coming in at different directions over the pole. How can I get around this? It really doesn\u0027t help that the lander only has enough fuel to get about 1/16th of the way into an orbit. I\u0027ll have to slow down the rescue probe and quickly dock before speeding back into a stable orbit again. This will be very difficult, and it doesn\u0027t help that I\u0027m terrible at docking two ships anyway. Halp?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Figured it out. I can select the rescue ship as a target and simply burn along that vector to get in the same orbit.
