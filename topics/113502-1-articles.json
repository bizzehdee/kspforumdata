A conventional combustion chamber is simple by comparison - it just needs to be a heat-resistant, pressure-resistant approximately spherical chamber with opening for combustants coming in and for exhaust going out to the nozzle. Rearranging all that to create nearly flat jets of exhaust that the aerospikes need is very tricky. Some designs have had many tiny combustion chambers each leading to a small, flat nozzle that directs the exhaust over a segment of the aerospike, or they have required large, heavy, complex manifolds to do the job. Either way, the engines are large, heavy, expensive and inefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T19:05:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022softweir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022softweir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe actual \u0022nozzle\u0022 part, yes, that\u0027s not excessively difficult, though making it strong enough and light enough has proved tricky.
