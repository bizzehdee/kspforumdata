However most needed (IMO and for RSS) is some control for the fall off \u0027range\u0027 of the atmosphere haze; on RSS with the right overall-visibility, it\u0027s completely opaque then suddenly starts fading in an obvious band in the sky. Ideally a value for fallOffScale so this fade can be made to stretch the whole way from horizon to directly above could be implemented (even if that meant just including it as an optional variable with the default value in place for simple use?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Proot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Proot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t truly get what\u0027s the difference between the alpha channel and the visibility in the atmo, could you explain me that?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is literally no difference between alpha and visibility, I\u0027ve tried increasing one by 1000-fold and conversely decrease the other by that much only to find absolutely no change in how it looks i.e. they do the same thing currently.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-15T02:34:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2014 02:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by pingopete\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chezburgar7300","CreatedById":114873,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T21:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having some weird issues with this and my cloud layers.
