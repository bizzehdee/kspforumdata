There easily the best looking engines I have, but they are the worst performing.\n\u003E \n\nThe engines are balanced for where they would sit on the ISP curve if the \u0027real world\u0027 ISP curve were normalized onto the \u0027KSP\u0027 ISP curve, using their SL-VAC ratio.  Hence the worst performing real-world engine will become the worst-performing KSP engine, for any given statistic.\n\nFor example; the F1.  Real world it has an ISP of 265-310, giving it a vac-ratio of 0.85.   KSP has vacuum ISP values between 290 and 350.  Real world vacuum ISP ranges from 290-450.  Real-world F1 has vacuum ISP of ~310 (sits at 0.125 on the \u0027curve line\u0027 between min and max).  Map that onto the 0.125 point between KSP min and max, you get the KSP vaccum ISP of 302.  Apply the SL/VAC ratio to determine the sea-level ISP of ~254.\n\nThrust has been scaled for KLOX engines to (0.64 \\* 0.64)% of the thrust (direct squared-linear scaling).  HLOX engines get an additonal \u0027bonus\u0027 fudge factor to thrust to compensate for lack of LH2 fuel/tanks in stock KSP.  After thrust is determined, I apply the real-world engines TWR to determine \u0027real-world scaled\u0027 mass, and them multiply that by 4 to get the \u0027KSP heavy-as-freaking-bricks\u0027 engine mass and TWR.\n\nAll of this ensures that the engines I\u0027m creating certainly won\u0027t be \u0027better\u0027 than the stock engines by any noticeable margin (not on ISP at least), keeps the TWR ranges within those of stock engines, and keeps all of the real-world inspired engines balanced relative to each-other.\n\nReally, there is not much wiggle room in the balancing without breaking the real-world-relative balancing of these engines, or without making them just \u0027too good\u0027.  Overall I\u0027m fairly happy with the general balance of them, though there are a few that could perhaps use some hand-tweaked thrust increases (mostly because stuff in KSP is -heavy- compared to real life).  Mostly the thrust-increase will apply to smaller engines; as \u0027small\u0027 stuff in KSP is much heaver than the equivalent scaled real-world loads would have been.  So I might be implementing a general thrust-bonus-curve that weights the bonus more towards the lower-end engines (think 2-3x thrust for the smallest, 1x thrust for the largest, mostly linear interpolation inbetween).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Which engines?  And what are you comparing them to?  The SSTU engines are probably a lot more specialized than stock engines (i.e. first stage engines won\u0027t perform well in a vacuum), but the Isp values are well within the range of stock engines.\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, VenomousRequiem said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E All of the engine are balanced something like 64% of the real engines, so any balancing problems are probably because of the IRL variants. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe you\u0027re talking about the F1? It has a pretty low ISP in both atmosphere and vacuum, but only because it\u0027s optimized for thrust!\n\u003E \n\nIndeed, exactly as it was intended to ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022).  Lifter engines are for -lifting things-, and generally have terrible efficiency (F1/F1B).  Second stage / sustainer engines have higher ISP and lower thrust, and are not intended to be used for lifting purposes (and generally -can\u0027t- due to their poor SL-thrust) (RL10, J2).  A -few- full-range engines exist that try to balance thrust and efficiency; again these stats are based on the stats of the real-world engines that do this (RS-25, RS-68).\n\nA good point of note regarding the currently available engines -- not all of them have been developed yet, so there exist some pretty large gaps in engine coverage.  I do intend on having several smaller lifter engines (Merlins, H1/S3), as well as a few larger upper-stage engines (J2-X, RL60).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Randazzo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I both love those engines and hate those engines.

The F1 clusters are some of the most powerful I have seen in the game, on my test rig I literally destroy the platform when I fire them up to 100% and the struts begin to wobble. Like Mage says, there are some holes in the line-up, I have brought that up as well in the past, but there are a lot of engines planned for future releases. The J2 seems like a good in-between, but it\u0027s very low atmospheric thrust means there is a hole between the low end and the RS25/F1/Clusters. Just add moar boosters (or clusters) in the meantime.\n\nbtw: last version for real-plumes with the SRBs added now. I will keep finetuning while launching... and maybe bribe Jose to help with the clusters.   \u003Cu\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://dasher.nl/kerbal/SSTU_RealPlume.rar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edownload\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-21T20:45:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2015 08:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-21T20:43:54Z","Content":"Wow great breakdown shadowmage, thank you.
