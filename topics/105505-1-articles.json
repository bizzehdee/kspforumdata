Try to put only one up front. I\u0027m also going to make a wild guess that you put the rear landing gear under the side fuel tanks. Sometimes this causes flexing, especially when you try to pitch up. The elevons on the back actually cause a downforce on the landing gear and make the fuselage bend.\n\nTry adding some struts, putting on some canards, or moving the rear landing gear closer to the CoM.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"MGCJerry","CreatedById":95202,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:29:49Z","Content":"Thanks for the reply Claw.

If the landing gear is highly splayed, however, downforce from trying to rotate for liftoff may force them down more, with no guarantee of even distortion - and there\u0027s your veering. \n\nPotential fix - set your gear vertically, rather than splayed, and use the offset tool to arrange the ground tilt to where it was previously. \n\nWhat I\u0027ve done in the past for this, when my wing layout was such that my elevator didn\u0027t have the required rotation lever *(either squashing down smacking the back end into the runway, or unable to rotate at all)* is to add some front control canards. Ahead of the CoG, so that rotating upwards uses upwards rather than downwards force on the canards, and far enough forward to have a reasonable lever arm around the CoG.\n\n**EDIT:** Yes, when you pitch upwards with a rear control surface, there\u0027s an initial downforce in the rotation, followed *(hopefully)* by increased upforce as your wing angle of attack increases.
