Disqualifying procedurally generated games is simply removing games that bypass this limitation. Beyond that, few game worlds today are created and shaped entirely by hand, with many developers using a procedural system even if it isn\u0027t built directly into the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it is a silly question to begin with. It\u0027s all relative. The only constant is time, in particular the time it takes to navigate the game universe. Whether it\u0027s walking, driving, flying or teleporting the size of the world is only truly measured by how quickly you can move across it, and every game world is made smaller by anything that decreases the time factor. If you limit yourself to 1x time and walking then yes the area of Kerbin alone dwarfs that available in most other games. However, at 100,000x time every point of interest in the Kerbal system is accessible in under an hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as games have features to reduce time-sinks, they also have features that artificially inflate time. A town may take a player 30 seconds to sprint through. Add a horde of zombies, lootable buildings and debris and suddenly that 30 seconds is 15 minutes. Remove teleports/gates/fast travel from a game, and what should have been a near instantaneous trip suddenly takes an hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is more to the bigness of a game than the area the game world occupies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luckless","CreatedById":3954,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T22:24:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are going to discard games with mostly procedurally generated worlds, then you are also discarding KSP...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TicTacToe!","CreatedById":44675,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T22:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave any of you guys seen that pre-alpha stage game Seed of Andromeda??
