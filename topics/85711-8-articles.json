I want to set up my throttle to two separate axis. I discovered that with an xbox360 controller (or at least a dualshock 4 in an xinput wrapper...) I can map throttle increment and decrement to the y axis of my right stick. At first it doesn\u0027t work, but if you enable invert on BOTH mappings then pushing the stick up throttles up, analogue, and pulling down throttles down, with the advantage that the throttle stays set when you release the stick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d like to do is simultaneous add another mapping for the regular throttle option, the absolute position one, on the right trigger. Right now if I try to add it, this mapping overrides the other one and holds the throttle at zero until it gets input on this axis. I would like to change this behaviour so that if there is no input on this axis then it leaves the throttle alone. As soon as there is input it should assume throttle control and bring the throttle as quickly (and smoothly) as it can to the absolute trigger position. Is this possible somehow in settings?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ph34rb0t","CreatedById":4291,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T22:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConfirming extreme slowdowns with 1.4.5 when the configuration menu is open.
