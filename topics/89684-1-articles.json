They could be unlocked by simply getting there with a kerbal or there could be certain unlock criteria to unlock them. Land an aircraft here, and return to the KSC to unlock, say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It would give a nice reason to explore Kerbin a bit. I have a few times flown a plane long distance on Kerbin and it was always really fun.
