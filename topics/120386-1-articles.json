Great as a spaceship, but will most likely snap when trying to push it against a heavy boulder. Make your asteroid pusher flat (if possible), compact and sturdy. Or at least strut the docked sections to each other. And put all those SAS modules and batteries somewhere where is no direct stress applied to them.\u003Cp\u003EIf did do something like that i\u0027d put all that fragile stuff and the ore tank into a Mk3 cargo bay attached to the engine section, strut everything into oblivion and launch it all in one big piece.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
