The dV needed for return from Minmus is minuscule and, when timed right, it can get you up to speeds of 3km/s at Kerbin periapsis and thanks to the Oberth Effect, that means your remaining fuel (which is still pretty much all of it if you\u0027re using nuclear engines or similarly efficient engines) can affect your dV much more than when you\u0027re orbiting at Minmus height, which is pretty slow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T01:41:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022locustgate\u0022 data-cite=\u0022locustgate\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELow Kerbal Orbit or Low Minmus Orbit for eject?
