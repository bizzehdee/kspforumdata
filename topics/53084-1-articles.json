In real life (and yes I know ksp is not real life) this wouldn\u0027t be possible. If you look through a telescope you can get a good idea of the surface of near worlds but less and less info on those smaller bodies and those further away. Hubble\u0027s picture of Pluto shows a disk with fuzzy blobs on it and to get a better view you have to go there as the New Horizons probe is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how about changing the map view so that the surface\u0027s of distant and smaller worlds are obscured (fuzzy) until you send something there. We had no idea of Venus\u0027s surface until we hit it a few times and radar mapped it. You could thus gain science (and a better map view) by sending something to a planet and transmitting details of its surface back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpanding on this, the current science value of experiments either requires repeated transmission of the same data, or somehow returning the experiment to Kerbin. The Mariner, Viking, Voyager etc probes, were all sent on one way trips yet produced vast amounts of science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how about tweaking the amount of science you can get on some kinds of experiments depending on the experiment type and, \u0027we don\u0027t know\u0027 difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking through a telescope at Lathe shows a small blue dot so the map would show a blue fuzzy moon to start with. Going there and flying past would give some science depending on how close you got and it\u0027d improve the map. You couldn\u0027t spam the transmission and get lots of science as well you still don\u0027t know much. Going and orbiting would give more science on the surface detail, depending on how low you orbited and how long up to a predefined max. and improve the map further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding would open up a different kind of science, you could sample the temperature, dig holes etc and do limited analysis \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 giving more science score.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding and coming back with stuff would give the full score on surface science as it would be so much more difficult. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically we have remote sensing science (flybys and orbits) and going there and falling over stuff science (landing and getting back in one piece). Both give valid science and you cannot get the landing science by spamming a probe in orbit or the orbit science by just landing in one place. Both are valid. Orbiting improves the map, showing good places to land etc, but the landing gives most score and kudos.(I think the latter was hinted at in the recent Reddit Q\u0026amp;A session).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpanding further you\u0027d probably need the ability to store multiple experiments in a probe. (It cost a lot to get to Lathe and all you brought back was a single rock!???) So the ability to store info on the atmosphere (temp, composition, pressure etc), water (is it water?) sand, rock etc and then bring all this back in one piece would produce massive science rewards (and fame/kudos whatever). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor other worlds you could perhaps get different science depending on where you go and what you find out \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 meaning that you actually explore rather than landing and then just taking off again. Kerbin already allows this and I guess it\u0027ll be added for other worlds in time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T12:26:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETHAT.... is one of the *best* ideas I\u0027ve heard so far.

Still even in a clear atmosphere no dust, clouds, birds, leaves on the lens or whatever you would still get convection currents as one side of the planet\u0027s atmosphere is heated by day and the other half cools by night. So Kerbals will have wind, or rather their planet will. I have no idea of their digestive problems. Anyway different layers of air with different temperatures have different densities and that reaallly mucks up an image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem is that stuff in space is a damn long way away and unless our green friends have 100% perfect lenses with incredible resolving power they wont be able to see all the features on a distant world for the same reason as we cannot see the Great Wall of China from space and Hubble can\u0027t see the surface of Pluto. Most of features will just be too small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
