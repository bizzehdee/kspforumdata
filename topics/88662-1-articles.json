Mostly going well; probes to the inner solar system, \u0027fast enough\u0027 jet planes for Kerbin flyover missions, and an unmanned Munar rover that can run just as well either side up, as inspired by those little radio controlled cars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGone career mode because I\u0027m that kind of guy who doesn\u0027t like everything handed to him up front and loves the long discovery process with lots of use of intermediate tech levels. Indeed, I restarted after two days because I\u0027d taken the Outsourced R\u0026amp;D policy, and discovered it is hideously overpowered and ruining the whole point of having a tech tree.

One accidental tap of time warp and my planes fall apart in flight, so I guess it\u0027ll be an honor-system iron man, where I\u0027ll take losses if they feel fair, rather than like the result of dodgy coding or lack of information at the point of commitment. I know it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E rocket science, but I don\u0027t have the head for the mathematics and I have to go on what the orbital predictions say will happen - even when that\u0027s really vague and stops at \u0027Kerbin escape\u0027 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf y\u0027all could spare a little wisdom, I do have a couple of questions however \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Is using NEAR (and later FAR when I know the game better) going to make me struggle with later missions? I like the aerodynamics a lot better than stock, but it does make getting big things into orbit really hard. So far I\u0027ve been focussing on unmanned flights, and have been shrinking my components to 50-70% normal size in order to wedge them into a 2.5m fairing, but I have absolutely no idea how I\u0027m going to get kerbonauts past Minmus. They\u0027ll need better comms, which will need to be shielded in a fairing, which will not fit around a big capsule; rovers for a crew will need to be bigger than my scaled down mini-rover, and yet I had to think really hard about how to fit a skycrane and lander into a fairing, just to land on Mun; etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, does FAR or any other mod, provide any solutions to the (realistic) problems that FAR brings to the table, or is it something nice to play with for a while, but an obstruction later on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I\u0027ve been looking at Transfer Window Planner and MechJeb to help me find the right times to get to places. The first just gives me angles and delta-v\u0027s that I have no real idea how to implement, and while MechJeb will create a manoeuvre node, it has a habit of not arriving in a very good place for getting into orbit around my destination. Example, my recent Moho probe just barely achieved a wonky orbit with 12 m/s left in it\u0027s fuel tank. According to TWP I should have arrived with a thousand times that to spare, transferring orbit-to-orbit, which was to my mind \u0027plenty\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question then is whether TWP is providing a fair calculation of delta-v, and if it is, how can I go from what it\u0027s showing me on screen to a set of manoeuvre nodes that I can execute? Otherwise, how can I get MechJeb to tell me what the other half of the transfer will be, before I launch, so that I don\u0027t try this with a crewed vessel and have to abandon it and return home?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your advice!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T04:45:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. NEAR is FAR without the mach effects and the wing interaction and the GUI. It\u0027s not really easier or harder (it\u0027s easier to go fast, but that\u0027s not always a good thing, like on reentry) and while it doesn\u0027t provide lots of info, that means you don\u0027t have info to look at as to what needs fixing in your design. If you\u0027re using Procedural Fairings, there is currently an issue with larger-than-1.25m fairings and FAR not detecting parts as shielded; you might need to use (non-procedural) KW fairings for now.

RemoteTech? That only kills antennae that are deployed, which you need not do when launching a crewed mission since you don\u0027t need a connection to mission control.
