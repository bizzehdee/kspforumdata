It would be beneficial so less launches are needed for stations and lower the likelihood of Jeb making an \u0022unscheduled orbital faceplant\u0022 due to the fuel weight snapping the rocket. By the way a design a mission patch screen would be cool as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T16:15:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can right-click the tank in VAB/SPH and pull the slider to whatever fuel level you want in it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T17:06:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKasuha is 100% correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut have you thought about actually USING the fuel to get the tank in orbit and then re-fill it? This way you can launch the tank with a much smaller rocket, or launch a bigger tank (or perhaps two tanks) in a single launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T00:39:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sumrex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sumrex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBy the way a design a mission patch screen would be cool as well.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed, but somebody with a *tiny* bit of design skill can open up Photoshop or any freeware photo editing program, create a logo, and save it in the proper place to make it a mission flag. \u0026lt;\u0026lt;My forum avi here?

I\u0027ve got a 600 ton space station that I might actually get to orbit now. Defueled it is only 80 tons, doesn\u0027t collapse under it\u0027s own weight and survives launch.
