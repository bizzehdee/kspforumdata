Do auto-updates of KSP on Steam still overwrite or erase mod files in the GameData folder? If so, then is it still recommended that I make a copy of the KSP folder that\u0027s found in the Steam directory to prevent that from happening?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T11:12:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 11:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Spark Plug**\n  \nsolved"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T04:57:10Z","Content":"Pretty sure that the update won\u0027t touch the mods.
