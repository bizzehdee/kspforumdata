Which is why I lamented that heating effects have been dialed back in 1.0.2 over 1.0.0.\n\nSo what I think is better in 1.0.2 is the low altitude air density, NOT the reduction of the heating. In 1.0.0, air at low altitude felt too thin. It is my understanding that if you are supersonic in a plane at 10km altitude, and then you start to dive down 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 while completely cutting the power, the drag should be slowing you down to subsonic somewhat quickly.

I loved abusing the hell out of it. Basic planes and how the handled. I do agree I hate them. Still could make and fly them. Just way to much work to keep up in the air. Rockets are well rockets. Always fun regardless of the atmosphere.\n\n1.0 Changes to the lift made it nicer to play with place that is for sure. Never got the chance to really try and make SSTO planes. The few times I tried did not go to well due to the runways being bumpy and was only playing that version with mainly rocket.\n\n1.0.2 Very fun to fly planes. Did some flying with stock plane with basic engine and could keep it at close to the same altitude with almost no input needed by me for 30\u002B minutes. I have the feling if I was not trying to do contracts at the time. The plane would just stay up in the air as long as it has fuel. Like how the engines drain fuel evenly even though that is a pain for when I was trying to make SSTO planes. They kept eating at the fuel and had no way to transfer the fuel back. No fuel lines or reasorce transfers yet.\n\nBut, over all. The thing I find most odd about the aero update is. That the first basic intake still had plenty of air in it, think about 0.17 to 0.23 left in it when the engine (only using one) cut out. At least my way of thinking. The basic should have flamed out a lot closer to 0.01 since the drain was about that. I understand that my thrust out put should be very little at high up due to lack of air going in. But, when placing 2 intakes the engine (using one still) shutting down is still about the same with the intakes having even more stored air in them. Which is what I find very very weird. While not expecting much gain. It is just weird that the engine still cuts out around the same altitude. Can accept that there will be some air still there as that is the pressure point for flame out. Just not when there is a tiny bit moar air left in. I do realize moar testing needs to be done. I\u0027ll try 3, 4, 5, 6, and up when I get the chance to. Certainly don\u0027t feel like playing in sandbox mode to find out nor redoing it over and over to find out.\n\nOther then that.

FAR with a Kerbin rescale, 3x-4x is a nice size that is still feasible with stock parts, but your rockets need to be bigger. One of the issues I have with stock is that Kerbin is just too small so getting into orbit is never that much of a challenge, unless parts are arbitrarily limited or severely nerfed, or I\u0027m trying to launch excessively large payloads.\n\nActually, that would make for a nice difficulty slider, being able to choose the system scale. That would add actual difficulty to the game, not just adjust the grind like the difficulty setting do currently.\n\nI haven\u0027t played extensively with the new update (I\u0027m waiting for Squad to finish fixing the hotfixes and for mods to be updated to fix what Squad doesn\u0027t), but given the buggy behavior so far in the new aero system, I would say .90 was more fun, even if it was unrealistic.
