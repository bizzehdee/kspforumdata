If your craft doesn\u0026#39;t sit level on the ground (mine typically sit with the nose pointing up a little when wing incidence isn\u0026#39;t used - typically because I have forwards and aft wings with engines mounted on the wings, and I don\u0026#39;t want the exhaust of the forwards jets hitting the rear wing - also I don\u0026#39;t want to have to deal with the offset thrust issues that can create) - then this may involve rotating the entire craft as well to get all wheels equidistant from the floor, just above the floor - do it that way and the \u0022drop\u0022 on craft loading is very small.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn top of that, landing gear placement is very important, you don\u0026#39;t want a long \u0022tube\u0022 of heavy parts, with just support at the front and back.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMake sure your landing gear are very straight, landing gear that isn\u0026#39;t vertical can cause all kinds of \u0022disassembly\u0022 problems on take off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile you want to minimize struts because of their drag, on a big craft you can throw several struts on it without killing its viability. As you see in my top images, I\u0026#39;m using struts to keep the payload in place, and also to keep the two halves of my craft together. It still manages ~35% payload fraction... so don\u0026#39;t be afraid to add some struts.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Der Anfang","CreatedById":134627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T08:19:55Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027FlipNascar\u0027]Well you can try by using struts.
