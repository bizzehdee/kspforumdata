I don\u0027t use strategies heavily enough to know if it\u0027s possible to pick 5 without conflicts though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greep","CreatedById":132944,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T20:48:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for conflicts is there is no point in having a strategy that converts funds to science and one that converts science to funds at the same time. Even at max commit, it results in a net loss for you. Since each of the 6 resource based ones have a counterpart, you can only have 3 of them, while you can choose both of the two unique ones, making for 5 total.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
