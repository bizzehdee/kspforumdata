Xenon from Kerbin\u0027s Clouds, Department. They also have a successful comic book series chronicling the lives and times of the air-miners of their workforce. A significant portion of stranded orbiting Kerbals come from workers munlighting at XKCD and using their xenon-collector packs too much. The rest come from Kerbals inexplicably trapped under the ropes of launching test rockets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T03:09:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T03:09:57Z","Content":"Very nice model there."},{"CreatedByName":"Sidereus","CreatedById":135263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T03:14:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hooray! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Having only male kerbals always seemed weird.
