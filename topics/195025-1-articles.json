Originally, the intent was to power it with batteries for local trips, charging it up with solar panels between journeys, with fuel cells and tanks to provide constant power on long distance trips. However, despite testing on Kerbin, on Laythe, this rover sucks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can deal with the fact that the rover is slow, burns through electricity fast, and needs to stop frequently even with the fuel cells running. What I an\u0027t deal with is the fact that the rover cannot go up slopes more than four degrees while carrying the trailer. That number is not much better without the trailer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rover\u0027s wheel settings were originally calibrated so that the rover would be stable at 4x warp. However, with the trailer, I need to make a really long journey (the ascent vehicle landed waaay far away and needs refueling) so if you can suggest changes to the settings to make it so I can go up steeper slopes, I will gladly sacrifice the 4x warp capability, as the trailer will not be stable in 4x warp anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E capability, but a very limited number of spare parts. Launching a new rover or more parts isn\u0027t really an option unfortunately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-25T03:28:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you having power (horsepower) issues, or traction issues on the slopes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was my monster rover in 1.3.1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iGYVt3m.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002257.82\u0022 height=\u0022170\u0022 width=\u0022294\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/iGYVt3m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0It had major issues transitioning from one slope angle to another, and would get stuck on the top of hills.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith BG, I should be able to redesign it so that the previously fixed undercarriage would be attached via a series of rotors/axles to allow the wheels to always be in contact with the surface.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Perhaps you are having similar issues where the wheels are losing contact with the ground when you are trying to climb slopes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArg... just saw the mission constraints part....

The sheer weight of the vehicle and the mass of the planet are keeping you glued down, so your problem here is one of two things. Either 1) You\u0027re lacking on horsepower. Or 2) Your heavy back\u00A0end is dragging\u00A0on\u00A0the slope adding excess friction as you try to accelerate up. Generally the fixes would go along the lines of increasing the rear\u00A0suspension a bit or adding more powered wheels depending on the actual problem. Obviously you can\u0027t edit the vehicle so... Try raising the rear\u00A0suspension or reducing friction of back\u00A0half of wheels or both lol? If it\u0027s digging in too much, it might start accelerating better after the change.
