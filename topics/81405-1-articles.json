I don\u0027t fly single missions, I have dozens happening at once. So while my flotilla heads for Jool I\u0027m also sending rovers and stuff to my newly built Minmus base, capturing an asteroid, preparing the missions to Duna, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, using Kerbal Alarm Clock, I may have a quiet week or two and then I need to go back to the Eve flotilla, in which three or four ships (more in the case of Jool) are entering Eve\u0027s SOI in a short period of days while I also have ships returning to Kerbin from Duna I need to check. Or I screw up the ascend for a payload delivery to Minmus so that ship gets to wait until a burn at the AN/DN gets an intercept while another ship launched a few days later can make the burn immediately after reaching KLO and ends up scheduled to arrive sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, not so much a \u0022skip to\u0022 but an alarm clock, maybe combined with MJ\u0027s warp helper\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
