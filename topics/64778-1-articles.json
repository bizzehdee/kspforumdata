It would take off from a typical runway, then quickly accelerate upwards, setting itself on a semi-ballistic trajectory aimed near the destination airport. After that, it would turn off its engines completely, gliding at the thin part of the atmosphere, then fire its engines once more at final approach. Electricity demands in the gliding phase could be met from either fuel cells (if using LH2/LOX), or deployable solar panels (if apoapsis is high enough). If using air-augmented rockets, it could either take off on fuel-oxidizer mix, or use some sort of bypassable turbocompressor mechanism. Then, it would transition to ramjet mode at about Mach 3, then to rocket mode when the air becomes too thin for jet engine operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible advantages include the capability to fly hypersonic over land, something which is forbidden under current laws. However, the need to carry oxidizer, along with the plane needing a heatshield for reentry, and a possibly complicated electrical system could offset it.

Contrary to a widely popularized speech, we don\u0027t do things because they are hard, we do things because they are worth doing. Especially when it requires a substantial effort. In fact, the bigger the effort, the more justification you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t build suborbital airliners because there is no demand for $200 000 express plane tickets. Concorde was a complex machine, but it flopped due to lack of demand. Nobody is going to start building rocket fuel factories and storage facilities at Heathrow, JFK, and Dubai International Airport for a handful of passengers every year.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T09:47:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sillychris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sillychris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe only thing I have to offer to the conversation is this:\u003Cp\u003ENaysayers say it\u0027s very complicated, requires infrastructure, etc. Engineering obstacles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s do it!
