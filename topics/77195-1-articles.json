The quality, the ideas, the dedication to updates and mod-users is im my opinion second to none. I was always surprised when someone in other games did something that one couldnt honestly expect from a modder with his limited access to sourcecode and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when i encountered things like ATM from abray89, loadondemand from Faark (and everything else he did) or the ALCOR pod from alexustas it blew me away how MUCH it added to the raw playability of KSP. Or Fractal_UKs Interstellar Mod or TAC LS from TaranisElsu that integrates complete new (end)games into KSP and this way consumed loong weeks of gametime long after the \u0022300t into orbit with stocks\u0022 autism challenges that for me gets boring really fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, where to stop praising? Infernal Robotics from Sirkut ... another complete new set of possibilities to waste tons of hours, and, as with the other examples, everything (mostly) is just working. How often can you say this in a professional developed game? And these are modder, and in my view some of the best i ever witnessed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you guys, and people like TriggerAU (KAC), KospY (KAS ... maaan, how i love this mod), PeteTimesSix (Vesselview), technogeeky, DMagic and damny for ScanSAT, B9, K3|Chris (B9 iva extensions) and so on and so on... the list of not only great but execeptional great modders (even the ones i actively use right now is too long for a short open letter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are the salt of the mun ... thank you very much from a very happy Kerbal!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T16:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere!
