The procedural craters on the mun are testament to that (This uses the sameish idea; use random noise to create environments). It would just take aaaages to get it running, so that time is better spend getting Career mode running and crushing bugs. Not to mention procedurally generated terrain is quite heavy on the CPU, which is also used to simulate physics (the main bottleneck right now).

It\u0027s bloody fast and very detailed, and looks very pretty. It is not only fractal terrain, it is real life height data combined with fractals for close-up detail. Only when you get up close and personal to the terrain is the detail lacking a bit, in that texels become visible. And the trees are just billboards, even trees close to the camera.

Additionally, I believe you are underestimating the amount of scratch Squad could garner with a kickstarter campaign to port it to that engine. It may take half to a year to port it with the current staff, but I believe that with the amount of money they would pull in via previously noted Kickstarter, they could hire on the staff they\u0027d need to do it in a reasonable amount of time. And finally, I can assure you with a fair amount of vigor, that given the choice, probably seventeen per twenty players would be more than happy, delighted even, to hold off on updates to the game to make such a port happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe unity engine used now is defective. It prevents the game from reaching anywhere close to its potential. You know the problems with it as well as anyone. It\u0027s one thing to acknowledge these problems, but it\u0027s something else entirely to ignore them, blame the engine developer for its deficiencies, and then do nothing in response.
