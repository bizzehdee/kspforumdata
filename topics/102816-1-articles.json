It can seem daunting at first, but a lot of it breaks down in to simple enough chunks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Start with a new career, and run the first few missions manned. You\u0027ll get a basic feel for some of what TAC requires to make sure your kerbals don\u0027t have a bad time. Aim for unlocking batteries and solar panels first, because they\u0027re pretty important for manned missions and vital for unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Then start launching unmanned probes. Expect to lose contact with a few, leading to crashes and zombie probes in weird orbits. But aim to get three or four with an omni and small dish antenna, all spaced out evenly in the same orbit. That will make further unmanned launches much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You will also want to use SCANSat, which is necessary to find Karbonite deposits to mine. I\u0027d strongly suggest installing that, and around this time also launch a satellite with a scanner. Put it in a polar orbit around Kerbin and get used to using it for altimetry and resource scans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy now you should have unlocked life support containers so you can send Kerbals on longer manned flights without them dying. So start exploring the Mun or Minmus. You can send a manned flight to land and have a look around, or you can start by putting one or two communications satellites in a high orbit around the moon. With some careful planning, that should be enough for a controlled landing of an unmanned probe on the surface. Also get a scanning sat in a polar orbit to look for Karbonite to mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here, you know where the best places to mine are, and you\u0027ve had a chance to look around. I\u0027d probably pick a resource rich site, and put and unmanned rover on it to scout around for the best place to build a base. From there, you want to be looking at the MKS/OKS doco on assembling surface bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Van Disaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Van Disaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso I think installing MKS means you don\u0027t explicitly need EPL? or possibly even Karbonite either.

SB is all 5-star kerbals, and in Career stars effect how much work you get out of a kerbal. It does give you a feel for how to move things around, and the overall cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make fuel without Karbonite with MKS, but it\u0027s pretty slow IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollow Stibbon\u0027s recommendations, and i wouldn\u0027t worry about MKS/OKS until you\u0027ve got most of the tech tree unlocked. Start with an orbital kerbin base, and throw on a logistics node when you get tired of shuttling resources up manually. LNs mean no more docking just to transfer fuel either, which can be a big time saver. Kerbals still have to fly themselves. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The C3 acts as a command station for RT, so if you want to land unmanned probes somewhere without atmo, you can put a small OKS station in orbit to provide local control (well, with 6 kerbals in it). For orbital unmanned, you can use maneuver nodes and the flight computer. Ah, the flight computer is definitely worth the trade off in setting up an RT network. It\u0027s like a dumb Mechjeb (won\u0027t plan for you, or land for you) that does precision burns, but you actually have to \u0022pay\u0022 for it with a comsat network, so I\u0027m ok with using it.
