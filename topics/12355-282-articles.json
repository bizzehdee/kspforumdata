Be aware of what the Sepratron exhaust is aimed at or will move across as the spent stage drops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESepratron exhaust is quite destructive, which makes them useful for simulating a failure.

Sticking an extra decoupler on a lower stage then putting its icon with the Sepratrons doesn\u0027t work because once the spent stage is out of physics range KSP removes the decoupler from the staging list , then MechJeb will go ahead and use them out of order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout a decoupler in the stage(s) with Sepratrons, MechJeb will activate them out of order, even if they are positioned to fire forwards. MechJeb will do the same with other engines not paired up with a decoupler, even though that works perfectly using manual staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout having at least one decoupler in every stage that has engines (not every stage has to have engines) the way to block MechJeb from activating engines early is to set the Stop at Stage number to the stage below the one you don\u0027t want it messing with. If that\u0027s in the middle of the rocket you can manually trigger that stage then change the Stop at Stage number to allow MechJeb to continue automatic staging. Or you can completely disable automatic staging and let MechJeb pilot while you wait for the burnouts and pop the spacebar - and the staging will work exactly as if you were doing everything manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legolegs","CreatedById":94430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T19:02:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor those who have issues with MJ not able to rotate the vessel without setting \u0022use stock SAS\u0022 turned on: remove MechJebFARExt, it does not work at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slammr","CreatedById":114714,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T20:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t seem to have the files/folders for MechJeb 2 in the right place.
