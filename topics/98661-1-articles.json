So as it passes a planet, the ship feels nothing but its course has changed. The only way passing something will wreck you is if there is a steep enough gravity well that the gravity is noticeably stronger on the one side of the ship than the other. So for best results we are talking about a large ship that isn\u0027t very sturdy passing close to something with lots of gravity that itself is dense and small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo not doing any math here, perhaps a large truss or frame ship made for travel only in space passing close to say a neutron star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe comet Comet Shoemaker\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Levy 9 broke up when coming closer to Jupiter, but this comet was held together by its own gravity not by nuts and bolts.
