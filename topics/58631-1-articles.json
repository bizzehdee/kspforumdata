It seems though that the planets and moons have a finite sphere of influence outside of which their gravity doesn\u0027t effect my ship. I\u0027ve gotten close to that style of orbit but never getting it like the old diagrams. This leads me to questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo planetary bodies have gravity influence outside of their sphere of influence? This would be crucial for finding Lagrange points (where I would like to drop space stations or probes).

AS far as setting up a free return from Kerbin orbit to the mun and bck, it is possible, but its going to take some maneuver node tweaking. What Apollo did was they initially set up a free return trajectory, then performed a munar insertion burn and then circularized their orbit. a truely apollo style mission can be done in KSP, but there are no Lagrange points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
