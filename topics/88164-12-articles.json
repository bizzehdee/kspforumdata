The bit I highlighted above is actually fallacious in KSP because I can take the craft, and calculate out whether or not it\u0027s possible to get the 71km periapsis with Kerbin. Irrespective of pilot. That\u0027s physically the best the craft can achieve, and KSP models physics well enough that one can perform that calculation. There\u0027s NO WAY to get better than that, not even with the best pilot ever.\u003Cp\u003EIt IS, however, very easy to get WORSE than that. And in fact, most human pilots would never be able to hit that perfect 71km periapsis. Which is why spaceships in Real Life are controlled by computers most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this part is important to think about as far as implementation: essentially - where is the baseline? Or perhaps better asked - if you had a computer on board perfectly executing commands, what would the values be. Now, is the system going to be implemented where, say, probes get the same dV values as Level 5 (since that is apparently the top level they\u0027re looking at) Kerbals, or do they get the same values as Level 1 Kerbals? If it\u0027s a system where Kerbals are getting better at flying then, in theory, probes would fly with the same ability as level 5 Kerbals, not Level 1 kerbals. Now, one could get around that by perhaps saying that Kerbals aren\u0027t all that skilled at programming flight computers, which I suppose would be a sufficient although not ideal explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr to put it another way: Do higher level Kerbals Add to the baseline, or do lower level kerbals subtract from the baseline?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-22T12:43:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2014 12:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FleetAdmiralJ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T12:33:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptRobau\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptRobau\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnly if you see the thrust/Isp tweak as an actual magical tweak to the spacecraft itself.
