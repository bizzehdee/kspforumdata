After 2-3 whole days of testing, frustration, and sweat, I finally created a spaceplane capable of carrying a payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I named the craft the K.S.S. Starflyer, and she is quite capable! Using a mk2 size fuselage, she has a crew capacity of 6, ample fuel with a proprietary fuel generation system (read as personal mod in development and yet to be released), and\u00A0a somewhat complex propulsion system composed of the following: \u00A0two atmospheric nuclear jet engines, two Nerv\u00A0rockets as main propulsion, and five auxiliary rockets (four thuds and a terrier).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0For the Starflyers\u0027 maiden voyage, I figured a ground mission to Duna would suffice, with a small space station as a payload. Takeoff was a little rough, kept having trouble with staying on the runway, I\u00A0nearly collided with the lights at the end! Getting into orbit was not as easy as I hoped, but the auxiliary engines really helped. When I got into a low orbit around Duna, that\u0027s when I detached the miniature space station. Thanks to mods, making a small space station with a mpl is doable, the only hindsight to the station was that I forgot to add more batteries to keep it active...\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u00A0(Ah well, could always send another mission to fix that!) While I was entering the atmosphere of Duna, I had noticed a slight flaw with my craft\u00A0design: the parachutes weren\u0027t evenly placed, the craft was pointing upwards instead of level(ish)! In my attempt to try to level the craft so it could land on the landing gears, I failed to notice how close I was to the surface! The Starflyer landed, but not perfectly; I lost one of the main engines and two auxiliary engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Now at this point I thought the mission was a failure and that I\u0027d need rescuing by Matt Lowne\u0027s Blunderbirds, but nope! Turns out the Starflyer is quite resilient; it\u00A0was only crippled, not disabled! Since the atmospheric engines were both intact, it was not that difficult getting into orbit, sort of. I used up the rest of the oxidizer circularizing my orbit, so the remaining auxiliary engines were useless. Because I only had one nuclear engine, the thrust was imbalanced, forcing me to lower the thrust of said engine. Getting back to Kerbin was very lengthy, but at least the mission\u00A0was successful!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-05T01:40:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2018 01:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by mr. engino\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
