Basic Dres mission is actually relatively challenging for most of players. Is it somehow better if I replace the return ship with large numbers of Hitchickers loaded with kerbals, call it a \u0022colony\u0022 end leave them on Dres? Or is it somehow better if I multiple basic mission by some factor and get tens of meaningless debris around and on Dres? In my opinion, if you expect much more complicated things than basic flag putting mission with resource utilization and couple of experiments, you should allow heavy modding. You should even demand some mods for example life support. Stock KSP\u0027s game logic is based on very basic missions. It does not have parts, resources or mechanics to mode advanced colonization with large scale resource utilization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not deny your opinions. If you feel this is right way it is. But maybe you would get more participants with little different set of rules. Your current set demands very much rolegaming. For example I am very interested in Dres (especially because its orbit), but my playstyle is very different and I can not take part of your challenge. I use mods and try to do well planned basic missions with tight timetables and resource budgets like first real world missions would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
