I loaded up a completely vanilla install of 0.25, with no mods but VOID and kOS, and got these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://toad.homelinux.net/pics/KSP/VOID/VOID_CB25-Mun_Minmus.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VOID_CB25-Mun_Minmus.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://toad.homelinux.net/pics/KSP/VOID/VOID_CB25-Ike_Duna.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VOID_CB25-Ike_Duna.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://toad.homelinux.net/pics/KSP/VOID/kOS25-Mun_Minmus_Ike.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kOS25-Mun_Minmus_Ike.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe VOID screenshots are in Kerbin time; the orbit periods in seconds are: Mun: 138984.4, Minmus: 1077310.5, Ike: 65517.9. These are all exactly what I get in 0.90 and exactly what kOS gets in 0.25 (rounding aside). Do you have another mod that might be changing the gravitational constant of the universe or something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eagle21221\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eagle21221\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks you for your awesome mod. I\u0027ve been using it since like ksp version 18 or something. But could i offer a suggestion for v.90\u003Cp\u003EI know code has changed alot, but think it would be possible to tie your mod to the engineer\u0027s ability. like level 1 he can use a few features and as he progresses he can tell delta v left and biomes or such?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thought this would really add to the class, which right now is pretty useless, unless dang it\u0027s modder can add to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have considered this and am of two minds about it. I could almost certainly tie VOID\u0027s information to career progress (manually or automatically depending on how accessible the limitations are in Squad\u0027s code), but at the same time I really dislike the idea of limiting basic information and probably disagree with Squad\u0027s approach (I haven\u0027t actually played any 0.90 yet; maybe I\u0027ll like it better than I think I will). Too, how do we resolve things with probes? Afaik probe cores don\u0027t get engineer or scientist levels (just pilot levels), so should a probe be unable to calculate its own delta-v, or sense the biome it\u0027s over?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T16:41:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 04:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by toadicus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded response to Eagle21221.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crown","CreatedById":18262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T18:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat Plugin, just what I have looked for!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the CSV data logger: is there a way to configure what values are recorded? i.e. when i want to log the SMA and eccentricity too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T20:05:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022toadicus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022toadicus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe VOID screenshots are in Kerbin time; the orbit periods in seconds are: Mun: 138984.4, Minmus: 1077310.5, Ike: 65517.9.

Y\u0027know, I guess I shoulda paid more attention to the issue that, when I tried to load a mission save from 0.24.2 into 0.25 where I was coming down to land on Mun, the rotational position of Mun was not the same. I wrote it off as a corrupt save file, since I do manually edit a lot of my saves and I coulda screwed up the spacecraft position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to have to strip to stock and see what the hell is going on.
