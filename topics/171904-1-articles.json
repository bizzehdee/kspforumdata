After that, 1.3 introduced localization for\u00A0Spanish, Russian, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese, but only made tweaks to game play, nothing big.\u00A0Since than the programming focus switched to using the now stable game to add the DLC\u00A0\u0022Making History\u0022.\u00A0\u00A0\u0022Making History\u0022 will not only add\u00A0new parts from the early space race of the 50\u0027s\u00A0and 60\u0027s, but also a scenario editor allowing players to create their own scenarios and share them with other players. This is due\u00A0out next Tuesday on March 13th.\u00A0 To make this DLC work, KSP has just released 1.4 which not only adds the hooks\u00A0needed for\u00A0\u00A0\u0022Making History\u0022 but also updates the game to the new version of Unity. To be sure 1.4 adds improvements to graphics and sounds, but nothing earth shattering in game play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not heard anything about the road map moving forward, but I would guess, that for the foreseeable future, KSP will add new DLCs to the now stable core game. As Vanamonde alludes to, the game has progressed so far beyond 0.17 that a KSP 2.0 will take a great deal of time and effort to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
