I want to play the latest version of KSP, however, to me it feels too ugly XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if you guys can point me in the direction of some mods that improve the graphics of the game (clouds, lighting, that kind of thing) or whichever you use? I realise that its still to early to expect every mod to be up to KSP 1.0 standard, so any active, still being worked on mods would be great!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance guys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CosmoBro","CreatedById":142301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:26:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell I use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55905-0-24-7-4-Sep-9-2014-EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEnviromental Visual Enhancements\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96497\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPlanet Shine\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98943\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDistant Objet Enhancements\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/220207-hotrockets-particle-fx-replacement/files/2236411\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHot Rockets\u003C/a\u003E and works fine to me in 1.2. the graphics are beautiful with this mods\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_Burnt_Rodent","CreatedById":123884,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T18:50:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI installed the same as CosmoBro minus the HotRockets as well as parts of Astronomers pack for E.V.E (medium res clouds, dust storms for Duna and 4k clouds for Eve and Jool) and using A.T.M and -force-opengl I still load up at less than 2gb.
