I\u0027m playing with galileo\u0027s system replacer, using a station and a probe. I\u0027ve put the station in the same orbit as\u00A0Lili but shifted ahead\u00A0(a large asteroid in the belt of a large planet) and want to use the probe to find ore deposits. the station is in a stable position - I\u0027ve accelerated time and watched them orbit, they stay the same distance apart. The trouble begins when I actually go to use the probe. I get it into a capture of Lili, and then the station\u0027s orbit changes. it goes from stable and separate to falling straight down to the planet, and when I use Hyperedit to place it back in the same orbit as Lili, it starts Falling towards it. I\u0027ve looked at the velocities, and they\u0027re the same. Lili is orbiting at 455,000m and 3578.5m/s, I\u0027m orbiting at 449,000m and 3578.5m/s. When I switch to target mode, I\u0027m moving towards Lili at around 200m/s.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow can I be moving in the same orbit and same velocity as a celestial body AND be falling towards it? also, when I fall towards it my orbit doesn\u0027t show a transfer into Lili\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, I just crash and explode.
