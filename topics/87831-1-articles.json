From the testing I\u0027ve done, everything works fine. But as always with \u0022Version 0.1\u0022, it may not work flawlessly! If you let me know anything that doesn\u0027t work, I\u0027ll try my best to fix it. Also I don\u0027t know why Squad doesn\u0027t make these availably by default, but as I said, they seem to work fine. The rewards for the grand tour seem a bit low perhaps, I should be able to adjust those if people give me feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Grand tour is disabled in the stock game from what I can tell, full stop, but I believe there may be a debug option to generate such a contract, this mod makes them available as normal contracts from the mission screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The interplanetary rescue missions in stock, according the code, would become available with exceptional prestige and when you \u0022complete\u0022 a planet (no idea what that means), but I\u0027ve never seen them, and I\u0027ve put over 700 hours into the game so far, with multiple careers completed. Seeing as I haven\u0027t seen any mention of them on the web, I think it\u0027s a safe bet that they\u0027re effectively locked in the stock game. Either way, this mod removes any special requirements around them so you\u0027ll start seeing them the moment you\u0027ve reached a given planet in the career without any further effort. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Having played around a bit with this, I can vouch that the interplanetary rescue contracts are very good fun and can present something of a challenge (I saw a contract to rescue a Kerbal from an altitude of \u003Cem\u003E10k\u003C/em\u003E over Minmus for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELICENCE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is public domain, if you want you may grab the source code from GitHub and do with it whatever you like.
