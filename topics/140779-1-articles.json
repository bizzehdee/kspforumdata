Now, I\u0027ll go from having a consistent 60 FPS to jumbling around 15 or so, with lots of hangups.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas something changed with how Unity handles part reflections? It\u0027s not a dealbreaker of course, but it does seem sad that even just a simple Stayputnik reflection could slow the game down more than a hundred-part-design. And it doesn\u0027t seem like a hardware issue--I\u0027ve got a GTX 970 and a i5-4670K (3.4 ghz).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have a similar experience?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
