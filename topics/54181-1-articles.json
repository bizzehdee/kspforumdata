I want to make these guys indestructible, so i can do all sorts of mean things to them, like jettision them from an aircraft traveling at 2200 m/s, dropping them from orbit and seeing how high they bounce, and other stuff. Is this possible? I know you can edit parts to have ridiculously high impact tolerance, but i cannot find anything about making kerbals tougher when on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T07:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough Kerbals are a Part, there is no Part file that you can change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey have very hard helmets though.
