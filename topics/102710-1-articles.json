More disks are safer, though other factors come into play too. External disks are preferred too, as they are less vulnerable to simultaneous power surges, virus infection, cryptographic malware, RAM failure and a whole host of other failure modes. Two drives inside the same system are a lot less safe than one drive inside the system and a secondary separated drive, as most mishaps can take out both drives at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERemember that external discs tend to fail far more often than disks in computers, they get bumped around a lot for once.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you just use it around the house, not really.
