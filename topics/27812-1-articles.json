If you actually make a new part in a 3d modeling program sized to 1.25m BEFORE you export it to KSP compatible files, you will need to put \u0022rescaleFactor = 1\u0022 in the part.cfg or it will show up bigger than you wanted it to. However, if you sized the part to 1.00m before export, you don\u0027t need that line, as KSP\u0027s default value of 1.25 will size the part to match the \u0022small\u0022 tanks, engines, and pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a quick guide for what to set rescaleFactor to in order to get a part that will match up with 5 of the common diameters used in KSP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a part that was sized as 1.00m in the 3d modeling software:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eresult diameter: = rescaleFactor value\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.625m: = 0.625 (probe core sized)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.25m: N/A (KSP default) (Standard diameter of the FL-Txxx series fuel tanks, LV-xxx engine series, stock jet engines, and the single seat space capsule)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.5m: = 2.5 (Standard diameter of Rockomax products {including the \u0022orange tank\u0022}, and the 3 seat white command pod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.75m: = 3.75 (Largest diameter parts available in KW Rocketry pack)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.25m: = 6.25 (Largest diameter parts available in NovaPunch pack, and the largest \u0027standardized\u0027 diameter, however larger is possible)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a part that was sized as 1.25m in the 3d modeling software: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eresult diameter: = rescaleFactor value\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.625: = 0.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.25: = 1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.5: = 2.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.75: = 3.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.25: = 5.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this data helps you out! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: If someone has a part sized at any of the other diameters in this chart, there should be enough data points for them to be able to use simple algebra, a pencil and paper to figure out what number they need to put in for rescaleFactor, if any.
