Please refer to the changelogs linked above to see what\u0027s changed so far. This mod is \u003Cem\u003Eusable\u003C/em\u003E, but not \u003Cem\u003Efinished\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOriginal first post:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working on a mapping mod for a bit, and I\u0027m now at a point where I\u0027d say it\u0027s definitely not ready for release, but maybe ready for some feedback. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main aim of this mod is that mapping should work as a game. Meaning, you should be able to put a mapping satellite in an orbit and get a reasonably useful map by playing normally, without long waits. It should be fun to watch how your satellite uncovers the map, but you should still have to work for it a bit if you want the map to be \u003Cem\u003Eperfect\u003C/em\u003E. At the same time, all data is pulled from the game - \u0022faking it\u0022 by just showing you parts of an existing map isn\u0027t acceptable. I also wanted to be able to have several different sensors that show you different things under different conditions, which is something I\u0027m getting close to now. Unfortunately, if you haven\u0027t already guessed, all this meant realism has had a somewhat low priority so far...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESo what does this do?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XVuAHf8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XVuAHf8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what the main UI looks like right now. Every part in this mod opens this UI if you enable it via the right-click menu or action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this particular example, you can see that I have three scanning vessels active. Number 3 is the active vessel, which is why it\u0027s green, and the abbreviations below the map tell me that it has both low- and high-resolution altimetry sensors active as well as a slope detecting sensor. Because they\u0027re green; you\u0027re probably noticing a pattern here. It doesn\u0027t have a biome sensor active, it doesn\u0027t have an anomaly sensor active, and it also doesn\u0027t have a BTDT sensor, which is another anomaly sensor that can also identify (as in, name) anomalies, but has to be very close to do that (i.e. on a lander or a rover, not a satellite). Oh, and if any of these tags were orange, that\u0027d tell me I\u0027m at the wrong altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also see that these sensors cover a fairly large area of land - although the high resolution altimetry sensor covers a smaller area than the other sensors, which is why there are greyscale bands around my active satellite\u0027s track. The other satellite in orbit around Kerbin in this game only has a low resolution sensor, which is why \u003Cem\u003Eits\u003C/em\u003E track is \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E greyscale. And lastly, the vessel named \u0022Anomaly Scanner\u0022 is really a rover sitting near the KSC that has a BTDT sensor equipped, so it doesn\u0027t leave a visible track at all because this window currently only shows elevation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and that red line shows update progress, because this map is continuously rebuilt line by line. It\u0027s not as slow as it sounds, I promise. I could \u003Cem\u003Eprobably\u003C/em\u003E make it update completely live too, but this way should give more constant performance (and I liked the look of it...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously there are two buttons here that you can click. The one that says \u0022Forget Map\u0022 will reset all mapping data for this system. I mean it. It\u0027ll forget everything about whatever you\u0027re orbiting at the time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other one opens a larger map window. This is a part of that window showing a map of Eve:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cTbNjiN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cTbNjiN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo surprise here. It\u0027s a larger map with more detail than the smaller map. It takes a few seconds to render, because this is when the mod actually scans the terrain. It uses the same coverage data as the small map, meaning you\u0027ll see tracks of your satellites here too. But since that coverage data is recorded at a much lower resolution than this map, edges will be jaggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small square that looks like a magnified view of the two craters to the left of it is in fact a magnified view of those craters; you get it by right-clicking somewhere. If you right-click inside the magnified view, it\u0027ll magnify it even more, too. Good thing that satellite had a high resolution altimetry sensor on it, because otherwise this zoom would not be so useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe text at the bottom refers to the mouse position within the map (or the magnified bit). Green means there\u0027s data of that particular type, grey means there\u0027s no data of that type, and red means there would be data if the game had that kind of data (Eve does not have biomes, but if it ever gets biomes, then I would be able to see the biome in this location). The number is terrain height under the mouse cursor, again good thing that I had a high resolution sensor, because otherwise this number would be rounded to the nearest multiple of 500.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe buttons are pretty self explanatory, they switch display modes. You can also use them to refresh the map if your satellites have scanned some more land. The greyscale button actually affects all maps, or at least I hope it does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to say something about biomes here - you\u0027ve no doubt seen the biome map of Kerbin in that blog post that introduced biomes. That map is exactly what I can get from the game, too. I didn\u0027t really like the colour scheme, so biome maps rendered by this mod look different. Here\u0027s one showing Mun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rRsV7oN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rRsV7oN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual biome map from the game is very colourful, with lots of brightly coloured blobs of biome. Unfortunately, there is a small problem: There is a function in the API that seems to be made for finding the biome at a given location, but I couldn\u0027t figure out how to use it without printing debug messages to the screen. So I implemented my own interpretation of \u0022closest map color\u0022, meaning biome edges can be inaccurate on these maps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, since I mentioned anomaly detection before, here\u0027s the difference between the anomaly sensor you put on a satellite and the BTDT sensor:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mEsje76.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mEsje76.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the BTDT sensor on my rover I mentioned earlier has correctly identified the KSC, while the Island Airstrip nearby still shows up as a generic \u0022Anomaly\u0022. (Note, these names are pulled from the game too, if you don\u0027t like the lack of spaces or the extra zeroes in some, that\u0027s not my fault \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and another thing about this window: Every time a map is fully rendered, it\u0027s exported as a PNG image to the PluginData folder inside the mod\u0027s folder. Existing images get overwritten, so if you want to keep anything you should probably copy it somewhere safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESome other things that I think are nice about this\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Scanning a planet can be completed in a few minutes if you set up a good orbit, or throw enough satellites at the problem, and time warp for a bit. This mod doesn\u0027t actually interpolate positions during time warp, but with the current field of view sizes, I\u0027ve had good results from up to 1000x time warp around planets like Kerbin. Faster time warp works too, it just doesn\u0027t paint recognizable tracks anymore. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E All active scanners scan at the same time, including those on vessels in different SoIs. You don\u0027t have to keep your satellite as the active vessel until you\u0027re done, as long as your other vessel also has a part from this mod that can open the mapping interface. (The non-scanning one counts.) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Watching your satellites make pretty tracks doesn\u0027t use too much processing power and shouldn\u0027t slow anything down. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Works on Macs, too! At least on mine, anyway. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESo, what\u0027s the catch?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, near as I can tell, this mod is actually working as described, and usable even on my Macbook that struggles with running KSP in the first place. But there are some things that are just unfinished or bad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E All the parts in this mod currently use the same terrible mesh that I made to find out how to get a mesh into a mod, with a texture I made to find out how painting textures works in blender. I don\u0027t know how soon I can make the actual models. At least it looks vaguely like a sensor array. But it\u0027s not pretty, and it\u0027s not animated. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E It\u0027s not properly integrated with career mode yet. Currently, the parts should be hooked into \u0022Science Tech\u0022. Obviously, the plan is that the better sensors should come much later. But those sensors didn\u0027t even exist two complete refactorings ago. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Parts don\u0027t use electrical charge yet. This is never going to be perfect, as I can\u0027t drain charge on inactive vessels. But I still want it at least for the active one. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E I\u0027m also hoping that eventually, scanning planets and in particular, discovering anomalies, can generate science, but I don\u0027t even know where to look for that yet. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Map sizes aren\u0027t configurable yet. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The small updating map still needs a way to show progress for sensors other than altimetry. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Only scanning vessels (and the active vessel) are currently displayed on maps. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E All the map markers are basically text labels that start with an x or an o, which means they\u0027re all potentially off by a few pixels. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Scanning isn\u0027t very realistic, and I don\u0027t know if I can ever change this because it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E important to me that this works as part of a game. One thing I\u0027d like to do at some point is make the field of view dependant on the altitude of the scanning vessel. But the fairly low resolution coverage map limits this somewhat. And the amount I\u0027m willing to blow up persistence files limits the resolution of that coverage map. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Scanning (basically) only happens while the mapping interface is open. It wouldn\u0027t be too hard to make it go on while you\u0027re doing something completely unrelated on a different vessel, but I haven\u0027t gotten around to it yet. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E There are probably a bunch of bugs in the code too, since I haven\u0027t touched C# in about ten years. (You can probably tell...) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E There\u0027s even at least one bug visible on one of the pictures in this post... doh. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m looking for here is primarily feedback on whether I\u0027m on the right track with my ideas on making this a \u0022gamey\u0022 feature.
