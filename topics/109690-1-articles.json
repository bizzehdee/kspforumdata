When I\u0027m docking I keep it in staging mode and use wasdqe for rotation, and ijklhn for translation. The vast majority of my ships have enough torque to turn just fine without RCS, so I\u0027d like to save monoprop fuel while still being able to use both hands for docking.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T19:18:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 07:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adinfinitum**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cebi","CreatedById":138242,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T18:44:40Z","Content":"You can do this with linear RCS ports. Place 4 around CoM and then some facing forward and backward. Also using fine control mode [caps] saves vast amount of fuel for me as i dont need to compensate too much for my piloting errors..\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T11:10:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 11:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cebi**"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T18:59:57Z","Content":"I\u0027ve thought about doing that before, and as of right now it seems like the best option. The only thing I don\u0027t like about doing it that way is that as soon as the CoM shifts the linear ports will start firing for rotation, and finding fore and aft locations that are inline with the CoM isn\u0027t always easy. Fine control definitely helps save fuel, I only ever turn it off when I need full power from my RCS."},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T19:02:25Z","Content":"This is a feature I would also like.
