I managed to get into an orbit around Vall in the regular game without having any sort of orbital insertion. It seems that you sort of \u0022overshoot\u0022 the SOI entry, and by the time the game catches up, you\u0027ve moved a bit, so it puts you in with a slightly different position and velocity.
