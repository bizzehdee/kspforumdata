One of these disturbances is an arc about 20 percent brighter than its surroundings, 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) long and 6 miles (10 kilometers) wide. Scientists also found unusual protuberances in the usually smooth profile at the ring\u0027s edge. Scientists believe the arc and protuberances are caused by the gravitational effects of a nearby object. Details of the observations were published online today (April 14, 2014) by the journal Icarus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe object is not expected to grow any larger, and may even be falling apart. But the process of its formation and outward movement aids in our understanding of how Saturn\u0027s icy moons, including the cloud-wrapped Titan and ocean-holding Enceladus, may have formed in more massive rings long ago. It also provides insight into how Earth and other planets in our solar system may have formed and migrated away from our star, the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We have not seen anything like this before,\u0022 said Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London, and the report\u0027s lead author. \u0022We may be looking at the act of birth, where this object is just leaving the rings and heading off to be a moon in its own right.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe object, informally named Peggy, is too small to see in images so far. Scientists estimate it is probably no more than about a half mile in diameter. Saturn\u0027s icy moons range in size depending on their proximity to the planet -- the farther from the planet, the larger. And many of Saturn\u0027s moons are comprised primarily of ice, as are the particles that form Saturn\u0027s rings. Based on these facts, and other indicators, researchers recently proposed that the icy moons formed from ring particles and then moved outward, away from the planet, merging with other moons on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Witnessing the possible birth of a tiny moon is an exciting, unexpected event,\u0022 said Cassini Project Scientist Linda Spilker, of NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif. According to Spilker, Cassini\u0027s orbit will move closer to the outer edge of the A ring in late 2016 and provide an opportunity to study Peggy in more detail and perhaps even image it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible the process of moon formation in Saturn\u0027s rings has ended with Peggy, as Saturn\u0027s rings now are, in all likelihood, too depleted to make more moons. Because they may not observe this process again, Murray and his colleagues are wringing from the observations all they can learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The theory holds that Saturn long ago had a much more massive ring system capable of giving birth to larger moons,\u0022 Murray said. \u0022As the moons formed near the edge, they depleted the rings and evolved, so the ones that formed earliest are the largest and the farthest out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.
