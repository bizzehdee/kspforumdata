Perhaps there will be a Navigation skill that concerns how accurately they can perform a maneuver you planned. Bill might get the maneuver to within 0.1m/sec of the goal, for example, while Bob can only get to within 2m/sec. So, you\u0027d let Bill handle the transfer burns.

It\u0027s only close enough and close enough is good enough. I was so nervous for my first interplanetary burn to Eve. Of course, I messed it up and ended up in a 180 degree orbit without enough fuel to get home. But I got there... that\u0027s the first step. I learned so much from that very first one. The second one sucked too, but it was better. Many burns later and I understand it to the point of it being just another burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint is, if you stray a little from your blue node marker on the navball, close enough will be good enough. If you don\u0027t burn exactly the amount of D-V the node tells you, close enough is good enough.
