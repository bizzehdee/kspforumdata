The transfer vehicle would likely stay on orbit until the planned transfer anyway, because ti would be well planned. The crew could do other science on orbit (remove rovers?), and such contingencies would presumably have been considered (because NASA). The whole not telling the crew subplot would have to go away, and he\u0027d be less alone.
