Your parachute will semi deploy at different altitudes depending on the atmosphere. If you look at the ocean blue part of the altitude meter that shows lowest part of atmosphere and so on until the dark grey which represents space. In the second portion to the far right (ocean blue part) it will have a white line connecting to the bottom of the bar, unusually random as it is larger than all the other lines. But, it is the point where your parachute will semi deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T22:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts#Parachutes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EChute parameters are here\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like your probe is running out of electricity on the way down.
