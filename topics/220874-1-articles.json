Think of a laser vessel with an engine at one end and a giant laser lens at the other... or a giant phased laser array that can fire in a cone arc without moving. Ironically a fleet of these is excellent for long range missile intercept IF they all mass laser focus with a combined beam on whatever target they wish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefense Space Vessel (DSV): Designed for active defense of one sort or another. For example an anti-laser vessel would be a sandcaster, firing off sand in the direction of laser zaps to weaken the beam intensity. With sandcaster pulsed fire acceleration measured in thousands of g\u0027s. For example, a cannon could fire pulses of sand in a cone shaped beam at 4000g. Excellent for wrecking incoming missiles as well as weakening laser beam intensity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBattle Outcomes: Inteligence is key... and lack of it would be a deciding factor in battles. I find it amusing how in Star Trek they go hopping from solar system to solar system not knowing what they will face and yet more often than not their weapons are are the right ones for the job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, a defense sandcaster vessel would be excellent at short range space combat (4000g sandcaster blasts sprayed liberally will kill anything), but at long range it would not be effective and a good counter to it would be a fleet of laserstars focusing a massed beam upon it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuantity is a quality of it\u0027s own, and I would argue that a large enough fleet of laserstars could only be beaten by a sufficient amount of missiles or sandcasters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStar Trek Combat Speed: At star trek combat speeds (literally flying up to orbit a planet in less than a minute after you can see it in the window with your eyes) missiles are more or less obsolete unless they can actually keep up. Certainly no real missile we could make could. The more ridiculously fast space vessels are, the more lasers and ultra high g sandcasters become the only weapons that matter much at all in my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-18T20:16:55Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2023 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 18\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-18T21:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\npoint defense certainly looks cooler in scifi than shield percentage callouts. its why space battles in bsg or the expanse are a lot more interesting than in star trek. star wars has shields but doesn\u0027t abandon point defense, which i think makes more sense and is a lot more realistic (tactically speaking). its pretty much the onion model, where you have a layered defense strategy instead of a single space magic system. realistically speaking i have my doubts that scifi force fields will be all that useful and can be penetrated by neutral particle beams and lasers and will fail catastrophically with kinetic weapons. electronic warfare might be a thing, you might have hackers on your crew that try to break into incoming warheads and either self destruct them or turn them on their own launch platforms.\u00A0 stealth, diversion and mimicry are all going to be other layers in that defense. and lets not forget diplomacy and subterfuge. art of war stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-18T23:32:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMotie novel(s) shields had problems.\u00A0 \u00A0Although, tbh, you \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E fly into a star with them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint defense is cool looking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I might remind is that the entire history of humanity shows a stagger -
