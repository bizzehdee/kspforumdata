But you want to escape Kerbin heading prograde relative to your solar orbit, not radially in! So this is not ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, you need to start firing your engines some time before midnight Kerbin time. How long before midnight depends on how much delta-V you need to apply (in other words, where you intend to go). Why? Because the more delta-V you add, the less your escape trajectory will be bent by Kerbin\u0027s gravity, and the straighter (closer to tangential) your escape trajectory becomes. Imagine if you had infinite TWR and could instantly add 50,000 m/s of delta V. Well then your escape trajectory would be tangential to the point you did your burn, with Kerbin having almost no effect on the trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that to burn for closer planets (Duna), you start your burn earlier (closer to sunset Kerbin time). To reach further planets (Jool) you start your burn closer to midnight Kerbin time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-24T01:47:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2013 01:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T01:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, just ran the test.
