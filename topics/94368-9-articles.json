I set up for an aerocapture around Duna, but it didn\u0027t work, even though trajectories said it would. So I reloaded and tried again, nope, still didn\u0027t capture. I couldn\u0027t figure out what it thought was happening but I definitely wasn\u0027t capturing before leaving the atmosphere. Finally it dawned on me...\u003Cp\u003ESo, what was happening is that I just happened to be lined up so perfectly that with the proper aerobrake, I would have left Duna\u0027s SOI, hit my apoapsis around the sun, and come back down into Duna\u0027s SOI a second time, right into the planets atmosphere and then captured. It was calculating a second aerobrake only after leaving and re-entering the planets SOI. I don\u0027t know if this can be fixed, but I can\u0027t imagine anyone planning their trajectory beyond the planets current SOI.

Stack mounted parts are now occluded from drag by neighboring parts, and lift induced drag is also properly simulated. Both the lift and drag are dependent on air density and the speed of sound, which are calculated from temperature and pressure.
