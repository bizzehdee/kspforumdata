This is because in a \u003Cem\u003Eproper\u003C/em\u003E analysis of a jet engine, when considering mass flow you would have the mass flow of air out balanced by the mass flow of air in through the intake, resulting in the only change in mass of the vehicle being the fuel flow, so it\u0027s the only significant bit of mass flow to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good way to show yourself that this is the only way that makes it kosher is that if you count the \u003Cem\u003Eentire\u003C/em\u003E mass flow out the exhaust, then exhaust velocity = Isp * g0. Now, if you have a jet that has an Isp of 4000s (approximately correct for a low-bypass turbofan), if the \u003Cem\u003Eentire\u003C/em\u003E mass flow were counted towards the exhaust velocity, this would imply that it was shooting air out the back at 4000s * 9.81 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E = 39,240 m/s. Which is 3.5 times Earth\u0027s escape velocity. Obviously, that interpretation makes no sense, so logically, we can determine that the standard definition of Isp for jets must use is mass flow of fuel alone, not total mass through the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in KSP, they use total mass through the engine. You can check this yourself by going and changing the IntakeAir requirements of a jet part and see how much fuel it consumes if it\u0027s demanding 15 air per unit LF or 2 air per unit LF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR: Current stock jets have \u0022true\u0022 exhaust velocities greater than Kerbin escape velocity, and at peak performance, greater than Earth escape velocity (11.2 km/s). Somehow reacting less mass they produce more energy to accelerate remass than rocket engines do, and this is broken.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the original NTR-being-balanced-or-bot discussion, It is heavy, and its TWR is terrible compared to the real-life concept. On the other hand, it can use storable propellants instead of LH2. Once you consider how OP LF / O is as a propellant combination (good density, perfectly storable, peak Isp of 390s in non-NTRs), the performance of the stock NTR is actually pretty-well on par. I\u0027d prefer needing special propellant for it and giving it a bit of a serious buff in terms of thrust or Isp to make up for that, but I find it odd to run an NTR on the same stuff as a standard motor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T14:22:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r_rolo1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r_rolo1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis.
