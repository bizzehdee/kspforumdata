Because I\u0027ve been playing around with those concepts, I\u0027ve found what I need is LOTS OF FUEL in my interplanetary probes to account for noob mistakes, non-optimal orbital shifts, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found a number of \u0022heavy lifters\u0022 on this site that can lift between 40-80T into LKO, and that\u0027s great... but I wanted more. Because bigger is better! And everyone needs a 200T fuel depot orbiting Eeloo!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft launched my Eeloo lander (attached) with 250T of fuel into LKO. I then traveled to Eeloo and landed on the surface with 150T of fuel total (most still in orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft also works for launching huge space stations or fuel depots into LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign considerations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) \u0022Low\u0022 partcount--457 parts! (plus lander). This ensures as minimal lag as I could with a design this large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Stable construction. While occasionally I do find a part break (\u0026lt;10% of launches), it appears to be pretty rare. This is due to extensive strutting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) No part clipping or cheating during construction of the ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Easy to fly--ASAS should work without ripping the ship apart\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Every other tweak I could find to ensure maximum payload delivery (asparagus staging)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) My main hope is that this lifter helps some new people to the game to be able to launch ships that can travel to wherever they want, and have plenty of fuel and parts to spare. Hopefully this ship can be featured in the first post as a super heavy lifter platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Ugly. It must be ugly. Apparently...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemaining Bugs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Rarely I will have an attachment break. I\u0027d be interested if anyone can improve the strutting to eliminate that without drastic increase in partcount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The ship begins to rotate, especially in upper atmosphere. I\u0027m not sure, but I think this might be related to the fuel transferring between stages, and I\u0027ve added a number of RCS thrusters to stop the rolling. You may have to switch off ASAS and manually maneuver to stop the rolling. I\u0027d love if someone could eliminate this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://illatia.yhbt.com/Lothsahn%20Heavy%20Lifter.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Lothsahn%20Heavy%20Lifter.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstructions for Modification:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) If you change the probe or lander on top, be sure to strut appropriately to reduce wobble\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If you change the fuel middle stage (above the decoupler), be sure to strut at least 2 struts per orange Rockomax tank to replace the ones there. These are vital to structrual integrity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) If you change the fuel middle stage, you may need to change the root module with the SelectRoot mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I strongly recommend at least 4 nuclear engines on the lander (if not more). If you have less engines, you\u0027ll find orbital maneuvers take a very very long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) You may wish to put a decoupler on the bottom center mainsail engine to jettison it once you get to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstructions for Use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike most massive ships, you can safely use ASAS with mine! This makes it a breeze to fly (mostly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Enable ASAS and disable RCS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Throttle to 75%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Hit the first stage to release the docking clamps. Once the clamps release, immediately go to 100% throttle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Remain at 100% throttle throughout the entire ascent\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Go to a 45 degree attitude at 25k altitude and finally nearly level at 50-55k to finish the ascent and attain orbital velocity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) After you drop all of the outer tanks and the lower two sets of orange tanks, enable RCS to control the rolling of the ship. The ship will start to roll agressively above 25k-30k without RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) You may have to disable ASAS at 40-60k altitude and manually correct the rolling. You can then re-enable ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) All upper-stage tanks are connected by docking clamps. Transfer fuel and jettison them as they become empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Switch to the control module on the lander and use nuclear engines from your lander or probe for orbital maneuvering for optimal fuel-efficiency. I recommend at least 4 to avoid boredom, as the entire craft is quite sluggish when the 3 orange rockomax tanks are still connected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://illatia.yhbt.com/Lothsahn%20Heavy%20Lifter.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://illatia.yhbt.com/Lothsahn%20Heavy%20Lifter.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Right click and save as)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-14T03:44:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2014 03:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Lothsahn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camaron","CreatedById":100218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T03:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWOW!
