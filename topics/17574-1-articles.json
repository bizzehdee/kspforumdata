The PAMELA experiment detected orders of magnitude higher levels of antiprotons than are expected from normal particle decays while passing through the SAA. This suggests the van Allen belts confine a significant flux of antiprotons produced by the interaction of the Earth\u0027s upper atmosphere with cosmic rays.[17] The energy of the antiprotons has been measured in the range from 60 - 750 MeV.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting, eh?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rascal Nag","CreatedById":9451,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T04:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, I\u0027ve read about that as well. There are some practical applications to this, in fact. One possible mission would be to send up a craft which would use magnetic fields to trap the antimatter, which could then be used in space endeavors (using the captured antimatter in matter-antimatter pulse spacecraft, capable of reaching relativistic speeds). Of course, all these ideas that have been proposed are highly theoretical and are pretty much just fun things to think about at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
