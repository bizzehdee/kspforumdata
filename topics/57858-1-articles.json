For the record I\u0027ve been to the Mun and Minmus on several occasions, and have a partially crashed / parked probe on Duna. I\u0027m also playing without any mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I just recently built a rover, but it wasn\u0027t what I wanted. My problem is that I cannot figure out how to rotate a part (like a wheel assembly) and attach it to the side of another part (like a mobile lab). Every attempt puts the wheels on the bottom, forcing my lab to roll around on it\u0027s end looking like a mobile beer can on the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If it helps to visualize it, this thread contains images of what I was trying to construct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63481-Runaway-rover-Science-Lab\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63481-Runaway-rover-Science-Lab\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-27T08:04:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2013 08:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ODaily\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EQuestion answered.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bongpig","CreatedById":44042,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T05:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Q\u0022, \u0022W\u0022, \u0022E\u0022, \u0022A\u0022, \u0022S\u0022, \u0022D\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose keys will rotate parts.

Zoom in close, use WASDQE to rotate, and use small struts to attach parts in places without attachment points. This is also how you use clipping without cheating, which allows you to pack more into your designs, keeping them compact and much better looking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ODaily","CreatedById":98717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T07:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome.
