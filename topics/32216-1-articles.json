Yes despite being natural scientists and obsessed with rocketry Kerbals have souls which make their way back to the ancestral home of Kerbin on death, floating all the way back takes time though so you\u0027d be without that Kerbal for as long as it took his soul to make it\u0027s way home, could be a year or more depending where in the solar system you blew up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce it arrives the soul flies straight to the hallowed cactus patch from whence all Kerbals originate, picture thousands of Kerbal shaped cactuses lying around waiting for souls to enter them, after which they get up, rub their eyes, have all their memories come flooding back and head straight for the nearest space center. (that wouldn\u0027t happen in the game of course, the kerbal would just re-appear ready to be sent, this is just background story.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr scenario two: Every kerbal is fitted with a chip that sends a complete copy of it\u0027s host\u0027s brain back to a cloning factory on Kerbin every 30 minutes, now this process takes a while of course so X amount of time passes before Jebediah II opens his eyes inside a cloning vat and pounds on the glass till they let him out for another space-ride, all memories and stats of the original Kerbal are implanted in the new clone, might explain why all Kerbals look the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis wouldn\u0027t stop new kerbals from spawning however because you\u0027d need a new one while the replica of your much loved Kerbal is made/soul flying back, what do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T21:59:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d prefer perma death for career mode, it\u0027d give it more of a realistic feel to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ecat","CreatedById":68747,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T22:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe something like resurrecting a favourite minion in Overlord II.
