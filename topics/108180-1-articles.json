Because I had to spend a lot of dV on \\*raising periapsis\\* after successful aerobraking (and Gilly is in quite high orbit). I now suspect that I would\u0027ve been better just capturing to high orbit by burning.\n\nI googled it a bit but cant find any previous guide/discussion on topic,- basically when it makes sense \\*not\\* to aerobrake?

Then create a maneuver node at periapsis and drag retrograde until you have achieved your desired orbit.\n\nYou will find that for a typical, ideal Hohmann transfer to Eve, your dV cost to brake into orbit will exceed a kilometer per second. If you want to brake into a *low* orbit, it will likely exceed 1.5 km/s.\n\nConversely with aerocapture, you skip this insertion burn entirely, but you may have to invest 100-150 or so m/s in dV to raise your periapsis out of the atmosphere afterwards.\n\nSaving 90% sounds like a pretty good deal to me, to be honest ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"RidingTheFlow","CreatedById":111197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T11:15:05Z","Content":"Raising periapsis just above atmosphere is not expensive, true.

WHEN DONE RIGHT, aerocapture/ aerobraking can be a very efficient method, but again, you have to do it right. This is easier said than done, as you\u0027re basically walking a tightrope. In real life aerobraking is done VERY conservatively, where it takes many months and many passes through the atmosphere to get the final orbit.

(and you can aerobrake at jool, then aerobrake at laythe, but I just aerobrake at laythe...I think its still OK with the rentry heating as it is now).\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure it also is easy at Duna... Ike has a big SOI, so its easy to aerocapture at duna, and enter Ike\u0027s SOI... at which point, its easy.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, your Apoapsis doesn\u0027t need to be the right height, just pretty far out there.\n\nFor example, the difference between getting a Mun encounter, and a Minmus encounter, is 90 m/s.\n\nAerobrake and get a large apoapsis, and its easy to adjust.

To do that, you can of course take many shallow passes, but that\u0027s boring... A solution is to do just like what you do when thrusting: \n\nTo avoid affecting your periphasis you want to gain/bleed off speed as close to it as possible.\n\nYou can use airbrakes/parachutes close to the periphasis, then desactivate them when you are too far from it, to remove unwanted drag.

Unfortunately, achieving precise eccentric orbit with aerobraking looks extremely difficult even with save-load, since any m/s at periapsis aerobraking makes massive difference in apoapsis height.
