I\u0027ve found out how to make materials but can\u0027t assign them to the objects that are missing materials, and I can\u0027t make the hierarchy window appear either (by clicking in the menu or pressing ctrl\u002B4).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did just upgrade to windows 10 and haven\u0027t reinstalled unity, not sure if I need to or not.
