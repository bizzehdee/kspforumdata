It has changed since I used to be OakTree42 and am now TheReadPanda.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo right now it has the following features:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. You can select the gender of your kerbal hires or make them random (male/female/random)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. You can select the career of your kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. You can select a number of kerbals to hire (1 to 10) but this is limited to what you can afford or what the Astronaut complex can hold in career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. You can set the kerbal Courage Stat (Higher is better!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. You can set the kerbal Stupidity Stat (Lower is better!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. You can set the kerbal Fearless attribute (On/Off - Game code calls this BadAss)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. You can hire said kerbals with a hire button. If you are in career mode the various options you pick will change your cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. In career mode you can hire level 0 kerbals without upgrading the complex, level 0\u0026amp;1 if you upgrade it once and 0, 1, and 2 if you have fully upgraded the complex. Note it costs more to hire more experienced kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9. If you are in career mode each kerbal that is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Missing in action\u0022\u003EMIA\u003C/abbr\u003E in a profession raises the cost of that profession by 5%. If you are in a mode that results in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E each kerbal of that profession that is killed raises costs for that profession type by 10%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote the cost increases are cumulative, so two dead kerbals results in a 20% increase if they were both pilots. If you have a bunch of dead pilots but not a single dead scientist it should not effect the scientist costs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for now that is it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to all those who helped me update this to 1.2.

The more wildcards you allow the bigger the discount on hire.

I\u0027ll see if I can think of something here though. What about a system where you hit a button and it pulls up three kerbals with stats /near/ what you requested? So you can pick from say three (each name shown along with stats). So you don\u0027t get the exact stats you want but you get a range of things near your desired stats?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can also see the fearless trait being random again, not just a yes/no but I do think that you should be able to see it if it will effect some mods... as it does in some efficiency math.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll see what I can think up, but with streaming it may be a week or two until I can nail down that kind of change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sochin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sochin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooks interesting.

I would like to add a \u0027training\u0027 area as well, where you can train up kerbals rather than just hiring them fully trained.
