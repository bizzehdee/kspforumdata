It has changed since I used to be OakTree42 and am now TheReadPanda.\n\nSo right now it has the following features:\n\n1. You can select the gender of your kerbal hires or make them random (male/female/random)\n\n2. You can select the career of your kerbal.\n\n3. You can select a number of kerbals to hire (1 to 10) but this is limited to what you can afford or what the Astronaut complex can hold in career mode.\n\n4. You can set the kerbal Courage Stat (Higher is better!)\n\n5. You can set the kerbal Stupidity Stat (Lower is better!)\n\n6. You can set the kerbal Fearless attribute (On/Off - Game code calls this BadAss)\n\n7. You can hire said kerbals with a hire button. If you are in career mode the various options you pick will change your cost.\n\n8. In career mode you can hire level 0 kerbals without upgrading the complex, level 0\u00261 if you upgrade it once and 0, 1, and 2 if you have fully upgraded the complex. Note it costs more to hire more experienced kerbals.\n\n9. If you are in career mode each kerbal that is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Missing in action\u0022\u003EMIA\u003C/abbr\u003E in a profession raises the cost of that profession by 5%. If you are in a mode that results in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E each kerbal of that profession that is killed raises costs for that profession type by 10%.\n\nNote the cost increases are cumulative, so two dead kerbals results in a 20% increase if they were both pilots. If you have a bunch of dead pilots but not a single dead scientist it should not effect the scientist costs.\n\nAnd for now that is it.\n\nThanks to all those who helped me update this to 1.2. It was a bit of a slog but here we are!\n\nSpecial shout out to Drakonite for help on my Twitch channel while we reworked this for 1.2!\n\nNote we added functionality for the new \u0027noExp\u0027 mode in career as well!\n\nupdated as of 10/20/2016\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-17T21:04:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2016 09:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by TheReadPanda**\n  \nUpdated for 1.2.1"},{"CreatedByName":"TheReadPanda","CreatedById":142617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T20:42:19Z","Content":"![newAC.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OakTree42/KSI-Hiring/master/newAC.png) \u003C---New // Old --\u003E ![oldAC.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OakTree42/KSI-Hiring/master/oldAC.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"One-Way Films","CreatedById":90926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T21:09:21Z","Content":"This is just amazing!

It is designed to hopefully not leave any extra kerbals in memory. \n\nWas tricky as I tried a lot of different ways but ended up having to use brute force or use crew roster method of overriding things and I really wanted to make it so that if you removed my mod nothing you made would change on you. \n\nSo while it is a bit \u0027brute force\u0027 it did work.

So you don\u0027t get the exact stats you want but you get a range of things near your desired stats?\n\nI can also see the fearless trait being random again, not just a yes/no but I do think that you should be able to see it if it will effect some mods... as it does in some efficiency math.\n\nI\u0027ll see what I can think up, but with streaming it may be a week or two until I can nail down that kind of change.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Looks interesting.

I would like to add a \u0027training\u0027 area as well, where you can train up kerbals rather than just hiring them fully trained. But again, want to wait until I see what is coming down the pipe with the UI changes in the shift to Unity 5.0...."},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T18:06:53Z","Content":"Kottabos review - : [https://youtu.be/Zqlu4Skc7NI](https://youtu.be/Zqlu4Skc7NI)\n\nEDIT : add do a trainging option where the kerbal goes out for like : 1 mth?
