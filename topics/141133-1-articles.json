I am doing a very large amount of rotations slowly dropping the altitude(accidentally used up my fuel). I noticed that when I warp here to get around into the atmosphere again I am not getting the full amount of drop on the apoapsis. This is because it is not stopping the warp at the 90k mark for the atmosphere but where I pointed it to warp. It used to do this whenever you warped into an atmosphere, I presume to make it calculate various affects. Was this removed as a feature or is this a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this was removed as a feature it is very annoying as it makes finding the right spot to warp very tedious, time consuming, or inefficient wasting more time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-03T18:09:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2016 06:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T00:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just rechecked that aspect of timewarping on Kerbin. It does still work there -- it should also still work on Eve. However, it timewarps by skipping little timeslices. So if your stay in Eve\u0027s upper atmosphere is quite short, then you will miss a significant fraction of it in those skipped timeslices. It only applies atmospheric drag once it actually recognizes the fact\u00A0that you are in an atmosphere. So make sure you stop each\u00A0timewarp a little before your Pe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, timewarping does not end instantly. If you are doing a 50x timewarp\u00A0and hit an atmosphere, the game will reduce the timewarp in steps down to zero. During those 50 steps, there will not be any atmospheric drag. So yes, you are missing a lot of it if you timewarp too far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is also true that there is a bug in version 1.1.2 that makes orbits decay (lose altitude on both Ap and Pe) if you don\u0027t timewarp at all. So your goal will probably be achieved faster by limiting your timewarping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-04T00:36:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2016 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
