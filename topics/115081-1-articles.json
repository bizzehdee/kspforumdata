Radiators kill parts for no apparent reason, especially upon coming out of warp.\n\nI see no reason to put radiators on a ship. As far as I can tell, nothing stock in the game right now produces enough heat to warrant having them, they don\u0027t appear to help reentry (nor should they, realistically), and they DO cause the parts they\u0027re attached to to explode for no damn reason.\n\nSo don\u0027t use radiators. You don\u0027t even need them at Moho."},{"CreatedByName":"jordan drake","CreatedById":147474,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T05:06:48Z","Content":"oh thank you!!!! just did it perfectly fine without them.

Seems more like they \u0027suck\u0027 all the heat out of a ships parts, which is theoretically a good thing. What is not good is the amount of heat they tend to amass, especially engine heat, leading to radiators and attached parts to overheat extremly fast and explode."}]}
