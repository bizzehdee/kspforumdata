One detail that caught my eye, though, is the legacy section. I understand legacy as prominent figures that have left the team for one reason or another, the question here is: why did some just disapear?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, NovaSilisko is in that legacy section and no official announcement and/or comment has been made on his situation. He was \u0022on leave\u0022 and then just dropped off the radar. Another one would be Artyom, who was hired into the team and now was, erm, unhired (once again without any clues)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother detail is the silence in the KSP Weekly (or Daily Kerbal) about those new developers. Are they just not working?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize in advance if any of this was inaccurate or if I missed something else. I highly appreciate the team and the game they\u0027re making.

Every moderator here is an active member of the community who has stood out because of their personality. They were helping people, bundling information and constructive in their remarks. Some moderators have slightly different tasks than others, that\u0027s why you\u0027ll mostly see \u0027green names\u0027 closing threads or giving infractions and it\u0027s also why you\u0027ll see \u0027blue names\u0027 post less frequently. I spend most of my time here overseeing the moderators and helping out behind the scenes. I don\u0027t post as often as I used to, or as often as I\u0027d like to but there\u0027s only so many hours in the day and I can\u0027t spend them all on the community. Despite that you can often find me in the IRC channel or during the KSP-TV streams and the same goes for a lot of the moderators here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModerators do police the forums but as the people before me have said (and I think this is a very good point) we\u0027re here to guide the forums and to provide a place where everyone can share their enthusiasm and vision for the game. The moderation team consists of roughly 30 awesome volunteers I\u0027d hire any day of the week. The fact that we\u0027re able to run this community so well is not only down to the moderators though: the community itself is fantastic! It consists of almost 100,000 people (5,500 active) who treat eachother and the developers with respect. You\u0027d be surprised how few infractions are actually given. So there, that\u0027s a big compliment for you! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T13:19:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a small bit of this that I can agree with, we\u0027re encouraged by the weekly/daily to know who the devs are, this is a good thing. It\u0027s nice to know something about the people that are involved with the project. The downside to this is that when they leave the project, you do tend to wonder what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI work with a number of small companies, and I\u0027ve seen a lot of employee turnover - people I have face to face interactions with on an almost daily basis. When that happens, sometimes you are told why, sometimes not. I might be curious, but it\u0027s not my place to push the issue. Many companies pretty much have a policy of not talking about ex-employees. It doesn\u0027t surprise me that Squad may have decided to go down that route, and from a legal standpoint it\u0027s probably the thing to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the moderators, you guys are doing a good job. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beachernaut","CreatedById":69994,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T15:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA company not discussing former employees is standard procedure. This follows every company I\u0027ve ever interacted with. Heck, the only reason I know when an employee in my company leaves is because user administration and employee access is part of my job, so I have to know. However, I\u0027m never told why they left. I think the difference here is that with Squad interacting with the community as much as they do, and the community itself being more personable than most, we as players are more concerned about the well being of both the developers, and the community as a whole. You don\u0027t generally see this with the larger game developers. I play quite a few EA games, and the thought about their employees has never crossed my mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs KSP grows and gets more involved as a game, I would expect that Squad will not be able to put the personal touch on the community that they did in the beginning.

Having moderated on a couple forums (large and small), I understand that 1 thread lock, 1 infraction, or a deleted post will completely negate the last 50 reply\u0027s you made assisting other members. Moderating is a time consuming and thankless job. Since it is usually volunteer work, most moderators do it out of a desire to assist the community. That alone should be worthy of our respect.
