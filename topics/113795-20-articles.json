One of the double-death scenarios involved the F-18 shooting off the tips of the MRF\u0027s wings, and the MRF continuing to fly as a lifting body and getting a lucky shot with the 20mm as the F-18 blew past, causing it to careen into a mountain. The F-18 managed to rend itself in twain during a daring maneuver once, and the MRF-2 ran out of fuel once. One fight, a whole lot of nothing happened, and the MRF-2 performed this insane climb maneuver and went into space, eventually re-entering and returning to safe flight almost 100km away in what I would consider an incredible disengage action. I suppose this is one of the reasons we need to keep those engines throttled down, heheh.

However, if I adjusted each plane\u0027s control value mid-flight, the Su-27 became more maneuverable than mine, but couldn\u0027t keep up on speed, and it became a much more even match. That 30mm gun is a beast (having taken out my cockpit several times), and your Su-27 is a tank, having gotten hit by a sidewinder and losing nothing but some missiles and its air intakes!\u003Cp\u003EI was running these dogfights at 100% thrust for both craft, with a max speed set at ~400m/s as it was much more interesting that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I need to try my craft vs some other craft!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: The F-16 proved too unstable, even under 30% control value, preventing it to perform even basic combat flight without fatally stalling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Rafale also proved quite unstable, but was still able to function. Unfortunately, after three flights, each ended with an AIM-120 up the rear, despite chaff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe F-18 proved an incredibly even match with each plane allowed full control authority. Incredibly, even with one of its wings shot off, the F-18 continued to haphazardly maneuver and remain flying, taking shots at the other craft when possible! However, with its combat maneuverability compromised, it was only a matter of time before it was finished off. Now to continue on for a best-of-three... I\u0027m almost daunted by this, considering each of the matches with prior craft took about 10 minutes each, and against the F-18, even the first lasted almost a half hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, things started moving faster when I upped max thrust to full. I\u0027m not sure I can declare a clear winner here. Both managed to destroy each other 2/7 times (both died from combat-related injuries), and killed the other unscathed once. One of the double-death scenarios involved the F-18 shooting off the tips of the MRF\u0027s wings, and the MRF continuing to fly as a lifting body and getting a lucky shot with the 20mm as the F-18 blew past, causing it to careen into a mountain. The F-18 managed to rend itself in twain during a daring maneuver once, and the MRF-2 ran out of fuel once. One fight, a whole lot of nothing happened, and the MRF-2 performed this insane climb maneuver and went into space, eventually re-entering and returning to safe flight almost 100km away in what I would consider an incredible disengage action. I suppose this is one of the reasons we need to keep those engines throttled down, heheh.

At this point, I wouldn\u0027t say it is the most capable fighter; however, it is capable of almost any role you\u0027ll need of it, hence the MRF designation (MutiRole Fighter). It is capable of a 9g turn in the transonic range, and exceeds at speeds of around 350m/s-400m/s. Current maximum payload is unknown. Maximum AoA is about 21\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (above 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 is not suggested), yet the craft is still capable of control up to nearly 23\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. It has yaw instability under mach speeds, but becomes fully stable after. It weighs 9.6t dry, and 12.5t carrrying 496.5L of fuel, and 1300 rounds of 20mm ammunition. Maximum LO weight to be determined. After testing, I would say it has a maximum operational altitude of ~17.5, capable of pulling 3g turns exceeding mach 3. Capable of reaching Mach 3.3 in level flight at an optimal cruising altitude of 16700m without use of afterburners. A safe operational range of 180km (Maximum range of 250km, or 500km round trip) without external fuel stores, and not using fuel stores in clipped parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop speed has not been determined, as it involves melting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis data is particularly important if we\u0027re thinking about looking at stealth craft, as not using afterburners becomes important for maintaining a low thermal signature. That entire run totaled 0:20:30 (man these engines are inefficient), and could have been done more efficiently if afterburners were used to get up to altitude and speed before cruising, but I really just wanted to see how fast and high I could go without using afterburners. I will likely continue to modify the plane, possibly to be lighter and more maneuverable. The optimal cruising altitude was determined by testing what altitude would allow the thrust and drag to be at the best balance. I\u0027m sure the math could be done on it, but I\u0027m too lazy to figure that out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the outer wing sections are what stall, and if I made it a singular piece, I\u0027m sure I could achieve better results... Also, the plane is likely to require a major redesign when 1.1 rolls out, as the profile of the Panther engine is much different, and will likely modify drag behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther testing, and repeated dogfights have shown the plane to be stupid maneuverable; particularly at speeds over 320m/s. The AI tends to try to stall it out, but once it gets up to speed, it\u0027s a bit ridiculous. Soon, I\u0027ll load it up with hardpoints, so it can be equipped for proper combat, but these initial tests were done as vulcans only dogfights against my old adversary: the FA-18J. At speeds of 400m/s and up, the MRF-3D won every time. At speeds of 350m/s and below, there was no point at which the FA-18J could get the MRF-3D in its sights long enough to shoot before the MRF-3D banked out of the way; however, they were both so unwilling to slow down that it just became this strange skydance until the MRF-3D ran out of fuel or they ran into eachother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may need to change its reporting name to Stingray, because that\u0027s what it really looks like when flying about.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T04:55:25Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 04:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheHengeProphet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T15:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DiamondHawk427\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DiamondHawk427\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it ok if engines stightly merge? for making crafts such as f-104, they have very close engines\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes engines can have slight overlaps, but just so you know, the F-104 only had 1 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T16:00:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of the F-104, it weighed less than 10t fully loaded.
