Bac9, K3|Chris, and Taverius (with some other talented contributors too) made something awesome, and Blowfish has stepped up to the plate, taking the lead, and spending his free time to work on making it up-to-date. And every once in a while, some bystanding non-contributor steps up to voice their opinion that some stranger they never met, who owes them nothing, is going too slow. Contribute, or voice your thanks for the effort that somebody else is doing to bring awesomeness back into your life.
