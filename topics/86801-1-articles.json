These turrets usually are just guns that move. And that\u0027s okay, that makes them simple. However when you look at real world aircraft, these turrets are almost always manned, glass compartments on the top, bottom or front and back of the plane. One of my favourite WWII fighters, the rather obscure Boulton Paul Defiant, is a weird example of a conventional single engined fighter, but with one of those turrets strapped to the back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Boulton_Paul_Defiant_gun_turret_WWII_IWM_CH_879.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Boulton_Paul_Defiant_gun_turret_WWII_IWM_CH_879.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I find it rather complicated to make this sort of thing from scratch so my request is for someone to make a radially attached version of the defiant\u0027s gun turret. But to make it manned as well, possibly with an IVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would make me very happy as currently I am trying to construct a defiant.

A simple version with a camera mounted on the pitch of the turret gives results like the image below. There is one big issue though and that\u0027s the range of movement available to the Kerb in IVa , but it\u0027s very workable as it is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tADOwka.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tADOwka.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
