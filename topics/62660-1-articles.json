I must have hot chocolate!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, there were a lot of little problems such as Nathan\u0027s \u0027node size is ignored\u0027; Razchek and Sirkuit (I have no idea what the spelling of that is) went deep and discovered that joint time was being ignored back around 0.21 or so, and would always be FIXED_JOINT regardless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to recall as well that the joint\u0027s physics didn\u0027t operate quite the same, but joint physics are a mystery box of love and death anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have heard nothing about Squad even touching it since it\u0027s release in 0.20, though I\u0027m not always the most giving-a-****-what-squad-did-on-wensday person so I may have missed something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother advantage of using transforms based attachment nodes is that sometimes it\u0027s very difficult or technically restricted to make a transform at the angle you want. I don\u0027t know if it still is, but there was a time that if you specified rotation along more than one axis for a node; KSP would round the rotation to a 90 degree mark, so 0, 0, 0,0.7, 0.7, 0 would give you 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1; so using transforms will properly allow you to have any aribtrary orientation you desire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore matched with MODEL{scale}, if the nodes are defined by transforms, and those transforms are part of a model that is scaled by say scale=1,2,1, they will automatically be scaled by 1,2,1 too; otherwise you would need to redo the nodes manually for any irregular scaling factor that can\u0027t be treated as a regular scaling factor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
