It would also restrict science spamming, as surface samples and EVA reports wouldn\u0027t be possible until the manned capsules were available. And since the earliest rockets you can build are either really heavy, making the small parachute break and therefore be kind of pointless, or they are just small sounding rockets, there\u0027s not much point in putting a manned capsule on a rocket that\u0027s either going to be destroyed, or restricted to a small suborbital flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know *some people* have made munar orbits in the first tier of tech, but the average player probably wont want to commit the time and effort to build one of those just for the sake of it, they would start with small suborbital or low orbital probe crafts. Furthermore, it would help players work out the kinks in their design process without sacrificing so many kerbals that get incinerated on the pad due to launch failures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jean Deaux","CreatedById":59842,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T11:46:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suppose if you\u0027re trying to mimic the human route of development, but who says Kerbals developed winged flight first? But yah, it would make getting around for Kerbal science experiments a lot easier. Actually, getting wheels for a surface drive earlier on would greatly approve the science mobility as well.
