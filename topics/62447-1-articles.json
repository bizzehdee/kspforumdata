This holds true in KSP as well. ~4500 dV will get you to orbit, about ~9000 dV will get you anywhere. I find I need around 2500 dV to perform a standard Hohmann transfer to Eve, Duna, or Jool, and mabe 1500 to stabilize once I get there. Those are very approximate figures, but I\u0027ve not yet had a fuel problem with 4500 dV after orbit, unless I needed fuel to land.
