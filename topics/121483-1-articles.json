The early carreer is good : you have to play with limits (part count, weight, dimensions, budget, etc), and this is fun (i still have to build a manned ship that can land on the mun and return to kerbin with less than 18t and 30 parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut very quickly, you have no limits at all : part count, weight, dimensions are no longer a problem (VAB lvl 2 \u002B launchpad lvl 3 is enough for everything i need). There is just money. And the money thing is bad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou just put a probe on orbit around mun, minmus and kerbin, and a probe landed at minmus and mun, and then go to the contract building : reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, accept \u0022science from space around minmus\u0022, reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, accept \u0022science from space around mun\u0022, reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, accept \u0022science from surface of mun\u0022, reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, accept \u0022science from surface of minmus\u0022, reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, accept \u0022science from space around kerbin\u0022, then go to your different probes, fullfill those contracts, and back to the contract building : reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, reject contract...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022get money\u0022 thing is just not fun. And money is very quickly the only difference between \u0022science mode\u0022 and \u0022carreer mode\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could restrict myself to \u0022only one of the \u0027science from space around XXX\u0027 contracts\u0022, but the problem is still the same : reject contract until you get the \u0022put satellite on an equatorial orbit around XXX\u0022 (maybe 4 or 5 of them), then fly it, then back to the \u0022reject contract, reject contract, reject contract, accept that contract you want\u0022 thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is i don\u0027t even have to build economic ships : i can build overengineered monstrosities, and just do a little more of these \u0022contracts\u0022 to get the money to launch it. So, in reality, even money is not a limit. The only limit is \u0022how much do i accept to grind before i can launch that mission\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some ways to (partly) fix this problem i can imagine :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- more/different building tiers : part limit = 30 for VAB lvl 1, 255 for VAB lvl 2 ? This is bad. I NEVER build ships with more than 255 parts. Part limit for VAB lvl 2 should be around 90, in my (not-so ?) humble opinion. This would give a reason to evolve VAB to lvl 3 (other than custom action groups), and would get the part-count problem back to business, which is good. Same problem with the launchpad\u0027s dimensions and weight limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- change the contract system. For example, change \u0022land on Duna\u0022, to \u0022land on Duna and come back to kerbin with a manned ship costing less than XXXX kredits\u0022. This would make me HAVE TO build economic, not just \u0022i don\u0027t care about economic ships, i\u0027ll just grind a little bit more\u0022. Also, the game should not consider the \u0022science from space around kerbin\u0022 contract fullfilled when the data i send have absolutely no scientific value (no science point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An on-the-fly contract editor. Like : \u0022i am gonna do a mission that will land on duna, land on ike, and get back to kerbin, please generate a contract asking to do all of it and calculate the reward accordingly to the difficulty of the contract\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you imagine other ways to fix the mid-and-late-carreer problem ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there some mods that could fix that problem that i did not consider ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do YOU fix that problem ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T10:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved this over to Suggestions and Development Discussion as it\u0027s not really a question about how to do things in game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Champ","CreatedById":96425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T11:08:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you Red Iron Crown.
