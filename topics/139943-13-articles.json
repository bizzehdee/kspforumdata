I\u0027ve visited everywhere except Vall and Tylo and maybe Dres. Although most of that was before we had career mode and they were boring missions that made no contextual sense. I.e., launch big rocket -\u0026gt; rocket lands on its fins on Bop after 5 years -\u0026gt; rocket comes back after 5 years more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter I did all those missions I decided that I wanted my space program to make sense, which was right about the time career mode and ISRU came out. At that point I lost interest in KSP for a while due both to not wanting to figure out this new facet of the game and confusion over which mods I really wanted. Plus I think my computer broke or something... anyway I\u0027ve just recently been returning to the game and I must say that I\u0027m enjoying it much more now than I have in the past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first career in a long time, in 1.1, I had probes and kerballed ships that had landed on and returned from Duna and Ike, a probe at Eve with a kerballed mission on the way, a flyby of Moho, and probes headed for Dres, Jool and each of its moons. I had two bases on the Mun and one on Minmus, as well as a space station around Kerbin. That save got cancelled because I found so many mods that I just had to have and decided it would be easier to start over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow in my current save, I\u0027ve got four probes waiting for a Duna transfer window, while I set up my Kerbin station and explore all the various biomes of the Mun and Minmus with the tiniest spaceship I have ever designed (the Mun Beetle, look how cute it is \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/e9ROx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/e9ROx)\u003C/a\u003E. However I\u0027m getting QUITE sick of the Mun and Minmus so I\u0027ll have to go back to my old habits of launching missions to everywhere, but unfortunately I can only bear to time warp through weeks to get to a transfer window if there is nothing left for me to do between now and then, so... I\u0027ve got 180 days until Duna transfer, and all my funding is more or less depending on exploring Ike... so I\u0027m going interplanetary no matter if I like it or not \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E the free market says so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I think the biggest barrier to me back when I first was doing missions was rocket design. Although back then rockets were fairly simple, not a lot of science or heat shielding or anything like that. So it really wasn\u0027t much challenge. But now...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I think there are two big challenges. Designing ships that are capable of doing science and bringing it back is tough. Re-entry means something now and science modules are delicate, so that can be tough. The other main barrier (for me at least) is time. It takes years to get to Jool, and as badly as I want to go back to Pol because I thought it was breathtaking last time I was there, but I just don\u0027t have the heart to coop up a kerbal in a Gemini pod for 10 years straight anymore. So for me the challenge is infrastructure for roleplay.

I\u0027ve never reached another planet (save for once hyperediting\u00A0two things\u00A0into Duna orbit for some manoeuvres that I could have done over Kerbin just the same), let alone completed an interplanetary mission.

I\u0027ve played the game for probably close to 2000 hours now, and I still haven\u0027t been to Dres or Eloo. What\u0027s the point? Two more drab, airless moons with Mun-like gravity and very little that\u0027s new to find on them. Been there, done that.\u00A0 Similarly, I landed on Vall only because it was part of the Jool5 mission. Moho, Eve, Duna, Laythe, and Tylo each present unique opportunities and challenges, so I\u0027ve landed on\u00A0each of those a fair number of times. But at this point, the only aspect of the game I keep finding fun is to try to come up with better, faster, or oddball craft, mostly testing them extensively\u00A0on Kerbin to probe the edge of the design envelope. That seems to be the space where there is the most opportunity to squeeze more novelty out of the game. I did also get a fair amount of enjoyment out of figuring out how to get around the Kerbolar system cheaply using multiple gravity assists, but that\u0027s kind of becoming old hat now as well. On thing they could certainly do to make the stock game more fun for people who have reached this stage would be to take all their Mun clone planets (Ike, Vall, Dres, Eloo)\u00A0 as well as their Minmus clones (Gilly, Pol, Bop), and change their\u00A0basic properties in some interesting way that presents new technical challenges and opportunities. For example, they could make one of the tiny planets have a really high gravity field (let\u0027s say because it has\u00A0a cloud of\u00A0quantum \u00A0black holes\u00A0orbiting its core) as well as a deep, oxygen-containing\u00A0atmosphere. They could have another one surrounded by a cloud of asteroids, perhaps, and one with only minimal solid surface or super-chaotic terrain. Similarly, a thin, oxygen-containing atmosphere on Eloo would give people like you and me a reason to go there, so we could see what kind of planes could be made to function in that environment. Vall could perhaps be superheated by tidal flexing like Io and have lakes of deadly lava, etc. etc. I believe that making some of these changes would produce quite a lot of new opportunities for experienced players to get something fun out of visiting other bodies, and that of al the things they could do to that end it would be among the easiest. I guess we\u0027ll see what happens once they have the bugs worked out of the new physics engine...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222641201\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139943\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466580306\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289995\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Madrias\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Madrias said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can do almost anything without leaving Kerbin.\u00A0 For the one or two things where I need low gravity to enjoy them, well, it\u0027s not hard to get to the Mun or Minmus, and then I can have my low-gravity party with rocket-rover crater\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for how to fix this?\u00A0 I\u0027m pretty sure that until we can build cities (and no, making bases and outposts doesn\u0027t count, I\u0027m talking the idea of shipping a few dozen kerbals to a planet and having them automatically build a city with similar architecture to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, with roads and buildings.) and thereby shuttle Architect Kerbals to planets in all three modes (Career, Science, and Sandbox), there\u0027s no real use, at least to me, to go to the other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if there were all kinds of novel terrain and conditions on the other planets and time warp were upgraded so you didn\u0027t have to wait 20 minutes or more to get to Eloo?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
