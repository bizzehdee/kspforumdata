Propeller driven planes taking off from an airfield is easy to imagine.\u003Cp\u003EMy personal view of spaceplanes in KSP is that Kerbals already knew how to make airplanes, but it took them a while to figure out how to make wings that could withstand re-entry and thus be useful to the space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do hope you are right, but the way Maxmaps said it in Squadcast implied otherwise, also editing the persistence file and copying in a craft from another save would have put it right where the runway was supposed to be also.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rithsom","CreatedById":114646,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T22:55:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can understand why upgrading the VAB, SPH, launchpad, runway, tracking station and R\u0026amp;D would be a good idea.
