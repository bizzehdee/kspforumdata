Other parts will assist, but the bare minimum are these two parts. A \u003Cstrong\u003EJump Capacitor\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0can store an amount of \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EJump Energy\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022, which is basically Electric charge. It will fill up like any other electric battery with electricty provided by reactors, solar arrays, etc, but can only be drained by a jump drive. \u003Cstrong\u003ETHERE CAN BE MULTIPLE JUMP CAPCITORS ON ONE SHIP.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA \u003Cstrong\u003EJump Drive\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0will have a maximum range and a maximum\u00A0mass the ship it can carry. The more capable a jump drive is, the more massive and large it is.\u00A0To jump, you have to enter in the XYZ coordinate (centered at the sun) of your jump location, your target direction of movement using a vector, and your target orbital speed. A jump will drain your jump capacitors using this formula: Jump energy use = mass^2 * distance * change in speed^2. As the planets are rotating around the sun, if you enter the same thing twice at different times, you will end up in different places. If you jump into a planet, RIP. After a jump, a jump drive will have to recalibrate itself by cooling down for a predetermined amount of time, possibly affected by the jump distance. If you mess up your coords, you end up in a different location. If you mess up your direction or speed, your orbit will be messed up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to the difficulty in calculating your jump, the \u003Cstrong\u003EJump Computer\u003C/strong\u003E will assist you. You can enter the planet, the altitude, the inclination of your target orbit, and the time of the jump. It will then drain EC and Karborundum continuously while calculating (Karborundum\u00A0is already in community resource pack). After some time, it will spit out the coords, vector and speed of your target orbit, which can be entered into your jump drive. If you run out of EC or Karborundum while it is calculating, it will shut down and you lose all your previous calculations, wasting EC and\u00A0Karborundum. There can be multiple jump computers on one ship, which can accelerate the calculations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo not constantly use Karborundum, you can set a \u003Cstrong\u003EJump Waypoint\u003C/strong\u003E on where you want to jump. A jump waypoint will constantly drain EC, and will only function\u00A0if there is enough EC. You can set your Jump waypoint anywhere, although it is recommended to place it in stable orbit for a healthy jump. You can then choose the jump waypoint in your Jump drive instead of entering coords and such, and you will be jumped within 150 meters of it. For this guidance to work, \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou must have a comm link to the Waypoint directly or with \u003Cu\u003Eone relay\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0connecting the two. THE \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E DOES NOT COUNT AS A RELAY, AND WILL NOT WORK.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to these mechanics, if you want a efficient jump system, you should deploy waypoints around the solar system. You can also have a large \u0022carrier\u0022 with a large jump drive and lots of\u00A0jump capacitors, where other ships can dock to to be carried to their respective\u00A0destination,\u00A0so you don\u0027t need a jump drive on every ship.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a concept, and I may develop it, but it would be awesome if anyone would help the development or have experience in this\u00A0sort of instant transport mechanics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-10T07:16:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2020 07:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Kev1n8088\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hohmannson","CreatedById":202712,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-10T21:02:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks very alike to hardly reconfigured\u00A0ESLD jump beacons.
