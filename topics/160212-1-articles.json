I\u0027m looking to get back into Minecraft, but I don\u0027t want to get on the official Forum users\u0027 server because I\u0027m just antisocial enough that it seems like there are too many players there. Anybody else have a whitelisted server or otherwise low-pop one to play on? I do vanilla except in extreme circumstances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-05T09:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a private server that i want to test out, want to join?
