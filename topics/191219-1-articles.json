This small change could be taking away a part and attaching it again (e.g. a nose-cone), or just left(!)-shift clicking on the vessel to move it around a bit. That usually \u0022fixed\u0022 it for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the impression, that this happens when the program has trouble figuring out for how long each stage will burn. Usually because (as you have in your case) multiple engines run at the same time, but some burn out at some time and are staged away. It is even worse if you use fuel-cross feed to feed a stage with tanks from another. In this case it works better to use the external fuel pipe instead of the crossfeed in the decouplers and (manual) fuel feed priorities on the tanks. (But \u0022better\u0022 does not mean \u0022always correct\u0022.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo check if KSP got it right I usually check if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, start-mass, end-mass, and burn time all make sense and are consistent.

The problem here is YOU know you want to decouple those as soon as the side tanks are empty, but the game assumes you will not decouple them until their entire available fuel supply is gone. Because they can still run on the fuel from the center tank, the engines will still run until that entire booster stage is out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get around this, I\u0027ve used fuel ducts in the past. Turn off crossfeed, put fuel ducts on the side tanks going into the inner tank, and then your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E values will be correct. Once you\u0027ve finished your ship, delete the fuel ducts and turn on crossfeed again on the decouplers.
