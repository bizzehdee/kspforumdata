I think when we are talking about breezing through the tech tree we really mean that about 80-90% of the useful parts (things like the nuclear engine) can be obtained in only a handful of normal but well planned missions. Until you visit another planet or two, or you start covering the entire Mun in flags you won\u0027t have actually maxed out the tech tree. If you are having trouble my first suggestion would be to try and focus on the science items near the bottom - unlocking these lets you get even more science. Once you reach the last science item, the GravMax, you can build a probe that just orbits around Kerbin, the Mun and Minmus collecting massive amounts of science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jalapen0","CreatedById":9056,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T21:12:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got a custom tech tree and it has made career much more challenging.
