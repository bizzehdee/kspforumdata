My early Mun landings are primitive affairs. My first (in the latest career) landing being via a probe sent to accomplish the World Firsts flyby and orbit missions. It was never intended to land, but I realized it had sufficient dV so down it goes. It got me a little extra science early for little extra time and\u00A0no extra funds and reused a vehicle past its intended mission. My similar probe to Minimus then does something similar, and me getting greedy attempt extra biomes and splatter it across the surface with a piloting error. I next start up the Kerbaled missions. Three launch vehicles send up a specialized lander, extra fuel, and the capsule for the Kerbal out and returned. Using all 1.25 parts, the probes are driving and the Kerbal is the scientist. All three dock around the Mun, the lander makes multiple landings and delivers the science to the return capsule for a big haul. Efficiency in money spent and science returned (for me) ends up being roughly the same as had\u00A0I sent three different self contained missions. However, the self contained missions carry far greater risk to the Kerbal as the land and return vehicle at that tech stage ends up being tall and difficult to land. In previous careers I once sent 4 different rescue missions to the same Kerbal as I had trouble landing on slopes. My three part mission allowed a lander designed using the swept wings as the lander legs. No suspension, but strong wide and light weight far more stable landing on slopes. HOWEVER it\u0027s highly dangerous and inefficient getting it out of Kerbins atmosphere due to drag. It took several launches before figuring out how to launch safely and I did those launches in career without reverting and without testing in sandbox. I had to make the call if sending them up was economically justified and it turned out to be a good thing they weren\u0027t manned. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m now in the process of developing a new generation of lander using 2.5 parts. Designed to land 2 Kerbals, include wheels to rover to nearby biomes to save fuel (and new science equipment). I\u0027m\u00A0adding to the fuel depot a sci lab, and improving the shuttle vehicle as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter this phase will come my fully integrated landing facility complete with sci lab, ore drilling and processing and a fuel tanker. The Mun may have a larger gravity well, but it\u0027s tidally locked allowing launches to predictably end up over the same part of the far side of the Mun where the base is located.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing stops me from doing this in sandbox. But career forces part restrictions on me to simulate the different phases. In sandbox I\u0027m too tempted to just start with phase 4. I\u0027ve got the parts and no worry about funds, so why not? \u00A0But I like the story that evolves \u0022naturally \u0022 with career.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t stand grinding. So I have the game set up so I don\u0027t have to. I set to hard, then change science to 50% and funds to 100% and turn\u00A0quick saves back on (for Kraken insurance only). Science grinding is fun as it forces me to explore different biomes on the Mun and Minimus (I do minimal science on Kerbin) and set to 50% means Duna science is still relevant. Funds at 100% means I do no more than a couple \u0022paying the bills\u0022 missions like launching satellites. But funds ARE relevant and I have to weigh them went I want to do a mission outside of game offered missions. These constraints add to my enjoyment in a way that playing sandbox and saying \u0022keep this mission under X funds\u0022 doesn\u0027t appeal to me. I have an in game reason to keep funds low. I also really enjoy unlocking the advanced parts like the nuke that open up all new design territory that I didn\u0027t have before. New personal missions open up that weren\u0027t available before and with comes a feeling of accomplishment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlaying sandbox doesn\u0027t offer to me quite the same experience even though I could every exact mission. The difference is the context in which the missions are done. Getting to the Mun the first for anyone probably feels good regardless of career or sandbox.

Charlie Bolden\u0027s job is probably not very fun or game-like, and the moon landings were made possible as much by external factors like the Cold War and the memory of JFK as they were by gradual experience and technical progress within NASA itself. They had an unbelievable amount of (arguably \u0022unearned\u0022 in a gaming sense)\u00A0money for a few years, and then after possibly the most iconic achievement\u00A0in human history, it got cut down to scraps. Anything short of that is going to be \u0022unrealistic\u0022 by definition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuppose they do add a reasonably accurate management simulation.\u00A0Is it simulating something fun,\u00A0like rocketry and astrogation? No, it\u0027s simulating being a bureaucrat. The more work they put into it, the better a simulation it will become of being a bureaucrat. And if your space program starts to tank, how will it feel if it seems to be happening because something\u0027s wrong with\u00A0the modeling of wages?\u00A0Better to focus career mode on driving\u00A0engagement with the core physics gameplay via missions and some kind of tech progression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, Teutooni said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that always puzzled me was the science points.
