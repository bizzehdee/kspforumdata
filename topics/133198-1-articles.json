Also, final touchdown on parachutes would be ok.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m mostly having issues balancing the final stage craft in such a way that it remains controllable at low speeds. It often ends up with not enough control surface leverage, or it has excessive drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure others have used similar profiles to this, so if you could post your crafts/experiences that would be great.

Today, I\u0027d launch it upside down at the end of the main fuselage.

The highest tech in it is the long mk1 fuselage. Though having wings in the middle makes the launches hairy. 2-3 flips on the way to orbit is calculated in the dV costs, and I never managed to get it even close to an equatorial orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough none of the above craft has landing gears. Both are quite capable of water-landings (though the longer one needs some expertise in such). I didn\u0027t feel that runway landings would pay for the added difficulty, weight and most importantly part count of wheels. One can still aim for the shore next to KSC for a good recovery percentage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002244IC7iR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022387\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/44IC7iR.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-29T19:40:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/29/2016 07:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
