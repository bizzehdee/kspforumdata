The idea is to build a rocket that has some high-visibility part on it (I used Captain Slug\u0027s flare), and place that part into a very low (~36,000m) orbit. Then deorbit and while sitting on the ground, wait for the object to come around once and pass overhead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t sure the draw distance was good enough for this, but...well, I\u0027ll attach some screens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been so excited to see a stupid little flickering speck. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit:\u003C/strong\u003E Video!\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qlqs5q7Wznc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jinglejanglespurs","CreatedById":5531,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-08T02:16:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always wondered if this would be possible.
