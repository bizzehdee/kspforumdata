I want to see where my non-planetary target will be when I\u0027m at a future point in my orbit.

The fact that they don\u0027t always show up is what made me wish for the ghost. I don\u0027t want to know where it is sometimes, at a specific time, if the game decides that they\u0027re close enough. I want to know where it is at this exact point here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if they already considered it and decided against it, I guess it\u0027s probably not going to happen.
