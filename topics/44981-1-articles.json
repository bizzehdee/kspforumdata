Open your persistence file, and use CTRL\u002BF to search for \u0022Kerman\u0022. Then you can scroll through the list of Kerbonauts at your disposal, and you can freely change the names of them. You can also change their courage, stupidity, and BadS stats if you want your Kerbal to have certain traits. I just made one named Nubby Kerman. He\u0027s a Badass genius that isn\u0027t afraid of anything! I\u0027m going to use him for my upcoming mission to Duna. I need to get refueling infrastructure in place first, though...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T06:12:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWarning: backup your persistence file before doing \u0027Anything\u0027 in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChange name, Yes, I did that...at the end.
