What\u0027s the payload mass?\n\nHi GusTurbo\n\nThe engines and the overall lift can pull two Jumbotanks up... way more than 100x100km, just lenghten the body a bit. The mounting of the fairing is easely changable with the conic and slantet tanks. I dont want to show more pics, its a huge spoil i think.\n\nIf anybody tries to rebuild it... its not so simple as it seems. Its Stockparts, Kerbal joint reinforcement is obviously mandatory. No clipping, minor offset of the wingparts.\n\nI have researched the propulsion intensivly ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)...\n\nIts real crazy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T16:06:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mikki**\n  \nTypo:)"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T23:56:25Z","Content":"My first suggestion is to make that payload less wide.

Its even possible to land a bulky outdated Module, just put a heatshield on its front somehow and get the scrap down for refunds, and if it burns up... we have to try - or never know.\n\nI play career. I dont like wasting stuff... Launchers are good but you wont get rich with it. Ask NASA or Roscosmos what the real problem is. Money... errr funds.\n\n![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T01:17:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s really awesome. What\u0027s the payload mass?\n\nHi GusTurbo\n\nTo your question, i had to enhance the ***\u0022SPACEGUPPY\u0022*** a bit ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif).\n\n![LrYIT5K.png](http://i.imgur.com/LrYIT5K.png)\n\nAnd the most interesting thing is this:\n\n![e2UpFBo.png](http://i.imgur.com/e2UpFBo.png)\n\nThe Spaceplane was 360 tons at take off, it ran out of tarmac, but if had lowered the reargear it would have easy come off the ground. Speed was 230m/s...\n\nPayload was 82,23 tons, after release i had about 1200 oxidizer and more than 2500 liquid fuel left, Orbit was 120x115.\n\nI added a short MK3 LFO to the front and taped another four R.A.P.I.E.R.s to the wingbase in line with other engines.\n\nTo keep the center of thrust inline with the changing CoM i did some actiongroup engine toggling, very easy, but before i knew how to do...\n\nI accidently burned off the oxidizer at descend to lower atmosphere...\n\nI entered to early (as most of the time) over the desert, but i surfed the plane over at 20000m at 2000m/s to 1600m/s, without any engines i arrived at the KSP kontinent. Did not use the airbrakes, just gently sailing down.\n\nThis is to me surly the biggest load with this spaceplane, i have tried four or five different things to put up the Mk3 Size Tanks.\n\nIts real crazy, and it flys real good. Just have to pump all the remaining fuel to the verry front before descending.\n\nThe only way to save some... funds.\n\nHave a good time and greetings\n\nahh okay... another interesting pic for some\n\n![25kuKo7.png](http://i.imgur.com/25kuKo7.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T02:26:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 02:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mikki**\n  \nSome detail for GusTurbo, and Typo:)"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T07:08:13Z","Content":"I still prefer my twin boom designs.\n\nNo kerbal joint reinforcement mod needed.\n\n[https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/s720x720/11032221_10103550674651363_2148940416804389397_o.jpg](https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/s720x720/11032221_10103550674651363_2148940416804389397_o.jpg)\n\n[https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11164685_10103550674182303_2013766903372658940_n.jpg?oh=e1dd17466d64fa6ca9843eb6f1b7bd00\u0026oe=55FA3B68](https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11164685_10103550674182303_2013766903372658940_n.jpg?oh=e1dd17466d64fa6ca9843eb6f1b7bd00\u0026oe=55FA3B68)\n\n[https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11051972_10103582138552453_2244033946117548209_n.jpg?oh=29d5854f09324ce6317a151378af6719\u0026oe=55EFC2A9](https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11051972_10103582138552453_2244033946117548209_n.jpg?oh=29d5854f09324ce6317a151378af6719\u0026oe=55EFC2A9)\n\n[https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/t31.0-8/s720x720/11000540_10103582135358853_5504031967368108229_o.jpg](https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/t31.0-8/s720x720/11000540_10103582135358853_5504031967368108229_o.jpg)\n\n![10441055_10103614966504973_7518848353140663427_n.jpg?oh=3cfe12cd27942e0856ea072c806e3bc0\u0026oe=5600DA04\u0026__gda__=1438608730_0c3bc409c5c907d21eaac086fca6680d](https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10441055_10103614966504973_7518848353140663427_n.jpg?oh=3cfe12cd27942e0856ea072c806e3bc0\u0026oe=5600DA04\u0026__gda__=1438608730_0c3bc409c5c907d21eaac086fca6680d)\n\n![11377237_10103614966819343_815094391064797949_n.jpg?oh=f227d7fe95add6604c86c4448736b3b6\u0026oe=55C1B44D](https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11377237_10103614966819343_815094391064797949_n.jpg?oh=f227d7fe95add6604c86c4448736b3b6\u0026oe=55C1B44D)"}]}
