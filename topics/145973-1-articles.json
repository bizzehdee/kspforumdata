Among these ill-fitting machines to a space game, I have begun making motorcycles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone out here make any motorcycles? It would be nice to see what others have made. Let us know what mods you have used for your motorcycle, and try to post a pic of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMotorcycles are perhaps useless in KSP. I have found that using both reaction wheels and motorized wheels tend to be problematic, causing me to use jet engines\u00A0for propelling the motorcycle.\u00A0I have constructed one for use on the Mun and Minmus using the stock Xenon thruster, and that was nice for ground travel, until I crashed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I think my favorite was constructing the Mach Fenrir. I had to use Tweakscale, and it has been known to reach 67 M/s (150 MPH). Nice for Kerbin use. A link to it is below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Core/AAA-Mach-Fenrir\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Core/AAA-Mach-Fenrir\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s12.photobucket.com/user/jstanley852/media/Mach%20fenrir%202_zpsxaa0c3hg.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a203/jstanley852/Mach%20fenrir%202_zpsxaa0c3hg.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022Mach%20fenrir%202_zpsxaa0c3hg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
