This means that while docking, if the imbalance on the craft is not too great, it will manage to counter the rotation you induce when translating. However, it does this reactively, so your vessel is prone to wobbling. It therefore works poorly in several common scenarios, especially with larger vessels like space stations, as anyone who has had their station ripped apart by ASAS wobble can testify. Also it only works to maintain rotation - it can easily cause your vessel to drift at an ever higher velocities while maintaining your heading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyHook","CreatedById":31496,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T20:45:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Nvm.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-31T20:47:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2013 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SkyHook\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BrutalRIP","CreatedById":59065,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T14:31:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust thought i should add if you use the FX glitch workaround displayed in the OP it will break mechjebs docking autopilot\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZRM","CreatedById":64626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T14:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BrutalRIP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BrutalRIP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ejust thought i should add if you use the FX glitch workaround displayed in the OP it will break mechjebs docking autopilot\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the heads up. If that\u0027s the case then in theory it should break the docking autopilot regardless of whether the workaround is used. Unfortunately this is just a side-effect of replacing the control mechanism on RCS blocks. MechJeb relies on statistics it calculates from stock RCS control modules to judge the strength of control inputs to use when docking. MechJeb does not consider the possibility of translation control not using stock RCS control modules, or not using RCS at all, which is entirely possible using the Engine Linear Control mode. I recommend just not using the docking autopilot for the time being - it\u0027s not as if docking is very difficult, especially considering the availability of other tools in MechJeb like Smart A.S.S..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, the new version of KCA is nearly ready to release, featuring gimbal support, reaction wheel support, an even better solver and a combined RCS/Engine/Gimbal/Reaction Wheel control system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BrutalRIP","CreatedById":59065,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T15:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell for me mechjeb does fine until trying to translate on H/N then it appears to have no control and ive been keeping an eye on your wip page its looking good will that also require fx glitch workaround ?

Because I seem to have gimbal roll control even when none of the modes are active, and reaction wheels seem to be still running even when I disable them on the pod. Also, kerbcom seems to interfere with mechjeb\u0027s smart a.s.s.

I am not so sure about the problem with the stock VTOL. It may be related to the reaction wheel bug, as that craft relies a lot on its reaction wheels for attitude control. I have tried replicating it, editing the craft as you describe, but it seems to work for me. Then again, if you have a joystick plugged in with an inadequate deadzone it may be that causing the problem. I will look into these bugs soon, though I do not think I will have time to do so today.
