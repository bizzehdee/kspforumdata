It\u0027s a little kludgy, but it works. You set it up as a region with an arbitrary XY coordinate system (so all it is is an XY region that can be modified). Then use g.region to set-up the region size, which thankfully, is very predictable here. The values will always be thus:\n\n    res=0.01n=90s=-90e=180w=-180x=2y=1\n\nEasy peasy. There isn\u0027t even really a need to generate a raster map to analyze for region information, since we know beforehand what it will always be. The only issue I\u0027ve run into now is dealing with these large volumes of data (I had NO idea just how much data scientists can end-up dealing with...it\u0027s just a little crazy O.O ).\n\nAt the settings above, the region is 648,000,000 data points. Presumably that could be the max number of data points for any planet/moon in the game. That...is a lot of data. My Kerbin\\_elevation.csv takes up 250MB (with r.in.xyz eating around 1.5GB of RAM to import it, for each pass, with 10 passes, meaning if I had loaded the whole thing it\u0027d need 15GB...crazy). So presumably a file that had all possible data points would be, erm...lemme go do maths \\*pause\\*\n\n    Data points in import (i) = 13,303,561Full set number of points (f) = 648,000,000i / f = 0.02053018673File size of imported data set (Fs) = 250.9MB = 2.1047e9 bitsSo file size of a full data set from ISA MapSat:2.1047e9 bits / 0.02053018673 = 102,517,333,509 bits = 11.93458837328944 GB\n\nYikes. O.O\n\nIn any case, the thing I can\u0027t seem to do is interpolate from that set, the rest of it. It\u0027s not that I can\u0027t make it work. It\u0027s that it will take a loooooong time. r.surf.idw2 (raster interpolation for scattered data points) works fine, but will take way too long. Simpler to just collect more data. (I started it off on its merry way but the progress bar didn\u0027t move, yet it used a single core at 100%, and it\u0027s a 64-bit module...yeah...too much data.)\n\nAnd then there\u0027s the slight kludge solution of simply rendering the region at lower resolution. \u003E.\u003E Yeah. Gonna be kludgy here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-02T02:49:49Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2012 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix\\_ca**"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T02:49:38Z","Content":"Nice.

The huge problem is that it has to read through the entire file once for every line. It\u0027s a real brute-force way of doing it but can be done...I just don\u0027t see any point, other than reducing the filesize of a CSV for upload. *Maybe* I\u0027ll write a cleaning script that can do this at some point, when it suits. Python can be pretty speedy, and compiled (well \u0022compiled\u0022 in the case of Python) can be speedier, but...yeah.
