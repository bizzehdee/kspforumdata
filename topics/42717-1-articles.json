And add some rounding errors here and there for extra fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost predictable is probably a head-on slam (but with the thin atmosphere of Duna you may not survive that), there you can pretty much use Radiokopf basic calculation and the aerobraking part is well defined (and minimized, too, ahem), the more shallow you enter, the more difficult it gets to predict. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind, too, that predicting is not controlling. Depending on your ETA and the rotation period of the planet there are some points (on the back hemisphere) that will simply not be reachable by any direct aerobraking maneuver because you would need a Pe too high to even be captured (with enough dV anything is possible, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafest (but by far not fastest) way of predicting and controlling is to split it in aerobraking-capture into an orbit and then land from it (at least you can work out an approximate rule of thumb if you keep your orbit radius and deorbit burns similar).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
