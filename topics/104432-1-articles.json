That means i avoid part mods especially that more and more of them are now 100% redundant, for example most of B9 (which was a pack i really liked before .24 or whatever the update that gave us MK-2 parts) is now non-essential and just adds resources. Especially with 1.0\u0027s new wings, it looks that even for massive planes B9 will nolonger give us any real benefits over stock game. Mods used to be almost essential, but with all the additions squad is putting into teh game, i feel that mods have become less essential, and more optional or even completely unnecessary these days. Back in .23 or whatnot, mods were 100% needed to make any sort of half decent looking/performing space planes/SSTOs, now with MK-2 parts, that is nolonger the case, with MK-3 parts, large space planes are now possible (\u002B the parts make for nice capital ship hulls too). Now with mining, large wings, better landing gear, larger xenon tanks, ect, many many many mods are nolonger essential to enjoy the game. Yes many mods are still neat, but at least in my opinion, not many mods are required to get any fun outta the game anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOfc i usually use EVE (with some textures pulled from astronomer\u0027s mod of EVE, as i dont quite like the stock cloud skybox as it has too many clouds in spots and the storm features look kinda fakeish). I also run planetshine and a few other improvements like a saturn styled belt around jool that looks really cool especially when you fly capital ships through it while being shot at/shooting at something else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T15:14:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to run through stock tutorials and career and try to collect my thoughts on the official release of KSP.
