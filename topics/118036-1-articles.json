But if it is just something that you are passively interested in, and want to have a little more freedom in plane design, stick with stock. As far as rockets go, it does not make a whole lot of difference between the two, as long as the rocket can get about 15 km in altitude without wrecking then it doesn\u0027t matter.\n\nedit: Also, FAR will change re-entry behaviors. FAR does a better job emulating lifting bodies.

The concepts are the same but the Center of Lift may not be, so just because you aren\u0027t learning bad habits, doesn\u0027t mean you can load a stock craft and fly it in FAR without changes. The general flight behavior in Stock and FAR is very close, not identical, but close. If you learn to fly in Stock, you should be able to transfer to FAR with little re-learning. This was not the case in pre-1.0 stock where they were so incredibly different, it was like playing an entirely new game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T18:31:49Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T19:01:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What are you talking about cheating?\n\nBuild a rocket and have FAR installed see how far you can go now un-install FAR same rocket try same path and you tell me."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T19:36:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Build a rocket and have FAR installed see how far you can go now un-install FAR same rocket try same path and you tell me.\n\nThe difference is like 200dv.
