Any idea what I am doing wrong?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are doing nothing wrong - the behavior is by design. The mode buttons control which mode SAS is in, not whether SAS is turned on or off (this behavior is different than the MechJeb autopilot buttons). Pressing the button in your example tells SAS that you want it to hold prograde when it\u0027s switched on, but it does not actually switch SAS on, since there is a separate action group control to enable/disable SAS (using \u0022actionName = sas\u0022). To use the SAS mode buttons, you will need a group of them to control the modes, plus a master \u0022On/Off\u0022 switch, kind of like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imageshack.com/i/f0F9XiaVp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/xq90/540/F9XiaV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F9XiaV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this instance, SAS is configured for Stability Assist, and it\u0027s off (the top SAS indicator is yellow for off, green for on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think this is confusing, I would be willing to change it so that the buttons turn SAS on/off \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E set the mode, which eliminates the need for a separate SAS button, but it makes it harder to know which SAS mode is going to be selected if you use the generic SAS switch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RealTimeShepherd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RealTimeShepherd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, in the cfg file for each prop, I can currently use action = custom01 to custom10 for the first ten action groups, but if I go beyond that to the additional action groups from AGX, then it just disables the prop.
