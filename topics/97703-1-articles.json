Particularly, I find occasions where craft returning from other planets run out of fuel in high Kerbin orbit and need to have a refueling craft get out to them. Or in my present case, getting an asteroid redirect craft to finalize its push into a parking orbit around Minmus, which requires several fueling trips (the return orbit was rather high and needs to be aligned.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to get to my question, I want to know other people\u0027s favored cost-effective methods of getting fuel into orbit. Smallish launch vehicle rockets do well enough, but I worry about price-per-launch over multiple launches. I can get small spaceplanes into orbit, but I find anything carrying excess mass it is not using (like cargo fuel it will not burn) makes it run out of fuel before leaving the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you typically do? I am looking for some inspiration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T21:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use a standard spaceplane to ferry fuel to orbit.

For your scenario, running out of fuel in high kerbin orbit, 12t would probably go a long way already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the \u0022smart\u0022 way is to have a large fuel depot in orbit that you top off only every once in a while (hence the interest in moving lots of stuff in one go). Most of the time, missions are launched with near-empty tanks, replenish their tanks at the depot, and are on their way. For your problem, you\u0027d also need a small tanker, little more than an orange tank plus engine, that delivers fuel to the stranded ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"match","CreatedById":91708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T22:00:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only started doing spaceplanes lately, but if you are dealing with fiances in this game, you probably will be happy with the results once you get your designs down.
