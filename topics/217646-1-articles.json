A good solution (in my opinion) is do the catagories: liquid feul engines\u00A0 nuclear engines, jet engines, xenon engines etc. Than give us partvariants of parts (like ksp1) and have for engines and feul tanks the opurtunity to choose a fariants for different feul types (Hydrogen, Methane and add Kerosine). The feul type will determine specs of engines and feul storage.
