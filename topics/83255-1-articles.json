While most of these planets have a stagnant, low-population society, where the level of technology is still at a similar level that it was at their kidnapping (mainly because of hostile aliens), some of these planets developed technology that is at a similar level to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese planets are usually protrayed to be somewhat less advanced than Earth, have a rundown look and don\u0027t feature things like vehicles and advertisements, so they end up looking like Eastern European countries under Communism. Good examples for these is the 8th season episode Icon, and the 9th season episode Ethon, where the inhabitants of the planet Tegalus developed a society and technology level that is similar to the Soviet Union in the 1980s. If a human from Earth was transported to one of these planets, he wouldn\u0027t immediately think he was not on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis got me thinking, if the above really happened (humans from the Middle Ages and earlier were transported to another Earth-like planet and developed modern technology there) how different would their settlements, structures etc. look like compared to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree things that would also happen there I think are settlements organized into streets, since either something similar existed in their society on Earth, or they would discover on the planet that its more efficient than building houses haphazardly, street lighting, which reduces crime after dark, and self-propelled vehicles without which a modern society couldn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think something \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.calincorpas.ro/wp-content/gallery/plopi-taiati-pentru-un-mall/img_6714.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elike this\u003C/a\u003E could be a believeable picture taken on another Earth-like planet inhabited by humans?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T07:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat picture you linked to shows a society using concrete and steel to make buildings, with an electricity grid and able to work with metals cheaply enough to use them for street lighting poles. The clothes appear to be synthetic fibres, so that means a confident grasp of chemistry. That\u0027s a fully modern society to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a bit of a clue just look at the various civilisations scattered around the globe prior to the modern age. Jared Diamond wrote a good book called \u0022Guns, Germs and Steel\u0022 that investigates how and why some societies advanced more quickly than others. A lot of it is about access to resources (minerals, livestock, plants, etc). If a medieval society were transported to a world where they didn\u0027t have easy access to metals it\u0027s not hard to imagine they\u0027d struggle to progress. Just look at the Polynesians all the way up to about the 1800s. They had a socially well-developed society which on the bigger islands (Hawaii, New Zealand) had developed into a feudal system, and they had some very sophisticated technologies (long distance navigation) but their society was stuck using stone and wood for tools and weapons. They were a medieval society stuck with stone age technology, and it\u0027s hard to imagine them getting past that point easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo whether the society would progress to modern standards or would be stuck at the same level as the Polynesians or the South and Central American civilisations depends entirely on what resources are available to them on this new world. Would they have the right plants for agriculture and forestry? The right animals to domesticate for beasts of burden and transport? The right metals to make tools and weapons? In our own history these have been what gave some societies the ability to leapfrog ahead of others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-29T12:06:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2014 12:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Seret\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T07:17:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022szputnyik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022szputnyik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think something \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.calincorpas.ro/wp-content/gallery/plopi-taiati-pentru-un-mall/img_6714.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elike this\u003C/a\u003E could be a believeable picture taken on another Earth-like planet inhabited by humans?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, since it is an actual, genuine picture of Earth inhabited by humans, why yes, I am 100% certain it is such an accurate depiction of earth-like planet inhabited by humans \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you know about the Sliders TV series that might make you familiar with Everett\u0027s multiverse theory.

Basic logic behind it: you can\u0027t develop Haemophilia if none of your parents got a gene responsible for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJesrad is right\u003C/strong\u003E assuming realistically possible selection - and we can\u0027t tell for sure which genes are good and which are bad in a long-term cross-breeding perspective. There\u0027s plenty of disorders that we cannot link to the specific genes just yet (Basic logical example: various types of cancer - we know about genes behind some, but not all, nor how exactly genes affect probability of each cancer type) and selection of these people will realistically affect survival or death of your \u0022colony\u0022. Therefore logically safe minimum size of a colony would be the one presented in a study.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also - sometimes having a person with \u0022impure\u0022 genes from a perspective of diseases might be more desirable as he might have much more attractive genes from other perspectives, like intellect, empathy or muscle strength (wildly assuming we agree that these are at least partially linked to the genes, as many, if not majority, disagrees)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case - having more people is better. Safer. For many reasons, not just genetic disorders, but also things like resistance of a population to the viruses (you don\u0027t want everyone die on a first flu epidemic), or even simple psychological reasons - humans want to have partners for a life time and want to have children with them - attempts to fully control that are doomed to fail, and a lack of proper control might endanger an entire colony. Also smaller populations would be much more affected by any cases of unexpected death before contributing to the genetic poll or any random mutations or disorders (you don\u0027t want to end up with a population which after a 100 generations ends up with 1/3 of people dying before their 50s on a cancer). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said though - selecting 2 ideal candidates might give you a stable colony assuming few things... for example: they live long enough to give birth at least to the 3rd generation and after 3rd generation reaches maturity - colony splits into groups (at least 2) with partners as distant genetically from each other as possible and go very far away in the opposite directions with an intention not to meet each other for at least several next generations. Each of these groups would also preferably have to split at some point in a similar fashion. This would ensure that accidents, like diseases (which are the highest risk due to low genetic diversity), massive fires, floods, etc. cannot wipe your colonists in an instant and that genetic variability develops over time in a different directions (eg. people living in a hot climate over dozens (hundreds?) of generations will adjust to that better that these living in a cold climate).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenetic diversity can do miracles.
