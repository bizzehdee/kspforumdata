Sorry about that. I can see possibly starting drag, Isp, lift, etc at a low rate and unlocking materials and techniques that can increase them across the board. I\u0027m pretty sure that space ships today experience less drag than Sputnik\u0027s launcher did, though I don\u0027t know how much less. I also think that possibly Boeing\u0027s new planes have more lift per wing area than the Wright Brothers\u0027 flier did. Rather than have 20 different wings and 20 different engines and 20 different pieces of every part with different drag coefficients, having a single \u0022drag of surfaces\u0022 thing that improves over time seems very reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut buffing drag for a launch or two and then losing that benefit? Not a happy horseman, here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis. Exactly this. I suggest you start a poll just to see approximately how many of the active forum members want this too. Having parts get better as you use them or buy more materials is something I\u0027ve been wanting either stock or mod for a while. Like increasing the isp of engines as you use them or only getting a burn time estimate after using it. I suggest we push this towards the devs. Great explanation 5thHorseman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Maybe a new tab like parts/action groups/crew could be added called something like \u0022materials\u0022 and in it you can change the \u0022material\u0022 for specific parts to change different parameters of building. Perhaps to increase strength and weight by making things out of steel or lowering weight and strength with aluminum. Or decreasing weight and increasing strength with carbon fiber for an increase of cost. This could be done with lift, drag, engine isp, and all other efficiency related parameters. You could even unlock materials through science and money and have worse options at the beginning of your career game. Is this something you all would like?

I think that means for the next five ships launched. Maybe there\u0027s a deadline, I\u0027m not sure.

Going to the Admin Building, weighting your options and selecting a strategy is hardly \u0022getting a random power-up\u0022. It\u0027s more like choosing an advantage trait on an RPG game, if anything. I know a lot of people here wanted KSP to be more like a hardcore simulator, but you should have noticed by now that\u0027s not what Squad is aiming for.

Exactly this. I suggest you start a poll just to see approximately how many of the active forum members want this too. Having parts get better as you use them or buy more materials is something I\u0027ve been wanting either stock or mod for a while. Like increasing the isp of engines as you use them or only getting a burn time estimate after using it. I suggest we push this towards the devs. Great explanation 5thHorseman.\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Maybe a new tab like parts/action groups/crew could be added called something like \u0022materials\u0022 and in it you can change the \u0022material\u0022 for specific parts to change different parameters of building. Perhaps to increase strength and weight by making things out of steel or lowering weight and strength with aluminum. Or decreasing weight and increasing strength with carbon fiber for an increase of cost. This could be done with lift, drag, engine isp, and all other efficiency related parameters. You could even unlock materials through science and money and have worse options at the beginning of your career game. Is this something you all would like? I\u0027d love it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I don\u0027t want it so much as would greatly prefer it to unlocking a 3-launch buff that magically erases some drag for you. But if it were to happen, I would prefer it be just a straight-up increase or decrease as you go. Dump 10k science into materials and get a 3% reduction in weight across the board. 10k into aerodynamics gets you 2% more lift. With a max cap of maybe 10% in stuff, and then we can balance with play testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think picking what materials each part on my ship has is overdoing it and would make building rockets a bit of a clickfest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T12:19:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Avera9eJoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Avera9eJoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat wouldn\u0027t be fun to \u0022do over and over again\u0022 though in my opinion.

But also, this gives some credibility to that last one (burning up while approaching the sun) since it\u0027s something that more experienced players probably aren\u0027t going to do intentionally (or they\u0027ve done it once long ago, and may not bother with again unless they hear about a feature with it). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho knows.
