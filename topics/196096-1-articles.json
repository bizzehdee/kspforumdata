I can\u0027t close the fairing even though the text is written in green. When I click LMB to close the fairing, the fairing still moves around when I move my mouse around. What is happening??? It is getting really frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-04T00:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA picture or (even better in this case especially) video would do wonders here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nupload to Imgur and link here to the picture and someone will hopefully see what\u0027s up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
