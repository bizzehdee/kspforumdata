In 1.0.2, I had rockets that just shoot straight up and free-fall back down and slowed with parachutes for doing sub-orbital tourist contracts. In 1.0.4, my chutes always rip off unless I deploy them so late that the pod crashes and explode before the chutes can slow them down enough (had to deploy somewhere below 1000m to not have them rip off, but that\u0027s too little time to slow down in 1.0.4.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy craft is very basic (only unlocked the really cheap techs so far): Mk16 chute / 2 radial chutes - command pod - command pod - heat shield - decoupler - hammer SRB - decoupler - hammer SRB (I need the second command pod for a pilot for SAS, otherwise rocket will flip.) I tweaked the SRB so that I get around an apoapsis of 80,000m or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did manage to get something workable and economical by adding a flea SRB (and an additional Hammer stage) that fires during descent to slow me down to \u0026lt; 200 m/s before deploying the chutes. Are there other solutions to make the chutes usable? Spamming a lot of radial chutes also look like it may work (it worked with the 1 pod version) - not because they slow me down in time if I deploy really late, but because they seem to add a ton of drag that slows me down even before I deploy them. Adding draggy parts seem like such an inelegant solution though, and I don\u0027t know if that approach will scale well when I build heavier crafts (not to mention wastes a lot of fuel on ascent.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what exactly changed in 1.0.4 that seems to have nerfed the chutes so much? Reduced air drag so crafts don\u0027t hit terminal velocity as quickly as well as raising the terminal velocity? Or is some part of the atmosphere a lot less dense now that it doesn\u0027t decelerate crafts as much? Understanding what changed will help me redesign all my old crafts much quicker.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T01:03:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 01:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by simsatellite\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T14:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDrag seems to have been decreased, so you don\u0027t slow down as much.

You want the CoM as close to the blunt end as possible to ensure stability during reentry. At only 0.2 tonnes, the science junior is very light.
