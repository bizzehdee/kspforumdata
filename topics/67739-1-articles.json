This is not a science-currency-making mod, this is a science-making mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod will really be two separate mods: a Telemetry Radio, and an on-board Data Recorder, both of which being RemoteTech-compatible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Telemetry Radio will consist of five things: a transmitter, a receiver, \u0022air\u0022, a standard data transmission protocol, and a lossless data compressor (Huffman coding). A craft will be able to transmit data into space, and any listener (other craft, KSC, etc) that has a connection, will receive the signal, with the appropriate delay. The Telemetry Radio mod should be considered a basic framework from which to build other mods that wish to transmit data non-instantly. Transmission will occur on one of eight possible channels, and the receiver must tune to the channel it wants to receive the data it expects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the biggest restriction to Telemetry Radio is that it requires you to have a connection in order to receive any full message. This is where Data Recorder comes in. Data Recorder will have two areas: a hard drive part on which to temporarily store data awaiting transmission, and an in-game GUI which lets you chose which game variables to record and transmit. Data Recorder allow you to send a craft someplace where it may have an intermittent connection to KSC. The data is recorded on the craft hard drive until a connection is established, and then the recorded data is transmitted back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESource:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/griderd/TelemetryRadio\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/griderd/TelemetryRadio\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUPDATE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod is dead-ish.

It will look kind of like BinaryStream. There will be a basic transmission protocol, containing information for the length of the data, the sender ID, as well as the data itself, as well as a data compressor. Both may be optionally used, but it\u0027s not required. Using the transmission protocol could come in handy for most people because it will contain a reader and writer basic data types, and convert everything into raw bytes. The bytes will be sent in packets of four bytes per Unity update cycle. So it\u0027s both a serial and parallel transmission - serial transmission of four-byte chunks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Data Recorder will be using Telemetry Radio to send telemetry data, sensor data, and the like, and when it arrives on Kerbin, it will be written as a CSV. Data Recorder will allow the user to pick variables to log, and the frequency, and they will be logged accordingly. However, because the Data Recorder hard disk part isn\u0027t infinitely large, you have to be careful not to record data too often if you\u0027re going to have a large blackout period, or it will start overwriting the beginning. Data Recorder will send all of its data on a single channel, one variable at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you wanted to, you could use Telemetry Radio to create a mod that transmits sounds from your space craft, but everything would arrive on a delay. As long as you know how to encode and decode the data, and your mod is equipped to handle data in mid-transmission, you can transmit anything you want however you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expect that, if people actually create mods with Telemetry Radio, the eight channels will not be enough. Especially since doing both input and output requires two channels. Therefore, I am planning, for the future, to release a version that allows multiple signals to be multiplexed onto a single channel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frozenbacon","CreatedById":49001,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T05:04:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, gotcha.

Want o make a map of the magnetosphere of jool for you to create the most antimatter possible with jool? Just track your altitude around jool and your current location in relation to the surface of jool and you can find the optimal orbit to collect the antimatter. What if you wanted to make a suborbital trajectory system based off of the kethane or extraplanetary launchpad resource data you collected? Again, once you get the raw data you can find the most optimal paths for your needs. Things like that are only as good as your space program is. If you have gaps in your data, you may not end up with the result that you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis type of gameplay isn\u0027t for everyone, but for people who enjoy playing based off of the data their space program creates (even if they don\u0027t have much time to play like me so campaigns may last quite a long time), it opens up so many possibilities for them.
