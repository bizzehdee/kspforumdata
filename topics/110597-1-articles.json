This is meant to be a challenge to get everybody to try out new things in KSP. Too often do we get stuck in a single mindset, focused on a singular task like finding a way to slingshot around every planet and into the sun. There is a lot of fun stuff that you can do in this game, and it would be a real shame to miss out on any of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really use these forums, so if you want to make a comment that you wish for me to see, please make it here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3724di/the_kerbal_joint_strike_fighter_xplane_challenge/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3724di/the_kerbal_joint_strike_fighter_xplane_challenge/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
