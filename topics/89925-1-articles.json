In fact, it\u0027s been discussed so many times that it\u0027s the #1 item on the \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not To Suggest\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 list. That\u0027s not a bad thing, but it\u0027s up there for a few reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, fear not! Squad has said that they will visit the idea of Multiplayer at some point down the road. Also, there is currently a fan created mod called Dark Multiplayer (DM) that allows you to play multi. It can be a bit laggy, but it does the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of that, I will close this thread. Please feel free to visit the DM thread and further discuss the virtues of multiplayer. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
