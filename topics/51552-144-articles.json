Essentially, RT is no longer working. The connection bar says N/A for probes, I cant activate/deactivate any RT antennas and the squad antennas have reverted back to the old options of extend and transmit. The map does however show that there are connections between the antenna and whatnot and the dishes are still pointed at the bodies. On a possibly related note, the map has also started occasionally failing on me, by which I mean when I go to the map, be it through M button or the tracking station, it is just a pitch black screen with nothing visible. Im not sure if this bug is due to RT itself or something else as it also appears to have partially broken mechjeb as well.
