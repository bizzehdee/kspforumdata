Curiosity is going ot have more instruments(and better) than the MER(s). But upgradeable scientific instruments would add to progression. Better engines and such I disagree with because that messes with balance. But I\u0027d like to see instruments advance in detail over time, like in our world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad_Scientist","CreatedById":145581,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T14:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think such functionality can be implemented using\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128204-11-kerbal-research-development/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E this mode\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T03:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m gonna note that the thermometer and barometer not being at the first science node doesn\u0027t make a whole lot of sense, and I\u0027m not sure what the game-balance choice for it was.
