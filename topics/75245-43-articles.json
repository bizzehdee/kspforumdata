That second payload of probes had the issue, but it was the second probe I tried to control, not first, and not counting the lift stages. It was odd because at first it would just not point in the right direction, it would be 90 degrees off in the same direction every time. MJ could point to a node fine though. I was only able to stop the spin with MJ if I made sure to stop sending kill rotation commands from the flight computer as well.

I would like a difficulty setting that causes omnidirectional antennas to be able to automatically connect to only the nearest other omnidirectional antenna in range. Each antenna can only have one task at a time. If you want an active relay from A \u0026gt; B through C then C needs two antennas. This way, for instance, if we are controlling a rover on the surface, in order to minimize blackouts it benefits us to built commlink sats with enough antennas to maintain connections with each other (2), the relay back to kerbin from where ever you are AND the surface.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI, we\u0027re much less likely to overlook feature requests if they\u0027re posted on GitHub.
