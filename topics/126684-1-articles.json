I found this out by inadvertently using an image from the internet archive in my signature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Editing an image that is also a url link using the ctrl-right-click editing tool does not let you change the image. It says it\u0027s changing the image, but instead is changing the link. This may be specific to when those image links are copy/pasted from another site and not using the forum editing tools.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) (not image related and just noticed now) The forum will break works up over line endings. If we\u0027re forcing 2-line paragraph breaks as the default because the other way is old school, shouldn\u0027t we also eschew the old practice of wrapping a single word across 2 lines?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
