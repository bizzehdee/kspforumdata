With 0.24 on the horizon, I have some ideas that might or might not turn into a mod (which would get me started with modding KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome basics around the idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The ARM pack spawns random asteroids around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75376-Asteroid-Spawn-API\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E some folks smarter then me managed to spawn asteroids manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 0.24 can spawn Kerbals in orbits for contracts, I suppose its all the same mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- from what I\u0027ve heard so far, the contract system is designed to be mod-able, so it will have some API support to create new contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Create missions to spawn and explore derelict ships. These may or may not have some science on board in addition to the contract, some may have recoverable parts, all good reasons to capture them and bring them back to KSP. The spawned ships could come from a directory with craft files, so it would be easily customizable and extendable. The derelict ships could be anything from lost rockets, pods, to alien vessels, whatever people come up with. Some randomized elements would be nice to spice it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA question to the modders:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you see any showblocking elements of the API or the moddability of KSP that would prevent this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course we dont know much about the contracts part yet - it does not necessarily have to be attached to those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t taken a look yet at the KSP API and Unity so I\u0027d be starting from scratch ( but I am familiar with C# from work, so the programming itself should be doable )\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
