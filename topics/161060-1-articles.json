rover, you can sat network... as long as you\u0027ve opened up the OKTO.\u00A0 The rest of this is an opinion for avoiding your original concern.\u00A0 However, as stated for your original question, when the face of the Mun the rover is on is facing Kerbin and you\u0027ve got enough antenna, you can directly communicate with Kerbin to drive it.\u00A0 Be aware, you will be in the dark during this time 50% of your communication time, so no power generation on the rover when you can actually talk to it.\u00A0 This will severely limit you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s talk distances then.\u00A0 With a Tracking Station 2, which reaches 50 Gm range, the built in comm system on a MK1 pod/OKTO can directly talk to Kerbin.\u00A0 Mun is roughly 10 Mm up, and you can reach 15.81 Mm with those built in comm systems.\u00A0 Unless it\u0027s absolutely pinned on part count, however, I\u0027d slap a 16-S or a 16 onto it for sanity.\u00A0 For reference, three Comm-16 antennas on a ship to Minmus for Tracking 1 is fine (54.77 Mm comm range)\u00A0if you don\u0027t need relay.\u00A0 Tracking 2 is basically upgraded for near body interplanetary communications and Patched Conics/Maneuver Nodes, and can hit Mun without any help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I really recommend you put up your commnet.\u00A0 Three flat solar panels, two MG-5s for balance,\u00A0two Oscar-B tanks, a Spark, and an OKTO 1 is a relay satellite.\u00A0 Put up 4 roughly on the corners of a square around Mun equatorially\u00A0and you\u0027re good for a while, and they\u0027re incredibly cheap to put into orbit riding a thrust limited BACC \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E inside a fairing for most of the trip to orbit.\u00A0 You don\u0027t

\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E don\u0027t want to rover the Mun with the little shopping cart wheels, so you should have the OKTO.\u00A0 Wait for the orange ones for sanity.\u00A0 The offroad looking ones are really where you want to be though, you\u0027re going to be doing ~50-100 kilometers of driving for some of the rover contracts,\u00A0nevermind how well you can land it on target.\u00A0 Those little ones are fine for minor base movers but they\u00A0fall apart\u00A0too easily going overland at speed in my
