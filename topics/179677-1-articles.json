The most efficient trajectories are calculated beforehand, so the rocket knows exactly how to turn itself so that it reaches the desired orbit without having to coast beforehand. The main reason\u00A0they don\u0027t have to do a circularization burn like we do in Kerbal Space Program is because Earth is much bigger than Kerbin. If you want to do a single burn to reach orbit around Kerbin, you have to turn very fast to get horizontal before reaching orbital speeds. Kerbin has an atmospheric height similar to that of Earth\u0027s, but it\u0027s orbital velocity is only about 2300 m/s whereas Earth\u0027s orbital velocity is over 6000 m/s. Additionally, Kerbin\u0027s radius is 600 km and Earth\u0027s radius is about 6000 km. That means when you\u0027re getting into orbit around Earth, you spend a lot more time burning horizontally when already in space to get enough velocity to clear the curve of the planet, which is very shallow. On Kerbin, the time spent in the atmosphere is a much bigger part of getting into orbit, and you end up much higher relative to Kerbin\u0027s curve before you\u0027ve turned over completely. This usually puts you on a trajectory where you need to wait a while before you reach a place where you can circularize your orbit. When launching into Earth\u0027s orbit, you can spend a lot of time keeping horizontal during your initial burn and keeping your apoapsis close - allowing you to circularize your orbit without having to wait for a second burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can better understand this effect if you try launching a rocket in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E or a 10x scale KSP\u00A0system. You will notice that you spend much more time circularizing, and that you can do that during your initial burn much easier than on a small planet like Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-10T02:40:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2018 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by cubinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-10T07:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real life, orbital velocity is much higher than in KSP, so the circularization time is much higher, and it sort of spills over into the ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150330-cubinator/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022150330\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150330-cubinator/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@cubinator\u003C/a\u003E, while I\u0027m pretty sure some rockets in real life do use precomputed trajectories, many use Powered Explicit Guidance Ascent System (PEGAS) or a variant thereof.
