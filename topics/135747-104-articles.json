IMO the Augustine commission tried to kill Constellation for good reasons. Clearly, a big part of its raison d\u0027etre, at least as far as the U.S. Congress is concerned, is naked political patronage of the old shuttle suppliers. I have always favored the alternate model for manned space exploration based on commercial medium lift/orbital propellant depots/on-orbit servicing and assembly which I see as much more robust and sustainable under the present and likely near-future circumstances than huge heavy lift rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...That said, I find the profound pessimism about SLS widespread amongst my fellow space nerds (as sometimes evidenced in these forums), to be counterproductive.

A plan that doesn\u0027t make ridiculous assumptions about flight rates, game-changing technologies, \u0027Kennedy moments\u0027, or massive budget increases. This is exactly the kind of incremental planning NASA should have continued to pursue since the Apollo landings (instead of having to restart from scratch every new Presidential administration).
