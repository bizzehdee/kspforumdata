I\u0027m using the bits the Fustek allowed free use of- the internals. I just wanted to convert one to an external part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe catch is- when I try to place the part on a ship, it sinks into whatever part I\u0027m placing it on. How do I change where the \u0027back\u0027 of a model is, for the editor\u0027s sake?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErm, additionally I kinda found out you can\u0027t pick the part up again once you place it in the VAB.
