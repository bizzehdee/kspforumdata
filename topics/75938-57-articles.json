Not had anyone run into that particular issue thus far, and I think Gaalidas\u0027 answer pretty much covers anything I would add. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr that node toggler from the new B9 package, used specifically on the huge HX parts.\u003Cp\u003EThis experiment also showed that a few of the parts might benefit from some tweaked positions for both attach node types to better align with the visual position of the connecting part of the model. For instance, the side-mounted repulsors have the center of their surface and stack nodes set a little higher than the center of the area of the model that would be expected to be the attachment spot. I don\u0027t know how that would affect the attachment of the part though, just an observation. It\u0027s a little like some of the bobcat wheels and landing legs. Those things were huge and looked awesome if you\u0027re going for \u0022nuttier than modern sci-fi\u0022 but their attachment nodes were in such a horrible position that trying to surface attach them to your craft was a huge pain. The attach node was at the center of that side of the model, but the modeled part that \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be the attachment point on the hull was 10 feet above it. I tried adjusting those nodes in the past, but it was a real pain without knowing what the scale was. I\u0027ll experiment a bit more if I get the chance. As it is, the stack node hasn\u0027t interfered with the placement of the parts unless a stack node in the same orientation was placed on the part I was attaching to, and sicne most stack nodes will be aligned with the... uhh... stack, well... I see little chance for anything out of whack to happen. Still, might have to add compatibility for a toggler anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and the node size is up for debate. I picked what deemed to be fair, and bumped it up and down based on the side of the part I was dealing with (using the standard M1 wheel size as a measuring stick, so to speak.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYES!
