Apparently, all of the legacy parts are not showing up in the VAB/SPH, but *are* in the research window. The rework parts are showing up, but no legacy items are there. Any idea what is going on here?\n\nAlso, this issue is present whether I have the rework installed or not.\n\nKSP v1.0.4\n\nIR v0.21.3\n\nIR Rework v01b\n\nTotal of 66 mods installed including the 3 IR related. I can list if necessary, but not looking forward to it.

I have vessels from before 1.0.4. I think they\u0027re from 1.0.0 though, nothing from 0.90. Those vessels don\u0027t work in similar manner to yours.\n\nHowever, there is also the problem that I can\u0027t even \\*get\\* the legacy parts in the VAB. I still want to use them. The Docking Washer is excellent for making VTOL craft, since it is super flat and attaches anywhere. I stick it to the bottom of wings and then add a basic jet engine... and bam, I have a VTOL. Better than that, the basic jet engine is precisely at center of mass because I make certain to place it such.\n\nAnyway, until such time as the rework is completed, I still want and need access to the legacy parts.\n\nIs there some way to make it happen?"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T14:04:14Z","Content":"New to the mod here: is there a way to node-attach the rotating parts ?
