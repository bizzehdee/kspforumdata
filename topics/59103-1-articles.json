While your altitude might be 2km up, you could be landing in a low area, making you burn more often by thinking you are closer to the ground than you actually are. Once I learned about the radar gauge in IVA it helped me with my landings by letting me burn less often and still get down to about 5-6 ms before touch down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TerrificToby","CreatedById":58095,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T21:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei do use the mechjeb readouts though\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T21:45:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry try again. You just have to learn by errors. First, you have to have a capable ship, and once you have that you can land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo land: If you lower your periapsis to ~5 Km above your target landing site, and burn retrograde early enough that you are in a ballistic trajectory before you reach periapsis, you should be able to land by pointing retrograde and managing throttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo return to Kerbin, take of east roughly like you would on Kerbin, but begin the gravity turn earlier. Also, make LMO around 20-30 Km. Using a maneuver node or sight, which is not too difficult, put your craft on a free return trajectory by burning so your escape trajectory is in the opposite direction of the Mun\u0027s prograde. Lowering your Perikee at this point is more efficient than doing so in Kerbin orbit after escaping the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can add pictures if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T04:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHiya, as Tank said, learning by errors is the best way. However, you are probably like me, and poof Kerbals makes me feel sad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, when I first started my moon missions, I planned for always having an escape route. Therefore I always make sure my landing engines, and launch engines use separate fuel supplies. In the early days before I had my lander design exactly how I wanted, I would attempt landing. If I got too low on lander fuel, I would jettison and just abort mission, returning to kerbin in my launch vehicle. To start, the MK 1 pod, medium 1m tank, and that 1m efficient engine which I can never remember the name of gives plenty of fuel for goofing around on your return trip or abort.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T05:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most fuel efficient way to land on any body is to put your periapsis as close to the surface of the body you are landing on as possible, same as in that video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you reach the periapsis you burn horizontally as to kill all horizontal velocity, as you begin to drop you compensate if necessary by burning upwards a little bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou then descent slowly and safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the same approach as shown in the video in the first reply by astropapi1, and it is the most fuel efficient way no matter what your TWR is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"irongut","CreatedById":97315,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T13:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s much easier to land on Minimus than Mun and not really any harder to get there.
