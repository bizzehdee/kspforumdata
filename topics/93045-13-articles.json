Different failures I got-\u003Cp\u003E-Vanguard fails to ignite (but the other \u0022engine\u0022 that is in the engine part keeps firing, making it hard to notice) and the rocket tips over. This happened twice, but unlike the real infamous TV3 incident, I could recover most of the rocket afterwards. I began to use launch clamps and checked the F3 menu before blastoff. The Vanguard engine became fairly reliable - it would frequently fail to ignite, but I could prevent total failure with launch clamps, and I only recall a few in-flight failures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The AJ-10 quickly became the issue. It would fail to ignite, shut down, or downright explode on several occasions. In fact, I even did a \u0022static firing\u0022 for the Flight Test mod by holding the stage down with launch clamps for a \u0022ground test.\u0022 Even on my final successful launch, it would frequently \u0022lose thrust\u0022, reducing it to somewhere around half power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-With AJ-10 failures (or even, if I remember correctly, total successes), I kept failing to make orbit. One particular case I remember is where my periapsis was 80 or 90km, below the edge of the atmosphere. I used the satellite for a bit before terminating. I eventually fixed this by using 4 SRBs (copies of the Altair solid-fuel stage.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, the British \u0022Gamma\u0022 engines have no FlightTest configs.

In some cases, one may consider this cheating, but as it\u0027s a single-player game, it\u0027s not like you\u0027re harming anyone else by doing so. In many cases parts are moved to earlier nodes, or reduced in price, so using the \u0022unsupported\u0022 parts is actually a handycap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s one huge reason why having \u0022unsupported\u0022 parts visible and tagged: we *know* they\u0027re unsupported.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf these parts were hidden, there\u0027s no reminder when playing that their data needs to be updated.

Gives a very nice pace through the tech and mission profiles. Follows is my new player experience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting with the sounding rockets is cool, learning to get those to fly straight works as a perfect method of unlearning stock-ksp design habits. Lack of attitude control really forces you to design right. The progression through to the sas-locking stayputs is a lot of fun. With these two phases teaching you aerodynamic forms and control-through-design then the transition to orbital flights feels natural and I now know the techniques needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was not really familiar with the history of real rocket launches and didn\u0027t research, so designed my craft from scratch. I found it interesting that I was able to come up with work-arounds for issues that varied from the historical solutions, though comparing the two techniques side by side always showed mine inferior, they both still worked. In particular it never occurred to me to use solid kicker first stages to mitigate the low pad TWR on my heavy aniline sounding probes, I had my tinytims as final stage for a huge uncontrolled burn in upper atmosphere. Ultimately I would adopt both tactics according to the need, but the feeling of having come up with something that flies is gratifying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started with moderate difficulty settings and things felt pretty well balanced. I will add that I use stage recovery, its a little moot early game where the entire rocket costs peanuts and later game even first stages tend to burn up, but it let me make a few mistakes and abort launches without haemorrhaging cash. Cash is thin, but rockets cost so very little at the start, the removal of kerbin surface sci makes sense and tempers the scumming that usually begins a game of KSP. It was fun angling sounding rockets and spitting them into neighbouring biomes. I used only parts flagged as rp-0 placed and costed where i could, there seems to be more than enough options to build decent systems and I like the way some engines upgrade as your tech level climbs (something i loved in interstellar). I did start to feel things were moving a little slow right about the time I was taking the 150mil meter sounding contract. I had just managed to put a stayput with basic solar panels into LEO which meant i could rinse-and-repeat the \u0027Science data from space\u0027 contracts. Actually sitting in mission control churning the contract list to generate and fill these for cash was boring, so i did a couple as proof of concept then hacked in 50,000 funds and upped the pad. Right about here I started my manned program, cash and sci flows much happier. Theres just a little dead-spot right after you get your first sat orbits/really high soundings where you cant upgrade and theres not much interesting to do beyond wait for sci data contracts. This may will be manageable with stronger design skills, maybe I could have gone further with pad 1, but I was already on mark 11 of my orbiters and at partcap. Eventually i took another 200k to get vab 2 since i couldnt do manned with 30 parts and was again unwilling to grind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathorn","CreatedById":99662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T20:08:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne big cause of the first dead spot IMHO is the inability to manage the early orbital contracts.
