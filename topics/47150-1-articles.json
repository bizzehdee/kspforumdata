First starting with the 0.20.2 version and all worked well enjoying it from git to go! I then saw some videos regarding MechJeb 1.9.8 and in my game it went. That worked as well. a while later my game made me aware of a recent KSP update (0.21.1). I put that in and all the extra parts became available. Cool! Getting used to things, I thought,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn YouTube I noticed a video with a link to the Kerbal Spaceport to download [0.21.1] KW Rocketry v2.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etry my hand at at the larger rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere along the line something went awry. No matter which, where or how I place an SAS module, it will not light up or function before during or after launch when it\u0027s selected, as well as the RCS. The Mechjeb, which worker fine before will now only give me bits of info during ascent autopilot, otherwise will not function either. The camera functions are off their rocker as well. The cameras will not remain in position when \u0027V\u0027 keyed to the desired aspect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve deleted everything KSP on my system and tried reloading it. I\u0027ve tried reloading the original version I joined with (0.20.2) alone, to loading 0.21.1 alone. No mods or anything.
