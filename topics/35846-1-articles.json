These metalloproteins contain two copper atoms that reversibly bind a single oxygen molecule (O2). They are second only to hemoglobin in frequency of use as an oxygen transport molecule. Unlike the hemoglobin in red blood cells found in vertebrates, hemocyanins are not bound to blood cells but are instead suspended directly in the hemolymph. Oxygenation causes a color change between the colorless Cu(I) deoxygenated form and the blue Cu(II) oxygenated form.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.dreamstime.com/stock-photos-oxidized-copper-texture-image1866363\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/thumblarge_118/1170387043KtaDPK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221170387043KtaDPK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
