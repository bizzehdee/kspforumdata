Let me explain, sometimes i intent to propel a bigger ship with some Q3 \u0022positron\u0022 Kannae drives, but the amount of parts i would need to do so would raise the part count very high. Don\u0027t get me wrong, i\u0027m not looking for a more efficient engine, just the possibility to make the existing one bigger to keep part count tolerable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen it comes to new ideas for parts, i could imagine a engine, similar like the \u0027Project Orion\u0027 Nuclear Pulse Engine from the same mod (but working, lol). What i mean by that is a big and powerful Engine that is fuelled by very expensive or hard to create fuel. (Like using 1000 ore for 1 unit of fuel for example.) You know something that is and really feels powerful. It doesn\u0027t need to be precise, but powerful, similar like the mentioned \u0022Project Orion\u0022 engine. Another thing would be to just scale up the Beta-SW \u0022zubrin\u0022 nuclear drive to a more appropriate size (for it\u0027s power). I only mention it, because it seems way too powerful for its size for my taste, so how about scaling the model up about 2x and make it a heavier? (Don\u0027t get me wrong, but i never use it because it feels a bit too cheaty to me \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome other random ideas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to go the more sci fi route, how about a fancy mass-reducing device?

It\u0027ll do catch-up processing when the vessel regains focus, solving your problem. You may however, require an input resource for this to work correctly (give it a go and see), it\u0027s a bit of an untidy solution but it may work.\u00A0A better solution would be to use\u00A0ModuleResourceHarvester, since you\u0027re actually harvesting resources,\u00A0but I\u0027m pretty sure the resource has to exist (in the stock resource system, or Community Resource Pack)\u00A0at the location you\u0027re attempting to harvest for that module to have any effect. Of course, there\u0027s nothing to stop you including a resource generation config to ensure that dust is always present throughout the solar system and can always be harvested. Check the Karbonite config in the community resource pack for some hints, I\u0027d be happy to give you a hand there if you want. Once you\u0027ve setup a configuration for it, the stock resource system will automatically generate it wherever you\u0027ve specified (even retroactively in old saves) and make it available for harvesting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure Background Processing is appropriate in this case.

Dropping the ISP down to 800, so it matches the stock nuclear engine, dropped thrust down to 4500, and playing with the fuel ratios for the transition to Blutonium from Ore. These are only as it stands in development right now and are\u00A0subject to change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Carbonjvd\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carbonjvd","CreatedById":137685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-19T12:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new update is out for 1.1.2, and has had the version updated from v0.4.8 to v0.5.0! So what\u0027s new to warrant such a change? At the request of various people, a new nuclear fuel has been added to the mod in form of Blutonium. That and a whole bunch of new parts!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis new resource has a power yield 10 times greater than ore, is similarly more expensive and a good bit more dense. All the existing reactors running on ore have been switched to Blutonium, so existing saves\u0027 ships will be been fully functional, although resources may be a bit wonky with both the ore and Blutonium storage in the same part. Blutonium has to be taken directly from\u00A0Kerbin, since it now lasts 10 times longer, or be refined out of ore using one of two new massive parts that each function as centrifuge refineries. One is designed as orbital module with the other designed as terrestrial base hub, both doing the job of refining Blutonium out of ore. This will hopefully make the usage of reactors more challenging and encourage dedicated facilities to its production.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther new parts include 2.5 meter versions of the Zubrin Nuclear Drive and the Attero Magnetic Drive with appropriate scaling. Along with a\u00A0smaller version available, the Zubrin Nuclear Drive has been rebuilt to be more balanced with an ISP of 1200, shaved down thrust by 200KN, and use a local Blutonium stockpile instead of an external ore supply. A similar change has been implemented in every nuclear engine, specifically regarding the replacement of ore with Blutonium as a fuel requirement and the local Blutonium stores. No additional storage parts have been included due to nature of Blutonium being a radioactive resource, so only dedicated parts can store it. That being said it is still fully transferable between parts, just make sure the reactor isn\u0027t drained of Blutonium to run your engines or vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the new parts include a pair of asteroid grabbers, one larger and one smaller, that provide more options for asteroid utilization. A control bunker that functions as a very large\u00A0probe core with a grabber attachment allows for even larger control options. A more normal sized Camera Core gives what would otherwise be a standard probe core with a built-in infrared telescope to hunt down addition asteroids. The final new part is Dual Maneuver Unit that combines a nuke\u00A0RCS with a fully functional\u00A0SAS for 1.25 meter craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBackground processing is being looked into, but it won\u0027t be ready for\u00A0a while.

It\u0027s a bit unpractical in my opinion to keep track of each part that uses that resource (if you happen to have more than part using it on a vessel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know about other people here, but i\u0027m perfectly ok with (overly) powerful Sci-fi like engines, as long as it\u0027s hard/expensive to produce fuel for it.

If i had the time (and talent), i would love to create a small addition to this mod myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I have some basic concepts but neither time nor the knowledge to realize it.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you considered to create something like a (non warp) drive system that is powerfull enough to reach other star systems within a reasonable time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could imagine a enormous engine \u002B energy source that are way too big and massive to be build on Kerbin or to be used on a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, maybe something like a bussard ramjet or orion drive system for a pure space ship. A massive Blutonium reactor (or something even more powerful) could create enough energy to generate a wide area manetic field to collect resources while travelling (dust, Hydrogen or deuterium) to propel the engine with. But the critical resource would be blutonium (or something else) to run the reactor. So the ship wouldn\u0027t need to be refuelled with x amounts of tons of actual fuel but much smaller amounts of Blutonium (or whatever those even more powerful reactors need to run). The ship could be refuelled by a smal lander/shuttle carrying much smaller amounts of reactor fuel, instead of sending dozends of heavy rockets into orbit. The hard (or better said expensive) part of it would be to produce the reactor fuel and the costs to build the engine system (Reactor, Engine some other fancy parts maybe).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course that\u0027s a much more Sci-fi -ish concept than normal KSP mods are, but i would love to have something like this in KSP. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carbonjvd","CreatedById":137685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T12:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModerate sized update this time to v0.5.2, mainly for cleaning up some parts and rebuilding the nuclear jets.

To that end I added yet another resource, Compressed Atmosphere aka \u0022CompressedAtm\u0022 for use in the rebuilt nuclear jets. The two nuclear jets now have built-in Compressed Atmosphere intakes and use that as propellant instead. The nuclear scramjet however has had even more features added to it. Not only does it use the Compressed Atmosphere for propellant, but can switch to using Oxidizer for ultra-high altitude propulsion. To add to the increased functionality, it also has a built-in PreCooler that uses electricity to compress the atmosphere even further by a factor of 10, so you can fly in open cycle even higher without switching to Oxidizer in closed cycle. A secondary function of the PreCooler is that it also extracts a miniscule amount of\u00A0Oxidizer from Compressed Atmosphere to slowly refill the oxidizer tanks, though does require electricity to run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking into new ways to clean up\u00A0the mod, and add more parts like the even more super engines everyone likes.
