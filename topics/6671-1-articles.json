Ergo, \u0027cheating\u0027. This is just for my enjoyment however, and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to even get a part to load in the parts lab, despite reading the read me text included in the SDK file. Can someone please, as if to a 6 year old, tell me how to load a part so I can edit?
