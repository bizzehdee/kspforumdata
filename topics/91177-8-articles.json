Essentially, over time, 100% of the heat generated must be radiated somehow. Firing a laser weapon that is 20% efficient radiates 20% of the energy as laser light, so you need to radiate the other 80% via radiators of some kind. Ditto for the nuclear electric engine case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the surface of your spacecraft hull radiates heat at a rate proportional to the T^4 (temperature raised to the fourth power), any parts of your ship that are not high temperature radiators can be ignored as they don\u0027t radiate enough heat to matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just the overall theory. In practice, using foreseeable future tech, heat management is an even bigger problem because a lot of the nifty gadgets you need require very low temperatures to work. Sensitive infrared detectors to spot enemy ships - better cool that detector down to reduce thermal noise in the sensor element and also use a cooled shroud to protect it from IR from your own ship. Want a coilgun? All those magnets need to be cold, even if room temp superconductors are possible, superconductors work \u003Cem\u003Ebetter \u003C/em\u003Ewhen cold.

It will be on a solid-fuel air-launched rocket like Pegasus, again to match inclinations, avoid bad weather, all that stuff. It consists of three major parts: a little hypergolic tug like Fregat to put it on a trajectory that will roughly intersect with the enemy. Mounted on top is a modified P-Pod, built to carry at least 4Us of Cubesat. And then the Killer Buses themselves, at least two Cubesats, probably at least 2U each to carry enough maneuvering fuel to rendezvous with the bad spacecraft. With multiple operating in tandem like sheepdogs, likely at least one will get really close. Then it detonates a charge, becoming a small cloud of lethal space debris.

These will look a lot like James Webb Space Telescope, but with bigger solar panels and bigger radiators to power the laser. If you had infinite money and infinite rockets, the best way to use these would be the way you use Killer Bus, but without having to have near as precise aiming. Unfortunately these things are probably way to expensive to regularly eject onto solar orbits. But even at low power, laserstars are the natural enemy of telescopes (including other laserstars). It eats flimsy, temperature-sensitive, finely tuned mirrors for breakfast. (If low power lasers are also good at frying solar panels, laserstars rule the solar system until we start regularly launching nuclear-powered spacecraft, but I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know if they are.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where it starts to get complicated.

Moon for some complex weak stability trajectories and stuff, but most or all infrastructures will probably center on Keck Institute-style redirected asteroids. Little Philae-looking Kuck Mousquitos will drill for water ice to keep as drinking water, crack into oxygen for breathing, crack into hydrogen to resupply Sabatier reactions, crack into hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel, and to make hydrogen peroxide. They will also drill for ammonia ice, and using the peroxide process (with that hydrogen peroxide), to make hydrazine, and with catalytic oxidation, to make nitrogen tetroxide. For rocket fuel. Hydrogen doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t keep for very long, so any maneuver not falling under the category \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Crocket stage putting something on a transfer trajectory\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 will be done with hypergolics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kuck Mosquitos will probably be teleoperated by astronauts in a space station somewhere in the vicinity of Keckistan. Mining is a difficult and unpredictable process, and mining in space will probably require constant supervision, and ocaissionally quick reactions to imminent problems. It is also one of the few cases in which it is probably easier to send astronauts to fix the probes that break, rather than just launch new ones. It is natural to assume that this is where the probes return to offload their freshly extracted ices, and where those ices get turned into something useful. It is equally natural to assume that there will be many of these stations, each supervising a rock, or a set of rocks. It is possible that this station will actually be on the surface. This simplifies protection against radiation, if most planetoids end up having enough regolith to make Mooncrete with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose rocks will be fiercely protected, there might be some big fighting landers, and maybe Laserstars keeping station. They would be regularly serviced by the nearby astronauts, as station-keeping requires non-trivial amounts of fuel. Once you have reliable data from L1 telescopes (protected by friendly Laserstars?), you need to immediately launch a large expedition, before this advantage gets Killer Bussed away. Ultimately the goal is to get your astronauts to those asteroid stations, and get their astronauts out, so this expedition will be manned. It will probably consist of a big central command spacecraft with a habitat, ferries, landers, and enough delta vee to brake onto orbit. The rest of the constellation will probably include some more telescopes, maybe some Laserstars, and lots of Killer Bus. The latter will stay on hyperbolic trajectories, and impact as much of the bad guy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s stuff as possible. If they aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t successful enough, the manned segment of the mission might be aborted. Otherwise the command spacecraft brakes onto High Badguyville Orbit, and launches astronauts to start boarding and taking over the bases. Depending on how successful this part is, their space infrastructure is taken over, and the interplanetary war is won!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T19:50:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums Kibble!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EzinX","CreatedById":118288,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T20:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood stuff Kibble.

Re: your comment I guess that depends on how effective lasers would be against them. I\u0027m sure most satellite components can be ruggedized against high temperature variations, and we probably won\u0027t have lasers that can actually vaporize metal until we have lots of fissioning in space (which I don\u0027t think will be for a \u003Cstrong\u003Elong\u003C/strong\u003E while). However if low-powered lasers can fry solar panels, then the Killer Bus would have to have an alternate power source, like an RTG, which IIRC can be fairly heavy, maybe even heavy enough (when you have to launch at least two plus the propulsion bus) that it defeats their main advantage over sending a Laserstar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T22:41:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe situation that you have outlined though Kibble ends up having an interesting issue. So, like I had pointed out in my post, the defender has something of an advantage against missiles in that he knows where the enemy is trying to go. Lets say the laser sats in the lagrange point that you mention have redeployable solar sails on them. Once an attack is though to be on its way (early stages), then they could open these up and start nudging themselves in random directions. Considering the distance between Earth and the lagrange points in question, this means your rocket is going to need to adjust its course to match. Now, the acceleration is likely not to be too much if its just a base solar panel, and a small size is probably what it gets if it is redeployable. That\u0027s fine! We\u0027ve known for a while that laser pumped solar panels can do quite a lot of interesting things when it comes to acceleration. You can utilize the main beams from the other satellites (I am assuming you have a few in the general area) to give each other shoves in different directions that could be quite powerful (NASA conducted a microwave beam test on a small solar sail in a lab on Earth and calculated that if you scaled the system up to its likely size, it could quite easily reach full G levels of acceleration from the beam).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, you have some other laser sats (probably using solar sails themselves to maintain position relative to the lagrange points) that can fire their beams towards the lagrange point sats so they can \u0027reverse\u0027 to some extent. Of course, once the killer sats start coming in, pack up the sails, present your thinnest feature to them and hope for the best. Chances are unless you sucked at this game, you will probably survive if the incoming are unable to manage a fairly precise intercept. Clouds of shrapnel tend not to work over the ranges most likely to be experienced in space.

I\u0027m really not thinking too hard here, but if for example Combatant A found a NEO in a highly inclined orbit, currently viewable only from the southern hemisphere and heading earth/sunward; would it be a matter of taking out Combatant B\u0027s southern hemisphere telescopes and using information control and misdirection to hide it\u0027s existence from them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould it be also that the asteroid be given enough delta-v so that no nation on earth could possibly counteract it?

It\u0027s a totally reckless and as you say, dangerous strategy regardless and would indeed make more sense for in-system planetary bombardment.
