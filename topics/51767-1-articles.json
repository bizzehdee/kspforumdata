Because Science system is not balanced yet and it is too easy to get everything unlocked I modified ScienceDefs.cfg so that I receive only 1/5 of science that I would normally get for my missions. This will require me to complete more mission using simpler equipment and do more planing before I send my Kerbals out into a space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EBackground story to let\u0027s play.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals never showed any interest in space travel and colonisations of other planets. Even though this peaceful race was capable of great achievements, Kerbals were content with the way things were on their planet. Agriculture and simple machinery were the most Kerbals ever wanted from life. Science was often looked at with fear and anger as any Kerbals were always afraid of change. Everything changed about 10 years ago when mystery during huge meteor storm mystery goo was found landing on the planet. Within fortnight population of Kerbin was reduced to half of what it was with strange illness killing every other citizen and spreading in exponential rate. All greatest mind of Kerbal Civilisation were put together and solve this problem. Luckily scientists were successful in producing vaccine but millions of dead were reminder that this could happen again. Within year time special commission was called to develop program to send kerbals to other planets and survey for any other potential hazards. 9 years of intensive research and labour finnaly resulted in creation of Kerbal Space Centre. Bravest people of planet Kerbin finally finished their traing are are ready to lunch their first manned rocket. Group leader Major Jebediah Karman and his two team mates Capitac Bill Kerman and 1st Lieutenant Bob Kerman were the only people who successfully passed their test with a big group of people still in training it was up to them to star their first mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOur first official photos:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i431.photobucket.com/albums/qq31/Feniks_photo/screenshot0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Space Centre\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i431.photobucket.com/albums/qq31/Feniks_photo/screenshot1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrave Kerbal Heroes (from left Major Jebediah Karman, Capitan Bill Kerman and 1st Lieutenant Bob Kerman).
