Each time you go into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, it\u0027s going to slow you down proportional to your altitude, the lower you go, the more it will slow you. On your first one or two passes to perigee you\u0027ll see your apogee come down, but not enough. Eventually the apogee will be flipped, and your 66km will become the highest point in your orbit as the atmosphere slows you down each time around.
