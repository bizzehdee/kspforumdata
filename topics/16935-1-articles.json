The spacecraft I used to do this is 100% stock (except the crewtank of course). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is able to get into a 100km orbit, transfer to the Mun, manouver, land, disconnect the habitation module and return safe to Kerbin. The booster/transfer stage is not very fuel efficient at the moment (onion peel design) but you can fly it at 100% thrust ....so without cheating/exploiting the fuel bug. (I made all my manouvers at max speed except for minimal course corrections).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my first mission I dropped a module next to a crashed Mun-lander to save the stranded crew and give them shelter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now these guys have been rescued already by a rescue(crewtank)ship capable of landing on kerbin with the rescue-tank attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the crew in the habitation module you see on the screenshot consists of 2 rescue-ship pilots, which took over the station while the remaining pilot rescued the remaining 3 stranded astronauts, and the \u0022classic crew\u0022 which has just landed in a standard munar lander design. (Next part of mission is deploying a rescue-ship near the base (8 seats in total, 5 PAX, 3 Pilots, same design I used earlier).
