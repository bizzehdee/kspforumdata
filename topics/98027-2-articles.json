Now that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s public knowledge, I can talk about them! It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a while since we started doing concepts, playing with the shapes, the texture ideas, how it would affect the current rig for the Kerbals, silhouettes, and all those processes involving character design. Right now I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m moving the default kerbal joints and adjusting them to the female version, also painting weights to try and do afterwards some retargeting inside Unity. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s one issue though, since we did the Kerbal EVA system before Unity 4, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re only using Mecanim on the facial animations. Everything else is running under the Legacy system. Right now we need to figure out how hard it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to be to implement the default EVA animations into the adjusted rig for the female model. If it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a couple of paths we can take. One of them involves doing the retargeting inside Maya (and since we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re talking of more or less 100 animation loops, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s probably the last option). My main concern right now are the facial animations, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m afraid they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to break once we add the rotations and translations of the default Kerbal face. Fortunately we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re talking here about single states that are blended into Mecanim (happy, sad, excited and scared plus variations), so creating new ones should take one day or two tops.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis paragraph leads me to believe that the females have a substantial difference in shape from the males.
