I\u0027m actually excited about having to learn what the real astronauts had to do as far as TLI burns and Orbit Insertion. I feel like I\u0027m really accomplishing something when enjoying KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is a mod or suggestion that I have for the business career mode for KSP. I feel this doesn\u0027t break the game but if you invested many hours only to run out of money then I\u0027m interested in some guidance as far as making my theory into an addon compatible with KSP. Probably the shortest mod idea perhaps but I feel this will minorly tweak the business aspect of that Career option (career business) that will only force you to warp time to get some funding if you totally screw up which is what happened to me during my first ever play. I enjoy the management and strategy beyond just building the rocket I really like how KSP integrates the science and the financial planning of this. So as to celebrate being a part of this new forum for one of my distinguished new favourite games I thought I\u0027d celebrate by saying hello to this wonderful community and share a thought that may help KSP become even greater. Below is my proposal for a mod that I would like to learn how to write but would appreciate some guidance so I can learn more about adding to the multiverse of this game which has literally limitless potential. I am so grateful for any help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh was curious how you could make your own flags for the game also..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to discussing this with the members.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESincerely Jason Chapman \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease email me if you have tips or helpful suggestions to help me make this possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*****PROPOSAL MOD FOR KSP CAREER BUSINESS MODE****\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EKERBAL FUNDING MOD OUTLINE\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eby Jason Chapman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#517466133e2125383e3f746615\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u002248252d2f2924272c2726222b082f25292124662b2725\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi everyone just enjoying KSP very awesome and challenging. I like the business aspect managing a space program brings me back to the days of Project space station for the commodore 64. When I learned KSP offered these resource management features I got extremely excited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not a moddeller slowly learning with challenge about coding, there is one little tweak I thought would be kind of an essential minor tweak to the KSP business career mode is a steady cash flow based on achievements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there would be any change to this mode of the game it would be something like this among all the other awesome aspects already featured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started a business career game and although each KSP game is essentially a sandbox I consider it a cheat to have access all at once to all parts available. Its great of course to see what the program has to offer. I like the concept of building my way up from start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI during my first game with the career business, found myself running out of money. I ended up being broke, and thought I\u0027d have to wait a month or something before a budget influx would give me some cash resources to work with instead of absolutely nothing. This killed my game and brought it to an abrupt halt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope someone could help me or point me in the right direction as far as knowing what I would need to accomplish this tweak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically have a formula where if in the event you run low on cash and can\u0027t complete contracts there should still be a way to get some funding say its called Government funding mod I\u0027ll use as a working concept. Or company sponsor funds mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically if you have obvious reputation points which will earn as you play plus completing science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore or less creating a formula would be the only thing in the mod and probably maybe one of the less complex. No parts or models just a formula that would add to players business budget at the end of every game month or even day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach day Funds=(Rep\u002BScI)x number of completed contracts complete divided by 24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach month funds=(Rep\u002BSci)x number of completed contracts complete divided by 30\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach year funds=(Rep\u002BSci)x number of completed contracts complete divided by 12.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously as you progress and by the time a game year passes the contracts will probably be alot that you\u0027ve completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if contracts repeat or offer again but I feel this would keep your business career going even if you experience massive problems ie accidents and so forth, but it will keep you going instead of bringing the game to a halt where you have to restart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor myself this is 1 mod I really would like to either know how to create or someone make it according to my outline, I only ask for recognition for the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your time and please feel free to contact me if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T03:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, moved to General Add-on Affairs, where requests for mods are made.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
