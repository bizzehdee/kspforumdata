Yeah! But I was surprised to find the dark side of Eeloo so bright. It does not have an atmosphere, so I expected it to be black as black can get. But the surface is very visible from orbit. Is there a reason for that? Or is it just sort of a game/video card glitch where the shader doesn\u0027t get it dark enough because it is so white to start with, or something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RandomUser","CreatedById":150836,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-23T03:41:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks fine to me.\u00A0 I mean, it has effectively the same brightness as the others, from the looks of things.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"2204happy","CreatedById":174040,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-23T04:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is from the ambient light, you can remove it with mods like planetshine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-23T17:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEeloo is made out if ice crystals that scatter light everywhere i geuss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimalMinmus","CreatedById":172387,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-23T19:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy theory: there is a minimum light amount, and eeloo\u0027s high albedo causes it to be bright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOooooor...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003E\u0022You thought Sarnus was installed\u00A0by OPM, but Sarnus was really here the whole time\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-23T19:05:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2017 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by MinimalMinmus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-24T18:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Ch1 style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 15px;color:rgb(24,24,24);font-weight:normal;padding:0px;font-size:14px;font-family:Merriweather, Georgia, serif;line-height:21px;font-style:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nThere is no dark side of Eeloo really.
