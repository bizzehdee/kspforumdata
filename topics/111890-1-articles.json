I\u0027ve seen so many people complain of the new aerodynamic system, while their still trying to air hog or use asparagus stage their rockets. People need to sit down and look at a real rocket- LOOK at how the Saturn V is designed and ask WHY is it built this way. Then go watch a rocket launch and listen to the audio transcripts that go with them so they learn what and why NASA does what it does.\n\nCase and point. Use common sense and don\u0027t give up just because of failure. Analyze and inspect the failure, find the cause, lead up to and result of the failure. Then try again whilst preventing the failure.

But before changing any settings, better save a copy of the physics.cfg (under the KSP root folder) so you may bring the correct ones back. \n\nTo change those settings, open the debug menu (Mod-F12). \n\nAbout the aero forces, the old drag system should be resurrected by checking (in the Physics/Drag panel) \u0022Apply Drag As Acceleration Instead of Force\u0022 and \u0022Replace Drag Cubes With Spherical Model\u0022. Lift is now provided by any part (not only by wings and Mk2 fuselage), to cancel this new lift you have to (in the Physics/Aero panel) put the \u0022Body Lift Multiplier\u0022 slider to 0.\n\nAbout the Thermal effects, try with (under Cheats panel) checking the \u0022Ignore Max Temperature\u0022, and cancel all checks under Physics/Thermal panel.\n\nBe advised, I did not try if those settings actually work, only have a basic knowledge of what they do. But worth a try in case, you may retain all the other improvements of KSP 1.0 without the trouble.\n\nAnyway, not that I\u0027m recommending to disable the new aero. Everything is being balanced for the new model, not only with 1.0 but with all subsequent patches and versions.

The old \u0022straight up to 10,000 m, then 45 degrees over\u0022 will definitely lead to rockets flipping out. Try bringing the nose over to about 5-10 degrees over from straight up when your rocket is doing between 50 and 100 m/s, and then follow the prograde marker as it moves further around.

That should be enough to keep it on track with a more gradual pitch maneuver. I\u0027d also look at moving as much of the radial mounted parts into a service bay as possible, as I\u0027ve noticed that too much radially mounted stuff at the top of the rocket really amplifies any tendency of a rocket to flip, since radially mounted stuff isn\u0027t occluded.
