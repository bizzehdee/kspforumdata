I\u0027d also look at moving as much of the radial mounted parts into a service bay as possible, as I\u0027ve noticed that too much radially mounted stuff at the top of the rocket really amplifies any tendency of a rocket to flip, since radially mounted stuff isn\u0027t occluded. If you can send Bob instead of Bill and have unlocked EVA, you can move the goo containers and science junior below the heat shield and extract/reset them with Bob, meaning that you don\u0027t need as many goo containers and you don\u0027t need them to survive reentry. I\u0027m not sure if non-scientists can remove the results from experiments in 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
