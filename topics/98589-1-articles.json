Is there a cheat sheet with all the hot keys? Anyway, I see all these posts on here of what you guys create, and most of the stuff is just mind blowing. I have so much trouble getting parts to attach, so I mess around with symmetry options and angle snap on/off, etc. But I look at some of the plans, and see that many use 20 or 30 individuals wings to create a single large wing. How do you even do this? When I try to attach part with angle snap off, I can place them, and even when they intersect with other parts, they don\u0027t \u0022attach\u0022 if that makes sense. And when you go to launch, those non-attached parts are not part of the vessel upon launch. Am I missing something? My creativity has been curbed due to my lack of understanding on how to build things.

This is typically in the center of the part. So if you want to attach two wing pieces, the pointer itself needs to be touching the first piece at the edge you want to attach. You might need to go \u002B- vertical a little to get the game to recognize the first piece as a valid attach point. Once attached, you can use the offset tool to move the part as far off the first part you like, as long as they still touch (in my experience). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome pieces require a node, some don\u0027t.

That\u0027s the root part. If you press 4, you have to click a part, I\u0027m not sure what exactly it does, so I click the original root part as in, say, my capsule, and then you click the new root part you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you have a rover with a cubic octagonal strut on the top that you want to attach to your decoupler, click new root (4) and click your original part, for example your probe core if it\u0027s unmanned then click the cubic octagonal strut.
