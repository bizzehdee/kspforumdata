But now I have a massive problem. For some reason in the map view there is a purple trajectory plotting my orbit around the sun which doesn\u0027t match up with the crafts actual heading. The blue trajectory leads right to my periapsis meeting the purple. And for some reason it will only let me select the purple line when I go to add a maneuver node. Once I do this it gets even more wacky and instantly shows the dotted green line on yet another different trajectory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe truly crippling part is the fact that no matter how much I edit a maneuver node my Kerbin periapsis will not change what so ever. Since I cannot see the changes I make to my path my mission has a real problem. Any advise?

Now what this also means is that when you try to select your trajectory to place a maneuver node, your not actually clicking directly on the trajectory, but instead clicking somewhere approximately where the trajectory is; Due to this if you have two trajectories (the blue and purple lines in your case) that are relatively close to each other in interplanetary space, these inaccuracies and approximations overlap causing only one of the two trajectories to be selectable for placing a maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that is why your seeing this happening, however there is one work around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInside of your KSP root folder there is a file called \u0022settings.cfg\u0022, if you open this file with Notepad or Notepad\u002B\u002B you can edit KSP\u0027s current settings. Now the reason this overlap is happening is because the Patched Conics are projecting 2 SoI changes ahead of your current trajectory, however this can be easily changed in the \u0022settings.cfg\u0022 file, simply find the setting called \u0022CONIC_PATCH_LIMIT\u0022 and change it to 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the up side to this fix is that you will no longer have any issues with multiple interplanetary trajectories overlapping and causing problems, however the down side is the Patched Conics will only display 1 SoI change ahead of your current trajectory, instead of the previous 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: On a related note, here is a link to a YouTube video by xPDxTV explaining the \u0022CONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE\u0022 and \u0022CONIC_PATCH_LIMIT\u0022 settings.
