Or landing on Laythe and seeing a meteor shower. I think that the small things, like auroras on Kerbin and Laythe and small flashes visible from Jool\u0027s moons on Jool (meant to represent turbulent lightning storms). I don\u0027t even think this really has to be features in the game world; it could even be a change in other aspects. What i\u0027m asking for really is just some small details that add to the realism and immersion of KSP2. Some more examples would be the frequent solar storms on red dwarfs; if there is a red dwarf (We don\u0027t really know what System 3 is), then solar storms would be great.\u00A0 Another good thing with gas giants would be the way that wind currents travel on them. Wind currents travel in bands on Jool; this implies that there are belts and zones on Jool, just like on Jupiter. In that case, the zones would be high, cold air, i.e icy and therefore lighter in color. the zones generally move slower than the belts; but their relative speed varies. They also form less storms. Again, the immersion benefit would be absolutely massive if these sort of tiny, but good, changes make it into KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-21T04:48:12Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2023 04:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Da Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMaking it better\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
