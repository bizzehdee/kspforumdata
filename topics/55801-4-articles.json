Resources are, I believe the official phrasing is \u0022postponed indefinitely\u0022. Now, we all know what this means: It\u0027s not on the plate and at best it\u0027s going to be implemented further down the road, most likely not in any way like what has been planned and showcased before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to be very frank here: I\u0027m thoroughly disappointed. While we already knew that resources were heavily delayed because implementation details were being changed and the direction was shifting a bit, shoving it out of the way entirely like this ... I mean, a lot of work has been wasted on it now, with the result being almost a complete 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 turn, moving away from one of the most anticipated planned features. In return we get multiplayer - something we were repeatedly told was not feasible in a manner that fits in with the vision for the game and is in fact not planned at all. Well, guess that\u0027s another 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 turn right there. I fully understand that multiplayer, too, is a feature a lot of people are looking for, and that they really want to play with their friends, make some larger projects. I get that, it\u0027s a nice touch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just really don\u0027t like this recent shift in direction. Career Mode, as it looks right now, is going to be pretty shallow. With resources not on the horizon anymore, a large chunk of the economy - and of planetary operations - is gone. Science is, once the tech tree is unlocked, just a bunch of flavour text - no game mechanics behind it. Missions/Contracts and perhaps some other systems might well give some more content to play here, but the way this has been started just doesn\u0027t look all too promising to me. I\u0027m not a supporter of this whole \u0022realism!\u0022 and \u0022serious business space programme!\u0022 stuff, I like the whackiness of it all - but I was looking forward to some in-depth \u003Cem\u003Emeaningful\u003C/em\u003E gameplay. That said, I can\u0027t see myself playing multiplayer KSP either, to be quite honest. I get what it\u0027s trying to do - and there are definitely reasons to do it (Minecraft collaborative efforts have shown us a great deal of magic that can be done like this), but I think this is something that should either have been integrated from the start, or added on after the game itself is finished. Pushing for it now seems very much out of place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a closing note, I\u0027m looking forward to the .23 update, but I am very, very sceptical of the future we\u0027re headed into. I mean, who\u0027s to say we don\u0027t get \u003Cem\u003Eyet another\u003C/em\u003E shift in direction in a year or so?
