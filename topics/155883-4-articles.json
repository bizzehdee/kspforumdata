First thing I\u0027m noticing is that I don\u0027t think the CrewAffect actually does anything when it\u0027s applied to hab quarters and not hab common. I know that the 2.5m Kerbitat holds 2 crew, says that the hab quarters setting adds 18.5 months and affects 4 crew members, but all it seems to do is add 18.5 months which is divided among however many crew are on board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso worth noting, I\u0027m having a bit of trouble figuring out how to calculate volume. Using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E is an easy solution. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E tells me that a MK1 habitat is ~10700 L (I\u0027ll be using m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0going forward, so 10.7 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E uses L). However, according to RoverDude\u0027s spreadsheet at 2.5m Tundra part should have a volume of about 19 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. Throwing a 2.5 m Kerbitat into a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E Kontainer gets you a volume of... 35 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. Now, maybe some of that is the parts at the end that taper down to 1.25 m but RoverDude doesn\u0027t consider them as part of the actual working volume (which would be fair, since you can remove those bits entirely depending on which node you attach them to) but that\u0027s a big difference in volume. Looking at RoverDude\u0027s spreadsheet, he bases his numbers on his parts having a diameter of 2.5 m and being 4 m long. I have no idea how to find proper dimensions for KPBS parts. Best I can tell, they\u0027re 2.5 m in diameter, and the mk1 habitat looks like it\u0027s about 3 m long when comparing it to some other KSP parts...? I couldn\u0027t find a way to make Blender tell me, either. using those numbers, I get a volume of just 7.4 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, which is noticeably less. Another problem I noticed with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E way of finding volume is that the mk2 habitat always has the same volume as the mk1, even if you deploy it before storing it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, if I\u0027m mistaken about any that, then everything that follows is pointless \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf the parameters that you posted above, the only ones that RoverDude\u0027s spreadsheet let you directly manipulate are the crew capacity, crew affect (which I believe is irrelevant in this case), multiplier, and machinery. The spreadsheet also lets you manipulate resource storage, which is not listed in your table. Notably, it does NOT let you manipulate consumption rates for machinery or EC, but instead gives you suggestions based on the rest of the data. So, putting in just a crew of 3 and\u00A010 months hab time gives me a recommended volume of 10.75 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, and a recommended total mass of 1.55. That is completely without machinery, which is actually good news on the mass side; it means that with those numbers, we don\u0027t need to add a bunch of mass. The problem in this case in volume. We are right at the limit of what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E says the Mk1 habitat is, and about 50% over what I rough guess was. Adding a bit of storage space for supplies, a bit of mulch, and some EC only makes that worse. In RoverDude\u0027s video, he mentioned that hab quarter parts will tend to be volume-intensive, and hab common parts will tend to be mass-intensive. While we can always add machinery to make parts more massive, we can\u0027t exactly add volume...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, maybe we decide that we aren\u0027t going to follow the formula too strictly, or maybe we decide that, since KPBS parts all have flat bottoms that their volume usage is more efficient than the cylinders that make up most parts. Maybe the fact that they are base parts meant for surfaces (with gravity and whatnot) means that they are inherently more comfortable. As another option, we could just add machinery to the thing anyway and make it more massive to balance the smaller volume. Regardless, it\u0027s something we have to look at and make a conscious decision about.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an aside, RoverDude\u0027s spreadsheet only recommended the habitat require 2.5 EC/s to run, so there\u0027s that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the topic of storage, I believe the mk1 habitat currently has 150 EC, 160 Supplies and 75 Mulch.

MKS users definitely should be able to do MKS-style cultivation, but non-MKS users can\u0027t. Basically, we need two sets of configs for the greenhouse.

Now, we talked about the central hub being the only part that has access to PL. So, I typed in a crew capacity of 6 and an admin module rating of 10 (assuming logistics is included in PL) and... I immediately was told I needed a volume of 36.5 m3 and a mass of 7.1. For comparison, the hub\u0027s volume is a hair over 30 m3, and its mass is 7.5. The thing is, there has to be something wrong either with how I\u0027m reading this or something else, because the Duna logistics module has access to PL and holds 2 crew members. Putting in those values (and nothing else) gives me a suggested volume of 35.5 m3 and a mass of 6.7.

I gave\u00A0it no other resources of its own (it relies on other parts having them) and for now just gave it an admin module value of 3 (which is the survey/logistics value. Less than the MPL value of 5, and doesn\u0027t include the PL 10 value). Then I gave it an 85% efficiency recycler (92.5% purifier) which only affects 1 kerbal. Finally, I gave it a 1.2 times hab multiplier for 2 kerbals, plus 2 extra bonus months. This made it work out to just a hair over 30 m3 (which is pretty much exactly what I came out with before I got rid of my decimals) and a mass of 7.6, which is pretty close.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I ignore the Admin Module entirely, I can still give it the 85/92.5% recycler/purifier, plus a 1.2 times hab multiplier for 5 kerbals plus 3 bonus kerbal months.

Looking at AVC, it basically wants up to four numbers for a version: a major number, a minor number, a patch number, and a build number. For now, I\u0027ll just build the version file\u00A0as\u00A01.0.0 (it looks like if you leave the build number as 0 then AVC just omits it, which is nice) and we can figure the rest out how we want to address stage 2 when we are closer to being done stage 2.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn that topic, I guess for stage 2 we\u0027ll basically build the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS patches in your repo, then give them to Nils when we\u0027re done, and once he\u0027s incorporated them into KPBS we\u0027ll remove them from our repo?

This may sound weird, but I think we\u0027ll actually need to have 2 seperate sets of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS configs: one for use with MKS, and one for use without. At the very least, some things will have to change. Specifically, things like the greenhouse. I was happily going along writing a config, looking at the fact that it does cultivation which uses water and dirt or water and substrate... and then I realized that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS users don\u0027t use dirt or substrate. KPBS adds water scanning and drills with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS, so you can get water, but not the rest. MKS users definitely should be able to do MKS-style cultivation, but non-MKS users can\u0027t. Basically, we need two sets of configs for the greenhouse.

There\u0027s a spot for putting in a value associated with \u0022Admin Modules\u0022. In the spreadsheet, it gives some sample values: MPL = 5, survey/logistics = 3, PL = 10. Now, we talked about the central hub being the only part that has access to PL. So, I typed in a crew capacity of 6 and an admin module rating of 10 (assuming logistics is included in PL) and... I immediately was told I needed a volume of 36.5 m3 and a mass of 7.1. For comparison, the hub\u0027s volume is a hair over 30 m3, and its mass is 7.5. The thing is, there has to be something wrong either with how I\u0027m reading this or something else, because the Duna logistics module has access to PL and holds 2 crew members. Putting in those values (and nothing else) gives me a suggested volume of 35.5 m3 and a mass of 6.7. According to the spreadsheet, a Duna module only has a volume of 12.89, and the Duna Logistics Centre has a mass of 2.2.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint is, I\u0027m a little suspect of that Admin Module value. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105198\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RoverDude\u003C/a\u003E, am I just not interpreting this right?\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for everyone else, let\u0027s look at the Central Hub: Volume, 30 m3 (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E says 42, but it\u0027s crazy. I used Nils\u0027 blueprint instead), mass is 7.5. It holds 6 kerbals, and has 150 EC. I gave\u00A0it no other resources of its own (it relies on other parts having them) and for now just gave it an admin module value of 3 (which is the survey/logistics value. Less than the MPL value of 5, and doesn\u0027t include the PL 10 value). Then I gave it an 85% efficiency recycler (92.5% purifier) which only affects 1 kerbal. Finally, I gave it a 1.2 times hab multiplier for 2 kerbals, plus 2 extra bonus months. This made it work out to just a hair over 30 m3 (which is pretty much exactly what I came out with before I got rid of my decimals) and a mass of 7.6, which is pretty close.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I ignore the Admin Module entirely, I can still give it the 85/92.5% recycler/purifier, plus a 1.2 times hab multiplier for 5 kerbals plus 3 bonus kerbal months. That gets us right at 30 m3 and 7.5 tonnes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, it is possible with that first option to make a bigger multiplier (or make it affect more kerbals) by adding machinery. Hab multipliers add a lot more mass than volume, so there is room to play with that if we really want to. Of course, that means we have to think about if we want machinery to exist in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS installs without MKS.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts on these?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst thought: Personally, I want to pull the recycler out of that part entirely - Keep the purifier, but there are other recycler parts; this increases their range, but doesn\u0027t supplant them.\u00A0 That then frees up some space and mass - some of that will be used by industrial efficiency parts in stage 3, at least for MKS.\u00A0 And the flip side of that is that PL is only MKS, not LS - so for a pure LS patch we can ignore the Admin Module(s) as irrelevant.\u00A0 I\u0027m also suspect of the direct hab months, though I\u0027m less set on that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this part is quite likely to be the biggest difference between \u0027just \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS\u0027 and \u0027MKS\u0027: What I\u0027m thinking for it would be all efficiencies and admin modules, pulling Kerbals out of their bunks when they need to do paperwork and stuff - which should take space and mass, I just haven\u0027t had time to run numbers.\u00A0 (Honestly, I\u0027ve barely got time to think at the moment.)\u00A0 So, for the moment compute it as pure \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS: Hab(s) and purifier, as that\u0027s the next patch that needs to be written.\u00A0 We can override in stage 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merkov","CreatedById":165068,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-22T03:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, DStaal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, that dual-stream stage 2 is sounding like the most likely option.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 And I\u0027m thinking I don\u0027t really want a \u0027full\u0027 release until we get to stage 2 - I\u0027ll do a \u0027beta\u0027 release in this thread once I get dboi88\u0027s textures merged in and the docs written.\u00A0 (I\u0027ve got the readme mostly done.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sent you a PR with that .version file.

RoverDude\u0027s spreadsheet doesn\u0027t really distinguish between purifiers and recyclers (basically, you put in what you want your recycler to be, and it tells you what a purifier would be ON TOP of that recycler). With all of that in mind, I wanted to run some numbers by you:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) We still have one of the options I mentioned earlier: an 85% recycler for 1 kerbal is rated as a 92.5% purifier for 1 kerbal. The purifier uses 19.25 EC/s and 0.0085 Water/s.\u00A0Add a 1.2 times hab multiplier for 5 kerbals plus 3 hab months (those are just used to justify extra volume when you add a hab multiplier). That hab stuff uses 2.25 EC/s. This works out almost perfectly to the 30 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0volume and 7.5 t mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) If we assume that a recycler would simply add mass, then we could try a 95% purifier (which would be a 90% recycler, but nevermind that) which uses 31.75 EC/s and 0.009 Water/s. Tack on a 1.2 hab multiplier for 5 kerbals, no kerbal months costing 1.5 EC/s and you get a volume just under the 30 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0plus a mass of just under 10 t. That\u0027s a fair bit heavier than the 7.5 t that we\u0027re working with, but we have to decide how massive the recycler would be.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Another option would be to make the purifier less efficient (90%, which only costs 6.75 EC/s and 0.008 Water/s) and boost the hab multiplier to 2 for 6 kerbals, costing 3 EC/s. Volume is still good, this puts us just under 8 t, which is only half a tonne more than the Hub. Removing half a tonne for the recycler makes sense to me, but I guess it depends on how powerful we want that purifier to be.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) If we want a bit more efficiency out of that purifier, we could bump it back up to the 92.5% I mentioned before (19.25 EC/s, 0.0085 Water/s) plus a 1.5 hab multiplier for 5 kerbals \u002B 1.5\u00A0bonus months (2.25\u00A0EC/s). This works out to just under 30 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0and 8.2 tonnes. If we assume a purifier without recycler saves us 700 kg, then we\u0027re on target.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are obviously more combinations I can play with.
