The solids eject first, followed by three vectoring engines, followed by the other 27, with 6 after that, then 3, then 1, and then a lunar lander with one engine and eight lander legs for extra stability. And yes, it does make it to the Mun.\n\n![FWuq9.png](http://i.imgur.com/FWuq9.png)\n\nBecause, Jeb said so.\n\nIt is entirely stock as well. Make sure to use the RCS on takeoff, as it likes to tilt beyond 18,000 meters."},{"CreatedByName":"Dobrodav","CreatedById":25028,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T12:13:36Z","Content":"Well, its big. This is a bright side. Does not sounds like a big achievement, but i know how hard to build (and especially, edit, in the process), so its actually is an achievement.
