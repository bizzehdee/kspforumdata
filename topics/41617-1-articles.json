Lets say you take a set of probes to Jool. Each one destined for a moon. You go in for an aero brake into Jool\u0027s atmosphere to bring the apoapsis of each probe to the orbit of the target moon. So to do this each probe enters Jool at a different height. When I set the height for each probe...then what? I cant control all of them at the same time so will the probes that I don\u0027t have selected even aero brake properly? Because correct me if im wrong, but after 2.5km the object is on rails, no?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
