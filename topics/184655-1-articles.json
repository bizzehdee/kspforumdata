Kerbin system is enough to fill the tech tree.\u00A0 I believe that part of the reason for that was to give people the chance to develop the good rocket parts without requiring them to first go on missions that needed those parts, and part of it was to give a number of opportunities to people who didn\u0027t want to search under absolutely every rock.\u00A0 If you want to try to develop a space program on only transmitted robotic orbital science, then maybe it\u0027ll work.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know whether that will supply enough, but remember that\u00A0if you don\u0027t like the distribution or the number of points available, then you can adjust that value in the settings.\u00A0 You also can make use of asteroids and mobile labs,\u00A0though both of those require crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not certain whether you mean orbiters only or are including robotic landers in your definition of satellites.\u00A0 The thing to remember about the way that science works in this game is that the only bodies\u00A0that give\u00A0more science for being in orbit instead of in the atmosphere or on the ground are\u00A0Kerbin and, oddly enough, the sun (good luck getting that science, though).\u00A0 Everywhere else has a higher value for ground and atmospheric science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, assuming that you want to deal with orbiters only and not bother with atmospheric science at all, then there are a few experiments that you won\u0027t need.\u00A0 The Double-C Seismic Accelerometer only works on the ground, so you can leave that off,\u00A0and the Atmospheric Fluid Spectro-Variometer only works in the presence of an atmosphere, so you can leave that off, too.\u00A0 Keep the PresMat Barometer, though:\u00A0 it works in space; it just reads zero pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next thing to remember is that every celestial body has a low space and a high space range of altitudes for purposes of science collection.\u00A0 Every experiment that works in space will gather science in high space.\u00A0 Of that list, the SENTINEL Infrared Telescope is the single experiment that works\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in high space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther on the subject, most experiments that work in space are a type called global experiments, which means that they\u00A0do not respect\u00A0biomes.\u00A0 Instead, there is one experiment result for the whole region of space and the specific features of the body directly under your vessel are irrelevant to the data.\u00A0 The one experiment that robots can perform but that also takes per-biome results is the GRAVMAX Negative Gravioli Detector.\u00A0 The gravioli\u00A0experiment takes biome-specific results in both high and low space, which means that it will be the main source of science.\u00A0 In fact, if you want to avoid heavy experiments (Such as Mystery Goo and Science, Jr.) entirely, then consider taking only a thermometer, barometer, and gravioli detector.\u00A0 You\u0027ll still get the great majority of science points and keep your satellites\u0027 masses (and fuel requirements) very low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, as a general tip, it may make more sense to send one probe to a number of destinations with the repeatable experiments.\u00A0 You can send a stack of twelve Science Jr. and Mystery Goo modules to Jool to get science from high and low space for all of the bodies in its sphere of influence, but it may be more logistically preferable to send one probe with a thermometer, barometer, and gravioli detector to orbit each Jool-sphere body in turn (or it can accomplish a similar result--minus the completeness of gravioli biome results--with flybys; you may have more fun setting up a Not-So-Grand Tour).\u00A0 If you want to recover the probe and get full value on the experiments, then include a science container to hold the results (the experiments themselves will only store the most recent result).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a postscript, this is absolutely a good idea.\u00A0 Some of the orbits in KSP are designed so that you can set of a Voyager-like flyby tour very quickly after starting a new game.\u00A0 Probe science is a great way to get a few extra points when you don\u0027t quite have the skill to reliably bring Kerbals back to Kerbin.\u00A0 By all means, try it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget the antenna and electrical system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan
