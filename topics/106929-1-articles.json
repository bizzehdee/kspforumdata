It was meant to fly a few hundred meters and then land near the KSC, generating science. I had 2 scientists in it and I was playing science mode, if that helps. I time warped and... nothing. No science.

Also keep in mind that the amount of science generated depends on the level of the scientists."},{"CreatedByName":"Parkaboy","CreatedById":64208,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:23:14Z","Content":"You need data from experiments to proccess in the lab. Bring data from experiments performed on another vessel, or remember to include experiments with your lab. Review the data and choose the option \u0022proccess in lab\u0022 to send the data as a numeric value to the lab. The lab can hold up to 500 data, and the more it holds, the more science it generates.\n\nI have a lab generating around nearly 0.5 science/day with almost max data (in Kerbin orbit). Not sure if I can get better values with scientists of a higher level.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T19:25:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 07:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Parkaboy**"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:13:07Z","Content":"Oh.
