I\u0027ve been playing Career mode and so far my biggest achievement is getting to the Mun and back. Now I got a contract for exploring several places on Kerbin and that\u0027s giving me some trouble. With my limited science (and experience) I have not been able to build a plane that can travel halfway around Kerbin, do the surveys and then back again... So I was thinking that maybe I should just explore the 4 places with rockets. One launch per exploration site and then use MechJeb to land near the spots... Kind of wasteful however.. And I dont even know if a contract can be partitioned in this manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas for the best way to do these kind of contracts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T08:21:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 08:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by michaelvf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T08:10:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor locations that are close together but a long way from KSC, I\u0027ve had some success with building a plane, and then strapping some booster rockets to it for a suborbital hop.

You\u0027ll want to put them more or less above the center of mass, and disable the fuel tanks on your hull. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso remember to add fuel-pipes going from the tanks to your hull. Once they\u0027re (nearly) empty, just enable the tanks in your hull again, tip your plane over a bit, and detach the \u0022fuel tank stage\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy smallest dual-engine plane using this system has a total of 8 fuel tanks: one on each engine, two on the hull, and a pair of detachable fuel pods of two tanks each. It easily reaches either pole or any of the other landmasses, though it\u0027s quite slow, so you need time for a long flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022kerbal way\u0022: if you are not entirely locked in these kind of contracts just let them gathering dust on the shelf and get back to them when you get to whiplash engine.

In 0.9 you had to land them before going away for 2.5km, which implied very low dropping and a series of \u0022aerobatic\u0022 manuevers to keep the plane flying at close range until the rover was on the ground, but on 1.0 you can put 25km between yourself and the parachuting rover so...
