It was locked, because this was considered piracy, however, if Squad has already gotten their fair share of the purchase, than why should it be considered piracy, when all he wants is another copy? I\u0027ve gotten a racing game for my PC without buying it, because I paid for the PS3 version, and as far as I\u0027m concerned, the company got their money for the racing game, so why should I have to pay the extra money to basically switch systems? Shouldn\u0027t the same go for adding an extra copy for your kids? Phone companies reduce the cost of additional lines when they are inside the family, so why can\u0027t game companies do a similar thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this seems like a cynical rant towards the closed thread, but I think the man has a point, and I\u0027d like to get other peoples\u0027 opinion on this. Should getting a second copy of the game without paying for it be considered piracy if you have already paid for the game once?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Couldn\u0027t he have just re-downloaded the game off of the KSP site by logging on his account via his kids computer?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T03:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShould getting a second copy of the game without paying for it be considered piracy\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T17:41:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add a short reply to explain why this is considered piracy, in case people are confused about this. The main problem with a parent installing this for his kids is the EULA you agree to when purchasing KSP. There are two important bits in it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EElectro Chango S.A. de C.V.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s End-User License Agreement (\u0022EULA\u0022) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Electro Chango S.A. de C.V.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis line at the top of the EULA indicates a key principle of the license you buy: it is personal. Under certain law systems (for example EU law) such licenses are transferrable but can only be owned by one person at a time, and although one could argue that you could technically transfer the license as long as the game is only run on one pc (so that multiple players can\u0027t play simultaniously), this is really a very weak argument and really doesn\u0027t hold up very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next very important bit: article 1 sub a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Electro Chango S.A. de C.V. grants you the right to install and use copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on your computer running a validly licensed copy of the operating system for which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT was designed [e.g., Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Mac OSX].\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have seen that the license is personal and that you [the other party on the agreement] is an individual or single entity.

This means that only the person with whom the agreement was engaged in (or the person the agreement was transferred / sold to) may install and use the game. You can install it on any computer you own with a legal version of an operating system and you can also use it on all those computers. Other people may - technically - not use it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
