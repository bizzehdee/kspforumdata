I can click on them all day long and no window shows up, and even when i go into actions in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and select them, theres no option to deploy them, just the panels name, zero options. Did the way the work change, or is something broken in my game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crash087","CreatedById":151606,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-02T20:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnevermind.
