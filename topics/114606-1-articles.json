Anyway, in building launch vehicles, I was turning on the center-of-gravity and \u0022center-of-lift\u0022 (which seems to be misnamed; center of lift applies to winged vehicles, while center of pressure applies to vehicles with and without wings) indicators, but not seeing the center-of-pressure marker. After stumbling upon shift \u002B right-click to raise the launch vehicle, I found the CP marker. It was approximately half the launch vehicle\u0027s length behind the first stage engine bell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI designed small rockets (\u0022model\u0022 rockets) for many years, and the rule of thumb I learned was that the CP of a symmetrical launch vehicle roughly corresponded to the CG of its silhouette. Considering that I rarely had CP-related stability problems, I took this rule to be a good one. So why is it that I\u0027m seeing a calculated CP well aft of where I\u0027m thinking it should be (which would go a long way to explaining why my vehicles are pretty much unmaneuverable right off the pad)?

It\u0027s more or less the place where the expanding gasses from the explosion of the fuel enter the exhaust. So it is exclusively the force generated by the thruster(s) and does not include any other forces applying to the vessel, like drag, gravity, etcetera. The builder only shows the static forces acting upon the ship: Center of Mass, Center of Lift and Center of (maximum) Thrust. Center of Pressure is a derivate of CoL and CoT, but would also require a Center of Drag, which varies depending on direction\u0026amp;heading, speed, and air pressure (altitude), and thus is not shown during building.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T23:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t the demo still on something like 0.16?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t say it accurately reflects the full game anymore.

There is no center of drag marker in stock KSP. Only center of lift (blue) and center of thrust (red ... or is it purple?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you can do, is grab the root part with the rotation gizmo and turn it slightly out of the presumed airstream. That way the center of lift should tell you If your rocket will have lifting forces that make it go straight again. You can do this the easy way by adding fins to the bottom of your rocket. However, KSP also simulates body lift since version 1.0. Although: The model for the wings is differnt from the model for the body. It\u0027s a little inconsistent if you really get to the details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you like tinkering with real aerodynamics, take a look at the mod Ferram Aerospace Research (FAR). It introduces a way more accurate and realistic aerodynamics model, including supersonic design ... area rule ... stuff like that. It uses a voxel based technique to analyze the actual shape of your rocket. Stock KSP only approximates that shape in a very rough way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dclarion","CreatedById":146813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T23:23:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m speaking of the blue ball.

When you pass 270m/s you get to transonic speeds, where part of the airflow around you vehicle goes supersonic. That creates a lot of drag and might cause a lot of instability.
