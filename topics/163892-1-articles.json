series of over twenty books that started out basically as Horatio Hornblower in space. \u00A0The main character in the mainline books (fourteen\u00A0or so, with another due out early next year) of the series is named Honor Harrington. \u00A0There are three side series set in the same universe that are either set a few centuries prior to the mainline books, or set concurrently with the mainlines. \u00A0These are co-written by others (Eric Flint, Jane Lindskold, and Timothy Zahn) alongside Weber.\u00A0 There are also five\u00A0anthologies of short stories set in the Honorverse written by Weber and other authors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also a series of three companion books planned, one of which, \u003Cem\u003EHouse of Steel\u003C/em\u003E, has already been published. \u00A0This book contain a Weber novella, \u003Cem\u003EI Will Build My House of Steel\u003C/em\u003E, which takes up about 1/3 of the book. \u00A0The rest is sort of like the Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual, with background info\u00A0of the\u00A0government and military organization\u00A0of two of the major Star Nations, a list (including general specifications) of the ships and ship classes used by those two Star Nations\u0027 navies, and other information either not included in the books, or just alluded to. \u00A0The other two books planned are called \u003Cem\u003EHouse of Lies\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EHouse of Shadows\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason the Honorverse is so important to me is that I\u0027m a contributor to the Companion books. \u00A0I\u0027m with a group of folks called BuNine who work directly with Weber to create the content of those books. \u00A0What we come up with, after aprroval from David, is considered canon in the Honorverse. \u00A0We have current and former members of all branches of the military as BuNine members, a robotics expert, a lawyer who gives us insight for legal stuff in the series, a military awards and heraldry expert, an artist who\u0027s real-life job is working on Star Trek Online (and is the guy who got me interested in KSP), and me. \u00A0I\u0027m one of the former military people (USAF), and I\u0027m also a self-taught 3D modeler (not very good, but good enough, I suppose, to get me invited into BuNine). \u00A0I make models of the ships in the Honorverse (you can see one in my avatar, although that particular one is more or less obsolete, as we\u0027ve been updating the originals with new detailing), which can be seen

If it\u0027s a good story, it will hold up well not matter what the technological setting. When you really analyze it, a good story isn\u0027t driven by the setting, or even by the plot (since, when you boil it down, there are only \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Six_Dramatic_Situations\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E36 plotlines\u003C/a\u003E anyway). It\u0027s driven by the characters. If you can write good characters, you can write about them being almost anywhere or doing almost anything and it will be a good story.

I went to San Diego Comic Con (back when it was just insane, as opposed to Totally Insane) because I was a big Babylon 5 fan and Joe Straczynski was leading a fan panel for it there. My plan was just to go to the B5 presentation, walk around the vendor hall, then go home. But then I started reading the program and saw that they had a panel with Larry Niven about an hour after the B5 panel, and I thought, \u0022Oh, that would be cool, I\u0027ll stick around for that.\u0022 I went up and sat at the door for the room right afterwards. Which was good, because I thought it was going to be another one of these giant fan panels with a couple hundred people, but it was actually 15 people in a conference room with Larry Niven for an hour, it filled up about 45 minutes before it started. So, 15 of us got to sit around and chat with Larry Niven for an hour. The funny part is that we hardly talked about science fiction at all. We talked a lot about his and Jerry Pournelle\u0027s involvement with national space policy under the Reagan administration, the rise and fall (figurative and literal) of Delta Clipper/DC-X, how ridiculously difficult it is to get a Ringworld movie made in Hollywood. He didn\u0027t sign anything, his arthritis was getting really bad at that point, but he did hand out Megastructure Engineering business cards, I still have it tucked away somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I\u0027ve heard, it\u0027s not that hard to meet Larry, he\u0027s a pretty approachable guy, goes to a lot of conventions.
