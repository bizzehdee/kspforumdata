Before the aerodynamics update, I\u0027ve used this profile for spaceplane ascents:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jGvFl1t.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jGvFl1t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that worked, but now I have large trouble getting up to 10 km, because my ship doesn\u0027t have a lot of thrust, and when I\u0027ve finally reached 10 km I can barely sustain my altitude, let alone increase my speed. After that, when I switch to rocket engines, I always run out of fuel soon after my apoapsis is above the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously this profile was designed for the souposphere, and doesn\u0027t work now.

I do my subsonic climb at 2 degrees AoA, pitching the nose up and down to try keep AoA constant. Actual pitch angle will depend on thrust weight ratio, and airspeed will depend on wing loading ie. how much wing area you have versus the weight of your vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend towards larger wings and moderate thrust weight, the climb generally starts at 120 m/s and gets up towards double that at 10km, with same AoA, because the air is thinning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will deviate from this optimal pitch angle theory however, when it comes to the sound barrier. Drag nearly doubles at mach 1, about 330m/s, before settling back to near-subsonic levels. It starts to rise above 240 m/s and starts to ease off again at 430. So, i\u0027ll often fly at up to 10 degrees AoA, to stay subsonic as high as possible. If my pitch control surfaces are maxing out though, this creates a lot of drag so i\u0027ll transition before reaching 10 alpha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I\u0027ve decided it\u0027s time to go supersonic, I drop the nose by either setting prograde on autopilot, or just release the stick and let it fall back to the 2 deg AoA that\u0027s hopefully been trimmed for. Depending on wing area, this happens at altitudes from 8km-16km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that it all gets very hectic. You\u0027re probably using Whiplash or Rapier motors, so once you go supersonic thrust goes through the roof just as drag is falling away, and a lot of this theory becomes moot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally level out from my sound barrier dive 10-13km and start pitching up to a STEEP climb, as the engines go ballistic. I\u0027m still relatively low, so whilst I believe the lowest drag coefficient north of mach 1 is around mach 2, i don\u0027t want to get too fast yet, hence the pitch up. This is especially important after 1.05, if you don\u0027t want the cockpit to explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTOH, you need to start levelling off in time to make your speedrun. I used to set autopilot to prograde at about 15km which would level me for an 19km speedrun. Going over 1000 below 20km is no longer safe however. It\u0027s tough to strike a balance between nosing over too hard, and blowing up, and allowing the ship to balloon to too great a height, and not having the thrust to hit top speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the engine config files, it might be safer to just aim for the optimum power speed of the engines, rather than absolute max speed. Below 22km at any rate. The Whiplash max out at 1050-1100, after that , the faster you go, the less thrust you get , whilst for the rapiers it\u0027s about 1200.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove 22km i generally light up the nuke, if carried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI switch over to rocket mode when the air breathers flame out or when the aircraft is no longer gaining altitude/airspeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaintain 5 deg AoA during the rocket part of the climb until above 40km or i can see from the aerodynamic forces display that the wings are no longer making significant lift. Then i set autopilot to prograde again and switch to map mode, and start thinking about apoapse and periapse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T17:53:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENicholander,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It really varies widely now with t/w, drag, and air breathing engine type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I build my SSTOs to rely on aerodynamic efficiency rather than raw thrust, so I have never pitched up to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 during my ascents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Step 1 is to build enough speed to get the angle of attack (difference between pitch and prograde vector) down below 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Step 2, I climb as rapidly as I can while steadily increasing speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Step 3, get your speed above 360m/sec\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Step 4, See step 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Step 5, reduce your climb rate as engine thrust diminishes until you have hit max speed and altitude for your engine.
