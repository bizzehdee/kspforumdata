One, I now know why so many people prefer attaching probes, shuttles, and droids on the hull of larger ships. Trying to dock in an enclosed space is hard - even when I took over from MechJeb 2 and tried to dock right next to the docking ports. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I also realized that while the armor plating and small entry point made it hard to pilot craft into the carrier, it really would do nothing to stop a missile. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started to think on designs for future space carriers. Two came to mind. Both would have armored bows. I know that capital designs among the military ships have advanced in the past year, as players fight battles, learn from them, redesign their battleships, and go back into battle. One of the first ideas of all those players seems to be to reinforce the bow of their ships. I know, last year I used a few as target practice for my own warships. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne idea is that the armored bow would have entry points behind it, on the flanks of the ship. While not subject to direct enemy fire, I can still see this being a problem when it comes to easy access and smart weapons. On the other hand, a dumb weapon may enter one side and go out the other. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA more interesting idea was to have a rear entry, between the main engines. The more I thought about this, the more I thought it could be a interesting idea. Many supply ships, cargo ships, and shuttles, be they controlled by MechJeb 2 or a live player, much of the time end up approaching their \u0027target\u0027 ship from behind because of the way ships change orbits when \u0027catching up\u0027 with another. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering what you folks felt?
