That may very well be stock experience talking there; I had a lot of RAPIER-based designs fail in the soup, with the cause traced back to excessive draggy parts (like intakes) up in front. I did fly around last night with the Cd tint on for a bit and noticed it was brightest around the nose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if I don\u0027t stick an intake up there, maybe I can use a pair of structural intakes instead? Oooh...maybe I could use those to replace those external RCS cylinders (still haven\u0027t ditched those \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl surfaces on the wings - current setup is aileron-aileron-flap/spoiler-flap. I\u0027ll take suggestions on how to change this; I didn\u0027t realy have any problems with the early part of the flight last night aside from it wobbling up into the air again. I did go ahead and tweaked down the canards to 75% and didn\u0027t have any tail strikes, which let me switch back to the Small Gears. Takeoff speed for the design with fully extended flaps is about 85 m/s...which as I recall was a sign of too much wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anybody walk me through a method of determining takeoff speed using the readouts? That damn thing still confuses me, but I\u0027m learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the things I had intended to do last night was to take screenies of the stability derivatives at the benchmark levels eddiw3 posted yesterday (M1.0@10k, M2.2@20k, M3.5@25k, M4 for the hell of it) as well as AoA sweeps for those benchmark values and post them up here this morning. Unfortunately, right before I played KSP last night I was in the initial stages of building a VASSAL mod, and a lot of what I was doing involved taking Windows screenshots (Alt-PrintScreen) and when I went to take the screenies my brain farted and started hitting Alt-Printscreen instead of F1. So I don\u0027t have \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E of those like I\u0027d hoped. Which is damn shame. Hopefully I\u0027ll get to that this evening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong and the short of it - it was green and white across the board with the exception of the N-sub-Beta Lateral/Sideslip Derivative at M3.5/25k. That was the only red I saw. Now, I did note that at subsonic speeds when I swept the AoA that my lift maxed out around 10 AoA at about Mach 0.8; it was around 15 degrees at M0.5 and it started going upwards after Mach 1. I read that as \u0022if you can hold her steady as she goes trans-sonic, you oughta be able to get to space\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is where my problems begin again. The design I think has been established as good, so at this point I have to attribute my failure to reach the same degree of success that I had on the first night to poor piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally what I\u0027ve been doing is cranking the nose up to 40 degrees above the horizon once I\u0027m off the ground. Flaps neutralized and gear up, then set FAR flight assist for AoA - generally somewhere in the 10-12 degree range. FAR usually reports minor stalling; the stall tint shows it\u0027s happening up on the canards, which unless I\u0027m mistaken is what they\u0027re designed to do, so I\u0027m not terribly concerned. (the wings are fine; I\u0027ve seen some stalling on the inner flap but that\u0027s usually right after takeoff, before I\u0027ve retracted it). Ascent through the lower 10k is pretty smooth but I\u0027m generally not going much above Mach 0.5 once I get to 10k, so I put the nose down to 20 at 10k and start building up speed. KER generally reports the rate of ascent during the entire initial ascent period to be no greater than about 50 m/s. Around Mach 0.8 I start experiencing SAS wobble and it gets reaaaaly bad up around Mach 0.9. I try to correct the wobble by turning off SAS, the plane doesn\u0027t hold its heading, and it\u0027s off we go - a 12 kilometer drop into the drink. Broke the sound barrier once last night before I went into the spin - so there is that. I haven\u0027t yet been able to recover once I\u0027m in the death spin - I\u0027ve been attempting the PARE procedure, and I generally get as far as A (neutralize the ailerons). I\u0027ve been trying to get her to level flight again after pressing \u0022X\u0022 to kill the throttle, without success. I may be reading the procedure wrong; how can I tell if the ailerons have been neutralized? Is the PARE procedure applicable in KSP? Anyway to tell if I\u0027ve got a craft that is unrecoverable once it\u0027s in the spin (that one has to do with wing loading, right)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking I need to limit myself to a single reaction stabilizer if I go with any degree of stability assist at all; I still haven\u0027t changed the setup yet.

I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s a matter of keeping the Jet on for as long as can be managed but at lower and lower throttle settings, maintaining a slow ascent and trying to continue accelerating horizontally, lighting the rockets only when it becomes necessary. I panicked on Friday - lit the rockets early and ran out of oxidizer before I had a periapsis off the ground. Mach 6 at 50k. I suspect the design hasn\u0027t got enough thrust for its mass - but that\u0027s another discussion I can have with y\u0027all.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E30km at mach 4 should normally be fine for lighting the rockets - although if you\u0027re flying level at this, then stay at it and get to mach 5. It\u0027s pretty hard to get an air breather over 30km. There\u0027s also no harm in keeping the turbo running after the rockets are lit; if it produces so much as a kilonewton of thrust, then it\u0027s helping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, also, I suggest using the VESL tab on your KER; it shows you the % of intake air used, and the current TWR, both of which really matter for the switchover point. An on-rockets TWR of 1.5 or better makes everything easier, since you can haul the nose up much harder. It\u0027s possible to circularise with a nuke and 0.4, but it\u0027s slow and painful. As yet, I\u0027ve never managed the stock trick of hitting an AP in vacuum while still running on turbojets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs yet, I don\u0027t know of an upper limit; the principles of FAR don\u0027t state any problem with bigger masses, it\u0027s all about getting the right aerodynamics. Of course, you\u0027re limited by what you can physically fit into an MK3 cargo bay; you can\u0027t chain them to indefinite length because they\u0027ll just snap. As a compromise, this thing behaves well, but lags due to high part count.

After a certain point (weight wise) you need so much wing and so many engines to get off the runway that you\u0027re going to have a ton of drag in the upper atmosphere, to combat this drag you\u0027ll need to burn a ton of fuel. Bringing more fuel means you need more wing and more engine and the problem spirals out of control. This is probably the closest thing to a real upper limit on plane design, but probably not what is actually going to limit you...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Running out of runway will. This is related to the first issue, essentially to get a super heavy bird off the runway you need a ton of wing and a ton of engines. But adding more wing and engine also increases your weight and drag, so you reach a point of diminishing returns just to get something off the runway. Then you run into issue number 1 when you reach higher altitudes. But even something that is all fuel and no cargo will run into problems getting off the runway first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as far as practical limits go, with stock parts getting an orange tank to orbit is hard but by no means impossible.
