Some effects after reciving too much harmful radiation may occur in future generations, maybe on your children or even later.\n\nRisk is determined by controlled studies, for example you take 1000 frequent fliers from different demographics and you can compare it with cancer risks in blood relative that don\u0027t fly\n\n10, 20, 30, 40 year later. What often happens is you come up with something that increases risk by 10 or 20%. Then each sort of risk either adds or multiplies. There can also be negative risks. \n\nFor example Colorectal cancer risk might be 60% transfats, 10% flight exposure, 20% other environmental exposures, 30% nascent mutations from a parent, etc. \n\nHere\u0027s an example.\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis\n\nNo shared epitope, never smoked, never lived near highway or rail station, never lived in an air polluted area, male. Risk = 1\n\nFemale with no other risk. Risk = 3\n\nShared Epitope (genetic). Risk = 5\n\nSmokes or lives in an area with particulate pollution. Risk = 5\n\nFemale, smoker with gene shared epitope. Risk 40 to 80\n\nNegative risk - Certain tribe (~20,000) living in Africa. Risk = 0 to 0.1 (using FET to establish a confidence range)\n\nThe risk of defects in children is less than easy to determine. Currently the best way would be transmission genome-wide association studies (for nascent mutations requires millions of markers) or whole genome sequence of parent child trios. Nascent mutations are hard to detect, but the have a handful of schizo and autism loci that can be sequenced for nascent SNPs generated (largely from father offspring transmission). (IOW the fathers white blood cells have one mutation, the maternal SNP is present and the other chromosome does not have an SNP present in the father). \n\nIts all about risk, for example\n\nIf you have red-hair (MCRA gene variant) and freckle (also albinism) easily your risk for cancer caused by radiation is higher. This risk increases the global risk. In the case of radiation, this gene lowers the threshold for radiation damage (the point in which DNA damage repair can no longer keep up with damage before the next DNA replication is complete), thus if we remove all such individuals and other DNA damage repair defects from consideration we can increase the tolerance threshold for radiation quite markedly.\n\nIf you consider for example why a village in Iran can have no increased risk of cancer despite magnitude higher radiation, you might consider that genes that increase risk may have been negatively selected and under-went purifying selection many generations ago, so now all the villagers that remain have very high threshold tolerances for radiation. If you then trained all your pilots and astronauts from this pool of individuals, you may never see evidence of radiation induced damage. \n\nIts all about risk, there are visible and knowable risks, and there are invisible risk creeping around in your DNA, just waiting for a prime opportunity to reveal themselves. This is, in fact, the whole idea behind individualized treatment therapies for cancer....identify the risk, the defects, and then target the defect with specific drugs that weaken those cells and not other cells.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s no mechanism for radiation in that wavelength to damage cells except heating, and the heating effects have been shown to be negligible.

There have also been studies done looking for correlations between cancer and mobile phone use, and no definite link has been found. Which means that, if there is a link, its weak enough that it cannot be distinguished from natural occurence of cancer in studies involving thousands of people. \n\nAs for your earlier point about the risk posed by low radiation doses, consider that it becomes very expensive to detect a tiny increase of cancer. You have to study many people to reduce the effect of background cancer, and at extremely low doses you have to monitor the natural radiation exposure of your sample population, because someone who travels a lot or receives a couple of x-rays has enough incident radiation exposure to skew your results. This all makes such studies prohibitively expensive - particularly since the data isn\u0027t particularly valuable. We know the cancer risk associated with 100mSv doses of radiation. We know it gets smaller as the dose drops. We don\u0027t know whether it drops to zero at some level, or if the linear no-threshold model is correct and any radiation exposure has some risk of cancer. More data won\u0027t change anything - if someone gets cancer following a 50mSv exposure, knowing the exact risk he was taking would not have changed his behavior, and the odds are that the cancer actually has nothing to do with the radiation.\n\nThe funds that would be needed to measure these risks are better allocated to cancer research. That will actually save lives, where determining the precise risks of very low doses will just provide a useless number.

I don\u0027t doubt in equations but in human interpretations.\n\nAnd your post just proves my point, most people using statistics are making mistakes. \n\nIf you can\u0027t distinguish cause of cancer you are accepting it as natural, that is mistake, because there is chance it is not natural and you are responsible for this one person getting cancer.\n\nAs for your castles, can you check on lab rat how cell phone is going to affect for him if he is using it for 40\u002B years?\n\nYou can\u0027t because 40 years ago there was no cell phones with touch screens, with batteries build like today and there was no satellites or poles sending waves to cell phones. \n\nCompanies can\u0027t check every new piece of their smartphones or tablets for few years in laboratory it would be obsolete if they would do that ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nso they are using statistics and us as test subjects.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Risk is determined by controlled studies, for example you take 1000 frequent fliers from different demographics and you can compare it with cancer risks in blood relative that don\u0027t fly\n\u003E 10, 20, 30, 40 year later. What often happens is you come up with something that increases risk by 10 or 20%. Then each sort of risk either adds or multiplies. There can also be negative risks. \n\u003E \n\u003E For example Colorectal cancer risk might be 60% transfats, 10% flight exposure, 20% other environmental exposures, 30% nascent mutations from a parent, etc. \n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s an example.\n\u003E \n\u003E Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\u003E \n\u003E No shared epitope, never smoked, never lived near highway or rail station, never lived in an air polluted area, male. Risk = 1\n\u003E \n\u003E Female with no other risk. Risk = 3\n\u003E \n\u003E Shared Epitope (genetic). Risk = 5\n\u003E \n\u003E Smokes or lives in an area with particulate pollution. Risk = 5\n\u003E \n\u003E Female, smoker with gene shared epitope. Risk 40 to 80\n\u003E \n\u003E Negative risk - Certain tribe (~20,000) living in Africa. Risk = 0 to 0.1 (using FET to establish a confidence range)\n\u003E \n\u003E The risk of defects in children is less than easy to determine. Currently the best way would be transmission genome-wide association studies (for nascent mutations requires millions of markers) or whole genome sequence of parent child trios. Nascent mutations are hard to detect, but the have a handful of schizo and autism loci that can be sequenced for nascent SNPs generated (largely from father offspring transmission). (IOW the fathers white blood cells have one mutation, the maternal SNP is present and the other chromosome does not have an SNP present in the father).\n\nThat is my point, we are all test subjects of experiments for large corporations. \n\nThere is no way to check how cell phones or flying planes is affecting humans in laboratory, you have to sell it and use statistics to decide... are we investing to make this technology less harmful or it is acceptable or indistinguishable from natural causes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T15:41:29Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Darnok**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T15:47:40Z","Content":"Biology isn\u0027t magic, it\u0027s chemistry.

We know various effects that increase the risk of getting cancer, but the evidence is almost always statistical. If someone receives a 100 mSv dose of radiation, they have a statistically increased risk of getting cancer. Still, if they do get cancer, it was most likely caused by something other than the radiation dose. The increased risk from a 100 mSv dose is much smaller than the background risk of getting cancer.\n\nIf the dose was 80 mSv instead of 100 mSv, we still have reasons to believe that the dose may increase the risk of getting cancer. The reasons are mostly speculative, however, as we don\u0027t have enough empirical evidence on the health effects of radiation. Most of what we know comes from observing the effects of various radiation accidents and the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Because such accidents are rare, because observational data is worse than data from carefully designed experiments, and because we no longer like killing/harming people for science, we\u0027re not going learn much more in the foreseeable future."},{"CreatedByName":"SuperFastJellyfish","CreatedById":57985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T16:33:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You have very strong FAITH in science... that is irony ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E Science is extensible, I don\u0027t have faith in science but in progression of science and sometimes to make step forward you have to first make few steps back. \n\u003E \n\u003E So putting your life on current science is naive for me.\n\u003E \n\u003E Simplest way to explain it... look at speed v = d/t it is simple and everyone know this.
