You have to study many people to reduce the effect of background cancer, and at extremely low doses you have to monitor the natural radiation exposure of your sample population, because someone who travels a lot or receives a couple of x-rays has enough incident radiation exposure to skew your results. This all makes such studies prohibitively expensive - particularly since the data isn\u0027t particularly valuable. We know the cancer risk associated with 100mSv doses of radiation. We know it gets smaller as the dose drops. We don\u0027t know whether it drops to zero at some level, or if the linear no-threshold model is correct and any radiation exposure has some risk of cancer. More data won\u0027t change anything - if someone gets cancer following a 50mSv exposure, knowing the exact risk he was taking would not have changed his behavior, and the odds are that the cancer actually has nothing to do with the radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe funds that would be needed to measure these risks are better allocated to cancer research.

Currently the best way would be transmission genome-wide association studies (for nascent mutations requires millions of markers) or whole genome sequence of parent child trios. Nascent mutations are hard to detect, but the have a handful of schizo and autism loci that can be sequenced for nascent SNPs generated (largely from father offspring transmission). (IOW the fathers white blood cells have one mutation, the maternal SNP is present and the other chromosome does not have an SNP present in the father). \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is my point, we are all test subjects of experiments for large corporations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no way to check how cell phones or flying planes is affecting humans in laboratory, you have to sell it and use statistics to decide... are we investing to make this technology less harmful or it is acceptable or indistinguishable from natural causes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T15:41:29Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Darnok\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T15:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBiology isn\u0027t magic, it\u0027s chemistry.

Still, if they do get cancer, it was most likely caused by something other than the radiation dose.

Most of what we know comes from observing the effects of various radiation accidents and the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Because such accidents are rare, because observational data is worse than data from carefully designed experiments, and because we no longer like killing/harming people for science, we\u0027re not going learn much more in the foreseeable future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperFastJellyfish","CreatedById":57985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T16:33:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Darnok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Darnok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou have very strong FAITH in science... that is irony \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience is extensible, I don\u0027t have faith in science but in progression of science and sometimes to make step forward you have to first make few steps back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo putting your life on current science is naive for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimplest way to explain it... look at speed v = d/t it is simple and everyone know this.
