This looks like someting I\u0027ve really been waiting for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if I only could make them work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two major issues I encounter on a regular basis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Firstly, I can\u0027t seem to save subassemblies myself most of the time. I\u0027ve managed to get a few saved during several tries, but mostly, whenever I drag a set of parts to the subassembly drop zone I get a \u0022part has not atachment point\u0022 pop up, and the parts are refuses. Why? What are the conditions a set of parts must fullfill in order to be accepted?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Secondly staging gets messed up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf load a complex part, ie. the DSL Pandora capsule (great work btw...) and then try to attache a subassembly to it, for example on of the KW Rocketrs launchers (another great addition to KSP) the stages of both get interleaved, in stead of the one just inserted below the other. That makes it basically impossible to use the subassemblies. It also means that I must build each spacecraft from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr must I? What am I overlooking here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T14:50:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first part you choose for your craft is the root part.

If you just click it and tear from the ship, they are usually ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may also depend on how exactly are fuel lines installed, though. It seems to me some people are installing them almost tangentially to tanks which might look better but may also lead to the \u0022raycasting\u0022 missing the target and skipping the pipe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"csanders","CreatedById":82143,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T20:29:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.
