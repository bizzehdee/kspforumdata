It causes extreme instability and makes attempts to control the craft all but futile. I suppose it MIGHT work if you had really weak controls forces versus the weight of your craft, but it\u0027s still sub-optimal even if it does. Note that IRL, Jet Fighters do this sort of thing ON PURPOSE because it makes them more maneuverable...but then they have Flight Computers that are constantly making adjustments to keep them in controlled flight. The new SAS *might* have half a shot at handling it on some craft, but I suspect it\u0027s too slow and tries to correct small movements too lightly to manage it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter of Lift behind the Center of Mass is good for spin recovery ability but bad for maneuverability and also gives that nose down tendency.
