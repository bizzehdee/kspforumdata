This would \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Enot\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E be an open-to-public repo, just one that we use to develop our software against, sort of like a development database. Doing so we can see the pro\u0027s and con\u0027s of the different processes and file structures, make some changes, wipe it and start over if something isn\u0027t working the way we want. I am no coder, just a systems tech that works closely and supports developers. And the ones I work with wipe/restore their dev database almost weekly while they are working on a new piece of software. Now making a TEST/Production repo? yeah, I agree that is madness at this point in the game. However that is just how \u003Cstrong\u003E*I*\u003C/strong\u003E view things. Actual processes will have to be decided as a whole by everyone who wants to actively participate in the project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for finding the \u0022oddball\u0022 mods that can not be dropped into GameData, I have a Linux Bash script that did something similar.
