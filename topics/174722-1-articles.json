There is a way to plan rendezvous in orbiter style?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor who never played orbiter there is a tool that allow you to know exactly when your craft catches (precisely which orbit in the future) the target. Of course he work when you are in the same plane. Every burn, or every little translation change in real time the effect on the interception once you have defined an encounter point (that can be the apoapsis or periapsis ).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ho that you understand me because I\u0027m Italian and my English is not the best.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-07T22:27:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2018 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Schumifun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashyMcCrashFace","CreatedById":187039,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-08T03:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how orbiter works but I think you\u0027re talking about Hohmann maneuver.
