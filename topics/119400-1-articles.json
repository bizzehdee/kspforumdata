However, it does offer a different take on the ubiquitous spaceplane (and if you abhor staging, it is capable of SSTO). The LD-1A3 is not designed for function. It\u0027s an open cockpit spaceplane that poops out an ion-powered personal spacecraft. Because optimising drag and having an inline cargo bay with a closed cockpit, is well, sensible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was never going to be well engineered because aesthetically it\u0027s hard to add bits to create different shapes without ruining the drag profiles. Subsequently, there are some tradeoffs. Namely handling, and the fact that without assistance it cannot push itsself through the sound barrier. Perhaps when I get better at this sort of thing I\u0027ll have a eureka moment. And maybe a little bit of part clipping while I naively tried to get it to space using just four Rapiers, and maybe some naughty fuel clipped into fuel tanks... There, I said it. This is not well engineered. It\u0027s crafted for the way it looks... I like it. But then clearly I\u0027m biased. Frankly, it\u0027s ugly. But it\u0027s different. And different is okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally this craft comes with a warranty that is voided the moment you spawn her.

Well Steinsieker will fit into a Mk 2 cargo bay and only weighs around 2t. You\u0027ll need to offset the docking port in the cargo bay slighty, and watch insertion to ensure the \u0022strut landing legcumfeet\u0022 don\u0027t attach to the cargo bay...

So the craft has two drogue chutes to help. And this is also why we have set the airbrakes to yaw control (the CoL is always behind the CoM but the drag created by the cargo bay, and the aesthetic parts, just seems to cause chaos). You will be able to regain control easily enough. Once control has returned and you are subsonic, you can cut the chutes.

She\u0027s packing 3,200ms \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V with ion thrusters - and because she\u0027s got such a low TWR she also features the retro landing rockets. Perfect for when you realise that lithobraking will be fatal. This means it can add 200\u002Bms \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V in 5 seconds. Perfect for that panic moment before landing. Although, landing is ill advised as the solar panel can be fragile. Warranty void upon undocking. She is however more than capable of Munar and Minmus flybys. She can land on the Mun without the rockets! But you need patience and altitude. Also, you may not make it back to Kerbin if you do land... She does pack an RTG to allow minimal thruster operations when in the dark. Because if like me you don\u0027t plan very well, you may need to thrust in the dark, albeit at a snail\u0027s pace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstructions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen cargo bay, EVA to the Steinsieker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prefer to manually start the engines because sometimes I get into that bloodlust staging frenzy.

Make sure the transport is not rotating. Play around to ensure you\u0027ve rendezvoused and you\u0027re near, tinker until your velocity vector lines up with the docking port, turn retrograde switch of SAS and wait for it to hit. Usually the magnets take care of this.
