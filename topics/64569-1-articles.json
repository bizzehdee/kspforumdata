It would make light speed travel possible with powerful engines. The only current problem is a question. What exactly would be done to make an inertial dampener?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, as far as I know, you could start with: What would absorb the inertia?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow could that inertia be turned to nothing without breaking Newton\u0027s laws?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve thought this through before by thinking about how a specific type of engine could be made, specifically the fictional warp drive. Something that creates thrust without exhaust of any kind. that would be the perfect engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are so many different things to achieve ultimate power through, but this is about making Inertial Dampeners.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Newtonian physics, in order to make something that works at all, you have to follow these laws, they are built into physics. In fact, if you think about it, figuring out how to make an inertial dampener would make it possible to make an engine with absolutely no exhaust, like the fictional warp drive. This is because you\u0027re finding a way to divert from Newton\u0027s laws, to other laws. Could be done with the laws of Equivalent Exchange, which is the laws of conservation of mass, only Equivalent Exchange is what I call it. Same thing. In a sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, force can be turned into energy through certain means, of which none are really usable without using Newton\u0027s laws.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way it could be done is by finding a type of process that doesn\u0027t depend on Newton\u0027s laws, and unless someone else knows something I immediately don\u0027t, it may be the only way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay I suggest the use of electromagnetism upon this subject? Think of a continuous loop of particles moving in one direction similar to a hadron collider, only you\u0027re not smashing atoms or accelerating anything, these are just kept moving in one direction at a certain speed. These particles move continuously throughout this vacuum loop, harbored inside the vessel, not touching anything. As I am thinking now, inertia (definition: a property of matter by which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless that state is changed by an external force.) is a part of specific energy. An atom has Electrons that move around it in continuous motion because it\u0027s just like the planets that orbit a star. They are moving fast enough in orbit that their speed of moving in one direction, and their mass, work to keep them from accelerating towards the center mass, i.e. the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, the electrons move so fast around the atom, creating the electron shells, because their mass is so small that they need an outrageous amount of speed in order to keep from colliding with the nucleus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that is an example of explaining what inertial energy is. (I hope that makes sense)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer. You move the inertia from the accelerated particles, to the particles in the forever loop. Doing so through a field, which inertial dampeners are supposed to do. This method would actually eliminate the need of the forever loop altogether, because it would just focus all inertia into the group of particles within loop. This would mean no matter how much the engines fire off, the ship won\u0027t move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn inertial dampener is supposed to spread the inertia throughout the ship, including the people on board, and any matter within range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh god, just...Just disregard most of that. I give up for now.
