That\u0027s metastability of the phase. Well, if there is such a thing as metastable metallic hydrogen, frequently abbreviated as MSMH, then it would be the holly grail of chemical fuels.

There is no classical reason for it to be metastable, but it\u0027s not going to be a classical system. It\u0027s all going to be hardcore quantum field theory, and we are still rather limited in how much we can do with that. Very few problems in QFT can be solved exactly and numerical solutions are very hardware-limited. So even though we know all the basic rules that individual particles are going to follow, predicting behavior of materials can be difficult, and metallic hydrogen is probably as difficult as they come. There are some models that suggest metastability. But there is no certainty on whether these models are trustworthy for the particular problem. Unfortunately, this is probably something that will have to be resolved experimentally.

The big events that might have \u0027seeded\u0027 some of the cosmos with this stuff long ago so that it could be dispersed to places like our solar system would seem to have involved lots of heat, which would tend to phase it back to non-metallic state (liquid if not even gas right?).

This isn\u0027t something we should be counting on, but we might get lucky. And as I said, even small quantities can be useful. Not as fuel, but for some other applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I completely forgot to address the implied question in OP. Can we get hydrogen to reasonable densities without high pressures? In fact, yes, we can. Lithium Hydride (LiH) is an ionic solid with density 0.78g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 at room temperature and normal pressure. It actually releases more energy per mole when burned with oxygen than pure hydrogen does. That compensates for lithium being slightly heavier than hydrogen. As a result, the maximum theoretical I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E of such fuel is almost identical to that of cryogenic hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar solution exists for oxygen. All things considered, the best choice is probably Dinitrogen Tetroxide (N\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E). It is a fluid at room temperatures, and so it is ideal for use as oxidizer in a hybrid. It is rather dense, 1.44g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3, and it actually adds a bit of extra energy to reaction compared to oxygen, which nearly compensates for the dead weight of nitrogen. The only downsides are low boiling point, only 21\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, meaning it will boil on a hot day if not insulated or pressurized, and that it\u0027s rather toxic. Still, you can get almost the performance of LOX without having to deal with a cryogenic oxidizer, and that\u0027s often worth the extra hassles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, as somebody mentioned earlier, for a large rocket, these things aren\u0027t really a big deal. Large tanks aren\u0027t a problem if they are not significantly pressurized, and insulation is easy with large volumes. So for larger rockets it\u0027s a lot easier to simply have cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen as fuel and oxidizer. They are cheap, they are environmentally friendly, and they don\u0027t require any special containment beyond keeping them nice and chill. But for smaller rockets, especially ones that need to be stored fueled up, these are serious problems. Standard solution is to fuel the rocket with Hydrazine (N\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EH\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E) and Dinitrogen Tetroxide. This is what you\u0027ll find in many ICMBs and some larger AA missiles. But as I mentioned above, a Lithium Hydride hybrid is another option. As far as I know only amateur rockets with such fuel have been built, but given that broad interest in hybrids is relatively recent, I don\u0027t think that it\u0027s due to any limitations of the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T06:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eits totally unrelated but that kinda reminds me of this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://hackaday.com/2012/09/26/hybrid-rocket-engine-uses-acrylic-as-fuel/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://hackaday.com/2012/09/26/hybrid-rocket-engine-uses-acrylic-as-fuel/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T06:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAcrylics make for pretty good hybrid fuels, but the specific impulse for it is about the same as other polymer fuels, and that\u0027s a somewhat lower than I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E of cryogenic LH2/LOX rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T07:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eone of the videos claimed an isp of 140s and about 1.7 lbs thrust. but what they lack in power/efficiency they make up for in awesomeness. its also a good way to demonstrate how this kind of engine works. its unlikely you will have a transparent combustion chamber in a typical lox\u002Blh2 rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T13:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne more question I had about the metallic hydrogen.
