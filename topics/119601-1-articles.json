Project Genesis Uno will go to Duna, and whilst there, on the way, and on the way back collect alot of science, I\u0027m playing in what I call Science Sandbox Sandbox, which is science mode, but with the TreeToppler mod, I can unlock the whole tech tree from the start, meaning I can do science and not have any limits to what else I can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VOIouLB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VOIouLB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgress so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome info about the Genesis Uno, it will carry six Kerbals, two Scientists, two Engineers, and two Pilots. I will be using the Habitat Pack for the hab module, and possibly the command module, as well as MJ to dock vessels, as this is about Duna, not learning to rendezvous and dock. Other mods will be [X]Science, UKS, and possibly KAS/KIS, and maybe some others that I haven\u0027t used yet. This takes place from where Minmus Explorers abrubtly left off, basically, the Minmus Explorers project was cancelled (or maybe just halted for a long time) to conduct this. As this is my first interplanetary mission I will be making noob moves, so dont go screaming at me \u0022You could\u0027ve a hohmann transfer!\u0022 because I have no clue what that is. Instead of what I did with Minmus Explorers, where I focused on the story, on this one I\u0027m going to focus more on what actually happens, and focus a bit less on the story, doesn\u0027t mean I won\u0027t be trying to make a good story, though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, on to the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldvis: What do you mean you cancelled Minmus Explorers?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: I\u0027m sorry Aldvis, but I won\u0027t need to apologize any more after you see what we\u0027ve replaced it with...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldvis: What did you replace it with?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Project Genesis, more specifically, Project Genesis Uno.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldvis: What in Sam Hills is that?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Calm down, Aldvis, Project Genesis Uno is going to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldvis: WHAT?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: It\u0027s gonna be big...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldvis: DOUBLE WHAT?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: And it\u0027s gonna bring three Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldvis: TRIPLE WHAT?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Who is Watt?

I\u0027ve stepped up my game alot since the Sharkman Launch Sloth\u0027s, which weren\u0027t very strong. The new Ignis 1 launcher I\u0027m using is a big upgrade. Hope you\u0027ve all enjoyed the first part. My most ambitious mission yet, in many ways other than just my first interplanetary mission, it will be my first mission out of Kerbin SOI, my most dockings, as before this my first docking was on a station ages ago, all dockings will be done with MJ, as well as rendezvous. Sorry theres no pictures other than the progress picture as of now, when I did this I didn\u0027t know I was gonna make it into a Mission Report, so I didn\u0027t take any screens.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-09T10:52:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2015 10:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharkman Briton\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T13:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, yesterday, after the science experiment module docked onto the core module, I did some science in LKO, blah blah blah. Today, I did the first service mission and crew transfer, with Doler and Bill, and of course, Mechjeb, it all went off find except a fuel flow error I forgot to correct on the first try. It was supposed to put Doler in the science lab to take care of the experiments, but when I did it I realized there were no parachutes on the servicer, so Bill is now in there too, Bill had no purpose to be there after all, becasue he was supposed to use KAS struts to stabilize the ship, but the places where the struts were supposed to go were too far apart. So overall the mission WAS a success, because Doler got into the science lab, reset the sciene experiments and did some more experiments, but as is tradition with me there was alot of complications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/j7zN1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

If anyone can help me with a lander design I can put in the ship, I would be very thankful because I have no clue how I would do that, the only way I can think of that would work with my proposed design is having it inline, meaning every time it undocks I have to dock the station back together, and as proven on this mission I can\u0027t do docking even at very close distances between the docking port, and putting the lander on the back would be difficult becasue I would have to put the engines and such on radially, which would require some precise docking to orient it right, which I can\u0027t tell MJ to do, so any Duna lander designs are appreciated. As well as advice on how to place it on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T17:38:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have taken upon myself the way of the Kuzzter!
