It\u0027s not just the speeds (orbital speeds are higher for higher altitudes, so a 2X kerbin will have higher orbital speeds), though that clearly matters. It is also the time in the atmosphere for those effects to manifest themselves. You\u0027d still need \u0022gameplay\u0022 tweaks to make reentry matter in a 2X kerbin, but the magnitude of the tweaks would be lower, and it might be possible to achieve better balance. Currently, reentry needs to be set such that at lower velocities, it is meaningful with far shorter times of interaction. This will clearly have a negative impact on high speed flight within the atmosphere for planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt;s another example of where arbitrarily changing things (counter to realism) opens cans of worms.
