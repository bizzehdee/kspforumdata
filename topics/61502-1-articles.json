This can be shown using some exciting amounts of integration with Newton\u0027s gravitation formula, but you can find that somewhere else if you want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Kasuha mentioned, two-body physics is plenty in the real world for a lot of interactions - although, you\u0027d better compensate for the moon when you\u0027re flying satellites around Earth. It does introduce a sizeable error. Once you leave the earth-moon system, pretty much everything reduces out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s one AM and I\u0027m kindof gibbering, but the last thing is that for all intents and purposes, the center of mass of a two body system (that is, one that we would see set up in KSP or real world, where one body is a man-made craft), lies within a negligible distance of the center of the planet. For example, the ISS (mass 450 tons (thank you google)) and orbits roughly 250 miles up (for a total of 4250 miles, plus or minus). Earth weighs 6.58321259 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 10^21 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso, a rough COM calculation (using earth as datum)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(m1*x1\u002Bm2*x2)/(m1\u002Bm2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(6.58321259 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 10^21*0\u002B450*4250)/(6.58321259 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 10^21\u002B450)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.9051166e-16 miles = 1.84068e-11 inches\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor comparison, a hydrogen atom is 3.93701e-9 inches across.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the ISS is \u0022moving\u0022 the earth by less than a hundredth the diameter of a hydrogen atom.
