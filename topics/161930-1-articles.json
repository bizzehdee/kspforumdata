It would be a mod that adds no parts, just a bit more realism :). I\u0027m keeping what it actually does secret because I\u0027m pretty sure it hasn\u0027t been done before and I don\u0027t want people stealing ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if anyone here knows how to code and is willing to help me out, please make yourself known and send me a PM and we\u0027ll work from there.

For the stall warning, you enter the stall speed of your aircraft, when you reach this speed you get the stall warning with the alarm and eveything. If ANY part falls of your craft you get an alarm and a master alarm comes on if your engines fall of. For terrain warnings, you select the altitude at which the warnings come on and when you\u0027re at that altitude compared to the ground you get \u0027caution, terrain, caution terrain, pull up!\u0027 Of course you could modify which warnings you like or even completey turn them of. This would be accessible through a menu like hyper edit. As in the side, under the resources. Or through a shortcut like\u00A0alt \u002B A or something. Since stall speed is determined by a complicated equation, instead you enter the stall speed, there would be a few small notes explaining how to determine the stall speed. This is the basic idea, It would still need to be elaborated to be more flexible, user friendly and to make it more unique to set it apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mod would be aimed for beginner players wanting easy to understand indications on their status of flight or for more experienced players wanting a bit more realism or again for normal players like you and I who\u00A0wanting a bit of variety in their game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-12T10:36:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2017 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Raptor kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-12T11:00:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be best to write up complete details first. \u00A0Then post and see who offers to help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe as detailed as you can\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-13T11:08:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was playing with this idea \u00A0the other day actually, but instead of making a totally new mod, I was doing it with KRPC and pyttsx. \u00A0 I just implemented altitude callouts - but it was fun and useful for landings!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really have time to get into coding all of this with you, but it sounds like a great idea for a mod and it sounds very approachable, if you break it into chunks! \u00A0 I\u0027d encourage you to download visual studio, follow the tutorials here on the forum and give it a shot yourself! \u00A0We\u0027re all here when you run into trouble. \u00A0I taught myself c# to be able to contribute to KSP mods. \u00A0 ((Okay full disclosure - patient people on this forum taught me c# when I nagged them with dozens of\u00A0questions.)) \u00A0Just jump into it. \u00A0It\u0027s actually NOT that hard. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr look into KRPC - you could do all of what you want to do in Python or Lua if C# and waiting for KSP to reload 43,000 times is not sounding appealing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kyle Worden","CreatedById":179715,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-13T17:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best place to start would be to come up with an algorithm, create a flowchart that shows what parameters the code would look for and what it does in each scenario.
