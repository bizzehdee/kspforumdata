As you launch missions and carry out your activities, there will be a daily bulletin say...pinned on the side of the mission control building. You can access it via said building. It could have a single headline regarding the space program events for that day. If nothing is happening at all, the headline can be related to that as well. It can be used for the apparent incompetence of the space program such as \u0022Dozens of astronauts MIA. KSC claims they are on extended vacation time\u0022. Whenever a monumental occurance happens headlines will correspond with \u0022Jebediah Kerman, First Kerbal on the Mun!\u0022 or \u0022Paradise found?

I think this fits in well with the kind of atmosphere the game is trying to set.
