I do most of my craft control using that, because to me, that is way more realistic than aligning a craft with WASD keys and more to the point, it\u0027s way more precise. The stock game gives you prograde/retrograde, normal, radial etc buttons to click, this does the same but for any heading and unlike the stock ones it also controls roll (I hate the way the stock alignment buttons will put you prograde, but leave you rolled at some random angle, I want to be rolled 0,\u00A0180 or tracking the roll of a target craft).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnlike the stock game it will orient a craft that you\u0027re not currently controlling; ie, set your station to radial out and then when you next approach the station, when you get close to it, the station will automatically correct it\u0027s alignment.\u00A0 I recently found out that you can also set orientation based on other craft or bodies, ie; set a probe to orient relative to the sun, so it\u0027s always facing it.\u00A0 In my view, features like that are just filling in for missing stock features.\u00A0 And that\u0027s just the SmartASS (which I could go on about for another page or two, but I\u0027ll stop now).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn flight and editor info is the other big aspect of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E for me (ok there is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E which can provide the same info, but why install another mod when I\u0027m already using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E).\u00A0 I love \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s customizable windows (and the fact that the settings for those are so easy to port between installs) and I\u0027ve got my in flight info set just how I like with just enough info that I can perform a launch to orbit without having to switch to map mode.\u00A0 I\u0027m still manually piloting the craft, but I can stay focused on it without having to jump to map mode (faff about with the mouse and AP marker) to check my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Is that cheating or detracting from the fun....I don\u0027t think so, I think being able to stay in flight mode is more fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s tools like the flight recorder which lets you record and plot various flight data\u00A0which, if you\u0027re doing experiments to see how one design flies compared to another, is a great tool.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rover autopilot (yeah it\u0027s an auto pilot but...) lets you setup waypoints and have a rover potter around your base while you do other things (can be a bit flaky, but it\u0027s pretty good).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0027s the maneuver node planner which is not only a great convenience tool, it\u0027s quite a good way for newbies to learn.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe landing autopilot can be used as a prediction tool; either predicting aerobraking outcome or prediction landing site.\u00A0 You still manually control things, but that can be some useful info.
