The balance is what most concerns me with this tech tree. And.. this version has a more expensive first 4 steps than when I first started the overhaul. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like the problem I faced most was how to justify the cost of most nodes because I cannot predict what mods users will have installed. For the most part I tried to sort parts by their value and what mod they come from, but there are some places where there are discontinuities for a mods\u0027 parts. If I start seeing a problem concerning this, I may have to seperate each mod and sort them more linearly. The problem with this is that one mod may have parts that scale faster than another mods, mostly storage parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe shall see. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if anyone sees problems with regards to sorting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I am going through the forum and spaceport looking for mods to add support for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Talisar","CreatedById":62035,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T21:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ackander\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ackander\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERight now I am going through the forum and spaceport looking for mods to add support for.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOff the top of my head, I\u0027d suggest \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26286-FTmN-Atomic-Rockets-More-v2-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKommitz\u0027s pack\u003C/a\u003E.

But I didn\u0027t really want more parts than this and I would\u0027ve preferred to go with even fewer mods, like removing KW Rocketry or KOSMOS, but that would\u0027ve left too many nodes empty and pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important mod I\u0027m running with is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52535-0-23-0-Achievements-1-5-3-Earn-132-achievements-while-playing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAchievements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E by blizzy, this one gives you \u002B5 science for every achievement you get. This might skew the amount of science I can get, but it\u0027s mostly just noticeable at the start since \u002B5 science isn\u0027t much later on and achievements are much harder to get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the first thing I noticed is that getting to the first couple of nodes, Logic and Basic Rocketry, is extremely easy. All you have to do is launch a Pod and do a Crew Report. That doesn\u0027t feel very satisfactory, I would rather you felt like you had to make an effort to kick the tech tree off. So I increased the cost of those two nodes to 20 and 25 respectively, forcing you to at least do a couple of crew reports and surface samples around KSP, nothing too hard or time consuming anyway. The second level of nodes that unlock after that I increased to around 6-8 instead of 2-5, but that\u0027s it, I didn\u0027t touch any other node costs. This had me do quite a thorough research around KSP which took me around 30 minutes or so and I liked it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore reaching parachutes I had to explore a little outside KSP so I built myself a \u0022hover rocket\u0022 with a Rockomax 48-7S (Basic Liquid Fuel Rocketry, 25\u002B8 science from start, very easy to get), which I could carefully \u0022crash\u0022 into the water and shorelines around KSP giving me more science to get. Pretty quickly I had parachutes and it felt like a huge success! Loved it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, since the tree starts branching out at this point, I didn\u0027t feel the need to increase the cost of nodes any more as it felt fairly balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing back to the first couple of nodes (Basic Rocketry and Logic), the parts that unlocks for me are: the command seat, the rover base, the RT-10 Solid Rocket Booster and a larger booster from KW rocketry. Now I feel like every node you unlock in the tree should give you new possibilities. These two don\u0027t. At the start, without parachutes, there\u0027s nothing you can do with those parts so essentially you have to use the same methods as you used at the start. I feel like it would be better if you unlocked the tiny Rockomax and Liquid fuel tanks in the first unlock rather than the second, giving you some new options to get science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater on I started to unlock things at a steady rate with new useful parts to play with at every step without ever feeling like a grind. MechJeb was an important one for me and I recently reached the node which unlocks the Maneuver Planner for it and it didn\u0027t feel like it was too far away at all, had to do a couple of manual orbits, and even a fly-by of the mun manually, but that\u0027s the way it should be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EECLSS Life support gives you enough life support in the Mk1 Pod to go the Mun and back without too much trouble, but soon enough I\u0027ll want to land on it and would have to start unlocking Logistics. Heatshields are also not much of a problem since the Mk1 Pod has a basic heat shield integrated but soon I\u0027ll have to start unlocking that to bring back larger science vessels safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike ZaPPPa said earlier, the fact that fairing bases for procedural fairings come without their fairings is a bit strange since they\u0027re (almost) useless on their own. And finally, maybe the layout of the tree could do with some minor tweaking, some nodes seem to overlap lines without actually being a requirement for that line so it looks a bit confusing, but that\u0027s only minor \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk. Let\u0027s wrap up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all I\u0027m really enjoying this tree. The fact that it\u0027s integrated with a lot of interesting mods is definitely a major major plus. The start is a bit too easy, but overall it seems balanced, maybe even on the easy side. I feel like a strong focus should be on making every node a useful unlock, so far, except for the first two, every one does, but there could possibly be some adjustments.

Since I probably cannot have all 88 parts mods installed at once without outright deleting all the texture files, I have to take it in steps.

But I didn\u0027t really want more parts than this and I would\u0027ve preferred to go with even fewer mods, like removing KW Rocketry or KOSMOS, but that would\u0027ve left too many nodes empty and pointless.\u003Cp\u003EAnother important mod I\u0027m running with is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52535-0-23-0-Achievements-1-5-3-Earn-132-achievements-while-playing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAchievements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E by blizzy, this one gives you \u002B5 science for every achievement you get. This might skew the amount of science I can get, but it\u0027s mostly just noticeable at the start since \u002B5 science isn\u0027t much later on and achievements are much harder to get. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree, pointless nodes are pointless. This just illustrates the difficulty in planning a tech tree with so many mods. I have to do two things at the same time when I plan part sorting: make sure the \u0027value\u0027 progression is balanced, and try to minimize gaps between nodes with parts when someone does not play with a particular mod. Before I realize it might be a problem, I just lumped all the mod parts together, and sorted them by their \u0027value\u0027 technology-wise. So all fuel containers are sorted by size and capacity regardless of mod, likewise with engines. An example problem would be Hex Cans. They get bigger faster compared to other similar containers, so they have gaps in capacity where other mods would have a container that would fill the gap. But the current tree structure does not have the room for extra levels. In other words, the small, medium, and large fuel HexCans do not have the same tech \u0027value\u0027 as round small, medium, and large containers.. So if I have three levels, the last level will have parts that can store 10 times what the other parts at that level can store, and if I add levels, there will be gaps between the HexCans. What happens when the gap mod is not installed though. Or, if I move all Hex Cans to be next to each other, why would someone use a far inferior container from the same node?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am seriously tempted to make each node represent a range of part properties like capacity, thrust, etc. and write a ModuleManager config to change everything accordingly, so no matter what mods you have installed, if they are supported, they will be comparable to stock and thus one another leaving no gaps in the TechTree, except silly nodes like nanolathing and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuite a task, though. I counted 1,685 mod parts in v1.12.18.b alone, and am sorting another 354 now for the next update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nelien\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nelien\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow the first thing I noticed is that getting to the first couple of nodes, Logic and Basic Rocketry, is extremely easy. All you have to do is launch a Pod and do a Crew Report. That doesn\u0027t feel very satisfactory, I would rather you felt like you had to make an effort to kick the tech tree off. So I increased the cost of those two nodes to 20 and 25 respectively, forcing you to at least do a couple of crew reports and surface samples around KSP, nothing too hard or time consuming anyway. The second level of nodes that unlock after that I increased to around 6-8 instead of 2-5, but that\u0027s it, I didn\u0027t touch any other node costs. This had me do quite a thorough research around KSP which took me around 30 minutes or so and I liked it!\u003Cp\u003EBefore reaching parachutes I had to explore a little outside KSP so I built myself a \u0022hover rocket\u0022 with a Rockomax 48-7S (Basic Liquid Fuel Rocketry, 25\u002B8 science from start, very easy to get), which I could carefully \u0022crash\u0022 into the water and shorelines around KSP giving me more science to get. Pretty quickly I had parachutes and it felt like a huge success! Loved it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, since the tree starts branching out at this point, I didn\u0027t feel the need to increase the cost of nodes any more as it felt fairly balanced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the pendulum swinging. I do not know if you played on the first first of the Vertical TechTree, but I designed the start of it to be grind intensive.. Most of the science around KSP needed to be harvested before you get Parachutes or General Rocketry. Seemed like a good idea at the time to force a player to use the limited capacity of a pod, and truss to start gathering enough science to earn less than helpful parts. The response to this was overwhelmingly negative, so I changed it. Instead of having to spend science on a relatively useless node like Logic and Basic Rocketry, I basically lowered the price to where it sort of became start, and this other node that you get when you do a mission using only a pod and truss, because I concocted a story about the Kerbals and this TechTree is the byproduct. I wrote it down earlier, in one \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php?p=822270#post822270\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esentence\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOddly enough, you increased the cost of Logic and Basic Rocketry to almost v1.0 levels.. and you felt the success I originally intended, good job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nelien\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nelien\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGoing back to the first couple of nodes (Basic Rocketry and Logic), the parts that unlocks for me are: the command seat, the rover base, the RT-10 Solid Rocket Booster and a larger booster from KW rocketry. Now I feel like every node you unlock in the tree should give you new possibilities. These two don\u0027t. At the start, without parachutes, there\u0027s nothing you can do with those parts so essentially you have to use the same methods as you used at the start. I feel like it would be better if you unlocked the tiny Rockomax and Liquid fuel tanks in the first unlock rather than the second, giving you some new options to get science.\u003Cp\u003ELater on I started to unlock things at a steady rate with new useful parts to play with at every step without ever feeling like a grind. MechJeb was an important one for me and I recently reached the node which unlocks the Maneuver Planner for it and it didn\u0027t feel like it was too far away at all, had to do a couple of manual orbits, and even a fly-by of the mun manually, but that\u0027s the way it should be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EECLSS Life support gives you enough life support in the Mk1 Pod to go the Mun and back without too much trouble, but soon enough I\u0027ll want to land on it and would have to start unlocking Logistics. Heatshields are also not much of a problem since the Mk1 Pod has a basic heat shield integrated but soon I\u0027ll have to start unlocking that to bring back larger science vessels safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are right, those two nodes do not give you anything helpful. See above about the triple-split \u0027start\u0027 node, in essence you have to pay to start like no other TechTree I know of. Almost like you start the game before rockets are invented, and your entire species is relegated to walking and rolling around in capsule rovers. I liked the \u0027before rockets are invented\u0027 part, but didn\u0027t feel it neccessary for a ton of walkabouts to discover them. Think of it as time compression in effect, so you do not have to walk-n-roll grind KSC and environs now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nelien\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nelien\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELike ZaPPPa said earlier, the fact that fairing bases for procedural fairings come without their fairings is a bit strange since they\u0027re (almost) useless on their own. And finally, maybe the layout of the tree could do with some minor tweaking, some nodes seem to overlap lines without actually being a requirement for that line so it looks a bit confusing, but that\u0027s only minor \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairings are unlocked with composites.
