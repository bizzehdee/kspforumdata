have a solution to your problem, this time \u0027round, but just one side note about How Things Work, since that may be useful in understanding potential future difficulties:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOxygen != oxidizer.\u00A0 They\u0027re completely different things and aren\u0027t interchangeable at all.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s easy to make this mistake, because IRL, oxygen \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E an oxidizer (thus the name \u0022oxidizer\u0022), and a material that will burn in oxygen will generally burn with an oxidizer, too.\u00A0 But in KSP, they\u0027re completely different things that simply happen to have similar-sounding names.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecifically:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJet\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E engines (or Rapiers in \u0022jet\u0022 mode) will run \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eonly with atmospheric oxygen from an intake.\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 They will not and cannot use oxidizer, ever, under any circumstances, even a little bit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ERocket\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E engines (including Rapiers in \u0022closed-cycle\u0022 mode) will run \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eonly with oxidizer\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 They will not and cannot use atmospheric oxygen from air intakes, ever, under any circumstances, even a little bit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a useful thing to know when you\u0027re debugging a situation like this.\u00A0 For example, if you\u0027re dealing with Rapiers and trying to figure out \u0022why does / doesn\u0027t it burn\u0022, just look at which mode it\u0027s in.\u00A0 If it\u0027s in atmospheric mode, you know it\u0027s purely an issue involving air intakes, and there\u0027s no point in looking for oxidizer anywhere, because oxidizer is irrelevant in that scenario.\u00A0 If it\u0027s in closed-cycle mode, you know it\u0027s purely an issue involving oxidizer, and therefore the air intakes have nothing to do with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust something to be aware of.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022

(I put it between quotation marks because I really don\u0027t know how exactly the game handle it: pressure, altitude, combination of both?). So at the altitude of your screenshot the engine should be in rocket mode and should require Oxidizer to work. If it worked without oxidizer its clearly a bug.
