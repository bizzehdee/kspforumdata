I put Valentina into orbit and got her back down.\n\nNow, the contract to orbit Kerbin is missing. None of my contracts available are orbital, all of them are suborbital. I check the completed contracts list, and Orbit Kerbin isn\u0027t in there, either succeeded or failed.\n\nDid I screw up?

After the initial four, at any given time you might qualify for more than one, but there is always one available at a time, to keep you focused. Because of this, they are not conducive to being auto-accepted, because even if they were, you might miss some if you have one accepted while you \u0022skip\u0022 another.\n\nThey are based off of your achievements, but they are not an achievement system. They are still contracts."}]}
