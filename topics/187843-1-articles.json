However, once you get to it the gravity is so much weaker that you fall more slowly, which can make the landing itself easier. Oh, and the \u0022seas\u0022 of Minmus are perfectly flat, making it less of a risk that your ship will fall over.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for being unable to circularize, I suspect the thrust of your upper stage is too low so that you are unable to attain orbital speed before gravity reasserts itself.

that\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Ethe Mun and Minmus present different challenges, but they are roughly equal in overall difficulty.\u00A0 Both present general piloting challenges for the early game:\u00A0 the Mun\u0027s is one of landing, and Minmus\u0027s is one of navigation.\u00A0 You can prepare for the Minmus challenges by learning to rendezvous two vessels in Kerbin orbit (especially so with one in an inclined orbit), and\u00A0many people do that first.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you asked about landing in particular, yes, Minmus \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E be\u00A0easier on that specific point, but while Minmus has perfectly flat places, it also has\u00A0its share of hills and uneven terrain.\u00A0\u00A0You need to select your landing site with some care (and pay attention to the area around that site--some players have wrecked landers on the slopes \u003Cem\u003Enext to\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the flats).\u00A0 On the other hand, you won\u0027t learn unless you go, so give it a try.\u00A0 If you like, you can take pictures and post them in \u003Ca

is falling back into the atmosphere before completing the circularization burn, then it is likely your circularization burn is taking too long.\u00A0 One way to decrease the duration is to use a

I\u0027m guessing the problem is likely in the trajectory that you are flying.\u00A0 My suspicion it that you are lofting the rocket into a steep arc with a very large circularization burn.\u00A0 There are two problems with this:\u00A0 (1) the duration of the burn is long, and (2) the time you spend near the top of the arc is brief.\u00A0 My suggestion is that during ascent you pitch the rocket over more aggressively and fly a flatter trajectory.\u00A0 Make the arc of your flight path as long and as flat as possible, without being so flat that your craft is overcome by drag.\u00A0 Doing so will decrease the size and duration of the circularization burn.\u00A0 You will also spend much more time near the apex of the trajectory and outside the atmosphere.\u00A0 This should allow you to complete the circularization burn with ease.\u00A0 This type of trajectory is also more efficient fuel-wise.\u00A0 It will take some practice to perfect the technique, but you\u0027ll get
