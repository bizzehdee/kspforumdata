I have also included a 10m version, though it doesn\u0027t really play nice with the physics engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 5 and 3.75m versions are not able to fit bigger than 1.25m engines(well, you can fit 2.5m engines, but it clips and looks silly), limiting how much thrust you can fit on it and therefore how much fuel is reasonable considering weight(no use pushing below 1.00 TWR really).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 6.4m version does fit 2.5m engines, making it much easier to find suitable engines for lots of fuel.(5 x Mainsail == 7500kN thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFit\u0027s the F-1 engine nicely, though you need to resize the engine to match the scale. (I tried running a full scale model in game, it wasn\u0027t good...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnical stuff: The model is made of 1142 polygons(606 for the base and 134 for each of the engine fairings), the textures(paint and normal map) are 1024x1024px. I have stacked uv-islands where I could to keep up the level of detail though it would have been easier if I could have used separate uv maps for the paint and the normal map. It is untested how it performs on anything but full texture size(may or may not go horribly wrong). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also not 100% accurate, there are decals and stuff missing still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel amount in the tanks is very WIP, I tend to change the values to fit my needs, balancing TWR vs dV, so feel free to post what you think are the appropriate values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3.75m and 5m tanks were filled so they were able to lift something with stock 1.25m engines while the 6.4m engine were filled to keep in line with my current progression of my Apollo Style mission(still to be launched). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stage fits nicely as the bottom of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/29411-Apollo-Mission-Pack-Development-(Beta-version-released!)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EApollo Mission Pack\u003C/a\u003E Saturn V, the textures don\u0027t match though(mine is brighter), you will have to adjust the fuel level and you\u0027ll probably have to do some engine modding to match their engine(2,275kN thrust, divided by 5 is 455kN per engine, their isp is 475(atm)/525(vac) and weight is 8t/5 == 1.6t each). You can use their engine cluster, but it clips with the engine fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to NovaPunch2, the tank is underfilled, if we compare with their biggest tank(5m x 12m == 235.62 cubic meters) it contains 78.23 liters liquidfuel per cubic meter. Converting that to our 6.4m tank(6.4m x 36.3m = 1167.8 cubic meters) gives 78.23 * 1167.8 = 91,357 liters and calculating for oxidizer: (91,357/0.9)*1,1 = 111,659 liters. This is a heavy tank(1030t if we keep dry weight at 15t), with just a Mk1-2 pod on top and mainsails underneath it gives us a TWR of 0.71, not really practical. (Same with the 5m and 3.75m versions, as they can only fit 1.25m engines(well, appart from the 5m version in the middle)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Fuel is heavy, let me know how much you think should be in the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: You might need to strut your engines, as the size of this thing tends to play around with physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDOWNLOAD:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/c6l7k8adqc15dq0/Saturn-V_S-IC_v0.4.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E From Dropbox!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Extract inside the GameData folder or if upgrading delete the HTP folder in GameData first).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ok7dz0csxsq5p6k/Saturn-V_S-IC_KSP-Texture_v0.2.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlternative KSP texture.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Extract inside GameData folder, it\u0027ll overwrite GameData/HTP/K-V_S-IC-5/model000.mbm ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Between v0.3 and v0.4 the texture changed, so using the old one might give funny results).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Not uploaded to spaceport due to the issues lately).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECHANGELOG:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev0.1 - Initial Release\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev0.2 - Separated out the engine fairings as separate models and fixed the missing convex setting on the collision mesh(es).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev0.3 - Got rid of three engine fairings, just duplicated and rotated the last one.
