If I select my game object and open the animation tab, I can add clips but I don\u0027t see objects or anything like that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/8KD0U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/8KD0U\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see my animation tab is empty. If I select the child of the game object, I can only see imported animation clips if I have any (can\u0027t add any then either, all options are disabled/greyed out). It also doesn\u0027t matter if I\u0027ve imported animations from Blender...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is really irritating when I try to do emissive textures and stuff, I can click \u0022add curve\u0022 when I\u0027ve selected the \u0022highest\u0022 parent and choose the emissive material in gameobject-\u0026gt;mesh renderer-\u0026gt;emissive color. But then when I change the value, nothing happens. I\u0027ve seen videos where people change the values and the emissive parts light up but not for me :/ \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if I don\u0027t really explain it well, I\u0027m tired and english isn\u0027t my native language but nonetheless, all answers are greatly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T21:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat version of Unity are you using?
