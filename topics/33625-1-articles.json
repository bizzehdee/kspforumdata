As folks have said, low and wide is the key to stability during touch-down. You can test your landing stability somewhat on Kerbin by hanging the lander from those red support leg thingies and various heights above the ground, and you can rotate the whole lander a few degrees in to the side to simulate landing with some slight horizontal speed. Make sure the supports are the 1st stage, below the lander\u0027s engine(s), so you can just release the lander without firing the rockets (the reverse of normal practice). The go to the launch pad, lower the legs, and then hit space to drop the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you learn from this is a bit limited due to Kerbin\u0027s higher gravity. Objects bounce a LOT higher on Mun so a slight rotation that doesn\u0027t go very far before the lander hits the ground again on Kerbin could actually flip you right over on Mun. Still, you at least get a good drop test of your design to know if it\u0027s strong enough to take the impacts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re REALLY worried about flipping over, you can add some parts to help stand the lander back upright again. These can double as auxiliary landing gear, too, protecting the lander itself from damage in the event of toppling. A very useful part in this regard is the Fighter Tailwheel in the Firespitter mod. Put these on the top corners of the lander so they\u0027ll hit the ground first if the lander topples. Then set up the Gear action group so the tailwheels retract when you lower the main legs. Then create a custom action group to extend the tailwheel. Once the lander topples and stops bouncing, hit the extend tailwheel action group and the force of the wheel popping down will throw the whole lander up in the air and rotate it back up. You can also set up action groups to control the extension/retraction of each individual main leg, you can use parts from the Danmed/Infernal Robotics mods to rotate/hinge arms. You can use RCS and the capsule\u0027s own torque. Just make sure ASAS/SAS is off when you\u0027re trying to stand back up because it wants to keep you angled where you are right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m an inept pilot so righting fallen landers is a common occurrence for me. Provided you stitch your lander together well with struts so it doesn\u0027t break apart at the joints, and make sure the only parts that can touch the ground are strong enough to take it, you can flail around all over the place with legs, wheels, RCS, and torque, and utilize any slope of the ground, and eventually stand up again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tokay Gris","CreatedById":58301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T18:52:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about this for a really broad base?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://hirnstroeme.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screenshot718.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot718.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://hirnstroeme.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screenshot723.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot723.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: If anyone is interested in the craft-file, I will provide it gladly, but this will have to wait till next week, when I am at home again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-18T18:56:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2013 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tokay Gris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thescientist","CreatedById":69046,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T18:13:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first ribbon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0026lt;a  href=\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003Ehttp://ribbons.cgagnier.ca/image.php?ribbon=4399\u0027 alt=\u0027image.php?ribbon=4399\u0027\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-19T18:19:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2013 06:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thescientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
