Seriously, they\u0027re SO BAD. Their color schemes don\u0027t even match or don\u0027t even progress properly, which ruins the sense of \u0022upgrading\u0022. I understand that they\u0027re supposed to look primitive, but that doesn\u0027t mean that they should be terrible compared to the other buildings or that they need pieces of sheet metal duct taped to the sides of things. How come the crafts the Kerbals make are so good yet their buildings suck eggs? Their destroyed buildings look even worse. There\u0027s visible texture tiling on all of the destroyed buildings, and the models themselves are pretty bad.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You should have seen the barn, it was beautiful compared to the ugly tier 1 \u0026 2 buildings we have now.
