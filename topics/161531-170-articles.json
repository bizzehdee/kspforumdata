It is mentioned in the mod thread and noone has noticed a problem from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I went through and tested from a clean install, installing a few mods at a time trying to see what was causing the problem. (With over a 120 mods that takes a while)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually I had everything put back in and still didn\u0027t get the error using a simple ship and a pair of the nuclear turbojets. \u00A0Loaded up the ship that was causing the problem before (now that I had all the parts installed) and launched it with no problem. \u00A0Thinking over if anything was different from this time to when I did it before, I realized there were two things that I didn\u0027t do during launch this time; activate Pilot Assist to keep me straight on the runway (it\u0027s a heavy ship and tends to drift a little), and activate PWB Fuel Balancer to keep my CoM close to where I am able to fly. \u00A0Decided to activate PWB on the next launch and game crashed 30 seconds into launch. \u00A0Tried it again, but this time I did not activate fuel balancing until in the air and it worked fine until the craft became too unstable at low altitude and too high speed and fell apart. \u00A0For some reason when the Nuclear Turbojet is on a ship that PWB is balancing\u00A0it causes something to go haywire while on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso noticed during my troubleshooting that, from a clean KSP install, putting only Exception Detector\u00A0and KSPI-E with its dependencies from CKAN results in continuous exceptions when using the Nuclear Turbojet in the SPH. The error is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at FXModuleAnimateThrottle.FixedUpdate () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese continue to pile up the entire time the engine is in the editor, even when not placed on a ship. Just selecting it causes them. \u00A0They do not occur when the craft is on the runway though. \u00A0Did not check if it also occured from other KSPI-E engines since I was just focused on the turbojet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing I noticed. My big spaceplane has an Omega reactor (I\u0027m using the SETI mods, so the names are different from the base) in 3.75m scale powering a 3.75m large electric generator and a 2.5m Vasmir engine. I decided to try adding thermal turbojets to it, so mirrored a pair of 1.25m Omega reactors and placed the thermal turbojets on them. Each engine ended up with different thrust, over 1kN difference between them. Tried placing them on the small reactors without mirroring and still had different thrusts. \u00A0How are the thrusts being figured for the engines. \u00A0If I removed the small reactors and stuck the jets on the large reactor they had identical, if huge, thrust (over 10kN each at 1.875m scale)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, rescaling with large reactor causes the indicated thrust to go way out of wack. Reloading the craft, or just exiting to space center and returning puts them back to where they should be, but they change again if rescaled any more. \u00A0If this a problem from tweakscale, or just stock not handling resizing very well?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"etheoma","CreatedById":69258,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T09:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving a problem with the charged particle electric generator, it will expand back to 2.5m when I quick load or revert flight which the revert flight isn\u0027t that bad because I can always revert to SPH or VAB.

I agree with your analisis in general. Fusion reactors indeed are too Power dence for the space they occupy. Originaly, KSPI Fusion was positioned as a superior engine above, fission reactors, but in reality this is not the case. The big advantage of Fusion Power is their ability to efficiently generate charged particle with relatively little to no radiactive waste with low resource cost. When it comes to raw power, fission power is potentialy much stronger due to the higher power densities. Fortunatly change is in the air, CTT now allows more technodes for Nuclear technology. This is great as it allows me the differntiate fission and fusion technology better. As one of the first steps, I intend to decreate the mass and power of the magnetic confiement fusion reactor, thereby reduce their power density.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-08T10:55:29Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2016 10:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ss8913","CreatedById":94747,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T10:55:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222399037\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022100190\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454924849\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022117389\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, FreeThinker said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI already know why this is a problem.
