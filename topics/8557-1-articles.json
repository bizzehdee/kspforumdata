After several attempts to land on Mun and failing, I finally made a landing but I really wanted to make some kind of base. So I designed many different ships until I came up with one that will look long and have a lot of fuel on landing. So on the first test of my new shuttle, I landed safely on Mun so I slowly lay it down and It looked almost like a base. I then launched a second, and with great difficulty I managed to land it within around 10 feet from the first (Which I was pretty proud of \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) and then slowly lay it down beside it. But only to find the first shuttle had lost its engine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E. lol but at-least the second was fine, but may not have enough fuel to make it back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you guys please post any suggestions on how to make it look better or any ship structures you would recommend? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think this base type structure is looking cool and thought I would share.
