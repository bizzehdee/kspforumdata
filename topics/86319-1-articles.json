This is a ~7% buff to the LV-T30, 15% for the LV-T45, ~31.5% for the aero\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-LV-T45 is more competetive... its currently got a high price to pay for 1 degree gimballing, this buff of 30 kN should help\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Aerospike should have its ISP nerfed to a max of 370 instead of 390 - so similar TWR, similar ISP to the other \u0022large\u0022 1.25m engines, but with better atmospheric performance (otherwise in space, same ISP, slightly worse TWR or same TWR but no gimballing) - this ISP nerf is the price for the thrust buff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-LV-909... weight decreased 10% to .45\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tiny engines and their tanks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Nobody uses these smaller tanks because their mass ratio is so bad - make them the same 9:1 ratio as all the other liquid fuel tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The LV-1/LV-1R engines... bad ISP \u002B bad tankage ratio of the tiny tanks \u002B OPd ion engine = why bother with this engine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-In combination with the 9:1 tankage ratio change, I think these engines should have their ISP increased to at least 320, and thier TWR to at least 25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is the 48-7s... It dominates the mass optimal charts... its in the interest of gameplay to nerf it, so that people don\u0027t build high part count monsters that melt their computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say nerf its thrust down to 25...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand there is the radial counterpart... the 24-77... worse TWR, worse ISP - buf its ISP to the same as the 48-7s, or buf its TWR to be the same, or some combination of the two. I suggest 22 kN thrust, 290-320 ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly.. the mk55 radial engine... poor ISP, poor TWR... Its just terribad... I\u0027ve never seen a good use for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fine with radial engines being a bit worse than inlines, due to their ease of placement, but the mk55 takes it too far\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d give it the same ISP curve and TWR as the rapier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
