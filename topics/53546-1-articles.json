We\u0027d be so better off if we could make energy from nothing.\u0022 So I\u0027d start my mad scientist meddling by removing the conservation of energy. I then realized that since life evolved in a world with the CoE, that many animals would have evolved to utilize free energy rather than playing around in the vicious food chain that we have now. You wouldn\u0027t even need food for energy, but just for nutrients. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother piece of physics I\u0027d like to manipulate is the propagation of photons.

I mean, sure, if you are a predator, you need energy to chase your food, but if you didn\u0027t need food in the first place, there would be no need for chasing. The only way for life to persist, however, is by maintaining low entropy. Hence the self-replication, hence the need for food, and all the rest follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConservation of energy is one of these laws that\u0027s so fundamental, I\u0027d be really paranoid about messing with it. The only way I can see it being violated without everything falling apart is if time is periodic. Then, instead of energy, you\u0027d be dealing with quasienergy, which isn\u0027t strictly conserved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be interesting to mess with some constants. Speed of light, plank\u0027s constant, etc. I\u0027m sure there is a way to adjust these to get some interesting macroscopic effects without all of the nuclear physics and chemistry falling apart. It\u0027s just not something that you want to be able to get wrong. Oops, you\u0027ve tweaked the strong interaction constant, and now neutrons are slightly lighter than protons.
