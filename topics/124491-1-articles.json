If you could design the craft, then \u0022test\u0022 it in a facility that would research the design, one could test the design in a wind tunnel (for aerodynamics and control surfaces), then do a mock-up to test the control group settings, then maybe a flight simulator to train the pilots. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this might be a neat idea for someone to mod, but the problem is that I\u0027m not sure how it would impact the gameplay.
