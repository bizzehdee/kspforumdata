I own it on Steam already, and I fully intend to re-purchase it if/when the issue is resolved, but this port should have never made it through certification. The corruption issue was the straw that broke the camel\u0027s back, but there were other bugs too like frequent crashing, the lack of optimization, or occasional inability to edit maneuver nodes. I\u0027m hoping that questions will be asked, and issues addressed.
