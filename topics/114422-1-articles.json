Of course I\u0027m on Linux x64.\n\nDoes the load time deter you from just firing up the game for a shorter session sometimes ? I love the game, but often I catch myself not wanting to play just because it won\u0027t be worth it to start the game for 30 minutes or so. \n\nIf there is ONE thing that I\u0027d really want improved in KSP it is the overall performance of the game (Load times and frame rate drop at increased complexity). Of course,as everyone I\u0027m hoping on Unity5 regarding this issue, but is there any statement on SQUADS behalf that they see a possibility for bigger improvements in performance (especially load times) apart from that ?"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T07:20:01Z","Content":"1 Min 5 Sec\n\nMods: 400 MB including the stock parts (Toobar, BetterBouyo, CrowdSorucedScience, KAS, KIS, KerbalAlarmclock, KER, Mechjeb, ModFlightInt, RCSBuildaid, SCANSAT, ScienceAlert, Squad, StockBugfixModules, WaypointManager)\n\nSystem: Win7 64 bit (but running 32 bit, opengl)\n\nCPU: [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) Ghz 3.30 Ghz \u003C- No idea why that has two frequencies\n\nGPU: Radeon R280x\n\nMemory: 10 GB\n\nEdit: This is a 4.5 years old \u0022sensible budget\u0022 gaming PC (I think \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC550-600 at the time).
