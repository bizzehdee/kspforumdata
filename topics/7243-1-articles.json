Using only stock parts myself, I found the stock repository very useful. I would be grateful if this design could be added so others can have as much fun as I do with it. It has very high thrust to weight and is good for getting somewhere fast! T/W could be improved using non gimballing engine if you really want it, but I like having more response, also the concept for this design is that it is modular, with the gimballing engine the amount of control you have does not decrease with added modules. Tanks are in pairs, with fuel lines to the next pair. I always launch at full thrust, so at launch you can expect it to be raining fuel tanks on the space center. The design was inspired by rockets such as the Falcon 9 heavy, I was interested in the advantages it\\\u0027s configuration gives (fuel crossfeed of common cores; lower cost due to economy of scale, efficiency of not having to carry engines doing no work etc.) and I took the concept to the extreme.

About 1 per second at launch on my underpowered laptop DX. I have seen your Pepperpot design, I started off with something similar and added another layer to it. When I got bored of that, I decided to add yet another layer. It took me a while, the VAB gets very slow and my mousepad doesen\\\u0027t help. I\\\u0027m also something of a perfectionist, trying to get all the tanks at the same level, down to the same pixel. I\\\u0027m not entirely happy with it, I think some of them are out, but I didn\\\u0027t feel like going to all the trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have many versions; 7 tanks like your Pepperpot, 19 tanks (add another layer), 37 tanks like this one. I have another where I started with a 19 tank base and added two tanks to each module, giving three tanks per module. I then added winglets to the middle stages of this and tried a few mun landings. One trick I like to do with the modular 4 is to max it vertically til 70km, then turn 90 degrees until the apoapsis reaches munar orbit shut the engines off, and you will get caught by the mun . It\\\u0027s a quick way to get there. I have an \u0027rcs return\u0027 version of the \u0027modular 4\u0027, used to test returning from the mun rcs style. Any changes to the last stage deletes a few fuel lines, though, and it takes ages to re-plumb all the layers correctly. I\\\u0027m slowly working on a 4 or 5 tank per module version of the modular 4, that should have a massive delta-V capability \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Takes ages, would be cool if someone could make it for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Daisychain fuel system sounds good, I think I\\\u0027ll use that from now on \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-01T10:27:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\\\u0027re welcome mate \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to be a sweet spot with power to weight ratio, 3 fuel tanks to 1 engine gets you about the right speed for an efficient ascent, the max the gimballed engine seems able to lift is 6 though, it\\\u0027s 7 for the bigger engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know fuel economy isn\\\u0027t a concern of ships like this, but if you pitch over at about 12k to 45 degrees, you get a ballistic trajectory that can save you a bit of fuel, it\\\u0027s supposedly how you get the best range from stuff like cannons but rockets need to get above the thickest part of the air first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know how bad the VAB can be, and I wish there was an easy way to line things up vertically, if your ship hasn\\\u0027t got enough engines on the ground some snap off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
