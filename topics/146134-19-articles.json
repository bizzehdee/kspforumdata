Bigger studios have released more polished and functional games that cost way less. KSP is competing with a lot of other AAA games at that price. The amount of content in game feels really small at that price, especially without access to mods. The game generally feels unfinished on console. I can\u0027t speak to the PC version. But to find out it has been in development for so long is very concerning.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne would think that with NASA and SpaceX interested, and with the support of at least a million Steam users on PC, they could\u00A0really have\u00A0this game figured out by now. It seems like there are a lot of people who are very interested in this game\u0027s potential for learning, teaching, fun, and exploration in space, but that the games development has crawled along, with the released\u00A0product looking pretty unfinished, and unplayable for some. I have others games on early access and I know what an unfinished game looks like, and what game development from small companies who\u00A0communicate\u00A0with their customers looks like. So far what KSP on console looks like is an early access game in an early stage of development, with a company that doesn\u0027t want to communicate with it\u0027s customers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not sure if I will go back to KSP whenever it is they release an update. At the rate they are going, it has a couple more years to go before it\u0027s done in my eyes. It\u0027s really frustrating because the idea of the game is so good.\u00A0It could have\u00A0had a story or career mode that was actually good, and that actually taught you about science. And why isn\u0027t there a mode where you can\u00A0replicate\u00A0actual space missions? I guess you can build something that kind of looks like a Soyuz with stock parts and role play, but I can\u0027t figure out why the real thing\u00A0isn\u0027t in the actual game when it could have been. I think along with \u0022why is this game still on the marketplace?\u0022, we should be asking ourselves why this game isn\u0027t actually better than it is, given the rave reviews on PC and support from the community.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-04T00:14:11Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2016 12:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by chimpbone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-04T01:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222741286\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146134\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472947818\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167310\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chimpbone\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, chimpbone said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...] we should be asking ourselves why this game isn\u0027t actually better than it is, given the rave reviews on PC and support from the community.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommunities tend to be very one-sided, usually blinded to some extent love for the subject at hand and faith in the developer. The vocal few also tend to outweigh the quiet masses in the support. As for reviews, they rarely spend enough time with\u00A0a game to learn its idiosyncrasies to the level an actual player will experience. Reviews are often more first impression than anything else. It doesn\u0027t help that probably a lot of reviewers come from a generation when space exploration was a still a thing (the Space Shuttle debuted in the 80\u0027s, after all.) Rose-tinted viewpoints, perhaps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a LOT I can say about KSP, both good and bad. I honestly would love to do a write-up on my opinion of KSP, but frankly it\u0027d be too long. (It would\u00A0give me a moment to rant about what I think are horrible trends in general game and software development as well.) In a nutshell, I think KSP\u0027s problems are a mix of current game industry trends when it comes to development and release, the game\u0027s ambitions, the lack of experience from SQUAD, and probably questionable (if not outright bad) decision made during development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is a fun simulator, but a crappy game. SQUAD now has more manpower on-hand that seem to have better programming experience (or so it seems from the mods they make/maintain). For now I have the faith and patience to see KSP improve. I don\u0027t think it should\u0027ve been released to full v1.0 status in the state it was, but what\u0027s done is done. SQUAD now has the task to live up to the promises they made/make. Will it happen? I hope so. Will it happen soon? Probably not. Everything takes time. Complicating matters is\u00A0SQUAD\u00A0trying to change the bath water without tossing the baby out. (Though I sorta wish they would to some extent... Sometimes it\u0027s better to get a new ship than patch the holes in the current one.) The fact SQUAD is actually refactoring the code is something I can find faith in for now. (Though I do question the development and release process since you usually don\u0027t see an entire code rewrite as an \u0022update/patch\u0022. Hence why I said I think KSP shouldn\u0027t have been released when it was.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have NO idea what they were thinking when they decided on a console release, however,\u00A0for many reasons. The dominant one is what the state of the was at the time. When the game was iffy in a \u0022stable\u0022 release on it\u0027s original platform(s), you don\u0027t try to do a port of it. Especially on consoles where post-release patching is less tolerated. I expect console releases to work, no if\u0027s, and\u0027s, or but\u0027s. Patches should be only for ancillary things, not functionality fixes. In particular game-breaking bugs. SQUAD pulled the trigger and committed, though. I don\u0027t have KSP on console (because to me, it\u0027s really a computer game; I prefer my games on the platform it was designed and intended for initially unless the porting process was VERY good), but expect them to support console as best they can. It\u0027s an obligation, especially if they want to keep the trust of the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t like the fact that some software I buy are in ongoing development (I prefer to buy my products in a complete, finished, functional state), but it\u0027s a bit better than getting a crap product with no support after the fact at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... And I\u0027m getting tired of\u00A0this. I do apologize if there are any mistakes or whatnot in the above text. I kinda stopped self-editing because I was getting tired of typing. My thoughts were also starting to ramble. No offense intended nor is this directed at anyone in particular (save for the first paragraph as a reply).
