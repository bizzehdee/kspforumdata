It seems that the black area is on the sky.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAreas stay fixed if i move views or move the camera. They seems going bigger when more sky area is viewed during view change (with V key) and then they don\u0027t turn back.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAreas are under the game\u0027s UI. UI stay visible and work fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAreas are visible only during the fly. I never see them in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or Map view. I never see them in tutorials.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf during the fly i go to map view areas disappear. When i come back to fly they come back again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI never seen this in KSP2-0.1.0.0.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn KSP2-0.1.1.0 a similar problem occurred occasionally but i could fix setting all \u0022low\u0022 graphic setup and then back to medium. Now this solution don\u0027t work anymore.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI tried to remove settings and start with a fresh install but it didn\u0027t work.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI tried to change resolution and window size, full screen etc but it didn\u0027t work.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI tried to put all graphical settings to low in one by one step but i didn\u0027t find anything that make black areas disappear.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGame work great in rest of screen. Changing graphical settings work and i can see changes in the textures, clouds, shadows, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running the game on Windows 11\u00A0 - 22H2 build 22621.1555 on ARM64.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe machine is a virtualization on Parallels 18 that emulates 4 CPU, 8GB of ram and 4 GB of video memory.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe real machine is a MacBook with Apple Silicon.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe game seems to run fine except for this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any suggestion to fix this?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ibb.co/gtKT3fb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScreen Capture with the problem\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wetzelrad","CreatedById":228424,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-19T13:19:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething about Parallels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022228030\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4658430274\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/215481-blackness-over-the-ksc-with-new-patch/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:194px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022227911\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5473465875\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/215229-odd-visual-artifacts/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n"}]}
