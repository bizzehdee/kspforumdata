Given that I\u0027ve only ever dabbled in C\u002B\u002B and a little bit of config file editing, this may be a time consuming and difficult process that I may end up abandoning.....BUT Imma try anyway...Wish me luck!\n\nEdit: So I was playing around with adding plumes before I try to tackle NovaPunch and i managed to insert a few different plumes (one at a time) into the XE101 engine from the Instell mod and got each one working, so that\u0027s good, but module manager would generate a single error pointing to the compatibility config in the RealPlume-Stock Configs folder. The error doesn\u0027t seem to have any noticeable effects. Oh, and I guess you could say I cheated a bit with the plumes I made, but the configs i put into the Instell engine were pre-made ones for the stock squad engines that i just edited a little. Have to start somewhere when you\u0027re a coding noob!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T05:24:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 05:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by roxedboxer**\n  \nThe voices told me to or they\u0027d revoke my sock privileges..."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T00:27:46Z","Content":"Would it be possible to give SRB\u0027s a realistic burn out effect?
