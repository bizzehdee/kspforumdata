I like to use two stages for ascent. Both with about 4800m/s of delta-v (note that for the upper stage I use the vacuum number) I usually end up with ~100-500 delta-v to do a few small orbital maneuvers and to de-orbit depending on my launch direction. I find that I like my bottom stages to have an SLT of 1.3. My upper stage can get away with as little as .75 TWR. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Launching I fly straight up till my speed gets to about 100km/s then I pitch 2-3 degrees (halfway to the first mark on the navball) Sometimes that is enough and my rocket follows the prograde marker till it gets to 45 degrees all on its own, but if it is not at the first mark by the time I get to 8kms high I manually adjust it so that I hit the 45 degrees mark at about 1000km/s speed and 35km in altitude from there I wait till my altitude gets to about 60kms (doesn\u0027t take long) Since I am mostly out of atmosphere at this point I don\u0027t need to worry much about flipping. I pitch all the way down to near zero degrees and wait until my time until apoapsis gets to about 10. I pitch up to control it and slowly work my way back down to zero degrees as my fuel burns and my TWR gets higher. I have found that if you pass the apoapsis about 15 seconds before you need to stop your burn you can mitigate the big jump that happens at the end of the burn and achieve nearly circular orbits directly from launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I do not know if this is the best way but it is close and its what I have picked up from playing RO. Also, you can use the thrust plate adapter to cluster multiiple smaller engines instead of a single large one and not have to use fins.( but I see you are using 17 engines. that is alot of processing and control authority. What are you launching that is so heavy?
