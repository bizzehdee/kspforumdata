It\u0027s going to be using a lot of the infrastructure that\u0027s been set up for Scott Manley\u0027s Runway Project but we\u0027re going to be, hopefully, setting up some infrastructure down the line for AI-run competitions so that at any time somebody could hop onto a stream and watch some entertaining BDAc dogfights. Add in some player/viewer interaction after the style of Salty Bets and that\u0027s the goal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from the above, there will be regularly run manual tournaments (Live Tournaments) up until and after the backend and support are there for the rest of the system.
