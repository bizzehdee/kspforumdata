You need to use an altered orbit to get within 5km, 10 tops. Make sure you set him as the target from the map screen and when you do you get the pink vector icons. When you get within range through orbiting, you can then make a burn straight toward him by pulling your prograde toward the pink circle marker (or if your going too fast, push your retrograde toward the opposite pink marker)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you approach the 200meter mark, flip the ship and slow down by burning against the green crosshair, this will eliminate relative velocity to the target. (Make sure the Navball is in \u0022Target\u0022 mode). Also be carefull not to burn directly against the kerbal, though they are for the most part fireproof, it will push him into another orbit, or out of orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor more details check out this guide here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92480-Illustrated-Tutorial-for-Orbital-Rendezvous\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92480-Illustrated-Tutorial-for-Orbital-Rendezvous\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-05T18:03:16Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2015 06:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T18:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E47km is a long shot, but if you have a lot of fuel it can be done.
