If you post a big image or several images in one post, you also need to put SPOILER tags around them to hide them until the button is pushed:\n\n[spoiler][img=http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/3893/tiberdynesig2.png][/spoiler]\n\nLooks like this: \n\n\u003E ![tiberdynesig2.png](http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/3893/tiberdynesig2.png)\n\nThe other method is attaching the image directly to your post, but doing it that way is discouraged in most cases; To do it, you click on \u0027Attachments and other options\u0027 and use the browse button to select your image; it will be attached to your post as a thumbnail after you click post.
