Whenever you use unitScalar anything in an intake\u0027s right-click ui becomes useless. Both area and unitScalar in those intakes have been multiplied/divided by the same number, which is the mass of the part divided by 0.01.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because intake drag is also multiplied by mass, and so if you want a part that does not weigh 0.01 to have an intake, you must set its intake size to you desired values, and then divide the size by the part\u0027s mass / 0.01, and multiply unitScalar by the part\u0027s mass / 0.01.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of the ramp intakes, the mass of the parts is 0.4, thus the ratio is 40.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Earea 0.01 / 40 = 0.00025.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EunitScalar 0.2(the default) * 40 = 8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus you can have an intake that does not mass 0.01 while still providing the \u0027correct\u0027 amount of drag per intake area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside, as I said, if that the drag and flow values shown in the UI panel are useless. Not that they ever were particularly informative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. This is also why the default AirScoop does 10x as much drag as it should. It weighs 0.1 instead of 0.01, and uses no unitScalar trickery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as to why all this would result in too much drag in FAR, I do not know, but I do know this: Its not an issue with the B9 intakes. Its an issue with FAR. If you actually want it fixed, tell ferram4 about it, because if you just add a 0 to the intake area, you know have intake that\u0027s 1/10th the size it should be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-05T22:52:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2013 10:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Taverius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Disfunctional_Rockets_INC","CreatedById":1649,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T22:16:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this has been asked before Bac9 (I couldn\u0027t find anything with the search function), but do you have any plans to make any higher visibility cockpits like what some millitary aircraft have (mostly fighters)?
