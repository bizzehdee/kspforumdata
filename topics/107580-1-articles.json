I think KSP thinks the chute inside (occluded) in another part. Is that possibly what happened?"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:07:37Z","Content":"I had this happen when the radial chute was just touching the outside of a service module. It seems that the game thought the chute was inside the service module and, therefore, stowed. Open the service module doors and the chute will deploy."},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo Kerbonaut","CreatedById":65299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T06:06:49Z","Content":"There is indeed a service module beneath the chutes, but the chutes themselves are mounted on the MK1. I replaced them just a little higher and now they\u0027re working fine. \n\nGood to know for rocket future builds."},{"CreatedByName":"QPDO","CreatedById":104760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T11:24:16Z","Content":"Yeah the Service Module is the culprit.
