I\u0027ll give some more thoughts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, as far as scanners go. I don\u0027t mind a 2.5m scanner, so long as it is WORTH 2.5m. For Kethane, we have a radial and 1.25m scanner. For EL, we have the radial tiny thing and the monster 2.5m scanner. I think having something inbetween would go well. Additionally, I think the basic scanner should be usable from LKO - Maybe put it up to an 80-85km max range. It\u0027s still a lot tighter than the Kethane scanner, but it\u0027s a lot easier to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, for the two parts that are the most \u0022problematic\u0022 - The Smelter and (In my opinion at least) the rocket parts factory. I think it\u0027s less of an issue of size as it is of usability. The smelter is big and ugly and, more importantly, it\u0027s a hex. Hexes are hard to work with when you\u0027re doing radial things. Four landing legs ends up with two of them \u0022hovering\u0022 over the side. This makes them somewhat difficult to build around. I think a \u0022Less is more\u0022 approach here is also better - While there\u0027s two sizes, I don\u0027t think two sizes are entirely needed. If you want more capacity, use two. Even more, use three. It\u0027s the standard way things are used in KSP. For the rocket parts factory, it\u0027s a bit of the same thing as the smelter. Yes, it looks a hell of a lot better than some of the other parts that EL has, but it\u0027s also hard to build around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue I have with EL is the seemingly absurd amount of steps I need to do to make a rocket. I need to mine ore. I need to smelt ore into metal. I neat to assemble metal into rocket parts. THEN I can build the rocket with said rocket parts. While I\u0027m not against those steps, I would like to see more done with that. Do more things with ore, maybe. Do more things with metal. At the moment I\u0027m not sure what, but it\u0027s very linear and strikes me as overly complex for what it does. I don\u0027t think you\u0027d end up with a lot of people complaining if you made a smelter/factory combination machine that ate Ore and spat out Rocket Parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last thing I\u0027d like to touch on is mostly nitpicking.
