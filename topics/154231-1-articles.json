many more chutes on Duna compared to Kerbin\u0022 is... \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eno\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E extra parachutes.\u00A0 In fact, I usually put \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efewer\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E chutes on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRationale?\u00A0 It comes down to the diminishing-returns thing that folks have already alluded to:\u00A0 I use only a bare minimum of chutes on Duna, and then do a powered landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy?\u00A0 Because getting the terminal velocity down to, say, ~30-40 m/s requires only a very tiny bare minimum of parachutes.\u00A0 So, why bother putting on more?\u00A0 Slowing just 30-40 m/s right at landing time, using engines, takes only a tiny amount of fuel, and the chutes needed to slow much more than 30-40 m/s will almost certainly weigh more than the fuel expended.\u00A0 So I don\u0027t bother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy don\u0027t I do this on Kerbin, too?\u00A0 Well, aside from chutes being much more effective on Kerbin, there\u0027s also the matter that my landing vehicles on Kerbin very often don\u0027t have engines on them (or, if they do, they\u0027re really low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E vac engines that wouldn\u0027t help\u00A0 much with a Kerbin landing).\u00A0 So I need to land on chutes alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T19:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022

reducing the total delta-v requirements of landing on Duna, but to land on \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E chutes would require so many chutes that the mass of them would offset the delta-v advantage gained by using them. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrogue chutes have been mentioned as a good idea and I fully endorse them. \u00A0The thin atmosphere will not slow your craft nearly as much as Kerbin, and if you do not do something to slow down before deploying the main chutes you will be going too fast for them to safely deploy before you hit the surface. \u00A0They will be a big help. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut like Snark said, you should do a semi-powered landing. \u00A0Let the chutes slow you, then use an engine on low-throttle to slow the descent before touchdown. \u00A0Now, this landing does not require much power, so you can get away with some tiny engines and only a little fuel. \u00A0I often use these same engines to conduct my de-orbital burn, especially if I am landing a rover or the like. \u00A0Since the trip is one-way, I do not have to worry about having enough fuel to get back to orbit.
