I know there are currently some missions planned that will send a rover to mars or some local asteroids; and they plan to launch some samples back to earth orbit where they can be recovered and studied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a big deal, because while you can send lab equipment to a place on a rover, it\u0027s out of date when it get\u0027s there. And there are some pieces of equipment that simply can\u0027t fit on a rover, or are too fragile to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving the samples here on earth makes studying them easier. We have a much better understanding of the moon, because of moon rocks that have been brought back to earth, then we ever got from probes and rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T06:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei find that while sample return nets you more science, the fact that you can just keep transmitting all the science back you can actually get more science with one ship, than a few sample return missions, even if you intend to return the ship to kerbin. i wish i could just collect multiple samples and bring them all back in one pass. the fact you can only return one sample and a couple reports at a time really limits sample return missions. this doesn\u0027t even seem remotely realistic. with apollo you pretty much filled the capsule with rocks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axon","CreatedById":55621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T08:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a similar idea. Rather than even sending them back to Kerbin, why not have the lab be capable of doing the science right where it\u0027s at with the cost of heavy electricity usage, being massive, and requiring a Kerbal to be present to perform the science (perhaps making a celestial body with this station on it be a capable of recovery?).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
