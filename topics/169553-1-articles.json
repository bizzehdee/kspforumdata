The first of these projects, the K-1 involved the use of balloons, geese, and on one memorable occasions, several coconuts. The second, aptly named K-2 was the first to try and use gunpowder to soar into the heavens. Unfortunately, as the ancient scrolls tell us, the test subjects failed in their ascension. This brings us to K-3, masterminded by Wernher von Kerbal, in which kerbals attempted to propel themselves to ever loftier heights.

Of course, once Val and Jeb saw the specifications, the mission parameters were changed to put the engine in it\u0027s paces. Jeb even had a reasonable argument, \u0022We need to test it in vacuum! If we\u0027re going to go to the Mun, and maybe even beyond, we need to know what these engines can do in space. For all we know, space is like a giant black pudding.\u0022 On this (dubious) train of thought, the V2-LD was redesigned and lengthened to exceed the 70km mark, the point where Werner believed that the atmosphere ended, and space actually begun.

By doing so, a craft\u0027s orbit would be adjusted so that it would safely return to Kerbin without a course correction burn in the ideal circumstance.

Solar intercepts are already annoyingly difficult, and the mun launched it\u0027s in a really awkward orbit to reach, I essentially got the full 500dV boost from the mun, and it was already close to escape velocity due to the earlier failure to the point Freeballer\u0027s orbit could actually intercept Eve if it wasn\u0027t for the phase angle. I\u0027m likely going to have to manually work out the math to determine how to even get an intercept with it without a massive amount of overdesign.

I\u0027m eyeing a two probe mission to Duna to at least pay for the former, but the orbits desired are annoying awkward compared to the intercept angle I\u0027ll have at the next launch window (basically a 90 and 270 degree u-turn; Ike can sometimes be used to help there but it\u0027s going to be irritating no matter what, alternatively brake into an elliptical orbit and flip it, but again, Ike causes issues here).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next trick is then determining if I\u0027m sending a manned mission or not; one of the quirks of Kerbalism is part failures are a thing, and I\u0027ve already had a few with the orbiting probes.

I\u0027m *still* not sure why it vaporized; re-entry heating is at 100%. As such, Stellar Wind was redesigned to be an orbiter/lander combo. Before we get into the specifics, let\u0027s go over mission objectives. As far as I understand Kerbalism, my current comm setup SHOULD work to Eve and Duna, as well as Dres for part of it\u0027s orbit; Jeb\u0027s capsule just passed perihelion, and still has a downlink to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with the high-gain antenna. If it turns out that I loose radio contact with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, the mission will ditch the lander and instead be a high-speed flyby.

That was (eventually) fixed by removing the probes from the fairing, welding a stack seperator between them, and then bolting a decoupler to the bottom the fairing. That fixed noodly rocket, Stellar then decided to develop a slight vaporization issue as it passed Max-Q once dumping the strap-on boosters.

Originally, the plan was to stay on Endurance until life support was near exhaustion and then return to Kerbin; after this mishap, Gene was decided that Stellar Wind would hold and a rescue mission would be rolled to the pad in it\u0027s place when Bill goes to deorbit. As such, it would be possible to rapidly launch a rescue mission to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E if something went wrong. Longshot grumbled, but even they were forced to admit a life was more important than a probe. If a rescue was NOT needed, Stellar Wind would only be a day behind it\u0027s launch schedule. Milestone station would be left with 26 days left of supplies, to be used for safe harbor until a larger station would be launched and this one deorbited.

Up until this point, CCD had more or less idled in the\u00A0 background with no truly notable missions, and primarily lead and operated Monitor and Gus Kerman. With the new Stellar LV though, CCD was willing to allow other projects to piggyback on their launches for helping to pay the bills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few days ago, the brass at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E got a rather strongly worded request from two separate companies to rescue employees in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E! Through deep magic, two separate companies had managed to launch kerbals into space with no method of safely returning them to Kerba Ferra. After working out the mission parameters, a new type of rescue capsule, based around the up-to-this-point disused Mk1. Lander was designed. Futhermore, an update to the guidance computers would allow full automated launches through a utility called Gravity Turn Redux. As such, two of the Rescue Mk1. pods were loaded. Longshot, seeing an opportunity pitched in to become a secondary payload; an open CMD mission requested a new probe be sent to two different Lunar Orbits, and they still had the goal of successfully returning from munar orbit. As such, the triple payload stack was assembled, and mounted to a Stellar LV. Unfortunately, the boffins under Linus\u0027s PR department forgot to take a picture of the craft on the ground, so these artistic renditions will have to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220vRY3Wm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/0vRY3Wm.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a slightly shaky launch to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, the triple-stacked launcher settled into an 80x75 orbit.

What wasn\u0027t properly accounted was that a kerbal actively using life support put a heavy drain on the battery packs, and that, combined with the probe core (which in Kerbalism you can\u0027t disable) caused the power rates to go negative. A workaround was quickly devised. By keeping Natalan on EVA, the battery packs would recharge off the solar cells, and then the pressurization system disabled.

A probe core had been installed to allow this. As planned, the Stellar LV did infact enter orbit, and detached its final payload.

I eventually determined to keep the plane flyable, I had to come in at 1/3rd throttle; a problem I didn\u0027t have with nearly full tanks or empty ones when I tested.\u00A0Once I figured out a slight bug with NavUtils (hint: don\u0027t have a waypoint called \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E 09), it only took three attempts to stick the landing on 27 mostly due to my in-familiarity with during a pure ILS mod (I couldn\u0027t see the runway until I was literially ontop of it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022G7joedB.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/G7joedB.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be blunt, I\u0027m not sure how best to handle this. Hard mode does allow F5/F9, so technically, I haven\u0027t violated the rules that KSP sets, but I also don\u0027t think I\u0027m willing to risk any planes (space or otherwise) without some leyway; I\u0027m not Scott Manley :). I also technically completed all the contract aside from hitting recover before I save/reloaded so there\u0027s that. Ultimately, this thread is for entertainment; I\u0027m not trying to prove anything, so if people want to see pretty scatterer screenshots and allow me to F5/F9 on planes, they\u0027ll continue. Otherwise we\u0027ll be a rocket based program for the most part. I could also allow quicksaving to in-atmosphere flight with airplanes; i.e., if I\u0027m flying a plane on Duna, I can F5/F9 and simulate it freely with hyperedit. I\u0027ll leave no revert for everything else because the failures are funny to look at in hindsight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also added a parashoot mod so I could have ditched (although in this case, I got determined to get the landing in the night despite teh cheating).

The problem was it\u0027s unstable landing with nothing short of full tanks or empty tanks. After a LOT of additional testing, I eventually worked out the root cause to be related to the landing gear and a bad interaction with Atmospheric Autopilot; specifically, I had steering on the front enabled with steering enabled. This was causing a hell of a lot of twitchiness when I had touchdown; atmospheric autopilot would try to correct to the original heading and *SPIN*. Landing with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on the other hand was quite a bit more stable. This might be because I haven\u0027t used AA in 1.3; I don\u0027t remember having the issue in 1.2. The forward trust actually was helping keeping the gear going; I couldn\u0027t see it in the dark but I suspect a lot of the landing crashes were due to landing and then flipping over; when I reproduced the flights during the day, that\u0027s what typically happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gear was also angled to provide a slight pitchup; this works wonders for getting off the runway, but the gear being offset made it quite a bit squarely at about 80 m/s. A brief redesign got it stable at much slower landing speeds and I\u0027ve had a lot less issues (I lost the flaps and gave it spoilers since it\u0027s perfectly happy to fly, land and take off at flaps 0). I likely need to play with the friction sliders to see if I can get it to stick to the runway and not re-create Kerban Drift Program.\u00A0It looks like 1.3 changed the 1.2 wheel physics slightly (though to be fair, I\u0027ve had gear issues since 1.1 dropped). Flying with a keyboard also means control inputs are fairly heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, the actual landing was only with the gear landing lights.

On one level, she got it; the current capsules used by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E could only support one kerbal, and the Rescue Mk1 was still pending a redesign to allow multiman missions. With the advances in automous operation, there had been little need for pilots at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E; Bob was a scientist, he went to the mun because they needed to know if it was safe. Bill on the other hand was needed to prove the technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt hadn\u0027t been the first time she had been sidelined, but she was the only pilot left in the astronaut corps. It was at least a little lonely. As she watched construction of the Duna/Ike mission (still unnamed) in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, Bill walked up, \u0022There you are, been looking all over for you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal shrugged. Bill gave her a look, \u0022Still doing the broody thing, look, I get it. Anyway, was wondering if you wanted go flying?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flying?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, flying. You know, that thing we used to do.

Remember? Anyway, Gwendon from the old research team phoned me up asking for a favor. Needed a skilled pilot for a hop to the North Pole. I remember you boasting Skipper could go around the world and have fuel to spare. Figured a hop there and back should be no big deal. Let me know if you\u0027re interested.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal nodded, and wondered if this was Bill\u0027s idea of a prank. Still, with nothing to do, she made the walk out to the small hanger next to mission control. To Val, the runway and hanger had been something of an anamoly; in her entire time at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, no planes ever landed, and the buildings were essentially derelict. Flipping on the light breaker, there was a loud whine as the lamps lit up the room. Unexpectedly, instead of an empty hanger, something large and roughly planeshaped was sitting under a tarp. Grabbing one end, she pulled the entire thing clear to reveal a small sleak two person jet, with the nameplate of Skipper painted on the side. A orange and black flag was painted on the side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow confused, Val made her way onto the wing, shimmied herself into the copilot seat and then slid down the access hatch to the main cockpit. As she thumped into the seat, a cloud of dust sprang up. Coughing, Bill hadn\u0027t been kidding when he said this had been here for awhile. Some thumping under the chair found the master switch, and the consoles began to light up. The VOR was reporting a strong signal from \u0022KMA-01\u0022, her compass was dancing, and the ILS system was complaining on no signal from KMA-01 R09\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, so there\u0027s a jet here. Why did Bill think I knew about this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat answer revealed itself when a thick wad of papers was retrieved from the pouch directly behind her chair when she found the plane\u0027s airworthiness certificate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Civil Aviation Administration\u003Cbr\u003E\nVehicle Registation: N-X-8724D\u003Cbr\u003E\nClassification: Experimental Jet/STAL\u003Cbr\u003E\nRange: 4000 kilometers (estimated)\u003Cbr\u003E\nDate of Original Certification: 4/22/277\u003Cbr\u003E\nLast Recertification: 7/11/285\u003Cbr\u003E\nGood Until: 7/11/295\u003Cbr\u003E\nFiled by: Valentina Kerman\u003Cbr\u003E\nAirworthiness Inspection: Bill Kerman\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal blinked at the slightly yellow documentation. This was HER jet? She was about to dismiss this as an overly elaborate prank, but something about it seemed familiar. The flight log was even more confusing because it was in her own handwriting. The first entry had been (as the airworthiness certificate suggested) made nearly fifteen years prior, and merely listed a few test flights operating from a grassy field on the edge of continent. The notes suggested she had flown with Bill several times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe maintence log was much harder to read (due to the fact that the author had incredibly poor pensmanship), but Skipper had been rebuilt several times, either due to rough landings, or to improve its range and capabilities. The latest entry showed installation of an experimental radio landing guidance system in addition to the standard NDB/VORs. There was a (now expired) limited passenger transport certificate allowing her to operate as an airtaxi service. Later entries in the flight log showed one passenger and their destinations, mostly throughout the \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EInhabited\u003C/span\u003E Continent, and some sightseeing flights. The last few years though showed a lot of travel to and from a location only noted at KMA, and some choice comments about the issues with the site. The last entry was two and half years prior, a landing at KMA from Homestead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022KMA?\u0022, she shook her head. It didn\u0027t make sense, and she wanted to grill Bill for answers, but appearing crazy would get her off the roster so quickly it would cause observers whiplash. Instead, she would play along, and went to find Bill, who was eating a late lunch in the astronaut complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, you win.

My wish is your command.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal didn\u0027t even blink at the odd nickname. For the time being, she\u0027d keep her head down, and figure this out on her own terms. True to his word, the next morning, Skipper had been taxied to the start of the gravel strip. The pilot was exhausted, she had read through most of the manuals and documents she found stashed in the cockpit, and was reasonably sure she could fly her(?) jet.

The two jet turbines began to wine as she finished her preflight checklist. A brief discussion with Gene had approved this flight, though the mission was entirely unofficial. The control tower remained unmanned. Still, following best practices, she picked up her tuned the radio to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E frequencies,\u00A0\u0022Center Traffic, N8724D departing runway 09.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith no answer, Skipper began it\u0027s takeoff roll.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DScNtTU.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DScNtTU.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ff20QlK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Ff20QlK.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the thrust provided by the two Juno jet engines and fitting its STOL capabilities, Skipper popped into the air long before the end of the runway.

In addition, without orbiter to provide complete scansat telemetry, there was no way of knowing on WHAT they\u0027d be landing on; the orbital telescope had revealed vast oceans, and Leaf would likely sink if it hit them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, without an orbital satellite to relay from the low-gain antenna, there was no way to stay in contact with the probe. The on-board guidance computer could only hold an angle, and not properly align the probe towards the retrograde vector. The next mission to Eve wouldn\u0027t have a window for ages, and HighSpeed had given mission control pause before sending a payload on an extremely fast flyby for the orbit. Computer simulations showed however Leaf had a decent chance of surviving the re-entry unguided if it took a steep descent through the atmosphere; there was a brief window each day where Leaf\u0027s solar panels, the sun, and kerbin were all visible from Eve\u0027s surface.\u00A0Despite the lost of the Wind orbiter, a large amount of science had been successfully gathered, and advances in rocket technology would mean larger and better landers could get to Eve in the future. After much debate, Gene approached the Impact Crater plan, and Leaf\u0027s small Ant engine light up to adjust it\u0027s re-entry angle. Shortly before atmospheric entry, the descent engine was decoupled; Sir Issac Kerbin was once again in the driver\u0027s seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022y7Ue5FP.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/y7Ue5FP.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last signal from the probe was a weak databurst showing it was experiencing heavy g-forces, and then silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022X5KKVjo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/X5KKVjo.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnknown to mission command though, Leaf had actually survived.

I need to take some more screenshots for that, and then we\u0027re going to the mun. Minnus is technically doable with what I have, but the life support for 30 days for two kerbals is close to impossible with my launch weights, and I\u0027m not sending a manned mission without an engineer, and I really want a scientist since Minnus has a massive amount of science I haven\u0027t collected yet.\u00A0Since she\u0027s currently the focus character, I\u0027m likely not going to send Val it\u0027s going to spork the story if I manage to loose her.\u00A0It\u0027s just unfortunate pilots stop being very useful once you get probe cores; she was going to go before I gave up an Apollo style mission (which I had designed, just couldn\u0027t get it to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with enough fuel) and simply doing a direct ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s likely going to be Bob and one of the whitesuites I rescued. As the screenshot suggests, the bonuses from the last few contracts plus World\u0027s First for Eve gave me more than enough cash to upgrade R\u0026amp;D. The science also gave me the Twitch engine which replaced the thud\u0027s on the LM module I\u0027m testing; I wasn\u0027t happy with the margin since testing showed the mainsail was struggling to put the payload into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m considering Stellar Wind, despite the hiccups, a success as I got a massive amount of science and money out of that mission. If Leaf\u0027s comm antenna survives, I\u0027ll also get surface science out of it when the next probe heads to Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the bugfront, I have Base and Stations contract pack installed, but its being glitchy. I may remove it, or edit it somewhat to get it working. I\u0027m also going to have to hyperedit a commsat to Eve orbit. Right now, Kerbalism is generating spam every time Leaf looses solar power and kicking me out of timewarp (so once every three ingame days) which is very annoying. You can configure a craft\u0027s notifications, but they need to controllable to do so. I tried to edit persistant, but couldn\u0027t figure out what was needed to fix the problem. Looking long-term, I just managed to unlock the greenhouse, and a few of the other of the life support items, so I\u0027m likely going to launch a long-duration mission to the Mun (I may also launch a station, but I\u0027ve never gotten much mileage out of a mun station; Minnus, due to travel times and low velocity needed to orbit/deorbit is different). The Mun has the most anomalies of any planet beside Kerbin, so long term research in finding and exploring them will be interesting. I\u0027m not sure if the first mun mission is going to check out the anomaly I already found though. I think it\u0027s the armstrong memorial but I haven\u0027t checked the wiki.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also not sure if SCANsat will find the green monoliths; my rough plan is for every green monolith I find, I\u0027ll let myself add another part pack or if I dump a crapton of science. I dislike CTT for the sheer amount of grind it has, but I don\u0027t want science to stop being useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong-term, we\u0027ll start exploring Minnus, and then probably a manned flyby to Eve or Moho. I\u0027ve got the better comm antennas, so Dres is now an option for probes, as is Jool for close approaches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I forgot to note that I can\u0027t seem to arm parachutes traditionally in this save. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s a Kerbalism tweak, or some mod broke them. RealShoot lets me arm them through staging which is how Leaf landed. A brief look through Kerbalism\u0027s thread doesn\u0027t bring this up at all nor did I see anything in the source code that removes this function, so I\u0027m going with glitch (it seems a rather silly thing to remove).\u00A0 I also noted that g-forces weren\u0027t enabled since the probe survived a 15G deceleration. That\u0027s been corrected.

Thumpers or kickbacks can get the payload going and give a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0026lt;1 all the way to orbit.The problem with the Poodle is it rather low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, and thus it can actually be a net negative because it may take too long to get out of the atmosphere. Basically, to actually get to orbit for 3400 m/s, you need to be blitzing through atmo, and then immediately circularize; Gravity Turn\u0027s stats page is actually quite enlightening and shows you how much you lost in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E because you hadn\u0027t reached \u002B70, or conversely, how much you lost because your ascent trajectory was too steep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-22T12:39:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2018 12:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by NCommander\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha 360","CreatedById":166007,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-22T15:42:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat to know.

There was a fear that she had simply snapped, an all too reasonable conclusion to draw. That being said, when looking at the circumstantial evidence around her, she couldn\u0027t help but think that there was something greater afoot. Her discussions with Neldum and Natalan only reinforced this belief. At the moment though, Val was dealing with a distinct lack of hard evidence. Digging through her storage locker for the umpeth time, a familiar feeling of frustration began to set in. Val unfortunately had never taken much stock in material possessions. Beside Skipper\u0027s airworthiness and maintenance documents, the only things she had were a few handwritten letters, her original pilot certificate, and a photo of her and Bill at what she was assumed was \u0027Homestead\u0027 with Skipper in the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe picture was perhaps the most damning thing of all. As far as she could remember, she had met Bill at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, but the evidence showed that they had known each other for far longer. As things stood, her own memories of her life were even suspect at this point. What she could remember, and objectively prove was that she was a bush pilot flying across Kerbin on a near daily basis. Skipper had obviously been her plane, but she didn\u0027t remember it specifically. Sitting in the cockpit though, she couldn\u0027t help have a feeling of familarity with it. She clearly remembered flying all around the Inhabited Continent, and ever the rare flight to the Outer Lands. As far as her logs were concerned, she began working on flights to and from the mysterious KMA. What KMA was though remained nothing short of a mystery; aside from the identifier code, she had nothing to go on. Perhaps more concerning was though, she had become a permanent resident of the cape, and joined the space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a blank in her memories though. She couldn\u0027t remember how or why. Her attempts to dig out the truth of the matter were being stymed by her work as the ace pilot of the Kerbal Astronaut Corps. With the constant simulation drills to get the bugs out of the LEM, and other pressing meetings, Val hadn\u0027t had an opportunity to go flying or even follow up with the strange lights she saw on the island. When she asked a few kerbals about the supposed island airfield got her nothing but blank looks. Mentally, she was wrestling with bringing the topic up with Bill. As pilot in command, the lives of her fellow kerbals would be in her hands. If she was mentally compromised, then it was her responsibility to remove herself from active duty. A small part of her also was willing to admit that coming forward would mean she\u0027d likely never get a chance to go towards the stars again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the flipside, there was a reasonable argument that she wasn\u0027t the only one being affected by this. The two engineers rescued from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E - Natalan and Neldum - had no memory of how they ended up floating in capsules. She had spoken to them both, and the only thing that they agreed on was that they were working at their jobs, and then poof, somewhere in space. Even more confusingly, they had survived an extended period in orbit without any means of viable life support. Given that the Rescue Mk. 1 had only been developed to bring these boys down, it seemed impossible that they had gone into space from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps even stranger, after the recovery teams brought them back for questioning, they both wanted to work for the space center. This request was eventually approved on the basis of prior experience - they had already been to space after all. Val couldn\u0027t help but think it was questionable reasoning at best. In her conversations with the \u0022Wayward Duo\u0022she had noted something odd. It was had to describe in words, but both of them seemed just a little off. Both were friendly enough though Natalan was not much of a conversationalist. Neldum on the other hand was hard to stop once he got started. They both spoke of grand designs, and seemed unconcerned on their situations. When they spoke of the future, they saw nothing but endless missions to the Mun, Minnus, Duna, and the other known planets of the Kerbol system. It was quite an ambitious dream to say the least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the moment though Val was cooling her heels. Currently, the design team were revising the LEM spacecraft again, and HS Duna was getting ready for it\u0027s departure burn; as such she had no pressing engagements until later that evening. It was more than a perfect opportunity to go digging around. Gwen had inadvertly given her a hint of where to start - she had specifically said when she visited KMA, the only thing there was the runway and the R\u0026amp;D building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the occassional staff meetings, Val had learned that there was a fairly extensive research archive in the basement of Research and Development. The idea of lurking in the stacks was not Val\u0027s idea of a fun time, but it *was* a source of potential information. With some trepidation, she set out from the astronaut complex, and made her way into the atrium of the complex. Surprisingly, Wernher was there apparently waiting for someone and pulled an appropriately fake accent to place up the stereotype of mad scientist, \u0022Ja? Is Valentina Kerman? How unusual!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal smirked, there was a friendly rivalry between the pilot corps and the eggheads that made their rockets go. Jeb would have died of shock had he seen her here, \u0022Hello, Wernher. Waiting for someone?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded, \u0022Lunch awaits launch. You are welcome to join us if you care to grace us with your presence.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal shook her head, \u0022Already ate, and we don\u0027t want to deal with recalculating fuel margins if I got any heavier. I\u0027ll take a rain check though.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher, obviously amused, played along, \u0022Ja, the lost boys would be most upset at that development! Not all progress is good progress!\u0022, the more serious tone returned, \u0022So what brings you to our humble abode?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wanted to check something in the archives. How do I get down there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher looked surprised but quickly directed her, \u0022Straight ahead, then down the staircases. Anything in practical you looking for?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The visiting researcher, Gwendlon, said there were some interesting files on the early days of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Before they started the corps. Was curious\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher gave her a pointed look, obviously not buying it. She suddenly understood Linus gave the Mad Doctor a wide berth. \u0022Alright, honestly? Something dry enough to help me sleep.\u0022 That actually got a snort out of the bespectacled scientist, \u0022Interesting choice, young Valentina. Most would try the works of Komer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What can I say? Fiction and history are both interesting, besides, if I lived in his time, I\u0027d probably be right there with them sailing into the unknown.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore the banter can continue, Bob walked in, \u0022Ready to go? Oh, Val!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded, \u0022Valentina was looking for some dry reading in the stacks, and a brief discussion on Komer\u0027s skills as a writer of fine literature.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob shuttered, \u0022Thank you for that, I thought I repressed those memories of Komer. Anyway, if we\u0027re going to have those numbers for Gus and Gene, we need to be quick with food.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded, \u0022Have a pleasant afternoon, young pilot! Don\u0027t let the stack bugs bite. Jajaja!\u0022. Val watched Bob and Wernher set off, and then made her way to the stacks, hoping to avoid any more unpleasant questions. Fortunately, it was just past noon, and with most of R\u0026amp;D out to lunch, the archives were empty. Having never been there before, Val was surprised at the sheer size of them. The archives were organized by planet, separate shelves held their (rather merger) knowledge of Eve, Mun and Minnus, and many simply lay bare. However, the Kerbin shelves on the back wall were overflowing with knowledge. The sheer amount of dust suggested that no one had touched these records in a very long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking her way along the Kerbin stacks, she found that they were roughly subdivided by type. Passing by atmospheric sciences, she finally spotted something at the far end of the row \u0022Kerbin Magnetic Anomaly 1\u0022. KMA. Paydirt. A brief glanced showed that the research was indeed extensive, and had spanned decades; the microfiche rolls were something of a giveaway. Looking at the titles, Val hoped there was some sort of comprehensive summary, or at the very least, an index. Going through all the research data would be a drag. After a few minutes of searching, she spotted it, \u0022Conclusions and Final Report of the Wernher Commission on KMA-1\u0022. A brief check of the spine suggested it was relatively new, it had only been published five years prior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cloud of dust that came when she pulled the book off the shelf was impressive, and Val had something of a coughing fit as the plume enveloped her. With her prize in hand, she sat one of the reading tables and began flipping through it at random. Despite Wernher\u0027s dry tone, Val found herself enraptured by the material. The Wernher Commission had been the final iteration of Civil Avionics Administration research into the magnetic anomalies that dotted Kerbin. \u00A0Vague recollections in Val\u0027s memory brought up how both sailors and pilots would have to compensate for compass drift flashed through her mind. Komer\u0027s Odyssey even talked that their compasses were at best unreliable, and the early Kerbonauts used the stairs as they made the journey to the Outer Lands.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOriginally, the Wernher Comission had started life as the CAA Magnetic Research Project. MRP was tasked with trying to create predictions for the drift so that charts could be published. At the time, the only sure fire way to know where you were was to use a sextant and navigate by stars. Skipper even had the astrolabe mounted in the rear seat for the navigator. By creating a null reference chart, a compass could be used to navigate safely day or night. Working through historical records and their own observations, MRP determined that these magnetic anomalies would come and go over time at seemingly random intervals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThroughout their research, MRP had identified at least six different sources for the anomalies. A rough set of coordinates had been noted, but only one had been accurately triangulated by using three separate teams, a lot of expensive equipment, and some blind luck. With a definitive source identified, MRP gave birth to the Wernher Expedition to what the report referred to as as KMA-1. Eventually, the CAA funded an expedition to try and find the fundamental source for the disturbances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was the first mention of Jebediah Kerman she found. Jeb had lead one of the triangulation teams, and had been selected due to his rather impressive history in exploring the unknown reaches of Kerbin. Wernher had hired him as a guide to get them to the cape, and eventually organize the entire expedition. In what was becoming a running theme, instead of returning his nomadic life, Jeb had eventually joined Wernher\u0027s team as a permanent member. Skipping further ahead in the report, a long term research outpost was setup, and supplies and personal were brought in by air. Val could only assume this was she got involved in the history of KMA (and in turn had become a permanent resident of the cape).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe running theme of anyone who got involved with KMA never leaving was readily apparently to Val.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, they found the source of the disturbances, a black monolith burned fifteen meters below the surface with strange writing on it. Wernher strongly believed it wasn\u0027t a natural phenomenon. Not long after they dug it up, it had sent a massive burst of electromagnetic radiation towards the Mun before going nearly inherit. KMA-1 subsided except in the area directly around the cape. The final conclusions made by Wernher was that further research into the other KMAs be conducted, and a secondary program to eventually investigate the destination of KMA-1 transmission be launched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal closed the tome, and tried put it all in context. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s current objective was a manned Mun landing, but there was no specific destination in mind. KMA-1 had sent a signal to the Mun. Obviously, Wernher had managed to get enough seed funding from the CAA to get the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E off the ground, and commercial ops kept them in the black. None of this research had been classified. As far as she could tell, knowledge of the monolith had simply been forgotten by nearly everyone. Gwen appeared to be an exception to that rule. There was also hard evidence suggesting there were further anomalies on the munar surface; Luna 1 had spotted unusual reading from the surface of the Mun but as far as mission ops were concerned, it was nothing more than a curiosity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a running theme here. People who get involved with the monoliths stay on the cape. Val couldn\u0027t remember why (or even) how she got involved. It was disturbingly like the Wayward Twins. Val shivered. Before she could reflect any further, a voice startled her, \u0022Ground Control to Major Val, anyone there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeside her, the master engineer was looking at her with some concern, \u0022Bill? What are you doing here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Looking for you, you missed your date with the simulator. Gene was about to organize a search mission until Bob remembered seeing you heading down here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe glanced at the clock, it was well past dark - she had been in the stacks all day. She looked rather sheepish, \u0022Um ... oops ...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill shook his head, \u0022No harm done. We ended up putting the OKTO through a landing test.\u0022, he looked glum, \u0022Impacted on the side of a crater. It\u0027s not like you to loose track of the time, what were you reading?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe held up the cover. \u0022Wernher Commission? I\u0027m surprised I didn\u0027t find you in the corner with your brain dribbling out of your ear.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal\u0027s laugh was a more than little forced. \u0022It\u0027s actually really interesting; it\u0027s the research into the Kerbin Magnetic Anomalies.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anomalies?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal blinked. Bill didn\u0027t know?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Magnetic anomalies, it why compasses go haywire around here, and the corrections pilots have to make.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill looked more confused than anything. Val followed up, \u0022You didn\u0027t know?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill shook his head, \u0022I mean, I knew about compass drift. We had to compensate for it for launching probes. It\u0027s why the Stayputnik kept landing in the bay. Didn\u0027t know there was a \u00A0research into it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA snap decision lead Val to go fishing, \u0022Bill ... you don\u0027t remember anything about KMA?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Should I?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill put her hand on her shoulder, \u0022Val, seriously, are you OK? You\u0027re kinda weirding me out right now ...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal shook her head, and inspiration suddenly struck, \u0022I\u0027m alright. All these drills are just exhausting. Look though, I need a favor.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill nodded, \u0022Name it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I need a flying buddy. When I was flying Gwen, I spotted something on that small island just off the coast. I\u0027ve been meaning to check it out, but I rather have a second set of eyes. Just in case ...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill wasn\u0027t sold, \u0022Something, Val? A little vague don\u0027t you think?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal shook her head, \u0022I\u0027m not sure what I saw. I was having trouble finding the runway beacons, and I overflew the island as I circled around. I looked out the window, and I could swear I saw buildings on that island, but I was running on mental fumes because of the long flight, but its been bothering me. Please?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill was silent, Val gambled \u0022Please? For old time sake.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob sighed, \u0022Alright. Might be fun, haven\u0027t gone flying in ages. HS Duna is scheduled to do it\u0027s exit burns in two weeks so we\u0027re fairly backed up between that and LEM testing. Most of the team will be tied up pooling through data, and then we\u0027re scheduled for some downtime. More than enough time to go investigating.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal relaxed. She would tell Bill everything then. Despite forgetting nearly everything, sitting in Skipper\u0027s cockpit made her feel safe and secure.
