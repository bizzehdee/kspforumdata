The 4th part (identical to the third) has been a major pain! Its two long orange fuel tanks with docks on each side. The first one went in without a hitch (and a little help from MechJeb). The 2nd one I managed to spend over 2 hours trying to fit it into place. So my question is how long can an object be that can still easily dock with a station? I\u0027m guessing two full orange fuel tanks stacked on top of each other vertically is what my issue is. Its like the tug just isn\u0027t able to accurately manuever in small increments. MechJeb is seriously having a problem with is one lol. I\u0027m also guessing that dock on the side of a cylinder shaped structure is harder than a single point extended below a module... I\u0027ll have to play around with it. Maybe putting some actual RCS modules on the tanks themselves instead of up high on the Tug will help with stable burns... Maybe emptying those tanks too. Still amazed I landed the first pair of orange tanks on the first try!\n\nSorry for no pics while I\u0027m at work. I could do a really crummy drawing upon request though haha.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T18:24:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mackadelik**\n  \nAnswered"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T17:48:08Z","Content":"What I usually end up doing (which has saved me a lot of headaches!) is to equip every module going up with a probe core, a solar panel or two (enough so it can keep electricity up), and some RCS for positioning.\n\nThis way, each module is basically it\u0027s own self-contained ship. It makes the whole process a lot easier IMO, as add, removing, or even re-arranging modules can be done without an addition \u0027tug\u0027 ship.\n\nI personally haven\u0027t used MechJeb; I can\u0027t help you out with that part of it.

The fourth one took probably an hour because I didn\u0027t get it exactly right initially, so I bumped into the piece I was trying to dock to. Although the bump was very slight (less than 0.2 m/s), it made everything start moving and wobbling, so the targeted dock was now moving. Even time-warping didn\u0027t really stop the moving and wobbling. But I finally got it, and decided that was enough. A 32-tank long section though, I am proud of that one!\n\n![Screen%20Shot%202015-02-22%20at%204.43.20%20PM.png](http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/beta/ring%20station%202/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-22%20at%204.43.20%20PM.png)\n\n![Screen%20Shot%202015-02-22%20at%206.30.43%20PM.png](http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/beta/ring%20station%202/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-22%20at%206.30.43%20PM.png)\n\nI did have a lot of RCS on the ship. Both to get things pointed in the right direction, but even more importantly for lateral translations (I, J, K, L keys). Moving the ship up/down and left/right. Because the ship is so big and heavy, I was using those Vernor engines as the RCS. I have never used MechJeb, being of the mind that if I can\u0027t fly it myself, what\u0027s the point. But that is not a criticism at all, just me. So, I have no idea how well MJ can do those lateral translations and exact docking and stuff.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T18:15:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by justidutch**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten 2X4B 523P","CreatedById":134404,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T18:16:29Z","Content":"Hold a broom handle out at arm\u0027s length and try to turn on a lightswitch - thats basically what youre dealing with.

Basically one ring (4-symmetry) at the top, and one at the bottom. You want the CoM to be directly between them for the best control. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"mackadelik","CreatedById":143364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T18:36:19Z","Content":"I must have really lucked out with the other modules lol. The first two are smaller and more manageable. The last 2 fuel arms are much longer and awkward. The first one I nailed it in approach out of luck and MechJeb docked it for me. Funny thing is that I have been adding more RCS and making larger tugs to retry docking, but I think I\u0027ve actually been moving my RCS and SAS modules further away from the CoM, lol. I bet paying attention to the CoM with the RCS will really help with my docking issues. Maybe it will even help out MechJeb, haha."},{"CreatedByName":"BigFatStupidHead","CreatedById":44217,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T18:54:14Z","Content":"It sounds like you might really benefit from [RCS Build Aid](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-1-0-2-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-7).

Probe core, 2x docking ports, 4x RCS thrusters, a little monoprop (no LFO or LFO engine needed). It would stay in between your tanks and your station permanently, or if you\u0027re feeling ambitious you could get aligned and start your approach, detach the probe and pull it out of the way before the dock finishes. Be sure to strut between the two docking ports for stiffness if you plan to leave it. \n\nAnother would be to try grabbing with 2 or 4 KLAW tugs with RCS\u002Bmono, but that might be impossible to get accurate enough to control. \n\nThird option would be to build a new tug, but give it long arms on struts that put the RCS thrusters closer to the CoM of the combined vessel. It still might have problems due to docking ports not being \u0022stiff\u0022 enough.\n\nFourth option would be to install KAS/KIS and add RCS blocks to the tanks - you could pull them off your tug or somewhere else on your station.\n\nIf you\u0027re going to redesign, I think 1x4 ring of RCS right at the far end of your station part should be \u0022good enough\u0022 to get you docked, the near end doesn\u0027t need any because the tug can provide it. If you have RCS build aid installed, you could mockup your tug \u002B station part in the VAB and zero out the rotational torques during pitch/yaw by accurate RCS placement. \n\nI did it with an RCS ring on one end of an oblong object (it only has radial mounting on one end), it was \u0027fun\u0027 due to the station blocking power for the panels so I had to bring in an RCS drone anyways, but now I know better ways to handle it. If I was to redo this, I would probably build a cage mounted with decouplers around the Shipyard using RCS mounted out there, like a flower, and strut it stiff.\n\nFor last few meters, disable your SAS, it can prevent a dock because it keeps the docking magnets from pulling your lighter part in.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
