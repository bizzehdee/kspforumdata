This feature, the LFA\u2019s ability of processing very high power (104 to 107 W) through a small, compact and simple device, and its high specific impulse (1000-4000 s) put it in a class by itself for application to many thrust-intensive and energetic missions such as demanding cargo and piloted planetary missions. For more power-limited near-term applications the LFA could also compete with other EP options especially for applications such as orbit-raising of massive payload. Since the Li LFA becomes adequately efficient (\u003E30%) only at higher power level (\u003E30 KW) (see Ref. [6] for instance) and since no such high power sources are available in space, the device has been classified in the US as an \u201Cadvanced propulsion option.\u201D\n\u003E \n\n![tumblr_inline_mm57uyPs501qz4rgp.gif](https://33.media.tumblr.com/69d1f6a422d7ed8c8b235aede826339a/tumblr_inline_mm57uyPs501qz4rgp.gif)  \n\nThat\u0027s good man, that\u0027s real good.

I don\u0027t think the fusion drive will make it into v1.1, mostly because I want to get some general feedback first from a stable release.

Although the facts are mosly consistant, when it comes to perfomance it is often becomes self inconsiistant , especialy when multiple sources are used that use either conservative or optimistic performance specs. In KSPI-E I solve this problem with Tech Level, with parts starting with the conservative performances and with more techs unlocked gradualy get the optimisitc performances at the end of the tech tree, where highly optimistic technologies like FTL drives are unlocked.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-29T10:00:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2016 10:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bonus Eventus","CreatedById":115722,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T19:14:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, FreeThinker said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, a functional liquid droplet system would be truely the ultimate radiator, but I guess it will be very hard to ccreate a good model and animation for it.\n\u003E \n\nUltimately, the way I would approach this is with particle effects.
