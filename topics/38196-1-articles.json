Then after starting the rockets and gaining a good amount of speed begin to pitch back up to 45 degrees or a little steeper if you can to climb through the rest of the atmosphere quickly. Finally just get into orbit as you normally would... Meant to be just a general guideline, if you are passing your apoapsis and dropping height then you will have to pitch up more to keep it in front of you, but if you pitch up too high, your intake air will drop fast and you won\u0027t be gaining speed at the rate you need to... So it is a balancing act and will vary with every SSTO you make; having something like flight engineer redux to see your time to apoapsis info helps a bunch in flying these as you can adjust your pitch in pretty much real-time to keep the apoapsis in front of you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-04T21:52:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2013 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sweetpezak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T22:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a general rule of thumb, I climb fairly steeply initially to get out of the thickest part of the atmosphere to reduce drag.
