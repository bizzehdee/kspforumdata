Add a bit of diehdral (tilt the wings upwards), and it\u0027ll be just as stable, and you won\u0027t block windows. Plus, it\u0027ll look a lot like a RL airliner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You have the fuel in the back, that should mean the CoM moves forwards during the flight. Much better to put the fuel on the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-What TWR are you at? As long as it is over 0.60 or so, you are wasting weight in engines (I doubt that, tough).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can hide the fuel lines by beginning them inside one part, and not crossing other part boundaries until you reach your taget. In this case, sink a bit the nacelles, and you can run the fuel lines inside the precoolers. Ditto for struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Check your landing gear. I think I see a tail landing gear really far back, that would make it very difficult to rotate when taking off. The rear-est landing gear should be just behind the CoM, so you don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A1\u0027t have to provide much lever to lift the nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... And that\u0027s what I can tell from the pic. I hope the friendly advice is useful to you in your next builds!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. You learn less from the people that praise your stuff, than from those that bring out the flaws.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWalrus123","CreatedById":119099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T18:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the feedback, I will fix these changes in the next version (Walrus 150)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
