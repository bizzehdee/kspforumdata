All it motivates you to do is to do some specific thing once, and then move on, at the expense of, usually, doing other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have nothing against achievements per se, but for an open game like this, it seems to funnel energies to something that provides nothing that isn\u0027t already there. All you need is stats and figures to measure things, such as what has recently been introduced with the latest persistence files. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example: I reach the Mun in my first save. It takes me a while. Great, I have now \u0027Reached the Mun\u0027. But what if I want to reach the Mun quicker, or with a larger lander? or even a smaller lander? What\u0027s my incentive then to try, if the game is focussed on achievements? The next logical thing I would do is land on Minmus. Tick that box, move on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchievements usually turn a game into a grind, unless they\u0027re clever and outside the box, and typically even then they only work if you stumble across them unexpectedly (ie: experience 15G forces on your space craft whilst having no reaction wheel power - \u0027OUT OF CONTROL\u0027, etc). Poor example, but you get my point. An achievement can be measured without being a driver for the game mechanic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would prefer just a list of funny things that the game could monitor (I believe there was a thread pre-forum crash dedicated to this), like comparing Kerbal deaths, or longest Kerbal faceplant, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T15:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell said, achievements are only for those who can\u0027t think for themselves.

I think there are lots of late game options that are either planned or are part of current mods. We\u0027ve got things like kethane and the planned resources and mining feature, which will push you to explore the farthest reaches of the Kerbol system. There\u0027s also the extraplanetary launch mod, which helps make colonies a viable option. I think there are lots of things in the pipe to make the game interesting even in the later stages.

There will, however, some means of showcasing your accomplishments in the game. They\u0027d talked about a museum that might house successful crafts or just showcase your achievements in some slightly meaningful way and on top of that, there\u0027s the knowledgebase which seems to function like an encyclopedia that you fill out by doing science and discovering planets and such. So you will see progress and notice it throughout your career. You just won\u0027t get achievements popping up through steam or whatever ;P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the endgame for career mode was said to be faster than light travel...using some kind of warp drive to travel to a solar system that you\u0027d discovered via...I don\u0027t know, orbital telescopes or something(which I would LOVE to build and use). There were supposed to be a couple predefined solar systems near the Kerbol system that would be the same for everyone so you could share those first FTL trip stories and experiences with each other using specified planets and such, like we have now. THEN there were supposed to be procedurally generated solar systems beyond those near to kerbin, I guess just to give you more things to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut who knows if they\u0027ve changed their minds on that stuff.

For instance, the easter eggs provide several very interesting \u0027achievements\u0027, finding them, precision landing on them, or landing a rover nearby and driving to them, etc. Finding out what they are and getting there has provided me with loads of mission ideas and adventures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese kind of carrots are very good for driving the gameplay when done right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital construction yards would probably be an interesting driver for late game development. Right now I find myself flying (always manually, no mechjeb) modules and rovers and fuel tanks, and rendezvousing and docking them in LKO to build a bigger interplanetary ship. It\u0027s getting very routine. Career mode should probably recognize this and eventually say \u0022ok, he knows how to get 25ton masses to orbit, lets have our Kerbal engineers come up with an autopiloted lifter capable of doing that\u0022. And by autopilot i don\u0027t mean mechjeb, I mean something that I don\u0027t need to sit through and watch. One idea might be that I\u0027m flying a little tug around my orbital dockyard, and request a delivery of a particular module which I built and saved in the VAB. Then a little while later an automated lifter arrives and drops the module a few km from my construction site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harguinxx","CreatedById":76917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T11:15:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only point I can see to achievements is to share it with your friends, competing with them in that way, since there won\u0027t be a multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
