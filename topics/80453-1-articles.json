The map shows it take 4500 deltaV to reach low orbit of Kerbin (70km). Does that mean you are in full orbit of the planet or just your apopsis is now at 70km?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask because the next step, to a geostationary orbit, says to burn 680, then 435. As I understand it the 680 is to get your apopsis to the required distance and the 435 would bring the periapsis up to create a circular geostationary orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to make my rockets more efficient now that I have to pay for fuel. :-P\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-02T00:33:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2014 12:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kethevin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T00:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe 4500 \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv means you are in a circular 70km orbit.
