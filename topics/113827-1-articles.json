I right-clicked the wheel, and surprisingly, there was the option \u0022repair wheel\u0022, even though the nearest Kerbal was 500km away at the Duna base. I clicked it and sure enough, the wheel popped back to its original shape and functioned properly! I broke the wheel on purpose again, and it worked again. This happened for all six wheels of the rover (the TR-2L Ruggedized ones). Did anyone else experience this? Did the rover\u0027s STEADLER Remote Guidance Unit finally become sentient, as its description claims?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: No answers yet?
