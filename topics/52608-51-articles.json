It is certainly possible to do, but requires creating another menu to do so, and the biggest stumbling block is numeric entry, the same problem that hinders making a maneuver planner menu -- it\u0027s hard to imagine an interface that doesn\u0027t suck too hard to use when you actually need to click 3d buttons to control it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbonautical\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbonautical\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBy the way I noticed in the screenshots you have some type of geographical map displayed on some of the screens, is that through some extra mod I\u0027ve missed somehow?

This lets the author of some other plugin feed data to RPM without actually making their plugin unusable without RPM in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if the author of that plugin doesn\u0027t care about RPM enough to support it this way, but I want it\u0027s data on RPM screens? Then I have to do a shim: A plugin which must fit certain criteria:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E It MUST be loaded later than both RasterPropMonitor\u0027s main assembly (so I can use all the utility code in there) \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E the plugin it interfaces with RPM.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E It MUST be a separate plugin, so that if that plugin I am interfacing with is not present, that shim will fail to load while RPM will load normally and gracefully pretend it never wanted the data in the first place.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what the MechJebRPM.dll and SCANsatRPM.dll do.
