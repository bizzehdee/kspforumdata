After that - bam - more science than you can shake a scientific stick at.

Changing the difficulty slider doesn\u0027t affect that much, if anything it encourages \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E biome farming just to scrape enough science together to do whatever else you want to do.

Maybe that means (shudder) rare, random failures, but mapped to the different fuel types. Upgrades (now a thing) can provide increased capability/reliability so that if you invest in hydrolox, maybe you stick with it, even though not ideal for all uses\u00A0because you\u0027ve bothered to upgrade it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not easy to get right, frankly, but the current tree is very, very wrong. Just look at having to even have a tech tree node for LADDERS...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn topic of comms, there is no reason why every antenna would not be available from the start. Really. The new relay antennas are \u003Cem\u003Egrossly\u003C/em\u003E overweight, for example. 600kg for the big one? It\u0027s basically the Voyager antenna (not even scaled down), and the entire radio suite on Voyager, with all the structure to support the dish included I think is 50kg (I posted it during the pre-release and don\u0027t remember other than it not being close to 600 since the entire spacecraft massed 800kg at launch (including propellants). So make them all available, and perhaps drop the mass and increase the capability via \u0022upgrades\u0022 so that the RA-100 can eventually mass what it should, maybe 0.05 or 0.1, instead of 0.6).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
