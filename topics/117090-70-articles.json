So far I have it swapping lengths and diameter appropriately, scaling motor min and max thrust according to diameter, and scaling the resources according to part volume (set up to maintain a consistent burn time regardless of size/length/etc).\n\nI have not yet fathomed how to -cleanly- implement a self-jettison setup.  Mostly it runs into RO compatibility issues due to fuel types and the fact that ModuleEngines will not allow for a fuel reserve for SRB type motors.  (E.g. the auto-depletion decouplers have been... broken terribly... by the RO patches; the same thing would happen to the MSRBs).\n\nHowever, at the very least, I will be releasing them as a modular SRB, usable with standard decouplers or the RBDC decouplers.  Nothing stopping me from adding the auto-decouple/jettison motor stuff in the future; the important part is the modular SRB setup, which works.\n\nSo.. will be spending a large part of the next two weeks making SRB models.

(Volume of a unit in LH2 as defined in CRP -- density would say that it is a 1l unit).\n\nEdit:  LH2 is -LIGHT-.  VERY LIGHT.  You would be surprised how \u0027fluffy\u0027 of a fluid it is.  Yes, you need MASSIVE tanks to hold any reasonable mass.\n\nFurther edit: Yes, those stock tanks/etc are WRONG.  They are holding double the amount of LH2 that they should (by liters of volume).  \n  \n**Proof**:  1l of LH2 has a real-world density of 0.0000708 tons per liter.  \n\n64000 liters \\* 0.0000708 = 4.5312 tons of LH2. -- which is the mass of LH2 they have in that tank.  So, they are using the proper density per unit for 1l units.  \n\nSo, they ARE using 1l units, but they have miscalculated tank capacity by a factor of 2.\n\nFeel free to submit this information to whomever is in charge of those tanks -- they need to fix their volume calculations.

I can do some brainstorming if you want some input.\n\nPersonally I never use rovers, and there are two very good mods out there at the moment (Rover Dude\u0027s Karibou and WildBlue Buffalo). There is only one mod catering for satellites that I know of (OctoSat, but uses a lot of parts), and 2-3 mods have components to make stations, but also with a lot of parts. So yeah, I\u0027d love to see those two started up first to be honest. I think a lot of people would too, as satellites would also tie into the many career contracts to launch probes, and complete stations with a handful of parts is unheard of right now (I tend to jump into 50-80 parts without even trying).\n\nRe satellites... these are basically modular Service Modules, just smaller... but hence the \u0022modular\u0022 part. Maybe that component can be included in the satellite pack? All probes share the same traits:  \n\n- Antenna  \n\n- Batteries, enough to transmit M700 survey report  \n\n- Solar Panels  \n\n- SAS / drone core level 3  \n\n- Reaction wheel  \n\n- Fuel tank (no engine)  \n\n- Switchable science equipment  \n\nThat pretty much sums up the same things as a Orion or Soyuz SM, just smaller, ex the science components.
