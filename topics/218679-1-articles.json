If yes, did you bypassed the PD Launcher? If yes, how? The \u0022hackish\u0022 way of changing the Steam command launcher to pinpoint the KSP.exe is backfiring badly, because it launches KSP from a different directory it expects, and this ends up making\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eparts\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0of KSP writing and reading files from the wrong place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
