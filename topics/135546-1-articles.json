If you look at the more popular challenges on these forums, you\u0027ll see that they pretty much all have a few paragraphs of information detailing specific requirements for the mission, as well as a set of rules, and usually a points system so that people can judge how well they do. Your challenge looks like it has the potential to be interesting and fun to attempt, however it is incredibly lacking in detail, regulations, and explanations (as well as either a list of allowed mods or a declaration that the challenge must be done using stock parts).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetski","CreatedById":119969,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T15:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20 Kerbals to Eeloo, MET 180 days 13hours. 463395 funds, 106 parts. \u00A04 Mammoth boosters, a single mammoth ejection stage, Rhino for midcourse adjustment burn and capture burn, 4 Terriers for landing. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/CQjkR/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/UE4YN/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
