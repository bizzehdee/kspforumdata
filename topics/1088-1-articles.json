The CEO of Paradox Interactive, Fredrik Wester, publicly announced his belief that the game would never see a profit while other members of the company such as Johan Andersson were confident it would be profitable. To this end Wester promised that if the game did indeed make a profit he would shave his head and post the pictures onto the forum.[13] This belief stemmed from the first game\u0027s lackluster sales numbers. It was revealed in a German interview with Frederik that 70,000 copies would need to be sold in order for Victoria II to be profitable.[14] On 17 June, Jessica Chobot from IGN shaved it off for him.[15]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darrknox","CreatedById":2513,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-27T23:25:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the business of gaming.
