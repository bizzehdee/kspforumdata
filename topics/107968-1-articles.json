So I tried to ferry 2 Kerbals around the mun and back. Unfortunately on my way back I ran out of fuel and am now in an orbit around Kerbin. \n\nNaturally of course I sent a rescue mission on its way. I did get Jeb to switch vessels but the tourists can\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t do EVAs! I dont know how I can get them to switch ships. \n\nIs there a good way to get the passenger compartment back to Kerbin or transfer the tourists? The ship has no more fuel, no rcs and no docking ports. \n\nThank you ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T22:09:32Z","Content":"if it doesn\u0027t have docking ports, then the only way to get them back would be to use the Klaw (advanced grabbing unit) to deorbit and recover the passenger compartment."},{"CreatedByName":"Ignath","CreatedById":77210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T22:12:14Z","Content":"Can you get out and push your original ship with your RCS from your Kerbals jetpack? That is pretty much the method of last resort when out of fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T22:30:35Z","Content":"If you don\u0027t have docking ports on the craft and haven\u0027t unlocked the claw yet then there could be another way (assuming you have parachutes on the crew craft). Send a rescue craft with a some landing legs on it set so when they\u0027re open they form a claw like shape that you can grip the crew craft with. Just enough to stop it rolling to the side. Bring the rescue craft up to the crew craft so the rescue craft is orientated on a retrograde orbit and very gently approach the crew craft. Once you\u0027ve got the crew craft into the leg-claw thing throttle up a bit and that should hold it in place while you shunt it into a sub-orbital trajectory. That should work assuming the crew craft has parachutes and enough electricity to deploy them on it\u0027s descent. \n\nYou could try and shunt the craft with a Kerbal\u0027s jet pack, but if your in a low(ish) Kerbin orbit that is going to take ages and it gets pretty tedious."},{"CreatedByName":"pinksheep","CreatedById":143293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T09:58:12Z","Content":"Ha!\n\nI managed to get them back. It was a pain without rcs (which I foolishly forgot) but it worked!\n\nThank you guys for the help! \n\n![qN83pQ8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qN83pQ8.jpg)"}]}
