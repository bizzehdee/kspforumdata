I am playing a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E install so it is unlikely that other mod has applied their boil-off after the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E configs; I did, however, notice a difference between cryogenic and non-cryogenic tanks. However, the difference is confusing: for Cryogenic types, having a higher skin temp does result a very slow but clearly noticeable loss; for BalloonCryo types the loss is very apparent. Notice in both case I do have my internal temp down to 19K because the Heat Pump is doing its job properly.
