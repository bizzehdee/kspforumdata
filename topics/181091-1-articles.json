Things started going wrong before I even finished the ship though! When playtesting the CSM, it\u0027s engine would burn for less then a second and immediately die out! Its\u0027 body was an SM-25 Service Module, and it had various components in it, mostly fuel tanks. It had an FL-T400 attached to the upper portion of the SM-25s\u0027 interior, with reaction wheels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks attached to it, and some extra liquid fuel \u002B oxidizer tanks attached to it. There were also some super small oscar tanks attached to the outer nodes inside the SM-25. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1612691823\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a screenshot with some parts removed \u003C/a\u003E(a lower oscar tank, a radial mono propellant tank in the middle, and some radial batteries to fill in the gaps) to clearly show the important stuff\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was able to work around it by attaching the engine to the components inside the SM-25, offsetting it so it didn\u0027t clip, and auto-strutting it to the root part so it didn\u0027t wobble in odd looking ways. I felt really dirty doing this, but it worked...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfterwards, I messed up by accidentally unstaging some stages after setting up a Minmus encounter. Since I didn\u0027t technically need them (my Minmus rockets as of late have been overkill X3) I went ahead, docked the CSM and Lander modules together, and eventually setup a stable Minmus orbit close to the surface. Somewhere along the lines, the GUI freaked out; the staging diagram on the side became empty, and it started saying that \u003Cem\u003Eevery single burn\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E(even ones that took less the 1 m/s; keep in mind this is a Wolfhound pushing a standard Apollo setup) would take about 1 minute and 20 seconds! The problem went away when I switched to another craft and came back, but it spooked me for a while, and made maneuver nodes a fair bit more difficult to use (and reordering of staging nearly impossible; in fact, I was able to delete ALL the stages in the menu since they were all empty, and it removed the entire interface from my screen).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where the next big hiccup happened! I undocked the lander so I could let it land, but I didn\u0027t move it right away, so the docking ports were still in contact. While I was making preparations to set up the landing, the ships redocked! I went back to undock them again, and I couldn\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u00A0Neither docking port had an undock option, yet the ships were still glued together!

I used some of them to kill some speed by transferring fuel to the tanks that the CSMs\u0027 engine could actually use, but it was quite the hassle, since I had to clip the camera through the hull to access them. After another accidental unstaging that cost me a lot of science, I finally landed and was able to return my Pilot to Kerbin. My initial plan to leave the ascent module so the scientists could return in one mission failed, but I was able to deliver them and bring my Pilot back despite everything, so I considered it a success, even though a new return mission is needed now...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr: What are the rules behind how engines use\u00A0fuel tanks?
