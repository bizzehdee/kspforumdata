I have been using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E since I started a few months ago. The text on the mod was fine. Now with version 1.1.5 the text is so tiny I can hardly see it and I\u0027m not even a foot away from my monitor and I wear reading glasses. If the mod owner is reading this please at least give us the option to increase text size?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-05T18:57:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/189105-theangryhulk/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022189105\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/189105-theangryhulk/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@TheAngryHulk\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Most of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E windows can be resized.

I have problems with this as well. I use a 4K monitor running KSP at 3840x2160 and the KSP GUI at 140%. Besides being incredibly tiny text the Build Overlay displays are too far to the left obscuring the Snap mode indicator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
