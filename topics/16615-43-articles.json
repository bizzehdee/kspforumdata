You can define a surface temperature for any celestial body, which only takes effect with an atmosphere. Neither density nor speed factor into it, the heat just rises according to a pre-defined curve unique to each planet as you go lower and lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there\u0027s no cool side of moho, despite one side being dark.. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T08:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also haven\u0027t posted any pictures of it because it\u0027s utterly hideous at the moment.
