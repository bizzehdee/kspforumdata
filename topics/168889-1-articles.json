It might be the ship slid downhill since I\u0027d left it. As soon as gravity or whatever kicked in the ship violently blew up sending my command module way up and parts spinning wildly. Tried it a number of times and always the same, big explosion. Tried reloading and it exploded.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that the rocket slid very slowly against this boulder and it sort of builds up stresses, which get real and concentrated when I focus on the ship\u00A0or try to take control of the ship. I\u0027m guessing there\u0027s no easy way to fix this.
