I will try to compare Ganymede and Titan the best I can, but I am not an expert or well-versed in these matters, and am mainly using Wikipedia as a crutch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGanymede and Titan are both about the same distance from their host, and have about the same escape velocity and mass. Titan is about 20 degrees Centigrade colder than Ganymede. Ganymede is largely composed of oxygen, hydrogen, sulfer and iron, while Titan has more nitrogen and silicon, with some hydrogen and oxygen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on this data, a few explanations might be provided. A very thin atmosphere has been discovered on Ganymede, caused by radiation reacting with water on the planet, releasing oxygen and hydrogen gas. Because the tenuous atmosphere is generated by solar wind, and much of these particles are deflected by Ganymede\u0027s unusual magnetosphere, not many H20 molecules are ionized into O2 and H2. The hydrogen naturally escapes Ganymede, as the its gravity is not strong enough to retain the light gas, and the oxygen remains. Titan, on the other hand, has an abundance of relatively heavy organic compounds, that, unlike hydrogen, are retained by the body. Titan also spends about half of its time in orbit inside the magnetosphere of Saturn, shielding it from much of the energetic solar wind. The atmosphere it had accumulated, likely when the sun was cooler and spat out less ions, is also thick enough to create an ionosphere, which can slow gas loss due to solar wind by having charge (the ionosphere is an area of the atmosphere where energetic charged particles reside). Ganymede\u0027s initial oxygen atmosphere, if it had existed, probably would not have been thick enough to create an ionosphere capable of keeping the solar wind at bay while it got replenished by some form of volcanism. Ganymede has a very low orbital eccentricity, so it is doubtful whether or not its interior could have been warm enough to release gases in the first place to create any initial atmosphere. Titan appears to have a warm interior, mostly driven by radioactive decay, with tidal heating giving only 20% of the moon\u0027s interior warmth. Inherently, this radiation would have been stronger during Titan\u0027s early days, and could have served to instigate volcanism, creating the initial nitrogen atmosphere of Titan. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr Ganymede has its own magnetosphere, which repels solar wind, but its thin atmosphere is generated by the radiation. Titan is in Saturn\u0027s magnetosphere half the time, and has the potential for an ionosphere to further repel atmosphere-killing radiation. The potentially gaseous elements on Ganymede are H and O, with hydrogen freely leaving Ganymede. Titan has lots of N and organic molecules, which are far heavier than H2, needing more energy to escape. Titan also has a warmer interior that created gas during its early days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn regards to Tylo and Laythe, it is a game. The Lords and Masters of Tylo decided it was not to be so, and lo! there was no atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E//holy crap, I love the autosaving of messages... after two more crashes of chrome on the iPad, I apologize to any ill feelings toward VBulletin I may have had and would like to have its babies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-06T18:54:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2014 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NFUN\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdited for accuracy and clarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T09:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaythe is very close to Jool, so might be shielded from solar winds by its parent\u0027s magnetosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo seems to have no water and there is no visible volcanic activity, so there is no source that could produce an atmosphere in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe only has a thin atmosphere and relatively low gravity - both might be an indication and reason respectively for Jool sucking up gas from Laythe - colonization might only be possible for a few million years then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T09:51:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr, maybe Titan is lonely being the only big moon around Saturn and wants a hug, while Ganymede has 3 other friends, two of which he dances with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThesaurusRex","CreatedById":8974,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T10:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NFUN\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NFUN\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGanymede spends much of its time outside of Jupiter\u0027s magnetic field, and because it does not have a magnetosphere of its own capable of repelling much of the solar wind (the wiki page for it is complex for a layman and I\u0027m tired), oxygen can be stripped from the moon (solar wind can give enough energy to gas particles to speed them to escape velocity, heat=vibrations=velocity).
