Thus far, 2:30am MST, the Twitch 1.0 stream has been a massive failure.. Even based on Kerbal standards where failure is part of the process.. \n\nI have never seen such unpreparedness for such an event. 1.8 Million total views and these guys seem like they didn\u0027t even know ... they were doing. All the hours these idiots claim to have on this game and yeah... even considering the newness.. and the \u0022it was just thrown at me\u0022 excuse.. Poor job guys for real. \n\n5 hours and the only rocket that left Kerbin had no chance of succeeding to dres. \n\nSquad deserves better than these amateurs. God only knows how many hours of fail footage they dig through to get the 10 min videos that made them look competent."},{"CreatedByName":"Torham234","CreatedById":58574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T13:02:34Z","Content":"Well, I didn\u0027t want to be the first one to say it out loud, but yes.

And yes, more bad than good, but failure is part of the game too, and seeing \u0022*well this used to work just fine*\u0022 fail is, in my eyes, very educational and sets my expectations for 1.0 (as being a tremendous rediscovering journey again. Joy!)\n\nWhat *does* annoy me though, is the tremendous lack in presentation skills. \u0022*Well this is KSP, what do you expect?*\u0022 Well, it\u0027s KSP *streaming* so part of that is presenting. People just staring at their screen and not at the camera and only mumbling things like \u0022let\u0027s raise the apoapsis\u0022 without really talking to the public... is not good. I\u0027d rather would have enjoyed two one-hour videos that were well edited, scripted and presented than the current 48h marathon with a lot of... not so good video."},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T13:07:46Z","Content":"I\u0027ll add that on top of the incompetent playing and seemingly poor (or no) planning on what to say, I see an overabundance of wiggling the camera view around nervously while talking, or endless filler like, \u0022ah, where\u0027d my oxidizer go?! Oh my god. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m out of oxidizer. Seriously guys. What happened to my oxidizer? I\u0027m out of oxidizer!\u0022 /turns off twitch.

They are going the best they can and full credit and a sincere thank you to them all. HOWEVER, what I think we are pointing at is more of an administrative and management issue surrounding how the streams are selected, what they focus on, and what appears to be a complete lack of common presentation standards and probably a woeful lack of pre-stream 1.0 play-time granted to the streamers - all of which could have been better addressed by Squad.\n\nI think the streamers are doing the best they can under the circumstances."},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T13:32:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think anyone meant that kind of failing.\n\u003E People just want to see more of the new features.
