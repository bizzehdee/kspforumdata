It would be nice if we have an option to transmit the data to the capsule or reroute the transmittion to Kerbin via spacecraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

You can even loose the mission like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Re-acquiring the link - if the connection have been lost the spacecraft will attempt to connect to other satellites or Kerbin control (that will save many lost ships)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Remote control from mothership - currently the requirements for remote control station is 6 kerbals on the spacecraft it would be nice if we would be able to tweak this number. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. More automatisation of antennas alignment - there are probably several routes that you can go but it would be nice to have computer that will help to automate the antennas alignments, with a lot of interplanetary missions going on it is become tedious without it. Maybe it can be separate part that will be available later in the carrier mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Better autopilot \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 currently the autopilot is crude at best. The MJ maneuver planner do way better job doing the burns but with RT it is not available without the constant uplink. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Atmospheric landing profiles \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the big problem with unattended landing that parachutes deploy to early and get blown off. Yes, it is possible to tweak existing parachutes for deployment at lower heights but it would be nice to have a option in the flight computer to autodeply to parachutes and landing legs after reaching speed less than specified. Than you can actually have the unattended landing in the atmospheric worlds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. MechJeb integration? \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Not everyone using it and some people are really against MJ but if I would have the MechJeb as my flight computer I might try to play with time delay enabled landing autopilot of MJ would allow to do landing on non-atmospheric worlds with time delay enabled. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Change antennas alignment from the map view \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 right now I have to load every ship in order to change the antennas alignments with large satellite network it takes a lot of time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Upgrades to Kerbin Comm center \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 with better antennas are available with the game progression. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Aditional comm stations at the other parts of Kerbin \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s all can be done with the satellites but still it would be nice and realistic to have comm stations at different parts of the Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso could you please post the list of people who donated to the project in the top post or maybe readme file for the mod?

It\u0027s not like the mechjeb console is at KSC sending commands to the craft. The mechjeb console is directly attached to the craft that it is controlling; receiving all the information it needs to do everything in real-time. Wouldn\u0027t it be more realistic if certain automated functions on MechJeb were immune to signal delay. For example, if you tell it to auto-land, it would take x amount of time for that command to reach the mechjeb module, but once it gets there MJ does the autoland all by itself in realtime like normal since that function is not dependent on information or commands from KSC. You can even make it so that once it receives the autoland command it can lose contact with mission control (IIRC this happens during reentry because of ionization and whatnot which might be another neat realism feature you could add to balance things out, that is loss of signal during reentry effects) and still continue to function as normal. I know for some of you masochists out there this might be sacrilege, but you wouldn\u0027t have to make MechJeb completely immune to signal delay, only those features that would require real time input from mission control in a real-life probe with an on-board computer. If real-life probes like Curiosity can do EDL in an automated fashion without real-time input from mission control why can\u0027t MechJeb? And yes, I know all about KoS, but my point is that there is no plausible realistic reason a MechJeb console requires real-time input from KSC for some of its automated features and therefore incorporating signal delay where no signal is necessary just doesn\u0027t make sense to me. Of course I could be completely wrong and I\u0027m open to anyone correcting me since my knowledge on many of these subjects is hardly adequate compared to most other KSPer\u0027s so please let me know what you guys think. Also it could be made optional trough a menu what type of signal delay people want to satisfy different tastes, though if that\u0027s too much work for the devs to support a feature that is considered too niche then I understand and might even get to cracking on learning how to make and edit mods and see if I can do it myself, though I imagine it\u0027d be a daunting task.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaze-Ni-","CreatedById":108853,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T14:28:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MeCripp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MeCripp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid you edit the files ? or you might have 2 ModuleManager *.*.* files, be sure you only have 1 in KSP/GameData is all you need.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you good sir!
