At 60%, many of those missions to try out prototype components won\u0027t break even, and you\u0027ll have to combine three or four on a single launcher to make a noticeable profit. It creates an environment where you MUST do many of these before you can take a trip to Mun. It also creates a system where you should go to fully reusable designs as quickly as possible, or at least try to minimize damage; I started putting parachutes and probe cores on all my launchers, just so that SOMETHING would survive to be recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two separate issues that make even Hard trivial to beat once you get past the very start, though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; The \u0022report science\u0022 missions. Once you put a tiny unmanned probe with a temperature sensor in low orbit around a body, you can complete these missions whenever they pop up, for large gains at no additional cost. For a measly 20k you can easily make an ion probe capable of reaching anywhere in the system, but each report mission from a Joolian moon (or Dres/Eeloo) will give you ~250k credits plus the usual science and reputation. (In 0.24, I made probes costing 50k that also carried a Kethane scanner, ScanSat arrays, etc. for even more utility, and they could be launched from an 8-ton spaceplane that cost barely 30k and returned 29k if you landed on the runway. VERY economical.) The flag-planting missions are similar, although there you at least have to have a manned rover/lander on the surface, which takes a lot more of an effort to set up for the more distant bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESOLUTION: Transmitted data that results in 0.0 science simply cannot complete a contract. In effect this\u0027d put a cap on how many times those contracts could be completed at all, and would really kill those 1-sensor sorts of unmanned designs. I\u0027d prefer a sort of diminishing returns system, so that the immediate response is for players to just not abuse those contract types, but a straight cutoff seems simple to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; The admin strategies are just not well-balanced at present. In my first 0.25 career save, I took the two \u002Bresearch strategies at 20%. With a few orbital trips and one Mun trip, I had enough science to unlock nearly the entire tech tree, while only sacrificing 20% of my monetary income. The problem was that many of the \u0022test prototype\u0022 contracts have huge cash rewards and tiny science rewards; in one case, I did a contract that normally awarded 1 science, but I instead gained 118. (The general useless of reputation once you hit a certain amount makes this even more pronounced, but that\u0027s a different discussion.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESOLUTION: Cap each strategy\u0027s benefit at, say, 100% of the \u0022native\u0022 reward in the destination resource. That is, if a contract pays 10 science before strategies are considered, then each of the two \u002Bresearch strategies can at most convert enough money or reputation to add another \u002B10 science, regardless of what percentage you\u0027ve set the strategy to. The percentages would still matter for those contracts that add good amounts of all three resources, but it\u0027d keep these other types from getting out of control. Again, a more complex mathematical relationship might work better, but this way would be really easy to explain to users.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T09:11:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Spatzimaus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgree with all of that, and good solution proposals to the currently unbalanced strategies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T09:54:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t willing to give up my .24 save that I was working on, esp since I was alreayd using SP\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I took a look at .25... and I quickly ran into money troubles as I paid to unlock all I could indiscriminately after my first mission (SRB\u002B pod to space)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, without enough funds for an orbital mission, I took some test part landed at kerbin contracts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMistake... one was a test an 800 fund decoupler... but with the setting I chose (custom, 50% cash rewards), it was a loosing proposition... but I realized that too late...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven worse, there was a bug, and the contract didn\u0027t complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to give myself negative starting rep... its a new program, I wanted \u0022less than zero\u0022 since a lot of funds would have already been invested to setup the complex, with no results yet... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResult... really bad contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the other contracts seemed to be \u0022flying at kerbin\u0022 ones that would be hard to afford just launching (given I had about 2,500 funds), and the flying part would mean poor recovery value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving only done 1 real mission, I started over\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T10:12:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDisagree.

This is one reason I was reluctant to make that suggestion; its simplicity might make it easy to explain, but it has definite downsides. The other reason was that due to the way the tech tree is laid out you\u0027ll often send manned, all-in-one missions to the nearer bodies (Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike, Gilly) before you unlock the techs to make unmanned probes practical. This\u0027d make those science contracts even less likely to come up, as you\u0027d basically be locked out of them for those bodies as soon as your first manned mission returns with the full array of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose you could do a diminishing returns setup instead, similar to how many science amounts already depreciate when completed multiple times.

There\u0027d still be a limit on the number of times you could complete it, though. The same would go for the flag plantings. Planting one in a biome you\u0027ve never placed a flag in before, with a Kerbonaut you\u0027ve never used for flags before, could give the best reward, while planting another one outside your persistent base would only award a token amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really prefer to keep the award simple, but have added complexity under the hood. For instance, you could allow people to complete the science contracts the way they have been (although possibly with the instrument-dependent scaling I mentioned a minute ago), but have the RESPAWN TIMER of the contract be dependent on how it was completed. Do it the same way every time with an unmanned satellite and you might only get a Mun science mission once per year or more, but do it with a variety of different sensors on manned round-trip missions and you might see the same contract pop up almost as often as you can launch Mun missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s another solution I just thought of. This might be even simpler; just make the contracts \u003Cstrong\u003Emore specific\u003C/strong\u003E. Instead of saying to get science from a body, have the contract specify \u003Cem\u003Ewhich instrument or data type is required\u003C/em\u003E. Maybe it\u0027d ask for temperature, maybe it\u0027d ask for goo, or maybe it\u0027d want an EVA report or surface sample, and the payout would depend on the difficulty involved (mass and cost of instrument, whether it requires a person, whether it can be easily recharged). While you could still send probes with the majority of the sensor types to cover most of the possibilities, this\u0027d greatly increase the cost of the probes (making it harder to blanket the system with cheap probes in the early game) and you still would get some contracts that just couldn\u0027t be done that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same would go for flags; if the contract specified a specific biome, then you wouldn\u0027t simply be able to have the kerbonaut step outside your base every time the contract came up. Sure, occasionally he\u0027d already be in the right biome, but most of the time he\u0027d either have to travel, or you\u0027d have to send another mission. The smaller (specific craters) or more remote (the poles) the biome in question, the better the reward; a basic Midlands/Highlands contract would pay only a token amount. Of course, this only works for bodies with multiple biomes, but that\u0027s the way it\u0027s all heading anyway and we ARE still in beta.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, I hope we can all agree that the current contract payoffs are unbalanced even before discussing the repeatability. If that 250k Laythe payoff required the sort of vessel that cost at least that amount then it\u0027d be one thing, but being able to complete it even once with a dirt-cheap probe is just a problem. Heck, I\u0027ve got an SSTO spaceplane design that can fly itself to Laythe and return, losing only the cost of its fuel, so even requiring a manned vessel wouldn\u0027t be enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Melcom","CreatedById":89393,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T11:59:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Spatzimaus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat ideas.

Not much point in having a biome system without some way to see them, after all; sure, you can just guess where the various biomes are, but that only really works if the bodies in question have distinctive terrain features in the first place.

For this sort of thing to work the biomes have to be visible from orbit, really, and that means either distinctive terrain types or major geological features. Kerbin\u0027s fine for that, and Mun has the various craters, but Minmus only has a handful of biomes (basically, the various altitudes) and most of the other moons and planets are too plain to even get that much without a major redesign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the instrument-based science contracts, at least, should be implementable in the current system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T14:40:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, good.

It upsets game balance significantly even at a low 10% commitment which I currently have it set to. I think the conversion rate should be reduced by an order of magnitude or more. Perhaps make conversions even worse as difficulty level scales up. I suggest 1 science for every 350 funds for normal mode, and 1 science for every 1000 funds on hard. I\u0027m still in early game (just Mun and Minmus so far) and the contracts I\u0027m being offered, combined with a 10% commitment to Outsourced Technology, gives me science gains that I would normally have to go to Jool for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*snip for brevity*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince posting that and playing a little more, I\u0027ve actually started to change my stance on this a little.

What has effectively happened is that I can see what potential technologies are on the table (the equivalent of dreaming up ideas) but I can\u0027t use them until I invest money in developing that technology. I can see a real-life parallel to this -- anyone can submit an idea for, say, a bigger more powerful engine, but if you want to actually DESIGN one you\u0027re going to have to pay engineers and scientists to work out every last detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Spatzimaus, I like those ideas. My personal take is that \u0022transmit science from space around X\u0022 contracts should require Science Jr. or Goo, i.e. non-reusable science instruments unless you have a mobile lab.

Once you put a tiny unmanned probe with a temperature sensor in low orbit around a body, you can complete these missions whenever they pop up, for large gains at no additional cost. For a measly 20k you can easily make an ion probe capable of reaching anywhere in the system, but each report mission from a Joolian moon (or Dres/Eeloo) will give you ~250k credits plus the usual science and reputation. (In 0.24, I made probes costing 50k that also carried a Kethane scanner, ScanSat arrays, etc. for even more utility, and they could be launched from an 8-ton spaceplane that cost barely 30k and returned 29k if you landed on the runway. VERY economical.) The flag-planting missions are similar, although there you at least have to have a manned rover/lander on the surface, which takes a lot more of an effort to set up for the more distant bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESOLUTION: Transmitted data that results in 0.0 science simply cannot complete a contract. In effect this\u0027d put a cap on how many times those contracts could be completed at all, and would really kill those 1-sensor sorts of unmanned designs. I\u0027d prefer a sort of diminishing returns system, so that the immediate response is for players to just not abuse those contract types, but a straight cutoff seems simple to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; The admin strategies are just not well-balanced at present. In my first 0.25 career save, I took the two \u002Bresearch strategies at 20%. With a few orbital trips and one Mun trip, I had enough science to unlock nearly the entire tech tree, while only sacrificing 20% of my monetary income. The problem was that many of the \u0022test prototype\u0022 contracts have huge cash rewards and tiny science rewards; in one case, I did a contract that normally awarded 1 science, but I instead gained 118. (The general useless of reputation once you hit a certain amount makes this even more pronounced, but that\u0027s a different discussion.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESOLUTION: Cap each strategy\u0027s benefit at, say, 100% of the \u0022native\u0022 reward in the destination resource. That is, if a contract pays 10 science before strategies are considered, then each of the two \u002Bresearch strategies can at most convert enough money or reputation to add another \u002B10 science, regardless of what percentage you\u0027ve set the strategy to. The percentages would still matter for those contracts that add good amounts of all three resources, but it\u0027d keep these other types from getting out of control.
