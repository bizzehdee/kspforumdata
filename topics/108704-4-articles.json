Do they have any stock purpose?\n\nIn any event, courage, stupidity, badassery, and experience amounts are all things that should be added to the tooltips. The first three can probably go in the trait tooltip (since it\u0027s always shown, regardless of game type) and the experience amount (current / experience for next level) can go in the star icon tooltip.\n\nAnd yes, maybe I\u0027ll make the wrench yellow. ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sarxis","CreatedById":130923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T23:16:44Z","Content":"These are great DM, and timely.

The experience field will only show experience that has already been granted (the events that gave that experience should show up in the \u0022Career Log\u0022 section of the tooltip).\n\nThe second part of the experience field, under the slash, is the amount needed to advance to the next level (I think 2, 8, 16, 32, and 64 are required for each level). It doesn\u0027t show the actual level, that is handled by the star icons.\n\nI see now that I should probably include the first two digits after the decimal though for the current experience.
