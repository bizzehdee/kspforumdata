The BioCake is fermented in a fermenter part to make ethanol. The ethanol and oil can then be combined in a refinery to make liquid fuel. Each of these steps is as realistic as KSP allows. The refinery part is essentially doing what is done to make biofuels (transesterification.

What I like about it is that the player needs to make choices about how much biomass they harvest for food (and thus reduce their biological CO2--\u0026gt;O2 conversion), and they need to decide whether to compress O2--\u0026gt;oxidizer, or save the O2 for life support.

You could sit down and do the calculations on Kerbal respiration and how many greenhouses you\u0027d need to keep them alive AND make fuel, or you could just slap some greenhouses onto a deep space craft and see if everything will be ok.
