Before it looked hard and complex, but I finally watched a couple quality tutorials (thanks ksp forum and Scott Manley!!) I decided it might not be as hard as I thought it was. After docking two capsules, I was pumped, so I created a space station. Now I have a lifetime supply of rocket fuel, more docking ports than I will ever need (different types too), and a lot of kerbals. Then I realized I didn\u0027t really have an objective, I was just launching the same stuff over and over. So do you have any ideas of what to do with rendezvous and space stations now?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T00:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHOCgaming was making a tourist setup requiring stations in LKO and around Jool but you can pick whatever destinations you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shoveycat","CreatedById":71091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T01:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA fuel depots never a bad idea, also, i like to have about 5-10 escape pods\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LtHeckard","CreatedById":83627,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T01:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might add some Communications docking pods, a Probe Wing, maybe somewhere the Kerbals can hang out, A Hydroponics wing (There are no Hydroponics in KSP so you\u0027ll need to use some imagination \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) A fuel depot is a great idea, you could also add some escape pods and maybe a space plane, a rescue lander, You could also add a space tug (A Probodobodyne based body with RCS fuel and RCS thrusters so you can tug things around your space station **Very useful**) and you could also add (Just for god measure) some battery banks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merlinux","CreatedById":83117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T02:35:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find space stations a lot more useful when they orbit far away bodies you want to explore.
