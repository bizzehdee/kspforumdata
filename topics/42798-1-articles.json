The game relies almost entirely on Unity\u0027s ancient, single-threaded PhysX. Last I heard, the One-man project to make a Bullet Engine plugin for Unity seems to be abandoned, as well as unfinished and unreleased, and there\u0027s literally no other options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you, as you try to claim, know ways to work around it, tell us! How do you get Unity to run multithreaded Rigidbody physics simulations.
