When i looked back at the map that ship no longer had a flight path. manually worked my way into a stable orbit based on the info below the nav ball and left the ship to go back into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. after tooling around in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E for a while checked the tracking station and the ship still did not have a flight path, so i took control again of the craft. when i loaded into the ship it now had a PE of -500,000 and was falling\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
