The teacandle heats the bottom of it. The bottom Pringles can has a section of another Pringles can inside it with both ends closed off as a displacement cylinder. When the cylinder is at the top, the air expands, forcing the diaphragm (balloon) to move up which pushes the straw upward. As it moves upward, the displacement cylinder moves down, forcing the air to the top of the Pringles can which is cold. The air contracts which causes the diaphragm to move down, pulling the displacement cylinder up, and this just repeats.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoxtane","CreatedById":6626,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-22T22:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry putting some ice at the top, to increase the temperature differential.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SteevyT","CreatedById":6183,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-22T22:54:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Phoxtane\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Phoxtane\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry putting some ice at the top, to increase the temperature differential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would, but I would need some way to keep the water from going down the tiny hole the thread runs through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some spare thermal paste and spare cooling block lying around, I\\\u0027ve been thinking about seeing if I can somehow cram that in there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"socket7","CreatedById":3956,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-22T23:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not put the ice in a plastic bag? then it won\\\u0027t leak or ruin the cardboard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SteevyT","CreatedById":6183,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-22T23:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s an idea.
