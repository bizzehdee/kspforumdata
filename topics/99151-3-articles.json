Behind him, the door made a barely audible \u003Cem\u003Eclick\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0For a moment, he just stood. Billy looked gaunt, and pale.

Warm wood paneling covered the walls and ceiling. A dark, intricately patterned carpet adorned the floor, and light came from a pair of stately floor lamps in a pleasing yellow shade. There was a massive, heavy wooden desk in the middle, behind which was a tall leather-covered chair. A pair of thickly padded chairs were in front of it, a large couch off to the side, and several paintings of very serious-looking Kerbals with very serious-looking beards festooned the wall space that was not taken up by bookcases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Please, have a seat,\u0022 Dr. Kerman said, gesturing to one of the comfy chairs.

He saw the door open, saw himself enter, saw the door close. He watched himself stand there for a moment and then... Billy just keeled over. Edgas watched himself recoil to the wall, slide, fall. The door opened. He saw Dr. Kerman and Marshmallow tending to Billy. And then he saw himself just... collapse. More people entered the room, carrying equipment, there was a portable defibrillator, more chaos, Dr. Kerman pointed to Edgas. Someone started examining him. The feed ended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment, Edgas just sat with his mouth hanging open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022B..b...but I saw...\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EI saw...\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman looked at him patiently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas lowered his head to his hands, then to the desk,\u00A0\u0022...I must be going crazy,\u0022 he said to the wood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman put a comforting hand on his wrist,\u00A0\u0022you\u0027re not crazy. Expert, remember?\u0022 He made a weak grin. \u0022Mr. Kerman, I think whatever you saw was just your mind manifesting a defense mechanism to cope with an extremely traumatic experience. Perfectly understandable. And \u003Cem\u003Enormal\u003C/em\u003E. As long as it doesn\u0027t become a habit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked up.

Please?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman suddenly looked very troubled, \u0022I\u0027m... afraid that won\u0027t be possible. You see... in accordance with his will, immediately upon his death, Billy was... cremated.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas\u0027s mouth fell open. He stared wide-eyed.

To choose such a fate, it was unthinkable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022W....what??\u0022 He squeaked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I saw the order myself, and was already familiar the relevant parts of his will.

Has anyone even spoken to her?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncredibly, Dr. Kerman\u0027s expression sank even lower, \u0022oh dear... I... She... Mr. Kerman, she passed away just over a year ago. Her will was the same. Billy was a ward of the State ever since.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe world began swimming. Edgas thought he might faint again. His face became a rictus as he stared at nothing. Dr. Kerman walked over and put a hand on his shoulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come, this place isn\u0027t any good for you,\u0022 Dr. Kerman said, helping Edgas up. He felt like he was floating, like reality was cracking around him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman turned, and looked him in the eyes, \u0022Mr. Kerman, take my advice. Go home. Get some rest. Take a couple of mental health days. You can tell them doctor\u0027s orders. I\u0027ll see you out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMarshmallow was waiting just outside the office door. He loomed over Edgas, frowning. Then he raised a hand bigger than Edgas\u0027s head... and rested it on Edgas\u0027s shoulder as gently as a butterfly. He closed his eyes for a moment, and bowed his head, then turned and walked off, trailing a few new moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman walked Edgas down the wide path, through the pleasant gardens, to just outside of the gate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry about all this, Mr. Kerman, I really am,\u0022 he took Edgas\u0027s hand gently to shake it, \u0022you need some rest, and peace.\u0022 Then sudden, crushing pressure on it snapped Edgas back to reality. Dr. Kerman looked at him with cool fire in his eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I hear Brownlake is very peaceful this time of year,\u0022 his speech was just the slightest bit... off, \u0022you should go there, \u003Cem\u003Etonight\u003C/em\u003E. Have a stroll. Do you good.\u0022 He gave Edgas\u0027s hand a quick shake, turned, and went back into the hospital.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas stood, staring at nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-23T05:23:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2017 05:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T05:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 16: Answers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas was sure he was going crazy. He couldn\u0027t believe he was doing this. This was asinine. And yet, here he was, at Brownlake, at night, wearing a trenchcoat. And a fedora. He hated going out at night. At least the M\u00FCn wasn\u0027t out. From here, as he walked, he\u00A0could just see the small rocket\u00A0sitting on the pad, illuminated by floodlights. Billy was there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Watch where you\u0027re going, you\u00A0spongy, boil-brained, moldwarp!\u0022 Edgas staggered aside and suppressed a yelp as the grumpy little codger\u0027s cane came down squarely on the bridge of his foot. Bewildered for a moment, he opened his mouth to yell after the old coot as he hobbled off, but decided against it. Some people could be so rude! He \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E watching where he was going. Mostly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas sighed, and continued\u00A0on down the winding path. Still, he had to admit, it \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E peaceful out here. The rocket reflected off the small lake, not brown now but a black mirror. The soulful, keening courting call\u00A0of RatSquirrelFishes echoed from shallows. He made sure to keep his distance. A whisp of breeze stirred the faint fragrance of night flowers, and here and there fireflies wandered between the bushes. It was other-worldly, in its way. It was \u003Cem\u003Eindeed\u003C/em\u003E peaceful. His mind began to wander, and he was reminded of a fairy tale from his youth, the story of the Fire Fly Queen, who out-tricked the evil Woodsie Lord, and trapped him in the Full M\u00FCn, which is why it was known to drive people...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a rustle in the bushes, just to his right. Edgas froze, breath tight in his throat. He backed away, trying to peer into the bush...\u00A0he could almost see something...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hand clapped over his mouth, another grabbed him around the waist and dragged him into the bushes behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Quiet! It\u0027s me!\u0022 a voice whispered in his ear. Edgas was released. Looking around, he was in some sort of clearing, hidden in the thicket, just next to the lake. His assailant was...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dr. Kerman?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Who else were you expecting?\u0022 He looked Edgas up and down. \u0022You look ridiculous,\u0022 he pulled the fedora from his head and handed it back, \u0022like I said, you\u0027ve seen too many movies.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022W... \u003Cem\u003Ewhat \u003C/em\u003Eis going on??\u0022 Edgas blurted out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You know something is wrong, don\u0027t you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas hesitated, \u0022I...

But it wasn\u0027t a vision or a hallucination. When the mind is confronted with that which is beyond its understanding, when it\u0027s made to conceive the inconceivable, it creates a defense mechanism. It gives shape to the formless, noise to the soundless, makes perceivable that which it is unable to perceive. It does this to protect itself, like a tree forming a gall around a parasite. When that mechanism fails, and the mind is confronted with pure reality, well, that\u0027s one way to end up in my hospital.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is... that what happened to Billy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know,\u0022 he shook his head, \u0022I don\u0027t think so. Perception does not change reality. Whatever happened to Billy, it was a \u003Cem\u003Emassively \u003C/em\u003Epowerful reality.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas was at a loss, still trying to process. \u0022Why are you only telling me this now? Why not before?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because something has changed. Something is different. Whatever\u0027s happening, it\u0027s happening faster now. Billy was part of that. How, I don\u0027t know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For the guy with all the answers,\u0022 he crossed his arms over his narrow chest, \u0022you don\u0027t know a lot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman laughed heartily. \u0022Oh I \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t \u003C/em\u003Ehave all the answers, Mr. Kerman. I don\u0027t have \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E. Whatever beacon the truth is, I can\u0027t even see that light. Only the shadows it casts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas dropped his arms and looked down, \u0022why me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because you\u0027re involved. You\u0027re a part of it now, you have a roll to play. What that is,\u0022 the doctor grinned in the shadows, \u0022I don\u0027t know. But what I \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E know is, you\u0027re strong. You have to be, or you wouldn\u0027t be here right now. You wouldn\u0027t have lasted this long.\u0022 He stepped forward again. \u0022But more importantly,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emost\u003C/em\u003E importantly, there\u0027s something in \u003Cem\u003Ehere\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 he pressed a finger against Edgas\u0027s chest, \u0022buried deep down, that\u0027s even \u003Cem\u003Estronger\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 he lowered his voice to a whisper, \u0022and it is \u003Cem\u003Esick \u003C/em\u003Eand \u003Cem\u003Etired...\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of always being afraid.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022H... how do you--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman removed the finger, and jammed a thumb into his own chest, \u0022expert, remember?\u0022 He smiled broadly, \u0022I\u0027ve got a certificate and everything.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But...what can \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E do?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman made a sweeping gesture towards the silent rocket on its launchpad,\u00A0\u0022this is the modern age!\u0022 he boomed, \u0022even the inconceivable has to obey a higher authority.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What authority?\u0022 asked Edgas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bureaucracy.\u0022 Dr. Kerman said with a wry grin. \u0022I saw the signature on Billy\u0027s cremation order. The same one was on his sister\u0027s. The same one is on the witness line of his will. The same one, over and over again, is on the paperwork that transferred his guardianship to the State after his sister was murdered.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas\u0027s eyes shot wide open. Dr. Kerman held up a hand again, shaking his head,\u00A0\u0022it\u0027s a name you already know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Who?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Edmund. Kerman.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas staggered. He felt like he\u0027d been gut-punched. \u0022T... that\u0027s not true,\u0022 he said to the grass, \u0022that\u0027s impossible! Edmund is a recluse! He... he never leaves his house, nobody\u0027s even seen him for \u003Cem\u003Eyears!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And there\u0027s a perfectly valid reason for that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right after you returned from the M\u00FCn, he was diagnosed with stage III excessive keratin chelation disorder.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nXKCD. It never made sense. You either got it or you didn\u0027t. If caught very early, the symptoms could be... delayed. It destroyed the body while mostly sparing the mind. And it was \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E fatal. Edgas dropped down to his knees. The bruises... The headaches... The mood swings...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He had it the whole time,\u0022 Edgas whispered to no one, \u0022the whole time we were up there. He never told us. He never said. But the physicals!\u0022 his eyes shot up at Dr. Kerman, \u0022the physicals should have caught that, should have kept him from flying. Let him get treatment.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Edmund had a lot of friends. Still does. Wouldn\u0027t take much to convince a flight surgeon to keep quiet. Especially with a mission like that on the line.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But \u003Cem\u003Ewhy?!\u003C/em\u003E Why would he do that to himself?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman sighed. He offered Edgas his left hand to help him up. \u0022I don\u0027t know. But I\u0027ll tell you the last thing I do know. All this time, he\u0027s been getting the best treatment money can buy. Only \u003Cem\u003Ehe\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E not paying for it. Layland Wutani is. Through a series of dummy corporations to hide the money trail.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas felt that cracking-reality sensation again. \u0022I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know what to do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a lot to take in. You now know everything I do, except for this: there\u0027s someone at the agency who\u0027s working against you. His fingerprints are all over everything, but he\u0027s crafty. He hides well. But there\u0027s someone who\u0027s looking out for you too. He\u0027ll pop in at the right time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I... wait, what?

It\u0027s getting late, and I have to be somewhere in the morning.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked at him in panic. \u0022But I don\u0027t understand! I don\u0027t understand \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E of this!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman clapped him warmly on the shoulder, still with his left hand, \u0022Mr. Kerman, I think you\u0027ll find that, sometimes, when reason fails, you have to just \u003Cem\u003Ebelieve\u003C/em\u003E. And trust that understanding will come in time.\u0022 He smiled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas was overwhelmed. His mind was spinning. That horrible reality-cracking feeling grew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For tonight, I must bid you adieu, I\u0027m afraid,\u0022 Dr. Kerman said, offering his right hand, \u0022it \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E be all right.\u0022 Head still reeling, Edgas took it... and immediately realized his mistake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnngahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u0022 He managed before his vocal cords seemed to melt away. Dr. Kerman caught him as he swooned, still holding his hand tightly, driving the prick into his palm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now don\u0027t you worry, that\u0027s just a sedative,\u0022 he said kindly, \u0022you\u0027ll be up and about in a couple of hours, with a bit of a headache I\u0027m afraid. I\u0027m sorry it has to be this way Mr. Kerman, I am very sorry about everything. Hindsight and all that. But I can\u0027t risk you following me. I\u0027ve played my hand you see, and they\u0027ll come for me, now. I need to destroy the evidence.\u0022 He lowered Edgas gently to the grass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas tried to move but couldn\u0027t, couldn\u0027t even feel himself anymore, as if he were floating. The world began to get fuzzy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman slapped him hard on the cheek, \u0022whoops! Now, now, don\u0027t go just yet.\u0022 He looked down into Edgas\u0027s increasingly unfocused eyes, \u0022I can\u0027t tell you what to do now, but the way I see it, you\u0027ve got two choices. You can go back to your nice, safe cubicle, and cloistered house, and this will all be just another bad dream. Or, you can go down to the beach and see Edmund, but I guarantee you won\u0027t like what you find. Either way, if I were you, I wouldn\u0027t watch that launch tomorrow.\u0022 He folded Edgas\u0027s hands on his stomach, and placed the fedora over them. Edgas\u0027s vision drew back as shadows danced around the edges, the distant cry of the RatSquirrelFishes warbled and reverberated in ears that were no longer his own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027ll do fine, I \u003Cem\u003Ebelieve\u003C/em\u003E in you,\u0022 the doctor sounded a thousand leagues away, \u0022but more importantly, \u003Cem\u003Eshe\u003C/em\u003E believes in you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shadows played in great undulated waves across the sky above, \u0022farewell, Mr. Kerman. Glory to Arstotzka.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe world faded into nothing, and darkness took him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom somewhere far away, Edgas drifted back toward consciousness. He couldn\u0027t breathe... something was on his face... it was in his...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis eyes shot open, and looked into a pair of equally surprised eyes just a centimeter\u00A0away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas screamed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe RatSquirrelFish screamed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe lurched upright, clawing it off his face and throwing it aside. He coughed and gagged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe taste! Jool\u0027s moons, the \u003Cem\u003ETASTE\u003C/em\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe spat and dry-heaved, his tongue lolling out like an overheated hound. For a moment, the RatSquirrelFish regarded him with a wounded expression, then chittered angrily and bounded off back into the lake with a splash. Edgas sat there, hacking, spitting, gasping. He thought of washing his mouth out with lake water, it was so bad, but then remembered why they\u0027d changed the name to \u0022Brownlake\u0022 in the first place. Eventually enough composure returned that he could think again. He looked around in the darkness. He had no idea how long he\u0027d been lying there. He looked at his watch, maybe he could still catch the last--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis watch was gone. He felt around. So was his wallet. So were his shoes. So was his trenchcoat. Even the fedora. Dammit, he \u003Cem\u003Eliked\u003C/em\u003E that fedora. Never could remember where he got it. Some of the wildlife around Brownlake was even more unpleasant than the RatSquirrelFishes, so he thought it best not to linger. With a curse, he shakily rose to his feet. He realized his head was pounding too. With nothing else to do for it, Edgas started walking. He thought the taste would never get out of his mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as the sky was beginning to lighten, Edgas pushed the door to his apartment open, slack-jawed,\u00A0red-eyed, tongue still hanging out. He was exhausted, soaked, and smelly from for walking hours in the humid night. The bus driver hadn\u0027t let him on with no fare. Guy was a big jerk.

He had to be. He was the only one left. If there was any reason, if there were any answers, they had to be with him. So here Edgas was, walking along a lonely, sand sprinkled road flanked by massive dunes. Shielded from the ocean breeze by those\u00A0dunes, the tropical sun beat down on him mercilessly. He\u0027d pleaded with the bus driver to let him off closer to where he was going, but there was no stop there. Guy was a big jerk. Edgas had walked past a sleepy security guard in an unassuming shack next to a long driveway, then up around a bend in the road. He had navigated to the M\u00FCn and back, he could find one enormous house across a sea of dunes. He just hadn\u0027t counted on it being so \u003Cem\u003Ehot\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComing to what he guessed was the right spot, he stopped, and turned east towards a dune that looked the same as every other. He spit a massive wad of gum out onto the sand, and stuffed fresh pieces into his mouth. Damn taste just wouldn\u0027t go away. He looked back and forth along the road, and, seeing no one, struck out up the dune. With some effort, he finally reached the top, and was rewarded with a wonderfully cool breeze from the nearby sea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there it was, spread out along the beach only a couple of kilometers away. Edmund\u0027s house. More of a compound, really. There was a palatial central building, a long dock with several boathouses, many smaller outbuildings, and a garage bigger than Edgas\u0027s entire apartment complex. All with a commanding view of the distant space center. Edgas set off towards it across the undulating dunes. He wasn\u0027t quite sure exactly what he would do, what he would say. He knew this was trespassing, so he crossed the mounds of sand as stealthily as he could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich meant falling down and cursing a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe neared the crest of the last dune, and carefully peered over the edge. The grounds appeared to be deserted. He scanned the area closer. Nothing seemed to move, no one was around, except... there, down on the beach. It looked like a wheelchair. Edgas carefully descended the dune and crept toward the beach, dodging bits of driftwood. Now on level ground, he could move almost silently in the soft sand. The wheelchair was bulky, obviously powered, mounted on small caterpillar tracks. A figure was seated in it, looking east out over the water. As Edgas approached, he could hear the rhythmic sound of a mechanical ventilator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EShhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-pop.
