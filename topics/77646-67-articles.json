Not this 1 - 5 watt garbage the Hams throw up. I have a few 40 Watt UHF 12VDC transceivers that I can interface into a repeater unit and use very little power and nor weight all that much. I am not a fan of using ham radio frequencies simply because the hams in the states here consist of jackasses who know it all and think they own every radio frequency they can tune into. I on the other hand hold a few commercial radio licenses (16) and I have no issue letting this project use one of the frequencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with using the ham radio VHF bands is the ham community will run the bird until the batteries do run flat and will no longer charge.

The whole cubesat needs to return to Earth within a reasonable timeframe, no space junk allowed. A geosync orbit would require thrusters to do that, which is a whole new level of complexity our team just could not make feasible at this point. I guess if we got $200k in the first week of kickstarter (or some ridiculous amount like that) we could see to expanding the whole operation for \u0022proof of concept\u0022 mission objectives (like thrusters). Realistically, though, a first mission with the bar set low will break the status quo of cubesats not being a hobby, but yes a second-job-hobby. This will then bring confidence in our small enterprise to make bigger, better, longer missions later on (with the ultimate objective being a Phobos soft landing, woo!).
