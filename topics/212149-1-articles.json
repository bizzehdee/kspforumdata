KSP1 has *some* of this functionality (none of the above, not truly, though) with more advanced probe cores and experienced Kerbal pilots being able to track the various points (prograde/retrograde/target etc). This does not stop or prevent the player from doing these tasks manually however it does allow for automation of tasks players are going to do most often \u2013 and enables access for players that may not necessarily be as good as others in that regard. Now you might argue that KSP2 then becomes a \u0022button pushing simulator\u0022 however, if these features are unlocked as part of a career mode, or when a Kerbal has high enough experience, then the player will have to work for these utilities, and that work should be rewarded accordingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me personally, it\u2019s about saving me time and allowing me to enjoy the visual spectacle of watching my ship achieve orbit or dock (or land) instead of missing that due to concentrating on the actual task. Not that the task at hand isn\u0027t also exciting in itself, however sometimes I\u0027d just like to step back and enjoy the view.

Outside of that, just large modules/cockpits where you can IVA as the Kerbal and get out of the chair and wander around looking out the windows, perhaps even going EVA from IVA using an airlock, or something.

It lives (citing Scott Manley). Making large, long-range interplanetary ships using trusses is going to be a pain if the Kraken still lives. One of the major issues (at least for me and some of my new modular-truss ship designs) of trying to make ships using truss structures is that they bend and flex - even if strutted - or when under thrust, or (especially) when multiple reaction wheels are in motion - even if they\u0027re on the same plane of motion (I\u0027m relatively new to modular ships built in orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering it would appear truss-based ships are actively encouraged in KSP2 (as we see several truss-style designs - including interstellar ships - in trailers), my concern is that while they are probably the most logical approach to deep space\u00A0exploration missions if they\u0027re going to flex and wobble and generally be a frustrating mess (on account of Kraken attacks), what is the point of even attempting to build one if it\u0027s just going to randomly explode or twist into random shapes and break itself spontaneously?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is being done to address this issue to enable long, thin truss-based ship designs to be viable in KSP2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cailean_556","CreatedById":12297,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T09:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually suggested this about a week ago on the Discord, so I\u0027ll add it here so it doesn\u0027t get lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESUGGESTION:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EMission Programs - Apollo.

I load up a craft complete with a lander and a rover that I have previously designed and assign it to the Aurora mission - it\u0027s automatically renamed \u0027Aurora 2\u0027.
