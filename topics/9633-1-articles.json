Sorry about that. Before 0.13 (I think) you could see stuff pass over you like Tosh\\\u0027s Jupiter or GoDammit\\\u0027s death star. But, a benefit from that is that it let\\\u0027s KSP process information much faster, so that way the game doesn\\\u0027t slow to a crawl.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-17T04:37:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYet we can see Kerbol and Mun.

Kerbin and the Mun are celestial bodies, not spacecraft, and so are rendered until the point comes that you are very far away from them.

The configuration I referred to would be deep in the software code, not something we could tweak. At least, not at this stage of the game\\\u0027s development. Kerbol is just a powerful light point, so I\\\u0027m not sure he counts at all. But Mun is an exception to the 2 km rule, which makes me wonder if the devs can make certain objects visible farther away than other objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, Kerbin is a spaceship, and we are all Kerbanauts on some kind of trip, man....\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
