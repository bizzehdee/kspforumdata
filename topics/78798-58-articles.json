It looks like some ModuleManager magic but I\u0027m not seeing what I need to do or what goes where. I also seem to have ended up with .dlls for module manager for 2.1.5, 2.2.0 and 2.2.1. Not sure if I can delete the old ones without borking some of my mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso getting a strange problem with the Karbonite scanner. I\u0027ve got it on a sat in orbit and to start with I clicked on it, started scanning. When I tell it to \u0027show me hotspots\u0027 it gives me the little orange bubbles. I do however have 3 sats in orbit - each only shows me concentrations near it specifically. Then, strangely, it would no longer let me toggle the sensor on and off. It says that it\u0027s off, but it\u0027s still showing me the hotspots. If I try to toggle it on it seems to toggle on for a second, then is off again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running x64 but otherwise I\u0027m not sure why it hates me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI deleted Kethane which vaped my prior scansat network, which is fine, it was all running dated tech anyway. I just want to make sure I\u0027m not going to have to vape and replace this new loadout - in career mode that stuff costs money \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo short version of what I need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

I have 3 module manager version dlls in my gamedata too, cuz why leave borking my game up to chance, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

I\u0027m jazzed and excited about the design and direction this has taken and has inspired me to pick up TAC and MKS after I get a handle for Karbonite, resource management and exploiting KAS to scatter LIVING Kerbals through out my system, instead of the dead Kebals and debris I\u0027ve generally packed it with in prior playthroughs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Phers\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Phers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou need to be running the DEV version of Scansat. once you have that installed click on settings and select show resources / Karbonite.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
