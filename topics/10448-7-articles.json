Hope it gets resolved and you don\\\u0027t have to start over.\n\nContracts aren\\\u0027t the only way to earn decent money. In the most recent one the entry fee is $2,000 which could be the difference between being able to do the next mission. Atm I have been doing the 25km altitude challenges and have found spending about $1,000 or so more has made my profit go up by about $3,000, not just because the mission is worth more but there is more salvage so you don\\\u0027t really \\\u0027spend\\\u0027 as much.\n\nWhen using properly staged rockets you really want to stick as much on each decoupler. To do this I have been radially mounting SRBs to a central one, and then firing them in sequence. E.g. the central one and two of the outer ones, and then going to the next two and then the last two of six. This gives a long duration of thrust and then you eject the entire stack which will be most of the weight one chute can take, for only one stack decoupler."},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T07:10:29Z","Content":"I had thought on a few occasions something along the lines of \\\u0027dang those small engines really are frugal with their fuel\\\u0027, but never stopped to think and check whether it was at all correct.

From now on out, the explosive decoupling of solid rocket boosters attached to **liquid** fuel engines is strictly prohibited. Awaras discovered a bug with that that causes an approximately twofold increase in fuel efficiency of the liquid engine after such a separation. This is considered cheating from now on. Note that the explosive decoupling of SRBs attached to other SRBs is still perfectly fine and allowed. Awaras has discovered this bug due to the fact that his designs the past few turns have (unknowingly) relied on it, causing him to operate impossibly effective and earn huge amounts of money. We\\\u0027ve discussed what to do about this and decided on slashing his starting funds for turn 7 to $45000 (less than half of what he had), additionally I\\\u0027m reinstating the first bonuses on the kubble, probe and orbit missions. Also Awaras will be unable to claim any of these bonuses until after turn 10. These measures still leave him with a slight advantage due to the bug, mostly technology wise. I think this is fair, he didn\\\u0027t intentionally cheat and his having of the technologies have reduced the prices for the rest as well.\n\nOn to the turn 7 report!\n\n**Contract**\n\nThe **contract** for this turn saw lackluster participation, perhaps because of the slightly higher entry fee.
