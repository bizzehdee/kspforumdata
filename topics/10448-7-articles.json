From now on out, the explosive decoupling of solid rocket boosters attached to \u003Cstrong\u003Eliquid\u003C/strong\u003E fuel engines is strictly prohibited. Awaras discovered a bug with that that causes an approximately twofold increase in fuel efficiency of the liquid engine after such a separation. This is considered cheating from now on. Note that the explosive decoupling of SRBs attached to other SRBs is still perfectly fine and allowed. Awaras has discovered this bug due to the fact that his designs the past few turns have (unknowingly) relied on it, causing him to operate impossibly effective and earn huge amounts of money. We\\\u0027ve discussed what to do about this and decided on slashing his starting funds for turn 7 to $45000 (less than half of what he had), additionally I\\\u0027m reinstating the first bonuses on the kubble, probe and orbit missions. Also Awaras will be unable to claim any of these bonuses until after turn 10. These measures still leave him with a slight advantage due to the bug, mostly technology wise. I think this is fair, he didn\\\u0027t intentionally cheat and his having of the technologies have reduced the prices for the rest as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn to the turn 7 report!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContract\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Econtract\u003C/strong\u003E for this turn saw lackluster participation, perhaps because of the slightly higher entry fee.

I get $250 from each spent SRB and in the 80km altitude challenge and so I recover about $3,000 from the SRBs alone. Yes I know it means I have to spend some money for parachutes and decouplers but the savings are worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrange, I never found it really worth it. One parachute can save 2 SRB. That\\\u0027s like, $250 saved but parachutes are quite heavy themselves and make the rocket need more SRBs as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fermun","CreatedById":593,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-22T23:44:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is only my second turn, and I don\\\u0027t have salvage tech yet.

You can get up to 8 spent SRBs and a stack decoupler on one single parachute.
