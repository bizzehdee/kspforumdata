general development news:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContinued conversion work on the ModularXXX PartModules is going well.\u00A0 Actually have the code back to a state where it will compile, though I haven\u0027t tried doing so yet -- still quite a bit more back-end work to do before it will be ready for testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn that note -- I have decided to delay the release of the \u0027reworked Modular Parts\u0027 to an undecided point in the future.\u00A0 While working through stuff, I have realized that there is a lot more that needs to be done, and quite a bit of it will be \u0027craft breaking\u0027.\u00A0 So, the current tentative release for this work will likely coincide with the KSP 1.4 update.\u00A0 I\u0027m going to continue working on and developing it it in a separate branch, and might issue some pre-release versions prior to 1.4 (depending on timing / where I\u0027m at compared to 1.4, etc), but the current intent is to hold off on the craft/save breakage until the major KSP version bump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, this week I\u0027ll be shifting focus back to generic cleanup tasks a bit -- fixing outstanding texture, config, and balance related problems that will carry over to the future releases.\u00A0 Candidate work includes ongoing bugfixes, landing-legs for the LV tanks/general use, and continued conversion of parts for recoloring and/or PBR texturing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of the reason for the major changes is that I\u0027m fairly certain I\u0027m going to be unifying nearly all of the ModularPart functions into a single PartModule that can have sub-modules enabled/added/swapped through config.\u00A0 Every one of the current modular part-modules duplicates a large majority of the code from the others, with only some \u0027minor\u0027 variations to handle the part-specific functionality (e.g. the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E selection on the MUS, the thrust updating on the MSRB, solar panels on MSC), and I believe this could all be handled more consistently, and be easier to maintain, if it were all managed by a single set of code.\u00A0 Some of the stuff I have learned since I first designed those systems would now allow for it to all be combined while still keeping the code maintainable and adaptable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis won\u0027t apply to -everything-, but only \u0027nearly everything\u0027.\u00A0 Some specific \u0027ModularXXX\u0027 part-modules would still exist with specific functions that are intended to be used as stand-alone -- such as the ModularHeatShield, ModularRCS, and a few others.\u00A0 What it will apply to would be the MFT tanks, ModularStationCore parts, MSRB parts, MUS, ModularCargoBay, and ModularServiceModule parts / modules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current intended design is an \u00278-slot\u0027 modular part.\u00A0 Parts that did not use all of the slots would simply not have them enabled (no GUI/etc for unused slots).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNose

adjust \u0027thrust transforms\u0027 in.\u00A0 They can point to the same slot (MSC), or different slots (MSRB).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThis feature, if used to its full extent, can allow for integrated and swappable engines in modular part setups.\u00A0 With the caveat that the stats for the engine module are taken from the \u0027model definitions\u0027, and any potential adjustments to engine stats would have to be done there.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUpper and lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control

tank slot is using a \u00275m to 3.75m\u0027 adapter model, then the \u0027nose adapter\u0027 slot would automatically have its diameter scaled to match up with the top of the 5\u0026gt;3.75

(nor do I have any way to know if they were \u0027fixed\u0027 if I were to adjust them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, not sure what to tell you on this one.\u00A0 Short of someone taking a look at the models who also knows about RPM, it is not something that I\u0027ll be working on.\u00A0 If someone can tell me exactly what needs to be done (e.g. move \u0027transform XXXX up 0.15m on X axis), I can likely get it fixed up, but I do not have the time or patience to find/download/setup RPM just to test a feature that I will never use and have no interest in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts not intended to be made of gold.\u00A0 It is simply gold colored.\u00A0 And as the precise material in use is different and varied between parts using the color, \u0027gold foil\u0027 was the most appropriately generic and descriptive name.\u00A0 Perhaps \u0027golden colored foil\u0027 would be a bit more apt, but is a far more cumbersome description.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can, of course, patch the name in your personal game if it bugs you that badly.\u00A0 Find the TexturesUnlimited/PresetColors.cfg, and patch the \u0027title=\u0027 line for the gold foil entry to say whatever you want in the GUI (don\u0027t patch the name=XXX entry, or you\u0027ll break all the configs using that

camera.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a conventional RPM camera, you provide a transform, and (optionally) rotation and translation components to configure it how you need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the docking camera, RPM searches the part for a transform named \u0027dockingNode\u0027.\u00A0 If it finds that transform, it uses it for the camera location.\u00A0 If there isn\u0027t a transform with that name, RPM simply grabs the root transform (I believe) of the part.\u00A0 There aren\u0027t any knobs you can adjust to move the docking camera around, either, so it\u0027d require model changes to support RPM docking cameras.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou *could* add a conventional RPM camera to the part and adjust it to where you need it, but it would not work for a docking camera without also editing the MFD config.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFWIW, this will not be a problem in MAS, since every camera has to be specified.\u00A0 I\u0027m hoping to have a major update for MAS in the next week or two, although there\u0027s only one IVA currently available for it (and it\u0027s not an SSTU

will be used to line up the size of the part to the fuel tank\u0027s diameter.\u00A0 When sized properly (this is up to the user to do), the struts on the leg will line up precisely with the struts/framing for the fuel tank.\u00A0 The \u0027leg quad\u0027 will have another attach node, in the same position as the first and facing downward, so that an engine may then be attached to that

struts on the tank), but there might be a couple of struts that clip into the fuel tanks.\u00A0 The \u0027medium\u0027 (and/or heavy) leg variants will have their struts setup specifically to line up
