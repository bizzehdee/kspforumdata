Actually have the code back to a state where it will compile, though I haven\u0027t tried doing so yet -- still quite a bit more back-end work to do before it will be ready for testing.\n\nOn that note -- I have decided to delay the release of the \u0027reworked Modular Parts\u0027 to an undecided point in the future.  While working through stuff, I have realized that there is a lot more that needs to be done, and quite a bit of it will be \u0027craft breaking\u0027.  So, the current tentative release for this work will likely coincide with the KSP 1.4 update.  I\u0027m going to continue working on and developing it it in a separate branch, and might issue some pre-release versions prior to 1.4 (depending on timing / where I\u0027m at compared to 1.4, etc), but the current intent is to hold off on the craft/save breakage until the major KSP version bump.\n\nSo, this week I\u0027ll be shifting focus back to generic cleanup tasks a bit -- fixing outstanding texture, config, and balance related problems that will carry over to the future releases.  Candidate work includes ongoing bugfixes, landing-legs for the LV tanks/general use, and continued conversion of parts for recoloring and/or PBR texturing.\n\nPart of the reason for the major changes is that I\u0027m fairly certain I\u0027m going to be unifying nearly all of the ModularPart functions into a single PartModule that can have sub-modules enabled/added/swapped through config.  Every one of the current modular part-modules duplicates a large majority of the code from the others, with only some \u0027minor\u0027 variations to handle the part-specific functionality (e.g. the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E selection on the MUS, the thrust updating on the MSRB, solar panels on MSC), and I believe this could all be handled more consistently, and be easier to maintain, if it were all managed by a single set of code.  Some of the stuff I have learned since I first designed those systems would now allow for it to all be combined while still keeping the code maintainable and adaptable.\n\nThis won\u0027t apply to -everything-, but only \u0027nearly everything\u0027.  Some specific \u0027ModularXXX\u0027 part-modules would still exist with specific functions that are intended to be used as stand-alone -- such as the ModularHeatShield, ModularRCS, and a few others.  What it will apply to would be the MFT tanks, ModularStationCore parts, MSRB parts, MUS, ModularCargoBay, and ModularServiceModule parts / modules.\n\nThe current intended design is an \u00278-slot\u0027 modular part.  Parts that did not use all of the slots would simply not have them enabled (no GUI/etc for unused slots).\n\n- Nose Adapter\n- Upper Tank\n- Core/Intertank\n- Lower Tank\n- Mount Adapter\n- Upper \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E (positioned on \u0027upper tank\u0027, \u0027core\u0027, or \u0027nose\u0027)\n- Lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E (positioned on \u0027lower tank\u0027, \u0027core\u0027, or \u0027mount\u0027)\n- Solar Panel (positioned on \u0027core tank\u0027, or other depending on config)\n\nFeature set would include:\n\n- All sections (except \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E) would have built-in animation handling, including \u0027deploy limit\u0027 if enabled by the currently selected model definition.\n- \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel type selection linked to optional \u0027support container\u0027 setup (e.g. MUS, but with fuel type selection for both main and secondary containers).\n- Option to have \u0027integrated engines\u0027 in any of the nose/upper/core/lower/mount model selections.  With the caveat that if the ModuleEngines is present in the part config, then **every model for the engine-equipped slot**  **must have engine thrust transforms**-- this is because the stock engine module cannot be disabled.\n    - This feature is mostly intended to maintain compatibilty with the ModularStationCore parts with integrated engines, but will also be used by the ModularSolidRocketBooster parts.  So, ideally, this feature will have two inputs -- which slot to derive \u0027thrust\u0027 values from, and which slot to adjust \u0027thrust transforms\u0027 in.  They can point to the same slot (MSC), or different slots (MSRB).\n    - This feature, if used to its full extent, can allow for integrated and swappable engines in modular part setups.  With the caveat that the stats for the engine module are taken from the \u0027model definitions\u0027, and any potential adjustments to engine stats would have to be done there.\n- Upper and lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E selections, including \u0027none\u0027.  Both sets of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports will use a single thrust-transform name, and a single ModuleRCS, but will have independent controls for positioning and model selection.\n- Can define in the part-config which \u0027slots\u0027 contribute to volume/mass/cost for the part, with the volume/mass/cost being taken from the model-definitions (with optional overrides in the part-module-config itself).\n- Upper/lower tank, and adapter models \u0027chain-scale\u0027 from the central tank model.\n    - Adapters model definitions will start to contain data regarding their \u0027profile\u0027 -- core diameter, top diameter, bottom diameter.\n    - Any adapter can have a different core/top/bottom diameter.  Further slots up/down the chain will respect that diameter and be auto-scaled to line up properly.\n        - E.g. if \u0027Core\u0027 slot is 5m, and the upper tank slot is using a \u00275m to 3.75m\u0027 adapter model, then the \u0027nose adapter\u0027 slot would automatically have its diameter scaled to match up with the top of the 5\u003E3.75 adapter.\n- Integrated fairing support at the plugin level.  Might not be enabled in all part-configs, but should be functional when it is enabled.\n    - Will include the option to specify \u0027top\u0027, \u0027bottom\u0027 and \u0027body\u0027 fairings.  Still doing concept development on this a bit, will know more in the future.\n- Nearly any combination of features can be used for any part.  Want a modular \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E type part that also includes solar panels, and an integrated service/cargo bay in the nose?  Sure thing.  One-part probe core with integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, solar, engines?  Sure.  Single part cargo bay that includes a built-in service module?  Yep, should be doable as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-11T19:04:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2017 07:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-11T19:31:55Z","Content":"Made this thing last night:\n\n![jyQABe2.png](https://i.imgur.com/jyQABe2.png)\n\nIt uses a petal adapter as a service bay: stock panels, since i wanted them really small, and a load of science experiments.

How do the colliders respond to being clipped?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-12T15:09:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E General question:  Can clipping parts into each other be responisble for ships flinging apart, i.e. Kraken strikes? How do the colliders respond to being clipped?\n\u003E \n\nKSP models craft/vessels as a collection of parts, with each part having its own RigidBody, and all being joined together/held together by Unity Joint components.  Colliders that belong to a single rigidbody (part) will never collide with other colliders on that rigidbody (part). \n\nKSP also has code in place on vessel creation that loops through every collider on a vessel and sets an \u0027ignore other colliders on vessel\u0027 flag.  So colliders on a vessel should never collide with other colliders on the same vessel, even if they are from different rigidbodies(parts).\n\nNow -- this all breaks down a bit when mods come into play.  Mods are capable of bypassing these collider checks, or simply creating new colliders after the checks have been run.  Either of those can create situations where colliders within the same vessel can \u0027collide\u0027 -- these instances manifest as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E in major cases or in minor clipping cases, phantom forces.   KSPWheel also enables its wheel-colliders to exert forces on colliders in the same vessel (intentionally), so craft with wheels/legs need to take extra care in design to no clip the functional suspension part of wheels.\n\nBut I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve all seen what happens if you happen to decouple parts that were clipping, where some of the clipping parts become a new craft -- instant explosions.  This is because when you decouple something/undock, KSP splits the vessel into two separate vessels.  Each with their own colliders, which only ignore colliders on that same vessel (but are happy to collide with the colliders from the other new vessel).\n\nSo generally speaking, from the games perspective, when everything is setup/working, clipping is fine.  Clip away.\n\n(if you are having problems with some clipping-related Kraken-strikes while using SSTU parts, please file a bug-report with as much info as possible; it is entirely possible that I\u0027ve missed one of these collider updates somewhere in one of the modular parts; other mods might have that problem as well if they deal at all with model/collider manipulation)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-12T15:29:55Z","Content":"The reason I ask is that when I start getting a lot of ships docked, stuff goes seriously wrong sometimes when getting near other ships or after docking.

Due to lots of texture and model sharing between parts, there is no clean way to split the mod up.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It can be done, but only with considerable effort.  Basically you have to pick what parts you want to keep, and then go through every config file associated with those parts to note the models and texture names that need to be kept (part.cfg, model-data.cfg, texture-set.cfg).  This is sometimes non-obvious, as a simple thing like an engine also requires all of the models and textures for the mounts and adapters.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On the bright side of that -- I currently have it in my TODO notes to reduce the texture resolution for the diff/spec/met/ao textures for the recolorable parts.  Should result in a massive decrease in RAM use when just the default install is used.  Might see this implemented in one of the next few releases (if it doesn\u0027t muddy up the textures too much).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Likely the RPM camera position/config is configured incorrectly.  Could be either in the models, or in the config.  Generally the SSTU parts with built-in docking ports -should- have viable docking camera transforms.  But I don\u0027t use RPM, so they have never been tested. (nor do I have any way to know if they were \u0027fixed\u0027 if I were to adjust them).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sadly, not sure what to tell you on this one.  Short of someone taking a look at the models who also knows about RPM, it is not something that I\u0027ll be working on.  If someone can tell me exactly what needs to be done (e.g. move \u0027transform XXXX up 0.15m on X axis), I can likely get it fixed up, but I do not have the time or patience to find/download/setup RPM just to test a feature that I will never use and have no interest in.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Its not intended to be made of gold.  It is simply gold colored.  And as the precise material in use is different and varied between parts using the color, \u0027gold foil\u0027 was the most appropriately generic and descriptive name.  Perhaps \u0027golden colored foil\u0027 would be a bit more apt, but is a far more cumbersome description.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You can, of course, patch the name in your personal game if it bugs you that badly.  Find the TexturesUnlimited/PresetColors.cfg, and patch the \u0027title=\u0027 line for the gold foil entry to say whatever you want in the GUI (don\u0027t patch the name=XXX entry, or you\u0027ll break all the configs using that color).\n\u003E \n\nSI;\n\nThis is wehat I ghot concerning the \u0022Docking: camera from MOARdV, wor what it\u0027s worth:\n\n\u0022\n\nThe docking camera in RPM is a special-case camera. \n\nIn a conventional RPM camera, you provide a transform, and (optionally) rotation and translation components to configure it how you need.\n\nFor the docking camera, RPM searches the part for a transform named \u0027dockingNode\u0027.  If it finds that transform, it uses it for the camera location.  If there isn\u0027t a transform with that name, RPM simply grabs the root transform (I believe) of the part.  There aren\u0027t any knobs you can adjust to move the docking camera around, either, so it\u0027d require model changes to support RPM docking cameras.\n\nYou \\*could\\* add a conventional RPM camera to the part and adjust it to where you need it, but it would not work for a docking camera without also editing the MFD config.\n\nFWIW, this will not be a problem in MAS, since every camera has to be specified.  I\u0027m hoping to have a major update for MAS in the next week or two, although there\u0027s only one IVA currently available for it (and it\u0027s not an SSTU capsule).\u0022\n\nSo again, if it isn\u0027t something that I can edit and p[lay around with myself, it\u0027s no biggie to me, there are always workarounds ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nHave a great holiday!"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T00:21:44Z","Content":"Just in time for X-mas (and/or other Holidays)...\n\n![CsLUcTz.png](https://i.imgur.com/CsLUcTz.png)\n\nAnd also...\n\n![PtfNg69.png](https://i.imgur.com/PtfNg69.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T01:33:00Z","Content":"![f3b77a25051a2a5d092bcdcd1fdce5dfe90f3407](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/f3/f3b77a25051a2a5d092bcdcd1fdce5dfe90f34078a95bdce6f051751f4803fed.jpg)   ![f0d98f68c871dadff2962d5c2cf37722.jpg](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f0/d9/8f/f0d98f68c871dadff2962d5c2cf37722.jpg)\n\nI pressed the like button 20 times, but they don\u0027t show up for some reason ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-13T01:33:56Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2017 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T03:36:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The reason I ask is that when I start getting a lot of ships docked, stuff goes seriously wrong sometimes when getting near other ships or after docking.

Likely will be a few weeks before they are usable (going to be at least another couple days just figuring out the rigging)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T20:45:52Z","Content":"I smell small surveyor type lander possibilites."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T20:53:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 44 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![2ChuYmq.png](https://i.imgur.com/2ChuYmq.png)\n\u003E \n\nSince this looks like it has structure above and below the tank, will it have that spacing (tank height) as something that adjusts in standard height increments, or are there simply multiple versions?\n\nRegardless, that looks so cool."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T21:06:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Since this looks like it has structure above and below the tank, will it have that spacing (tank height) as something that adjusts in standard height increments, or are there simply multiple versions?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Regardless, that looks so cool.\n\u003E \n\nIt is intended to be a single part that has four integrated legs.  The attach node on it should be attached to the bottom attach node on the fuel tank.  The \u0027scale\u0027 control on the leg will be used to line up the size of the part to the fuel tank\u0027s diameter.  When sized properly (this is up to the user to do), the struts on the leg will line up precisely with the struts/framing for the fuel tank.  The \u0027leg quad\u0027 will have another attach node, in the same position as the first and facing downward, so that an engine may then be attached to that attach node (or alternatively, use the \u0027interstage\u0027 node on the fuel tank to attach the engine).\n\nThe leg shown above is the \u0027light\u0027 version -- it is intended specifically for the \u00270\u0027 length tanks (as shown in the render).  For longer tank lengths, the \u0027light\u0027 version will still work (the struts will still line up with the struts on the tank), but there might be a couple of struts that clip into the fuel tanks.  The \u0027medium\u0027 (and/or heavy) leg variants will have their struts setup specifically to line up with the longer LV fuel tanks (these will not have structure \u0027above\u0027 the tank, only beside and below).\n\nBoth / all variants will -also- be usable on standard fuel tanks, though on some of the models the upper support struts (non-animated) will clip into the tank (it will look like only the main leg and lower bracing exists).\n\n(so no, there will not be adjustable height; there will be multiple different legs (light/med/heavy); use whatever you think looks best for your craft)"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T21:17:08Z","Content":"Awesome.

So, yes, but with increased part count as you\u0027ll have to use multiples of the single leg (KSPWheel isn\u0027t setup to support dynamic part manipulation like that).  The single leg version will not feature the \u0027bottom\u0027 attach node setup either, so it will require some manual offset positioning to line it up appropriately (but you\u0027ll also be able to use arbitrary scales for the legs).\n\nSo if you want a \u0027perfect fit\u0027 of 4 legs on the LV tanks -- choose the leg quad(s).  If you want \u0027something else\u0027, use the stand alone leg and set it up however you want (position, scale, rotation, symmetry count)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T21:39:21Z","Content":"Was horsing around with the \u0022make everything metal\u0022 patch [@Electrocutor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/109593-electrocutor/) posted in the TU thread...\n\n![5xNrArA.png](https://i.imgur.com/5xNrArA.png)"}]}
