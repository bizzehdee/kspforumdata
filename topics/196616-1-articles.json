But when you track one, and see its orbit, you will instantly be able to tell if it\u0027s a comet (very eccentric orbit, coming close to the sun and then swinging out to Jool or beyond) or an asteroid (generally hugs the orbit of a planet fairly closely, sometimes has direct encounters with said planet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Souptime","CreatedById":204451,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-30T21:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, OK.

Comets often have distinctive names like Froly-Lerdun-Arbretty\u00A0rather than being Ast.
