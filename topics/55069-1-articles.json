Generally I send 1 kerbal on a course with just enough grunt to escape kerbin soi in the direction of it\u0027s travel.

You get loads of science for \u0027return of a craft from the surface of X\u0027, but like everything else it suffers diminishing returns. It\u0027s important to remember that fly-by of X and orbit of X are seperate sci categories with their own dimin.returns. Often when a few points short of something I need for a planned expedition I\u0027ll send a fly-by of Mun/minmus, since I generally go directly to landing in career and those 2 situations (4 if you havent returned from an orbit of the moon yet) let me get the last parts I need.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T10:49:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith your restrictions (remote tech and TAC) I would aim at using probes on nearest planets.
