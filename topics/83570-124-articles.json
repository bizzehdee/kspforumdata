I took a stock Aeris 4a and under normal conditions you should just be able to floor the whiplash turbojets on a 30 degree ascent until they run out of air. With B9 they mercilessly explode between 8000 and 9000 meters even if you put them on zero thrust. This is caused by a totally outdated global module manager config called B9_Aerospace-Squad_Jet_Balance.cfg.
