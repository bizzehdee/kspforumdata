It\u0027s like a whole new game. I added the skybox and lens flare from someone else because of personal preference but all the necessary mods are in the pack, you just add onto it what you like then. I will try and find the skybox and lens flare I\u0027m using and update. \n\nTweety\n\nEdit: found it, I used Proots skybox and lens flare, once the initial mods are installed you can just pick and change the actual visuals and textures from other modders.
