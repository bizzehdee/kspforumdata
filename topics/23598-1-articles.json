That\u0027s why I\u0027ve started thinking it\u0027s about time we had different \u0022flavors\u0022 - complete parts packs that provide an alternative to the vanilla parts. These wouldn\u0027t be just some engines, fuel tanks, and decouplers. No, these would cover all the bases - aviation, space station modules, probe instruments - and then some, in addition to being high quality, balanced parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, I think KW Rockets is closest to this goal, although they have a long way to go. Their parts all look good and work well, and they\u0027re balanced too. However, there are no command pods, plane parts, or utility/scientific parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know ultimately it\u0027s up to the independent mod developers, but what do you guys think about an effort to provide complete, alternative KSP experiences?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom1499","CreatedById":38308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T16:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be nice, I personally love KW, it really does its style well, and the relative clean-ness of its parts can fit with stock. It is however, a launch vehicle pack, and so we have no other things. Nova punch does exactly what your on about, I dont particularly like the style, however I would appreciate a KW everything else. I also think people would like a B9 launch vehicle pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I got BCed","CreatedById":18121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T17:33:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve wanted to do something like this for ages, but don\u0027t have the resources to do it alone.
