This device needs at its center of gravity a GPS unit, there needs to be a control device placed in the same orbit but without an on switch for the resonator. The first device should be place outside of gravimetric range of second and behind the second device in its orbit. Then you look to see if the first device over time can raise its orbit relative to the second. Since the rate of acceleration is so small (uN) one does not expect it to gain velocity on the second or close the gap between the two, instead one expects the first to climb and its omega to decrease.

So if the ablation test proves not to show signficant ablation of labeled copper, then the only test that has any meaning is to demonstrate acceleration in space. If the ablation test shows significant loss of copper from the surface AND shows that the amount and momentum of copper released explains at least 50% of the thrust, then the inspace test need not be performed. But if not, then the inspace test needs to be performed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kunok","CreatedById":147982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T22:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222465959\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288197\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458509622\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should note I also opened a thread for a specific type of test that can be performed here on earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI totally missed that thread \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E I may comment there (tomorrow, is too late), but I have not many things to add, only the manufacturing process doesn\u0027t feel right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T02:46:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222465776\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288197\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458501533\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022147982\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kunok\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, kunok said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I understand the idea of a prototype, but even if we put the device in space and it works, if we put latter after some test in a commercial satellite and stop working, we don\u0027t have any idea of why, and we can\u0027t really study why stop working because is in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe lose satellites every year from failures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
