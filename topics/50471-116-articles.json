RSS exacerbates it because it throws a lot *more* PQS terrain around. Though as SpacedInvader says, RSSv6\u002B adds another 200MB or so of memory usage on top of whatever extra memory the far larger number of PQS quads is taking up. Since you\u0027ve been playing without ATM, however, that means that all your TGA textures have been sitting in memory uncompressed. Even if you only try ATM basic, you should see a considerable decrease in RAM usage.

First, because of the relatively low resolution map that KSP uses and the way I created this, there are some regions with highly varied terrain that almost always return the transition zone. These regions can span 300km-400km and sometimes more, so my recommendation is to avoid attempting to land near the edge of a biome, with the more solid the color on the above map, the less likely to return the transition zone. In addition to this, every crater on this map is representative of craters that can actually be found in the game. With that in mind, be aware that their rims will almost always fall in the transition zone, so if you\u0027re landing in a crater, it\u0027s best to shoot for the middle rather than accepting a landing spot near the edge. This is dependent on the size of the crater, however, with the smaller craters being affected much more than the larger. I\u0027m currently working on a way to recreate this map without the need for the transition zone, but that will take some time and I for one would like to start exploring in the meantime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, before anyone says it, I know that there isn\u0027t really a Mare Apollo, but I hope to add the Apollo crater at a later time so I needed something that will differentiate between the crater and the water feature. Also, again, before anyone says it, I too wanted to have the Mare Tranquillitatis be its own biome, but that would have lead to the necessity of naming many more lunar seas, which would have greatly increased the number of biomes, and as a result thrown game balance out the window. Look for it in a future release of this map.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
