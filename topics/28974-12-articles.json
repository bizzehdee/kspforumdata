Luckly for me enough of my lander survived that everything went good. I then launched another mission and on Eva I killed the poor kerbal. So I send another mission and while Evaing the kerbal over the kraken struck and killed the kerbal. So I went back to my lander and waited for the launch window then fired up my acent stage and went back to kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chiron0224","CreatedById":147812,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-06T04:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222862265\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002228974\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479936585\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277574\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wallace\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn \u200E11\u200E/\u200E23\u200E/\u200E2016 at 4:29 PM, Wallace said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem that always returns for me is fixed solar panels all endin up edge on to the sun, battery goes flat, probe is bricked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne trick is to arrange them in accordance with the faces of a platonic solid.\u00A0 Another way to say that is to arrange them like the faces of a die.\u00A0 So if you know the dice used in D\u0026amp;D this will be familiar, if not you can google them.\u00A0 So if you have 4 solar panels you want to arrange them in the pattern of the surfaces of a tetrahedron (or d4 to continue the die analogy) if you have 6 arrange them in the six faces of a cube, if 8 then arrange them like an octahedron or d8.\u00A0 These arrangements will guarantee that at least one of them is always facing the sun.\u00A0 I should also note that certain shapes are made necessary by the design of your craft (for example, it would be hard to do the cube since the bottom of your craft has an engine where your panel should go, but you could do a tetrahedron instead).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-06T04:44:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2016 04:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Chiron0224\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matthomas7","CreatedById":157825,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-06T21:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first interplanetary trip was to Duna.
