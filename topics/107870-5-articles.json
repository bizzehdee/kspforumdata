Atlas was developed by Convair (then General Dynamics, then Lockheed) under contract. It was neither designed nor built by US government employees. Its chief designer, Karel Bossart, was a Convair employee. Thor had more USAF involvement, but the components were still all contracted out, and overall airframe and integration was done by Douglas, not by the Air Force. The fact that \u0022USAF\u0022 was painted on the missiles means the USAF *bought* them, not that they *built* them.\u003Cp\u003ESeriously. Particularly for Atlas, the only sense in which it was a USAF project is that it was developed under a USAF contract. Which was my initial point -- the government \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E give money to private companies to do stuff like building rockets, and \u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E do it itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe USAF also bought the missiles\u0027 development.

We may or may not have had the technology to go to Mars since the \u002780s but we haven\u0027t gone because it was too expensive to justify the effort, given the relatively limited benefits relative to the magnitude of the cost.\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX is working to decrease the cost of reaching orbit, and if they are successful, it will be a great incremental improvement to rocket technology. It may ultimately make it economically viable to send people to Mars, but there are many many other pieces to the puzzle that must also be solved before we can do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny such effort has to make financial and technological sense. Bankrupting a nation and/or unnecessarily risking the lives of astronauts just so we can look up in the sky and say \u0022tick\u0022 is short sighted. It will happen eventually, but it isn\u0027t some collosal failure of human ambition if it doesnt happen in our lifetimes. Real life is not a sci-fi book or a space simulator game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we both have similar arguments. I said that someone has to take the step, to start the journey of a thousand (insert long unit of measure here). People want to take the step, but very few actually can. And the few that can mostly don\u0027t want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is that the journey of a thousand (insert long unit of measure here) won\u0027t happen until someone takes the first very difficult step, which requires the people with the money to do it. But most people with the money don\u0027t want to, which means it will take either a good slap in the face or space becoming economical. Both of which aren\u0027t very likely in our lifetimes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T02:49:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe USAF also bought the missiles\u0027 development.
