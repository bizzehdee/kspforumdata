I sent a rather big and heavy lander to Minmus with three Kerbals, and on the bottom it has a Service Bay (2.5m) with a small rover in it. However, whenever I open the bay to get the rover out, the whole ship breaks apart. This is because the Service Bay doors lightly touch some fuel tanks on the side, but this is still a bit strange, as it should not be this breakable! How can I fix this, I really need to get my lander out! Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T00:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you post pictures of your ship, it would be easier to help you. I\u0027ve done this before myself, the doors would swing open and clip through the fuel tanks, thus pushing them aside and breaking up the ship. Even though you say they clip only a little bit, why are you surprised that it causes the ship to break up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I did that mistake with the doors myself, I now always test all moving parts of my ship during pre-launch and fix any problems I find. Heck, I\u0027ve even done a dry staging test on some very complicated designs. It pays off in the long term to test your designs before sending them out on a real mission and realizing you\u0027ve got something off in your design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T01:09:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou answered your own question - the service bay is clipping other parts on the ship.
