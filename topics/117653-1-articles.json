It\u0027s sort of reverted back to the free version (if you brought it recently, *like I had to due to yadda yadda, reasons*) even if you spent money.\n\nSo you spend a few quid, open it up and get the previously free version but now with bits missing and a lot more bugs! ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\nThis is kinda terrible."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T23:53:07Z","Content":"Moved this over to the Kerbal Network.\n\nSounds like something went wrong, hopefully one of the website people can get you squared away.
