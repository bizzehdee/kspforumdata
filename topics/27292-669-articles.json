Final stage, the shuttle, carries two kerbals plus the pilot or (with a 1m cargo bay mod) 0.5t of cargo. It can survive reentry from LKO (7.3km/sec) by having a very low ballistic coefficient (high drag vs. mass) and flying a skip trajectory between 85 and 65km (at 20-40 degrees alpha) until it finally slows below 5km/sec.
