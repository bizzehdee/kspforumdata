First of all, you might have learned about the discovery, made by our satellite: the radiation belts somewhere around 900 km up high. Since the periapsis of the satellite is only around 1800 km, we need to gather more information. And this rises more problems. Even to reach our nearest neighbor, Mun, we need another propulsion block. This is the job for the First Department. Third Department, your job will be to create the means of control for the stage and, what is even more important, the orientation system for the block and payload itself. Second and Fourth Departments, I have a special task for you, I will instruct you after the meeting. We need to get ahead the USK. Premier has told us that we need to aim for the Mun. Karim, what is the situation in the West?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarim: -According to the press, KASA has also discovered those fields. \u003Cem\u003EAkademiya Nauk\u003C/em\u003E also indicates, that the satellite\u0027s readings were correct and the amount of radiation matches the readings of USK ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergey: -That\u0027s good, thanks! Prepare the message for TASS to inform our country about the new achievement! Any questions, kermrades?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVasiliy: -Of course! The problem we face is the lack of fuel pumps. Developing one by ourselves will take too much time. What shall we do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoris: -And about the payload, what are the requirements? According to the preliminary calculations, an error by 1% of velocity will lead to horrendous trajectory changes and I\u0027m not sure we can made a really precise avionic system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergey: -First of all, Vasiliy, I want to cheer you up. Design Bureaus from Ministry of Aviation have currently heavy times, and it\u0027s an opportunity for us. They have some experience with jet engine techniques, this is really handy. Now, for the payload. Boris, I think you should contact Kerbysh, he is more competent in electronics than I am. But you should keep tight contact with Vasiliy, since the payload must fit his block.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVasiliy: -Ok, I have a couple of ideas who to contact. See you later, I have something to show you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Sergey nodded*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoris: -Sergey, we may need several test launches for the avionics. Maybe we should not hurry. I think we are taking too much risks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergey: -I understand that. Actually, I\u0027m 100% with you on that. But the government is forcing us to hurry with our projects. It is the question of prestige. We must prove that our country recovered from the War and is ready to open new frontiers. It\u0027s so sad that our allies turned against us. But we\u0027ve suffered enough and won\u0027t let them take the initiative. The next launch should hit the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoris: -I\u0027m sorry. Is this all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergey: -Yes. The meeting is over. And you, Vladimir, Eugene are asked to stay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoris exited the conference room with mixed opinions: on the one hand, new goals were set and this mean new interesting tasks and opportunities. But on the other hand, the pressure of the government forces RSSA to take more and risks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoris: -What do you think Vasiliy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVasiliy: -I have some doubts about it. But, anyway, our department had already several ideas since the first days of the agency. We have an engineer, Valentin Klushko, he is a brilliant mind. He was the main constructor of the Tavio engines. He has some blueprints. His proposal is in having one main engine and four smaller verniers, the same thing that on the first stage, but with a lighter engine, with only one combustion chamber. I think it might work out. And it might be less complicated if we start it while the core engine is still running. That\u0027s what I\u0027m going to show Sergey. He might love it. And you, do you have anything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoris: -Yeah, but not very much. I remember having an star-based orientation system built for our night bombers during the War. Remember the Night Witches? That regiment proved it to be really effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVasiliy: -Oh, I remember them. They were truly the legends even behind the frontlines. I guess you can improve it, well, we can allow more sophisticated electronics nowadays. What do you think, what mass could your payload be? Sergey said that we must orient on a one day flight time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoris: -Well, the first Sputnik was only 60 kilograms. But this one will be, I think, about half a ton, since we have lots of transmissions to do. And to think about this radiation belt...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVasiliy: -That\u0027s fine, don\u0027t hurry, get me the info this week, good?

Valentin, himself, ashamed of his suspicions, tried to remain unseen and not to draw attention to himself for the rest of the investigation, which showed, that he was right: a bolt, holding the fuel line broke, causing the fuel to spill on the hot metal of the combustion chamber, basically, leading to its ignition and explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergey remembered his words at the meeting, and pardonned him, with the cost of Valentin\u0027s promise to be more cautious with his speech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next launch to strike the Mun was announced on January.

Boris, you should realize that if this failure happens on our Heavy project, it will lead to more serious results than just a loss of a piece of metal. As you night have understood, I decided to assemble of you to talk about our new project: a crewed heavy satellite. We should increase the gap between us and Kerbal states by sending a Kerbonaut into space in the next two years at maximum. The Gensek speech of 1960 December Revolution Anniversary should announce to world our success! It will show to the world the advantages of our system. As far as I know, komrade Kishin has already some preliminary designs on the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVasiliy stood up, nodding his head: -Yes, I have a couple of ideas. Our Tavio rocket doesn\u0027t allows us to put much weight to orbit. Only around 5 tons. So, we need to find the easiest solution to most of our problems. To simplify reentry control I want to propose a spherical capsule, which allows the easiest reentry profile and is the easiest to stabilize. Easy and reliable. The only downside would be higher accelerations for pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergey: -Hmm, that might be an issue. I will consult our medical service about the load. Intelligence service told us that Kerbal States are most likely going with a conical capsule. Maybe we should study it too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoris: -Personally, I disagree with the conical capsule solution. It requires control jets for reentry, thus, making the system more complex and heavier, due to the increased fuel load. Less complexity, less chances of failure. I will ask the Science Akademy what G-loads will be on one\u0027s body on that descent trajectory. If we can\u0027t bring pilots back with a spherical capsule, then we\u0027ll go with conical one. Though, I suppose, there might be an intermediate solution. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergey: -Ok, we can settle it down later in private and in details. Boris, what is with the next Muna satellite?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoris: -It will work excellently, it took us 20 minutes to reset that delay mechanism to account for the time delay, using just a solder and a screwdriver, heh. So, basically, we\u0027re good to go as soon as the factory makes another launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergey: -Never tell to anyone that you fixed an error worth a launcher in 20 minutes. It means that you\u0027ve missed it during lab and factory testing and it\u0027s your fault. So, I\u0027ll place another launch in the schedule. Vasiliy, what is the production status?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVasiliy: -The basic Tavio will be over in July, but the upper stage might take some time. I can\u0027t know precisely, but the factory promises to ship us next \u0022Wayfarer\u0022 upper stage in August.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergey: -Thanks. So, basically, we\u0027ll have to wait until at least August to launch the rocket... Well, we can pay more attention to the crewed satellite then. What\u0027s on the orientation system, Boris?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoris: -We don\u0027t have many advances, but the KTDU has already passed the preliminary lab tests. Probably, we might have to change the fuel, since nitric products might cause corrosion of the tanks. The same way as we had with, you know, the KI-1 and other airplanes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergey: -Right, I see that.

But surely our engineers will definitely find out a way to safely detach the module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergey: -Thanks for explaining. Basically, most of documentation is ready for factories. Boris, I ask you to check wirings once again. We didn\u0027t need someone to stay in orbit just because the plug fell out of the port. So, finish up the blueprints, I\u0027m going to visit the General Secretary today and tell him about our project. Now, let\u0027s get to our battlestations!
