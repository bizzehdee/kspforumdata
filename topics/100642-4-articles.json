It will prove much easier and more intuitive, I think, to just place a 2.5 interstage on a 1.25m engine if you want to go to 2.5m, rather than having to use an adapter part. It also allows the very important \u0022use an LV-909 on a Mk1-2 pod\u0022 gameplay choice, or using the 48-7S on a 1.25m stack, without things looking odd.\n\nAlso really happy to see you all taking part in the conversation! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n(Ted, Mike, hope you feel better soon!)"},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T08:09:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Works like debris of solar panels?

They\u0027re just not accounted for yet, and we\u0027re probably going to have to do some playtesting to figure out how (and if) the fairings would work in between two chunks of spacecraft. We might be able to adapt the current module to do both, or we might require a separate module to handle those cases.

When a decoupler is used below, the fairing sticks to the decoupler, just like engine shrouds. These thrust plates come in several adapter-sizes and also have some multi-way adapters built in, allowing you to make custom engine clusters from smaller diameter engines.\n\nThe system works well, but with a couple of caveats:\n\n1. The fairings aren\u0027t ejected separately, after staging, so we miss that level of \u0022realism\u0022. With the fair/shroud sticking to the ejected stage, it\u0027s the same expected behavior we get with engine shrouds, so I think this is acceptable.\n\n2.
