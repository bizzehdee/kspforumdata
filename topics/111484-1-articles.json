Basically a wider Mk3 Cargo bay as it\u0027s very s,all. \n\n**Mk3.5-Mk3 Cargo Bay Adapter:** Also suggested by Grumman, this is basically an adapter from a \u0022Widebody\u0022 Mk3 fuselage to a normal Mk3 fuselage (or cargo bay). \n\n**Mk3.5-Mk2 Cargo Bay Adapter w/loading ramp:** Again, suggested by Grumman, same thing as above but from Mk3.5 to Mk2 and with a loading ramp. \n\n**Mk3 (or bigger) \u0022Guppy\u0022 parts:** Suggested by pandaman, it\u0027s basically a very large cargo bay (maybe with nose loading?) to fit very large payloads, basically being much wider and slightly taller to carry for example bigger rovers, space station parts or even 3.75m parts. \n\n**Modular Mk3 (FAT) Wings:** Suggested by Kweller, more modular FAT wings (the big cargo plane wings), to make better and more interesting designs, rather than having a very thin wing at a desired shape. \n\n**Kerbodyne Mk3 KS-25x3 Spaceplane Engine Cluster:** Suggested by GregroxMun, 3 uprated (more efficient) KS-25s on a Mk3 fuselage to act as space shuttle engines. They would have a high gimbal range and a configurable default gimbal angle.\n\n**Mk3 Compatible Jet Engines:** Suggested by Columbia, a jet engine that\u0027s between the size of 1.25 and 2.5m engines. The Mk3 fuselages need a lot of engines to take off, so bigger and more powerful jet engines made to lift these heavy payloads (maybe shaped like airliner jet engines?) would be neat. \n\nThat\u0027s all I have right now, but you\u0027re welcome to post your own and I\u0027ll add them to this OP. \n\nThanks for reading!\n\n-Brix\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T14:33:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 02:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BriXman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T10:04:06Z","Content":"The loading ramp is definitely the big one, apart from strengthening the joints so that they don\u0027t fall to pieces every time you land.

Cargo bays big enough to take 3.75m parts, with \u0027wiggle room\u0027 (maybe 4.5m internal diameter) for a few radially attached bits, and size adapters to fit onto Mk3. \n\nThis allows bigger loads without creating a whole new Mk(x) series. May only need 1 in line bay, 1 tailgate bay and 2 adapters, one symmetrical that expands the diameter evenly (handy for rockets too), and one offset that bulges on one side keeping the other side in line with the existing fuselage.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T11:21:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 11:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandaman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T11:51:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How about Mk3 \u0027guppy\u0027 parts?

If you add a new diameter to hold the 3.75m parts, is there any particular argument for why that is the perfect stopping point and not a new Mk4 size that can hold your \u0027guppy\u0027 parts, or a diameter one larger than that?

This is vital IMO for loading/unloading cargo horizontally.\n\n\u0022Unopenable\u0022 cargo bay: No. This is just an unnecessary extra part: if you don\u0027t want the cargo bays to open, then don\u0027t open them. Besides, having the cargo bay open in the editor is very useful for placing parts inside even if you never open it in operation.\n\nMK3.5 widebody: Might be useful for large rovers, but overall I think extremely large spaceplane parts might be better left to mods like B9, SXT, and MK4.\n\n\u0022Guppy\u0022 parts. This is definitely best left to mods, possibly even Procedural Parts if it ever supports cargo bays.\n\nMore big wing parts: Yes. We absolutely need this.\n\nShuttle Engines: Meh, people seem to manage fine with Skipper clusters or even Mainsails. And what if someone wants a longer shuttle with 4 or 5 KS-25s? An individual KS-25 might be nice though.\n\nBigger jet engines: Yes, yes, yes. It\u0027s ridiculous that we keep seeing SSTOS with clusters of 10\u002B RAPIERs. Even a 2.5m jet engines aren\u0027t unreasonable: IIRC the engine bodies for the real-life SABREs are somewhere around 4 meters, and we have a couple turbofans that are over 3m.
