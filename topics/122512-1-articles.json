This effectively limits the daily launch window to a few minutes, after which the Earth\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s rotation has turned the rocket too much off course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA limited launch window is a severe logistical disadvantage, since any launch is affected by several factors that can cause delays, and range safety may prevent launch at any specific time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo mitigate this problem, Moonspike will follow the traditional approach of first launching into LEO, then after a few orbits accelerating towards the Moon (TLI). The advantages are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch from Earth is somewhat decoupled from the trajectory to the Moon. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis both allows for a much wider daily launch window (hours rather than minutes)\u003C/strong\u003E, and a less \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erestrictive selection of launch site \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part in bold is the part i don\u0027t understand.

Minmus would actually be a better analog for the Moon in this case. Imagine trying to launch directly from KSC into an LKO co-planar with Minmus\u0027 orbit. In KSC terms, you\u0027d have to launch approximately when Minmus\u0027 ascending or descending node passes over the KSC, and boost slightly north or south of due east. The whole thing would get even more complex if your launch site wasn\u0027t on the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, all that assumes that you\u0027re trying to launch into an orbit that avoids any plane changes later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWikipedia has a great explanation of the moon\u0027s orbit here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Champ","CreatedById":96425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T15:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the explanation.
