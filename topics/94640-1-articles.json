My main issue is a weird problem I haven\u0027t discerened about lifet to center of mass. I always end up lining up the life to the center of mass so that they are basicallly perfectly aligned. but the mass is always a little above or below. This causes problems with getting proper flight controls. I always do a loop de loop test and it usually shows in that right after take off. The reason this matters is that I am doing high orbit long jet runs and it and reentry need very good aerodynamics to help control in weird situation. I\u0027ve noticed, I think, that the best way to deal with anomolies is to getperfect alignment and then try to control the plane. Could be wrong but this is my current line of thought. My question is how do I control teh center of mass or lift up and down. I use those forward facing wings but I can\u0027t place enough to get it down or up enough for my needs usually. What are the most efficient ways to adjust this up or down to alling completely. I\u0027m using many wings on a plane(usually 12-25) each with 2 elevators in groups of 3(1 bottom 1 middle 1 top) all aligned. I need to find out how to fine tune this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022a\u0026gt;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an example pic of a prototype for the planes I\u0027m designing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T02:57:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArugela,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The center of lift doesn\u0027t have to be perfectly aligned vertically with center of mass to get high- speed stability, but it helps. Getting that is just a matter of adjusting the wing attachment height and how much the wings slope up from the fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E From what I\u0027m reading here, it seems to me that your problem isn\u0027t one of static balance, but rather drag distribution. Some parts in stock KSP have higher drag than normal. Especially intakes. Other parts can have lower drag than normal, such as wings. Control surfaces can have anywhere from negative drag (infinigliding) to high drag, depending on how they\u0027re aligned at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A lot of people don\u0027t realize this, and it leads to a lot of frustration with planes that seem to handle fine... and then become completely unflyable at high speeds.

If on the runway, that usually indicates that the gear are too close together or the weight is too great on one side. If in the air, I would think it is also the weight distribution. One of the big \u0022invisible\u0022 causes of this is the fuel distribution, if fuel is getting used up from a tank on one side of the plane but not on the other, hence one side of the plane gets slightly lighter than the other side and this becomes more pronounced the longer the flight goes on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I recommend checking the fuel line flow.
