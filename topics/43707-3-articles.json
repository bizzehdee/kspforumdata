It is a computer calculating vector sum! The term Horizon is meaningless. I could care less what sort of convention is used by the pilot or the informational display. The actual math uses 0-359deg. We are talking about programming a computer here. Not relaying information to a human. Negative numbers being used to describe vectors to a mathematical calculation machine is not correct.\u003Cp\u003EAnd \u0022the rest of the world\u0022 is certainly not the truth of the matter as any mathematician will tell you. Those are values made up in your head. They do not exist in reality. The flight computer in that plane you fly has no understanding of the terms you use. So because you are a pilot we are expected to believe that you know and understand how to program the flight computer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost computers that deal with lots of rotations use quaternions, if I recall, because of the possibility of gimbal lock.
