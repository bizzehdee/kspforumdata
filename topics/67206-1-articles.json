However, they were short-ranged, and couldn\u0027t really do much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe A-9 is essentially an A-4 with wings, and then with shingles (aircraft shingles, like on the SR-71).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, one of the craziest ideas, which is actually kind of cool and stupid at the same time, (not to mention a wee bit kerbal) was to launch an A-9 on top of an A-10. This stack could have hit the USA, and would have caused widespread panic. It would have been manned, as there was no guiding system that was fairly accurate (for the day) that worked for crossing an ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Germans cancelled it in the early 40s, but restarted it in the mid 40s.
