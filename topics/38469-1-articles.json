My first two are not on the forums because they were school projects. Anyway, let\u0027s get on with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrologue : Ten years ago, the second largest ship to date, named 120 took off to make sure no enemies of the UKN (United Kerbal Navy) made it to Laythe, their base. Laythe was chosen because the commander of the navy, Kater Kerman, was fond of boats, as he had had combat on them during his twenties. Kater is MIA. No one knows where he is, but the FN (Federation Navy), the main and only enemy of the UK (United Kerbals) learned five years after the UKS. 120 left Kerbin orbit. One of their scouts discovered the wreckage of the ship on their last orbit made around Jool. When the scout F-1009 discovered the wreckage, an unknown ship destroyed it. The pod and crewmen of the ship, still left alive, sent a distress signal back to Kerbin. It flickered for the next ten minutes. The pod was soon completely destroyed. The Federation had a confrence with the UK. When the Federation left the room, it was decided. They would create the greatest army to combat the enemy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Chapter one will be in next post)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sesni","CreatedById":50625,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T14:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChapter 1 : I stare out the hole in the hull, and at the enemy flying around this ship\u0027s wreckage. I\u0027m Kater Kerman, morons. You can\u0027t beat me. I pop on my radio to the only other survivor who they finally let out of a station that makes craft for a couple rookies and a veteran. Kurat Kerman is at the final non-destroyed weapons bay. \u0022Ready?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Yep.\u0022 He says.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Remember the plan, knock out the bits near the hatch, board the ship and get the crap out of here.\u0022 I said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Alright.\u0022 Kurat says as he passes me the one man upgraded RCS pack that is useful only in situations where you are trying to get out. He then pulls out his makeshift bazooka he made using three probes. The bazooka is made out of three Oscar-B tanks, micro docking ports, and a makeshift fuse that used his EVA pack. He lights the fuse as a scout passes over the big hole. It blasts the hatch open, flinging the people inside of it out screaming. We instantly grab the jetpack controls, and boost inside. We kill the comms to them, shut the hatch, and throttle up the engines. Unlucky for us, they\u0027re able to blow the engines out via radio signal in the case of hijacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Dig in!\u0022 I shout as a missile rocks the ship. We blast the cargo bay door open with another seperatron. As high-rankers, we have upgraded armor in our EVA suits so we can easily survive the explosion with no breaches. We get the weapons inside, and stuff them in the Command Module. Kurat pulls another modified seperatron for the bazooka ready. It is the last one we have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Go go go!\u0022 One of the boarders shouts. He then notices the weapons crammed in there. \u0022HOLY **** GET OUT N-\u0022 He is cut off by the firing of Kurat\u0027s bazooka, and the shattering of the CM, resulting in the death of all of the boarders. I stare ahead at the large ship, with huge laser operated weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Oh cr-\u0022 I am interrupted by the firing of the largest missiles I\u0027ve ever seen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-24T14:32:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2013 02:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sesni\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sesni","CreatedById":50625,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T14:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChapter 2 : The missiles explode before even coming close to the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022What the f***?\u0022 I say as the ship trying to kill us explodes, and a huge ship rolls by. \u0022I knew they\u0027d come for us.
