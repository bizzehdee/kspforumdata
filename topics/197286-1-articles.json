However couple months ago, I saw that some people were discussing that some parts were capable of generating a lift/drag ratio of hudreds, so I searched through the parts and found the magic parts( an specific arrangements of certain parts, dm\u00A0me for detailed construction, since Stratzenblitz75 has a lot cooler mission ahead that will explain the working of magic wings in detail, so I won\u0027t spoil it), we will call this setup the \u0022magic wing\u0022 from now. I put this aside for a while,\u00A0since I was not able to resolve the misterios torque this setup was producing, and hence completely unable to control my craft. However recently, I discovered that the solution was remarkebly simple, by\u00A0simply putting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECol\u003C/abbr\u003E instead of the geometric centre of the \u0022magic wing\u0022\u00A0exactly below the craft dry and wet com( which coincide with each other), I got close to 0 aerodynamic torque, hence I was able to control the vehicle with only reaction wheel, which means I can get craft l/d really close to the theoretical maximum l/d ratio of \u0022magic wings\u0022,\u00A0\u00A0after resolving the issue with takeoff and landing,\u00A0I made a prototype electric \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E that can get into LEO with about 3000m/s of margin and about 7% of LEO payload fraction and only consuming 7900m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E. This low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E use meant that I can reduce my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E a lot further, and hence put in a lot more xenon gas and having more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E.

So what we did here was firts raising the opbit by using about 30 periapsis kicks, then get a lunar assist, which will throw us into a 1:1 resonnat orbit to Moon, then we will eject the Earth-Moon system with another moon assist, which will make us come back to Earth exactly one year later, encouneting Moon again in a retrograde orbit, and throwing us into another 1 year heliocentric orbit with a higher relative velocity to Earth. We will continue this process two more times, which will give us enough relative velocity to earth to allow as transfer to venus. However, neither our ejection direction or the phase angle of earth is correct, so the last Lunar assist will throw us into a resonnat orbit with earth, coming back several years later, which will raise our orbit such that we will intersect Earth at another position in the orbit, and a final assist will send us to Venus. To avoid nightime reentry and landing, we did another assist off of Venus into a Venus resonant orbit, that allows us to land in the daytime when coming back again (Still not perfect, and light was a bit dim when landed).

However, for our craft, this is not true and the Venusian ascend is more or less an easier version of earth ascend, since our craft has props, so doesn\u0027t care about the superhigh pressures, and also our craft doesn\u0027t depend on intake air, like those more traditional rapier-nerv powered stock sstos for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E. So the lessend orbital speed, gravity, increased \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E due to fuel drainage and the steeper pressure profile of Venus really made this easier than Earth ascend. There are some cavietts though. Ascend starts by rising backwards as a helicopter just like on Earth, however we will start at a much lower rotor torque, hence rpm to ward off aero kraken, and also stop the craft from flipping due to it\u0027s naturaly stable orientation is going forwards and not backwars, due to prop and payload bay placement, as well as fairing orientation. We slowly increase throttle as air thins out, but the craft still flipped several times. Lucky, this didn\u0027t cause the loss of the vehicle, and we were able to fix it by letting it dive down by killing the throttle, then arrest the dive by going on high throttle then lowering the throttle to limit speed to safe level. After reaching one atm of pressure, we flip the baldes just like on earth, and the rest of the ascend onwards is fairly similar, there are some differences though: first, we got past m1 slightly due to Venus\u0027 lower speed of sound , hence lower bladepitch is required,\u00A0 however, the lower speed of sound means we also needed to throttle down the rotors a bit, since if we push the balde airspeed\u00A0too far beyound speed of sound, it will suddenly\u00A0loose thrust (seems like a behavior built into the lift-mach curve of dlc ducted fan blades, so nothing you can do with that, only throttling down.) Anoter difference seems to be due to a typo in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E Venus cfg, there is a negative sign missing from one line of the atmo curve, as a result, the craft entered wild wave like motion, luckily, this made us stuble into a better ascend trajectory(during testing phase, it got us into a worse trajectoty, so we were lucky this time).

Some are from broken drag cube, some are from hardwired drag reduction ,while others are from node occlusion eliminating most of the body drag.\u00A0Just try with different parts by slapping them onto a low drag fuselage( node occluded cylindrical fairing), rotate te part of interest by 45 degrees, which usually is the angle where most magic wings peaks,\u00A0and see which part works (use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003Eaoa\u003C/abbr\u003E curve display, and vary your speed to be \u0026gt;M3).
