Well now is as good a time as any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings, I am Colonial Marine Corporal Vasquez. I have enjoyed playing the KSP game and it\u0027s been an educational run. I enjoy the mods, especially the KSO, FASA and any historical mods. I have always enjoyed space flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was using the 23.5 version, and recently decided to upgrade to the 24, but now it seems my voyage is at an end. The 24, crashes on load, but hey I\u0027m not mad, it has been a fun journey. I have tried all the fixes to no avail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will continue to run on the 23.5 until it no longer works. But hey, it has been a wonderful ride.

But I think I may know why you are crashing. It is most likely RAM crashes, which is caused by mods with lots of parts. The easy solution is to download the active texture management mod, or switch to ksp 64 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:I was about to salute you out of respect, until I noticed it said Colonial \u0027space\u0027 marines. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-27T00:18:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2014 12:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Space_Kraken\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T19:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDual boot Linux and grab the Linux version of the game.
