The whole idea was to have that gameplay challenge that it brings. I have heard of problems with mechjeb before, however the way I see it is that the challenge it brings is worth the hassle. I\u0027ve always been able to plot courses to different planets, however they take quite a few corrections. The whole layout was created in Universe sandbox, so the system is stable, however I had to drastically reduce each planets SMA to make it a viable system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair enough, if it\u0027s an intended design then I\u0027ll learn to live with it.
