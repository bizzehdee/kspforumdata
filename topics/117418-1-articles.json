In so doing we got the feeling that our code was going to be super fragile and break with the next update, just because what the stock game was doing to handle things (especially the weird hack they did for fuel hoses) seemed like exactly the sort of spaghetti design that would be changed later and we were getting too dependent on making assumptions about the inner guts of the data structure - exactly the sort of thing that should be kept private (but wasn\u0027t) and masked behind an API intermediary layer. This made us nervous and so we switched to calling SQUAD\u0027s own built-in routines to get resources in stage instead of doing the work ourselves, with an eye toward future-compatibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis made it so things didn\u0027t break when there were massive overhauls to the fuel/resource system in later releases of KSP, which was good, but then meant we \u0022inherited\u0022 stock KSP\u0027s bugs in how it is calculating the stage resources. In other words, it\u0027s wrong, but at least its the SAME wrongness the stock game is giving, and not a new wrongness kOS is adding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T09:02:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou made the right call imho, KSP may (knock knock) eventually get fixed and in the meantime it\u0027s at least easy to troubleshoot stuff like this when the mod is using same numbers as the game itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
