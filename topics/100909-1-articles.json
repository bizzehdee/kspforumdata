If Not Then Why?Because when every engine can lift its own wait then why cant 30 engines lift their and theirs fuel tank?\n\nI Have SAS, Pod and all the requirements that is used for a basic lift off."},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T02:52:59Z","Content":"It can lift itself if you do that, though you might have problems with stability and structural integrity.\n\nAfter you add a few engines and fuel tanks, you\u0027ll quickly hit diminishing returns, and you won\u0027t get much in the way of extra Delta-V or TWR though."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T03:01:18Z","Content":"Not 100% sure what you mean. \n\nVery simply, if you have a rocket with, say, 3 tanks and 1 engine that can lift 1 ton of payload, then 30 tanks and 10 engines should lift 10 tons of payload."},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T03:17:13Z","Content":"It might help if you could provide a picture of the design you\u0027re having trouble with, as we could tailor our advice to the design much better.\n\nThat being said, as Empiro has suggested, past a certain point simply adding more engines and fuel tanks won\u0027t cut it. You\u0027ll notice that real-world rocket designers divide rockets into different segments called *stages*, where after one stage burns out, it\u0027s dropped and the next stage above it fires in sequence. Because the rocket sheds dead weight as it rises by staging, each successive engine has less mass to push; thus, with proper technique, a relatively small rocket can lift its payload into orbit if it\u0027s broken up into stages, whereas if it tried to lift the whole thing into orbit it wouldn\u0027t make it very far at all.\n\nHope this helps! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T03:33:28Z","Content":"Anything will fly if you attach enough boosters to it.

Then you put multiple of the same basic rocket together, and ask whether it should still be able to take off.\n\nThe answer is yes, absolutely! Those rockets could all fly into the sky if they were sitting next to each other unconnected, and if we connect them then they can still fly into the sky just fine.\n\nNow, if you\u0027ve built an actual rocket like this and if doesn\u0027t seem to fly for you then there must be some other problem. If you can share a screenshot of the rocket, perhaps that will give us a clue? Because in theory it should fly."}]}
