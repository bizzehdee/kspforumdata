You\u0027ll notice that real-world rocket designers divide rockets into different segments called \u003Cem\u003Estages\u003C/em\u003E, where after one stage burns out, it\u0027s dropped and the next stage above it fires in sequence. Because the rocket sheds dead weight as it rises by staging, each successive engine has less mass to push; thus, with proper technique, a relatively small rocket can lift its payload into orbit if it\u0027s broken up into stages, whereas if it tried to lift the whole thing into orbit it wouldn\u0027t make it very far at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T03:33:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnything will fly if you attach enough boosters to it.

Then you put multiple of the same basic rocket together, and ask whether it should still be able to take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is yes, absolutely! Those rockets could all fly into the sky if they were sitting next to each other unconnected, and if we connect them then they can still fly into the sky just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you\u0027ve built an actual rocket like this and if doesn\u0027t seem to fly for you then there must be some other problem.
