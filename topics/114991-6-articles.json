(can be toggled on and off).       \n\nIf you have RemoteTech installed AmpYear functions will be disabled automatically if you have no connection or local control and restored when you do.  \n\nTotal EC and ReserverPower on-board reported by AmpYear now respects the flowstate of the resource on each part, so if you turn off the flowstate little tick boxes in the Part right click menu they will not be reported by AmpYear.  \n\nAdded support for Active Radiator, Enviro Sensor EC usage.  \n\nAdded support for DeepFreeze (can\u0027t believe my mod didn\u0027t support another of my mods. This slipped through the cracks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022))  \n\nAdded support for KPBS and USI LS mods.  \n\nFixed TAC LS GenericConverter rates to include the conversionRate variable.  \n\nNew Solar Panel algorithm for editor (VAB/SPH). Ability to select different SOI for solar panel estimates.  \n\nAdded GUI window and processing for Emergency Shutdown Procedure (ESP).   \n\nYou can now select which parts are automatically shutdown when the ESP is activated and set a  priority setting for each type.  \n\nThere are three Priorities High, Medium and Low. All supported Parts are included in this list by default.   \n\nIf you are using mods like RemoteTech you probably want to change this setting for an antenna to ensure you keep your connection during Emergency power down, or not.   \n\nBy default when power is re-gained within the vessel and the ESP had shutdown parts, all parts that were previously active will be automatically re-activated by the system progressively by priority as power returns to the vessel.   \n\nCurrently the following parts are NOT supported by the ESP, simply because the mods or stock parts do not provide an ability for AmpYear to  turn them on or off.  \n\nScienceLabs, the KAS winch and magnet.  \n\nFor TAC LS and USI LS - ESP will not deactivate Life Support but will deactivate TACLS converter units.  \n\nAdded the ability to Execute ESP processing manually (override button in the GUI) which will cause all parts to be shutdown regardless of their priority setting or the vessel\u0027s EC status.  \n\nAdded ToolTips for all the GUI windows.  \n\nAdded Settings config file items to the config file and window to control the ESP functions.  \n\nThere are three new Settings to set the Percentage of Main Power that EPS will kick in for High, Medium and Low priority partmodules.  \n\nESP processing will automatically Shutdown Or Restart part modules (that are tagged as include in ESP processing) when Main Power reaches these three settings.  \n\nAlso in the Settings menu will be a list of all ESP supported partmodules.   \n\nHere you can set the default setting for each module as to whether you want them included in ESP processing or not and their priority (High, Medium, Low) if you do set their Include in ESP setting on.  \n\nAdded Alternate Resource Panel Icons for ReservePower and Teflon. Massive Re-Factor of a lot of the internal code and utilities (Code Housekeeping).  \n\nNo longer requires AYInterfaces.dll or KKInterfaces.dll  \n\nLatest PIC:  \n\nSpoiler\n\n![l0n3He3.png](http://i.imgur.com/l0n3He3.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-18T11:23:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2016 11:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T22:27:31Z","Content":"Seeing how 1.1 has now been officially released, I need to get on with finishing the updates to this mod.

But an update. Made a LOT of progress last 24 hours on updating AmpYear.  \n\nI have already split the ION RCS and PulsedPlasmaThruster RCS parts out of AmpYear and released them as a separate parts **[mod on this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138057-11-ion-rcs)**.  \n\nThey work fine in 1.1 stand-alone and going forward will no longer be part of AmpYear (this mod). AmpYear will of course recognise them and process them correctly.  \n\nSome WIP Pics:  \n\nSpoiler\n\n![XdzeGms.png](http://i.imgur.com/XdzeGms.png)\n\nPosted this one previously I think. New Settings window with Emergency Shutdown Procedure (ESP) settings.  \n\nSetting the values here for part modules will set their default values when you add them to vessels in the VAB. The radio button is whether they are included in ESP processing or not.  \n\nThe 1,2,3 buttons indicates the Priority of the module. 1 = High, 2 = Medium, 3 = Low.  \n![vpiw1pL.png](http://i.imgur.com/vpiw1pL.png)\n\nThe VAB windows. Yeah there are a few of them, thinking of merging the Dark-Side and Solar Panel SOI windows.  \n\nLet\u0027s explain them:  \n\nThe Solar Panel SOI window lets you set the Celestial Body you want AmpYear to use to estimate EC production for solar panels on your vessel (using a new algorithm). In previous versions it just used to use the MAX value for the part.  \n\nBut now it estimates the EC production based on the distance from the Sun of the Celestial Body you select. Also to note, it recognises different Celestial Bodies and calculates their real distances if you are using Kopernicus and other planet mods.  \n\nThe Dark-Bodies window is as before with a few small changes.  \n\nThe Parts List I\u0027ve been over in an earlier preview. The EC production changes for the solar panels based on the SOI window Celestial Body you select.  \n\nThe buttons from left to right are:  \n\nC - Include in AmpYear calcs in the VAB or not. E - Include in ESP processing or not. 1,2,3 - The ESP priority. When added to a vessel the E,1,2,3 will be set to the default value that you have set for that module in the AmpYear settings menu.  \n\nYou can change the settings here for each part/vessel and it will override the defaults. It also will save these settings to your saved craft files and persist the settings from the editor into flight mode. Once in flight mode you can also change these settings as well and they will persist for each vessel."},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T04:41:42Z","Content":"So glad to hear it and read all the tasty updates and plans you\u0027ve got coming for us.

I\u0027m guessing manually.\n\u003E - How are the average users supposed to know which module corresponds to which ingame item? You and I might know, but they might not. Maybe a tooltip or a descriptive text (resourceharvestor = drill).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Not sure what a NavLight is (or how it\u0027s different from a regular light). Is there anyway for users to add their own modules to the list (or remove some)?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I really like what you\u0027ve done with this mod.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nThanks for the suggestions. If you could put these into github issues register that would be great (just one entry). Otherwise j will lose track of it. I\u0027ll be circling back soon as I get Interstellar working again.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-01T20:19:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2016 08:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T20:30:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, thunder175 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just a very minor request. For the Dark Side calc altitude input box, could you expand the width to make it easier to read five digit numbers? I\u0027m running Sigma Dimensions at 6.4x rescaling so my altitudes are much higher.\n\u003E \n\nIf you could put a github issue in I\u0027ll see to it (see link in OP). If you can\u0027t figure it out or don\u0027t know how to use it that\u0027s fine.
