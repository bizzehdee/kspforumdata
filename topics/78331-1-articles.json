It somewhat breaks the fun of the game when it just becomes math and or numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead what they should do is have a Vehicle Assembly Building adviser, sort of how they do now with Gene Kerman at Mission Control, but this Kerbal would say useful things. For those of you familiar with the Sid Meier\u0027s Civilization video games, each part of your civilization had an adviser that gave you tips and advice. He didn\u0027t tell you numbers or statistics, he would tell you if you were doing something bad, and make recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.civfanatics.com/images/civ3/science809.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022science809.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/b/b6/Wernher_von_Kerman_portrait.01.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Wernher_von_Kerman_portrait.01.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough this would mainly be for new players, it would also be for people who want some good approximation of whether they have a rocket that has enough dV and TWR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis wouldn\u0027t be an \u0022In Your Face\u0022 message, it would just be up in the corner, similar to or smaller than that example, but with Wernher Von Kerman.

And if you find that kind of thing annoying, i\u0027m sure you could turn it off. And, as different parts of the game progress, I could imagine an advisor in each building. Spaceplane Hangar, Astronaut Complex, Mission Control(Gene with more helpful advice), Research and Development, Tracking Station. I can think of plenty of advice they could give.
