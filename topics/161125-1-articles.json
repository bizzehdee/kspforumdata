I had this alot on one ship i did. You either need to add or remove autostruts rigidity options in places to correct potentially, or add wheels to the back section to absorb more force or a combo. Also play with autostrut and other settings. I always found a way around it. Unless it\u0027s a bug of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry adding some wheels to the part of the ship hitting the runway in the back or various places and see if it alleviates the problem. Also try removing or adding rigidity to the main structure. There may be simple solutions to this depending on what is causing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee if increasing the stats on your wheels to max also if it\u0027s a space plane.

Assuming that is useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid they adjust the joint strength values in the game again or something?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I had potentially similar issues it was the craft bouncing causing parts to come off. I had to be creative to get around the issue. But this was around 1.2 or 1.2.2. If it\u0027s related to it hitting the ground on physics easing it may be fixable regardless of the cause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ultimately fixed mine with autostruting, modding rigidity(sometimes adding sometimes removing), and adding wheels to the back, or needed areas, to aid in physics bouncing on load. The wheels were the most effective part once the other issues were dealt with. And I autostrut everything to grandparent part in general. Sometimes it simply comes down to sticking something in just the right spot to get rid of the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket one might be that the fairing is simply to big for it\u0027s mounted part. The physics easing might be introducing forces too strong for the the thing it\u0027s attached too(maybe not, noticed the rest of the pictures and staff commends. but adding support might help regardless). Try regular struts also. Or mount some parts that fit underneath it to hold it up then add struts to be safe. Just make sure they are capped to stop drag issues. That fairing realistically would be completely unwieldy and unbalanced. So treat it like structural problem and see if it\u0027s resolved when it looks more like it is solid. The thing inside the fairing might also be wiggling a lot causing problem. Did they ever add auto strut inside fairings(besides actual autostrut, which could help)? Does it have adjustable setting or anything if it\u0027s in? On that note take out the ship in the fairing and see if it still blows up. sometimes that helps. If it does try to give it more structural support empty until it is solid. Then add the ship and test again adding more support where it looks like it is needed. That is my normal method for my larger rocket. It is a rocket that goes from 2,350 tons empty to near 20k tons when fully loaded with boosters for launch. Any thing larger generally needs to be dealt with in terms of structural integrity. Because you are usually going past the normal tolerances of the parts sizes you are using.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, try putting i beams or the longer structural frames under the fairing going all the way to the edge in 4-8x symmetry or more(multiple sets.). Make within millimeters of the actual fairing so the fairing hits this and possibly limits movement of the fairing itself. Then strut the new parts to the main fuselage or rockets on the bottom depending on which ones are going to stay on the craft long enough to get the fairing unloaded. You could even make these parts go to the edge or halfway to the edge of the fairings bottom then bend the to go back to the main body like a triangle then strut them to the main rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that doesn\u0027t work it might display there is another problem if anything. Maybe someone messed up a decimal point in the fairings values or something.(that could also be modified potentially to test the problem.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDerp, I just noticed the staff responded right away!

It\u0027s becoming extremely frustrating.

Fairings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI first found this issue wherein I tried to replicate an old shuttle design I had a few versions ago with the new auto-strut feature. To make a properly scaled replica, the 3.75 meter tanks aren\u0027t big enough to take the place of the shuttle\u0027s orange tank. So instead, I use a fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... It kept exploding on the pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried another design in which I made a huge 1500-2000 ton \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E to lift large cargo to low orbit. It used a maximum sized 3.75 meter fairing to store potential cargo. Even empty, it caused an explosion on the runway, and even nearly crashed the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) FAT wings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried building an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E using FAT wings. i\u0027d never done that before because of their low heat tolerance, but I\u0027d thought I\u0027d try it since I\u0027d seen others pull it off. The second it loaded in, the wings were the first thing to explode, and destroyed the rest of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. It happened as a result of putting heavy tanks and engines on the end, and clipping them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Parts clipping on very large crafts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat super heavy \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E I mentioned in the fairings portion, I tired removing fairings altogether, and not using FAT wings... Though it did start loading in, and started looking promising, it started exploding again. And since it\u0027s so big, I could watch it in slow motion. This craft has a lot of clipped parts. They aren\u0027t one on top of the other, but they are clipped to make it look nice. For example, it\u0027s a twin fuselage design, and each fuselage has 2 mk 3 tanks stacked on top of each other, and they\u0027re clipped in so the flat sides line up. When I watch the explosion happen, I can actually SEE the parts that are clipping suddenly have collision between them turned on (despite being the same vessel), and the tanks and such start flying apart and exploding. It\u0027s very frustrating. It seems that clipping works just fine on smaller vessels, but once it reaches a large enough point, the game\u0027s issues with clipping it once had many many versions ago suddenly return... Which sucks, because that problem was solved already a few versions ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d really like to see squad make this one of their priorities on the 1.3 development.
