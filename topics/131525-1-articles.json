On each scene change small amount of memory is reserved but never released. I found huge impact with trees. Some other objects/textures etc. also reserve small chunk of memory that is never set free. Unability to release memory properly when some object is no longer needed is called \u0022memory leak\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith carefully written code it does not happen. However there is problem with unity game engine as a whole, not only with SQUAD piece of code for this game. When you call function to release some object in memory to make some room for new object some small chunk of memory is never become available again for game engine that can be use for new objects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmount of memory in resource manager will not increase, but overall memory usage is increased by small chunk all times until game CTD.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can watch this with already mentioned tools like graphic memory monitor. With my currently installed mods, memory usage on first main menu is just slightly below 3 GB. I can play game for hour or two before it reach critical area between 3.5 to 3.7 GB until CTD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaps","CreatedById":83083,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T21:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, I understand.
