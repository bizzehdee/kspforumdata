Krag gave me a rough idea where the new systems would be located, out in the darkness beyond even Eeloo. (Though I did notice that a new satellite appeared to be orbiting the Mun.) Sentar, a gas giant with many small moons piqued my interest.

Unfortunately this meant that Bob\u0027s journey would last almost 6 years.

Bob decided that it was as good a place as any to land. Since Erin has a thin atmosphere, Bob was again able to use the aerobraking technique to enter orbit around Erin. During the aerobrake, he was able to fully appreciate the majesty of Sentar\u0027s system, with Sentar rising before him and Erin\u0027s small sub-moon Pock transiting overhead while the diminished sun shone in the far distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v6pKqwb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022v6pKqwb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErin has one hemisphere nearly covered by dune covered land, with the other nearly covered by water ocean.
