Creatures great and small walked the new forests. Some of these creatures grew smarter. Tools, energy, science. All were developed by a central species, the rulers of the new earth. They were foolish. They pursued their frivolous goals, goals of money, fame. In their folly, entire swathes on untouched land became clogged with pollution. They fought amongst their own kind, across the world. Cities erupted in fire, forests became home to colossal battles, deserts became a familiar hell. Throughout this war, they were driven to extinction. However, the irrevocable damage to the world was too much. A new Eden, ruined.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDataMiner","CreatedById":45648,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T19:23:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a little piece I wrote a couple months ago with no name and no context, even in my head. Here goes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mountain was dark, and snow fell softly upon it\u0027s lofty peak, shrouding the scenic view below in a veil of white fog. The bright moon shining through the snow\u0027s thick curtain was the only sign that a world of any kind existed outside of this pinnacle. A feeling of peace permeated through the air, the kind of peace one feels after a long tumultuous war is over, or when a laborer sinks their head into a pillow after a hard days work. A single pine tree sat atop this peak and it\u0027s fallen branches and scorched bark served as a reminder of the many storms it had weathered resolutely, clinging to the soil of trees past, ones that had finally succumbed to the destructive glowing power, fire, or invisible wind that makes branches and trunks sway and crack or even blinding lightning shooting across grey skies. The tree was the lone survivor of the violence in its turbulent past. It knew that it\u0027s time was drawing to a close, and that one day the mountain\u0027s top would lay barren and rocky, devoid of life. but for now, the lone tree knew only peace, peace and silence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"General Rarity","CreatedById":67829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T03:37:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E The Cyro-Pods were a state of art sleeping device that had it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s own supply of oxygen, food, and water just in case the station went haywire when the ponies were sleeping.
