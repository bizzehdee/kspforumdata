One of the most popular mods for this game implemented a resource system that Squad themselves cried was \u0027no fun\u0027. Well obviously their players disagree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers who make a game for sale who insist on making a game \u0027for themselves\u0027 are selfish, bad developers. If Harvester wanted to make \u0027his\u0027 game, he can make his own version of KSP and not sell it. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/667-Procedural-Craters\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPeople want to explore procedural asteroids, planets, and terrain.\u003C/a\u003E Harvester then gives up on this completely \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pcgamer.com/kerbal-space-program-dev-on-random-solar-systems-the-joy-of-failure-and-the-cult-of-steam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eand comes up with some absolute bull excuse for why we\u0027ll never have procedural anything in this game.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, god forbid you have satellites that do anything. Who\u0027d have thought that in a space game where you put satellites into orbit, there should be a purpose for them! The fact that something like that wasn\u0027t in \u0022Harvester\u0027s vision\u0022 makes me wonder if he had any business even being the creative director for this game. If anything it suggests that somewhere back around late 2012, he basically stopped caring about the game, because nothing added since then has really been put in with any passion. That was right around the time where development slowed to a crawl and it would take them five months to release an update adding two new parts and a UI that shows your fuel levels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-19T01:48:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2014 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Frostiken\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
