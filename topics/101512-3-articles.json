I think I get it. You are calling me a troll. Very solid counter argument to almost any point of view that you disagree with. Start calling people names. My post did not call anyone a name. It was designed to point out the futility of any attempts by any one particular group at changing global climate patterns. Not because it can\u0027t be done, but because I believe it is impossible to get everyone to agree on what to do and why. There will always be disagreements on what is necessary and why. That is why threads like this should be closed as soon as they are started, unless you want to change forum rules and allow political arguements, and all viewpoints that go along with them, without censorship. Unless of course this is actually just one big hugbox with political agendas of it\u0027s own.
