The huge flat surfaces have captured his imagination. Jebediah loves speed almost as much as he loves snacks and therefore he has autohized the scientists to build the fastest wheeled vehicle imaginable and send it to minmus. A few very rich investors have also contacted KSP as they believe this could spark a massive business in Minmus tourism. Even televised racing competitions have been suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis here, guys and girls is our playground.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/1/1b/Minmus.jpg/268px-Minmus.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022268px-Minmus.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge: Beat everyone else with your rover. (don\u0027t take it too literally, we don\u0027t want violence.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- use STOCK parts on the rover, you can use non-overpowered parts etc. on your transport ship. No mod can interfere with the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- get a rover on minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Highest speed done with the rover on minmus wins (starting from a stationary position, not taking off the ground at any point during the run)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If the craft leaves contact with the ground, the run ends there and even if it returns back into ground contact the run has ended the moment it leaves ground. So no skipping off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It does not matter how you get there, just the end speed of the rover matters. Must however be sent there without cheats etc. (During transfer to minmus, Mechjeb can be used, even the autopilot.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No cheats means, no unlimited fuel, unbreakable joints, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- must have some sort of wheels (a sledge/sleigh/sled will not do) and a kerbal attached to it during the speed run\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No exploits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- no cheats or godlike mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Special pin awarded to those who keep their kerbal alive.
