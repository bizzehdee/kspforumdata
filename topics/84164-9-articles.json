Let\u0027s say Squad implements realistic aero, but instead of just using Earth-based numbers like FAR/NEAR, they come up with an atmosphere that is more dense, and so doesn\u0027t have the extreme dV-to-orbit losses of FAR---is that possible? Would it even make any difference to the \u0027souposphere\u0027 we have now? Would it throw off the other planets\u0027 atmospheres, balance-wise?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can increase the effective area of a craft with a multiplier or the sea-level pressure, but you\u0027d have to go absolutely bonkers to bring it back to 4500. I tried out Ferram\u0027s 10x area multiplier, but that just seemed to provoke bugs and really encourage aerodynamic building. I\u0027d say the losses there were only about half of stock aero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem here is that stock aero assumes that the effective cross-sectional area of your craft is directly proportional to the mass, so no matter how intelligently you build it, no matter how big or small it is, it will have this massive drag. That\u0027s why generally craft find themselves slowing to ~100m/sec just before impact on descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith real aero, if you make a slender rocket, the effective cross-sectional area will not increase as it gets taller, only if it gets wider (and even massively abusive asparagus pancakes are actually more aerodynamic under this system than the mass=area=drag stock system, as they usually have engines underneath tanks, saving them some \u003Cem\u003Efrontal\u003C/em\u003E area...). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, the force of the drag is the drag coefficient (this varies per the shape and orientation of an object) times the dynamic pressure (mostly velocity squared, but including static air pressure and such), times it\u0027s area. In stock, the drag coefficient (c\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003E) is almost always 0.2, and the reference area is proportional to mass (mass times .. 0.008?). Not cool. This has the side effect that a stock rocket made entirely out of 0.2 (c\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003E parts (some parts are not 0.2 (c\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003E, like cupolas, nosecones or parachutes), it will fall in the atmosphere at any which angle, regardless of it\u0027s shape, as there\u0027s no net torque anywhere as all the parts are decelerating at the same rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure Ferram or Nathan could explain the aero ends of things a lot better. My jargon in that area isn\u0027t very strong. Yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that a thrust corrector wouldn\u0027t have that big of an impact on your efficiency to orbit, you\u0027d just have to be slightly more careful around vacuum-rated engines on the launchpad in terms of TWR. It\u0027s main benefit would be to increase the authenticity of the KSP experience and simplify manual calculation of fuel flow rates (plus save a few CPU cycles over the stock .. thing..). While this might sound like a minor gain (and it is), the cost is even less than minor..six lines.

I guess the alternative is to save them all for the end, and doing a massive clean-up pass before 1.0. But that\u0027s a long time to let a lot of small things linger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s similar to the technique I used to use as a professional programmer, only it was more like a session at the end of a shift, any day where there wasn\u0027t some massive interference from the suits. Turns out that translates into \u0027weekly\u0027 or \u0027monthly\u0027 in a lot of companies. Or \u0027unpaid overtime\u0027 (not that it\u0027s typically paid anyways)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese problems do tend to build up, and eventually cause secondary issues. It\u0027s generally easier to do changes early in a project, too, rather than later on once the faulty code matures into a \u0022feature\u0022 and other parts of the project start to rely on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
