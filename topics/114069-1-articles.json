It\u0027s UpsilonAerospace.\n\nI was just thinking about a Kerbal Space Program convention; while the devs have apparently stated that it would be nice to have one, I haven\u0027t heard of any efforts on their part to create one. Maybe this will change in the future... but (in my best spoiled-brat voice) I wanna Kerbal-Kon *nowwwww!*\n\nSo!\n\nI was wondering if you guys were up for a devious and possibly slightly ludicrous plan. It will be daring! It will require some planning! If we pull it off, it will be awesome! I\u0027m not sure how good of an idea it is, but hey, I\u0027ve got a whole bunch of much smarter Forum-goers to discuss this plan with.\n\nKerbal-Kon 2015: Can We Make It Happen?!\n\n~~~\n\n**Okay, here\u0027s the plan.**\n\nStep 1: Find an Existing Convention!\n\nThis will be the hardest step. People play KSP on all seven continents, so picking a single location will not be easy. \n\n**I\u0027m thinking that it would be best to select a smaller comic-book convention within the United States.** Why? Well, KSP is played most in the United States of America, unless I\u0027m mistaken. It would be much easier to find KSP players in a smaller convention than it would be in a larger one, which would cater to the rest of my plan (see below). And comic-book conventions are generally happy to accept people, regardless of the games, books, or movies they enjoy.\n\nBecause many KSP players are under the age of 18 and thus have more free time in the summer, it would probably be best to choose a convention that occurs *before mid-August*. This puts a pretty significant time limit on this project, but we still may have a bit under two months to carry this plan to fruition.\n\nStep 2: Politely Ask if We Can Come!\n\nI\u0027m sure that no convention would turn down a bunch of polite ladies and gentlemen, but it would be nice if we had confirmation that the convention could handle the increased traffic. Perhaps, if we\u0027re nice enough, they\u0027ll even cater to us somehow! I\u0027ve been to several comic-book conventions now, and the staff always seems to be helpful and nice (as long as all rules are followed), so I think it\u0027s not a stretch to say that they\u0027ll try to make us feel at home.\n\n**I\u0027m not saying that we should make any attempt to close off the convention to anyone else.** There will likely be many non-KSP players there too, and that\u0027s okay. However, there would be enough KSP players to make it easy to find fellow KSP fans.\n\nWe could also probably have a way of distinguishing KSP players from non-KSP players. It doesn\u0027t have to be much - putting a green sticky note on the admission pass would be fine, for example.\n\nStep 3: Recruit People, Famous and Otherwise!\n\nWhat\u0027s a convention without a few famous faces? If we could get famous people (YouTubers, streamers, community members, and maybe even some Devs) to join the ranks, our convention would start looking a lot more awesome. If we plan this thing properly, maybe KSP giants like the Great Manley or the Esteemed HOC could come!\n\nAs for me? Even if the convention was held in the midst of the Himalayas or something, I\u0027d probably still come to be with my fellow community members. I\u0027m certainly not a very famous Forum-goer (or YouTuber, for that matter), but maybe someone would want one of my drawings or *some*thing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nStep 4: Panels?!\n\nIt would be nice if we could get some KSP panels going with some help from the aforementioned famous people, but this might be a bit of a stretch. I\u0027m picturing a general KSP meet-and-greet panel, as well as some more specialized ones like being creative with part usage, getting started with the game, or creating KSP streams or videos. Regardless of the panel content, it would be great to be in the same room with a bunch of like-minded individuals. It doesn\u0027t happen nearly enough for me, that\u0027s for sure...\n\nStep 5: Kerbal-Kon!\n\nHopefully, this planning would pay off, and we\u0027d be left with a quality convention and fun for all. Kerbal-Kon, here we come?!\n\n~~~\n\n**So, that\u0027s my rough plan. What do you guys think about it?** ***Can we make this happen?*** (I sure hope so.)\n\n**Please let me know if there are any conventions that are near you and that fulfill the criteria above!** It would be nice to have several options to choose from. Or, at the very least, [vote in this Strawpoll](http://strawpoll.me/4739037) so that we can figure out where the best location for a Kerbal-Kon could be.\n\nPossible Conventions:\n\nAnime Revolution\n\nAugust 14-16; Vancouver, Canada.\n\nAn anime/cosplay convention. Attendance unknown.\n\nSpoCon\n\nAug. 19-23; Spokane, Washington.\n\nA comic convention with a sci-fi emphasis. Attendance is ~1500 people or so.\n\n**Upon further review, I\u0027m not sure tickets are still available.**\n\n~~~\n\nOh, and Forum-goer Unheld is planning on having a meet-and-greet in Germany, including touring an aerospace center! If you\u0027re interested in this opportunity, [here\u0027a a link](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126256) to his forum post for more (it\u0027s in German).\n\n~~~\n\nI think we may want to take a week or two to choose the desired convention location, then spend the rest of the time trying to build support for this convention. It\u0027ll take the whole community to make this work, but I trust that we can do it.\n\n**Oh, and please let me know if you have any questions!** Perhaps y\u0027all will have better ideas that this... though personally, I like this plan ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnyways...

(I should probably start making a list of conventions that would work on the OP.) I like its location - pretty close to both the US and Canada - and it seems like an appropriately-sized venue.

PAX Prime is going to be held in Washington in November, but that\u0027s rather too large a venue for my taste: there will probably be well over 75,000 people there. \n\nThere is another convention in Washington called SpoCon at Sasquan, which looks to be a very good candidate (it\u0027s a general-audience, small-venue comic convention with a science-fiction focus, held Aug. 19-23). Unfortunately, their annual attendance is just over 1,000, so they probably couldn\u0027t take too many KSP players... but I\u0027m not sure that more than several hundred people would come anyway. It definitely merits a place on the list of candidates.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Isn\u0027t kerbalkon a thing already?\n\nYes, but it\u0027s pretty much exclusively on Twitch... which isn\u0027t *quite* the same as having a bunch of KSP players in a room together.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe us New Englanders should talk to those at [ConnectiCon](http://connecticon.org/) for this summer and possibly [FlightSimCon](http://www.flightsimcon.com/) for next year.\n\nSadly, it\u0027s probably a little too late to arrange anything at ConnetiCon... though FlightSimCon sounds like a great venue for next year!\n\nI\u0027m beginning to think that I should have had this idea sooner... it seems as if many of the best conventions have already happened ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E @UpsilonAerospace\n\u003E This is a very good idea and I wish you the best of luck!\n\u003E \n\u003E I try something similar to this already for all those in and around (or willing to journey to) Munich in Germany.
