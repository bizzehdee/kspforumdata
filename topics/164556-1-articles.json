I\u0027ve watched several videos about it, but I think I\u00A0have an\u00A0input control issue: I can not\u00A0set the Mun as a target to perform the orbit calculations. I used right and left click, and tried all the possible ways! I also cant add a nod in my orbit to perform a maneuver! I realized in the videos that the orbit was in a blue line, mine here is a white\u00A0line.
