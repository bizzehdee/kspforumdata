So if you can have them figure out their orthogonal distance from the line between the solar body and the camera, you could use that to correctly modify the glow. Wait no what you need is that distance to get the angle off  the camera/solar body axis and use that value, that should work. Otherwise you\u0027ll have to pick some compromise or other.\n\n![STS-130_Endeavour_approaches_ISS_3.jpeg?](https://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/1000_1x_/public/import/2013/images/2011/11/STS-130_Endeavour_approaches_ISS_3.jpeg?itok=EUMjms_-)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-15T05:52:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2017 05:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by vossiewulf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-15T06:23:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 33 minutes ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So if you can have them figure out their orthogonal distance from the line between the solar body and the camera, you could use that to correctly modify the glow.\n\u003E \n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) The good thing is I already built those parameters into the shader.
