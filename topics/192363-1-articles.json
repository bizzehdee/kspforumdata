And the game/program be smart enough to increment the number from the last craft for us. So if I choose My-1, and My-2, instead, it\u0027d realize the next one was My-3.... or if i went KSP-001, it\u0027d know the next one was 002, and eventually it\u0027d be KSP-011, and not KSP-0011.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
