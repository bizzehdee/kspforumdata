And they where stored in a warehouse from 1969 until 1990. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, of course aerojet checked those engines thoroughly (x-rays and such) to check for the smallest crack, but the fact remains that the metal of these engines was subjected to whatever conditions they encountered in their warehouse for at least 20 years. And metals can be affected by temperature changes, the oxygen from the air itself, even moisture if the warehouse was not hermetic - especially over such a long time. I\u0027d say, it\u0027s even wonderful that those engines still works after all this time. (I doubt someone came down in the warehouse to put a new later of paint on the engines every few years \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least, if the problem really came from the aging of materials, it will be an interesting thing for metallurgy rocket scientists - they\u0027ll have real data on how rocket grade materials age over time - which could prove useful if they want to send automated ISRU bases on other planets years in advance of a manned mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T17:37:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sgt_flyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sgt_flyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, of course aerojet checked those engines thoroughly (x-rays and such) to check for the smallest crack\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK, they also did a \u003Cstrong\u003Etest burn\u003C/strong\u003E. 40 seconds, no ka-boom.
