It fires an exotic laser beam which has extremely high repulsive force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a loud crack since lasers obviously break the sound barrier but this one is far more interactive with mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of the smaller size of the power supply, the discharge of it\u0027s energy occurs faster than larger power supplies that spaceships use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n30 seconds of continous zapping will drain your power completely, so pulse firing is recommended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow powerful is a single zap? Same power as a grenade blowing up on something at point blank range. Cannot be throttled down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote of caution: If your gun is somehow blown up it will detonate your remaining energy supply in the gun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion about utility: How and when would such a gun be used? I do not see it being standard issue because it is dangerous. Maybe only special tactical forces would use it or specially trained military but that\u0027s it. I don\u0027t see them used in random fire fights where you care about collateral damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t care about collateral damage and leaving craters then this is the perfect weapon though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-01T15:25:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2023 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-01T16:33:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds dangerous, all have probably been killed using grenade launchers in video games.
