I have a brand new theory (unless someone theorized it before I did... I haven\u0027t seen anything exactly like it before, so.) regarding Kerbal civilization, the purpose of the Space Program, and many many other little details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we all know, the entire Kerbal civilization appears to be concentrated on two places on the surface of Kerbin: KSC1 (which here includes the island airbase) and KSC2. No other significant structures exist apart from scattered monoliths and other anomalies across Kerbin\u0027s surface. The reason for this is widely debated and many many theories have been cooked up over the years to explain this. Maybe they live underground, maybe the KSC workers are the only ones left, maybe they\u0027re aliens that crash-landed and called this place home. However, my theory explains just about everything, and in true scientific fashion I even have a research source! Yay science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Theory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals do indeed live underground, but they do so for a very specific reason: Harmful ultraviolet radiation hinders Kerbal lifespan on the surface of Kerbin, forcing them to mainly live underground to protect themselves and live longer. The Kerbal Space Program is a method for developing new radiation-resistant structures, vehicles, and clothing that will allow Kerbals to live on the surface of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Background Information\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin has NO magnetic field whatsoever. While there is no way to be exactly sure a body like Kerbin wouldn\u0027t have one, as Kerbals have yet to perform (or at least share their results of) analysis on the interior of Kerbin to determine if the planet has the requirements for producing a magnetic field, there is also the fact that Kerbin is not programmed to have a magnetic field, nor is any other celestial body within the game. Because of this fact, it can also be assumed that while Kerbin does have an atmosphere, it does not have a proper layer of ozone that filters out UV radiation that the home star, Kerbol, produces. The same argument can be made that Kerbol is not programmed to emit UV radiation (because, of course, it isn\u0027t), but it does emit or is the source of light in the Kerbol system. This light is evidence that Kerbol does produce the spectra of radiation similar to our own Sun, and also allows for the trees and grasses on Kerbin to survive. Players have also theorized that Kerbals, because of their green skin, can use Kerbol\u0027s energy to photosynthesize for long periods of time with no need for tedious life support systems, which is an idea I subscribe to as well, and, in fact, include in my theory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the lack of an ozone layer, which filters out the particular section of UV radiation designated UV-C that comprises roughly 91.2% of the UV spectrum (Hollosy 1), a much, much larger amount of UV light and radiation is allowed to reach the surface of Kerbin. While this has no real beneficial effects on the growth of plants, UV radiation is harmful for organisms, thus leading to Kerbals living underground and allowing the surface of Kerbin to protect them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Textwall\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI theorize that because of this, because Kerbals would naturally want to live on the surface of the planet they live on, the Kerbal Space program was established in order to test different ways to negate the negative effects of radiation. Why don\u0027t Kerbals walk around the KSC? Maybe they don\u0027t want to be out and about during a rocket launch, but maybe it\u0027s because they\u0027re either not allowed to be outside due to the radiation (policies, policies...) or are scared enough they don\u0027t want to for fear of being damaged. Kerbal astronauts are safe in their space suits because the suits must be made of some material that absorbs UV radiation, and the same fabrics or what have you are simply to expensive yet to be made into regular clothing. Kerbals are safe inside buildings as the walls and windows are thick enough and made with special materials that protect them from radiation. In the VAB and SPH, kerbals can be seen walking around inside even though the huge hangar doors are open, but they are safe because they are never in direct sunlight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that KSC2 might have been the original space complex, but was abandoned as the structures weren\u0027t strong enough to protect Space Program workers from radiation, and the same goes for the Island Airfield. I also think that more than being a testing ground for kerbal architecture, I think having a Space Program makes sense for kerbals because although they may simply be fascinated by engineering and space, perhaps they are wanting to study celestial bodies in the Kerbol system to try and find a new home planet, one that could potentially be safer than Kerbin is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pucrs.br/fabio/fisiovegetal/EfeitoUV.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.pucrs.br/fabio/fisiovegetal/EfeitoUV.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may update or edit this theory as I think up new stuff that either doesn\u0027t agree with it or fits the story, but that\u0027s my idea in a nutshell!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to reply, criticize, help support, or argue against this theory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T19:22:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this theory!!
