For our purposes, that\u0027s the same thing as perfectly time-reversible.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If entropy increases only in one direction (from \u0022past\u0022 to \u0022future\u0022), this contradicts \u0022time reversibility\u0022.\n\nThis is why typical explanations of entropy, these not amed at people who spent many years studying mechanics, chaos, thermodynamics, and field theory, well, frankly, suck.\n\nLoosly speaking, there are two types of entropy we consider. There is the fine grain entropy, which is defined for the universe as a whole, and it is a conserved quantity. It\u0027s boring, just like the universe as a whole is boring. It\u0027s an object that just is throughout all of the time, and any dynamics within it is fully reversible. What\u0027s far more interesting is considering a small corner of the universe, which, nonetheless, interacts with the rest of the universe. If I drop a glass on the floor, I do not need to know anything other than composition of the glass and maybe small region of the floor near impact to predict what happens. And yet, the details of the impact and how the glass shatters, will depend on everything that\u0027s happening. This is where irreversibility comes in.\n\nPrecisely, this is described with coarse entropy. It\u0027s the quantitiy that doesn\u0027t just concern itself with total number of states, but rather the rough volume these states occupy. There is a way to state this with mathematical precision, but I don\u0027t think it will be useful. The important part is that if the system exhibits no chaos, and all trajectories flow together, then the coarse entropy never changes. The processes are reversible. A glass falling on the way to the floor is a good example. Once the impact happens, chaos. Small, tiny changes in original states of particles in the glass or floor make huge differences in where the cracks head and how the glass flies into shards. The trajectories diverge. As they do, the phase space volume occupied by these states increases. The corase entropy has increased, and the process is irreversible.\n\nNow, if you happen to have full information about all of the universe with precise state of every particle, you can still reverse it. The CPT symmetry still makes everything fundamentally reversible. But if you are existing within the universe, trying to gather the information you need would cause more irreversible processes to happen. Once coarse entropy has increased, you cannot make it decrease again. It is a strictly increasing quantity. But the actual amount of coarse entropy is strictly subjective. It depends on what you call time zero, what you consider as your sub-system, and so on. It\u0027s a useful quantitiy, but it\u0027s useful precisely for determining what can and cannot be reversed, as well as a few other things related to determining direction of certain processes. (Why things dissolve, for example.) But it\u0027s not a fundamental quantity. It\u0027s not inherent to the universe as a whole, but rather enters into our discription of small parts of it as means of accounting for the infinite vastness we have no access to."},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T09:51:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And it goes on to note that it exhibits CPT symmetry instead.
