However since .22 I\u0027ve noticed a problem and I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s the game or me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had several ships lately that should have flown straight and true instead spin wildly. Attached is a photo of my prototype concept for a super heavy lander. It is built in 6x symmetry and the center of mass and lift are both dead center on the middle of the vessel. If I reattach the girders in 4x symmetry it will sometimes launch straight but other times it will spin as well. The only time I have a 100% success rate regarding spinning is if there is only one central engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed that my heavy launcher which is a central orange container and three additional layers of orange containers in 6x symmetry also spins every single launch while the same design used to be perfectly stable. I have my suspicions that something more is going on but maybe it\u0027s a simple fix. I am not running any mods. Hopefully someone can help me out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/S9q0V01\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/S9q0V01\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-01T06:53:17Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2013 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Magicide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TaranisElsu","CreatedById":57742,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T05:46:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry turning off the gimbals on the outer engines (or using the LV-T30 which does not gimbal).

Anything from 2x to 8x symmetry leads to the ship rotating at an increasing rate. I experimented with the other girders, decouplers and pylons as well. They all exhibit rotation right from launch if any sized tank \u002B engine is attached to them. I also tried several different engines and they all rotate. I tried stiffening the assembly with struts but it doesn\u0027t appear to make any difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does work is disabling the engine gimbal so it\u0027s the most likely culprit.
