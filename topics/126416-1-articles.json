The Newtron-S is a solid-fueled Sounding Rocket. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBelow it, is a \u0022Milkstool\u0022, like those used for Saturn IBs during the Skylab Program. This was to allow the rockets to use the same infrastructure.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNewtron 1 is a suborbital tourist rocket, like Blue Origin\u0026#39;s New Shepard, but only able carry a total of 3 using a single stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNewtron II is used for longer suborbital tourist missions, and carries 6 on a single stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNewtron III is used for 3-man orbital missions, and uses 2 solid fuel stages and boosters, but 2 liquid-fuel upper stages.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i65.tinypic.com/9sz1b9.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was the \u0022Final Evolution\u0022 version of the rocket- don\u0026#39;t ask me what those things at the side of the 1st stage are- I don\u0026#39;t know either, I made this a while ago.
