It took me much tinkering before I was satisfied by both the income rate of the various resources, and with the progress of goals in the game. By that time I took like 10% of the available contracts, but it became compelling. But not nearly as much when I started to experiment with contract packs, and removing the majority of the original ones.\n\nSo in the end, I agree with you. Vanilla career has annoyances that other game-modes doesn\u0027t. Hell, if a buddy of mine told me he\u0027ll start playing KSP the first time, I told them to play Science mode. But I think career mode has the best potential, and we KSP players doesn\u0027t have to wait for Squad to fix it, as we have unlimited options to do it ourselves.

I mean, points to Squad for effort, I suppose, as the current implementation has brought a lot of users to the game, but I like a more defined direction. I\u0027d like a career game to have you set an ultimate goal, or at least milestones along the way. I.e., moon mission for example. In order to put a Kerbal on the moon, you first need to develop the technology, practice docking, survey for landing sites, etc. So the missions you get follow that path. Leave a little wiggle room open for side jobs, for example, like SpaceX. They want to colonize Mars, but in the meantime, they butter their bread by launching commercial and military satellites. So sure, have a contract here and there to send payloads to orbit in order to make side cash, but the core \u0022campaign\u0022 structure should be more goal oriented, and user-tailorable to let you define what those goals are."},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T22:09:46Z","Content":"All I do is career mode. out of 1500 hours, id say 1400 spent it in and 100 hours in sandbox before career came out.
