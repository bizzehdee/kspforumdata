I\u0027d like a career game to have you set an ultimate goal, or at least milestones along the way. I.e., moon mission for example. In order to put a Kerbal on the moon, you first need to develop the technology, practice docking, survey for landing sites, etc. So the missions you get follow that path. Leave a little wiggle room open for side jobs, for example, like SpaceX. They want to colonize Mars, but in the meantime, they butter their bread by launching commercial and military satellites. So sure, have a contract here and there to send payloads to orbit in order to make side cash, but the core \u0022campaign\u0022 structure should be more goal oriented, and user-tailorable to let you define what those goals are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T22:09:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I do is career mode. out of 1500 hours, id say 1400 spent it in and 100 hours in sandbox before career came out.

quite agree with people defending carrier mode.

Carrier at Normal difficulty looks not like \u0027grinding\u0027 at all. At very fist launch I have spend some 200 money (fuel inside flea \u002B 2% reduced cost from landing at KSC) and got about 50K in return mostly for braking records. At least at my current tech level every mission is quite profitable and most of it even interesting to do.
