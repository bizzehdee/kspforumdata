Joseph is opposed to the construction of the ISS because he knows what his future self told himself (technically future Kranz and Jeb told him, because future Joseph was dead by that point) about what happens if they activate the Omega-13.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 1 of the ISS was built off screen as a prototype. We see the construction of version 2 of the ISS over the first episodes of Project Gateway. Joseph manages to infiltrate the organization and gets malicious software installed on the station\u0027s computers. He gets the station to deorbit itself, but Kranz orders the secondary backup modules to be launched while starting a manhunt for his brother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 3 of the ISS is launched over the next episodes, and Joseph realizes he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not going to be able to stop the construction of the station. He instead focuses his attention on mitigating the effects of the anomalies. If he can at least stop the effects of the anomalies then maybe in the end that might be enough to save the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoseph also realizes the Omega-13 may have been used incorrectly in the alternate timeline that warned him about it. He thinks that using it properly might actually be quite safe, and could in fact be the ANSWER to protecting the solar system. However, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll need to survive long enough to reach that point, and the current anomaly situation is only getting worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne particular anomaly near the moon has Joseph worried. He secretly constructs a device to send into the anomaly that will nullify it and prevent a catastrophe. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s definitely a temporary fix, like putting a Band-Aid on a gushing wound, but he hopes it will buy enough time to finish his research into how to use the Omega-13 properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKranz discovers where Joseph is hiding out, and threatens him to stop interfering with the construction of the station. Joseph doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t tell his brother about the warning from the future because he doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to appear crazier than he already does. Instead, he tries to reason with Kranz about the dangers of what they are doing. Ultimately Joesph needs to continue on his own to protect the universe. He sends his device to the moon using an experimental low thrust but high efficiency engine. The device enters the anomaly and stabilizes it enough to delay universal destruction by one more year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKranz doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know what the device was supposed to do, so he assumes Joseph has done something to make the anomalies worse. He sends a squad to capture his brother, and they find him hiding out in the Badlands. He is captured and imprisoned. However, Kranz opens an investigation to see if Joseph is right about the danger. His scientists decide it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s true and that the anomalies are on a course to eventually rip the solar system apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoseph gets released from prison on the condition that he helps continue his research to stop the anomalies and help finish the ISS. He agrees to work on the Omega-13 because he feels they are only a few months from understanding how to use it probably to not only reverse the anomaly effects, but also find out what it was really meant to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, a huge anomaly opens inside the sun. Solar mass from several parallel dimensions begins flooding into our sun and causes instability, which is leading to a supernova and subsequent black hole. However, before that happens, the crew on Kerbin decide to activate the Omega-13 early in the hope that it will stop or reverse the effects, even though it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not ready and has not been tested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EThis is where Project Odyssey starts.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly a handful of Kerbal personnel survive. They slip into an alternate dimension where no Kerbals exist, and yet there is a whole KSC there. The old occupants have slipped into a separate dimension of their own, leaving their old world uninhabited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew vows to find a way to reverse the effects of the anomalies and restore their original home. They realize that a piece was missing from the Omega-13 all along, which might be why it didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t perform as expected. It might also be the reason why they were sucked to this dimension, because the two parts might be acting like magnets, attracting each other. They need to get to Duna, get the artifact there, bring it back, and combine it with the piece they already have. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the only way to unlock its full potential and save the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHadfield Kerman didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t make it through the rift as easily as the others. He appeared displaced in space and time, and first showed up around the Mun. They had no way to rescue him, so they presumed him dead after realizing he didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have enough life support to last more than a few hours. However, Hadfield was slipping in and out of an alternate reality where time moved differently. We already knew this was possible because it happened to Bill on Minmus during Project Gateway. I guess they didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t consider this, so he was presumed dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHadfield eventually appeared again, so the crew on Kerbin realized what was happening and set out to rescue him. Unfortunately the effects of being in the alternate reality for so long was having an effect on his DNA. It was essentially giving him a lethal dose of exotic radiation. There was a potential short term cure, and a long term cure. They whipped up the short term cure right away, and prepared a probe to gather the needed element from Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s upper atmosphere for the long term cure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel was a problem. They were running out. They had a supply left behind by the old occupants of this Kerbin, but they had insufficient personnel to run the refineries to make more. They started working on a refining program to turn something called Kethane into fuel. Valentina Kerman was also working with Kesla Kerman on a way to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cteleport\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 tiny amounts of matter at a time, which would allow them to set up a mine and refinery for Kethane on the Mun and transport the fuel back to Kerbin. It was hoped that some day they might also research a way to transport more than a few ounces at a time, and even get to where they could transport Kerbals. That was a long way off, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second problem was with the anomalies having an effect on their memories. The memories of Kerbals from alternate parallel dimensions were bleeding into each other. We were getting memories that were not our own, and probably dumping our own memories into Kerbals in those dimensions. It was not good. We were never entirely sure if what we knew and what we were seeing was actually true. All this meant they needed to move fast, before the effects jeopardized their mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESvetlana Kerman was a Kerbal from an alternate, parallel dimension that had also been affected by the tears in space-time. Her entire planet was almost destroyed, and they were working with a limited crew as well. They had better technology, including transporters, shields, warp drive, cloaking, and ansible communication. They were researching the source of the anomalies and had tracked down a signal to our Omega-13. They were a few weeks away from a mission to explore the source of the anomalies when an accident sent Svetlana into our new dimension earlier than she had expected. She was recovered by our crew and nursed back to health. The Kerbals from her dimension ordered her to keep her mission a secret. They wanted her to steal our tech and return home to save their solar system. She was getting to know us better, and seeing we were not malicious, and so became conflicted by the order. She stole the tech as ordered, but had second thoughts after meeting the equivalent of her sister from our dimension. (Many people had a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctwin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 like this, since these were parallel universes. Each of the girls had lost their own sisters in their original dimensions.) Svetlana attempted to return the tech she stole, but something went wrong and she was overcome with radiation while returning it. She helped stop an overload and then revealed the truth to her sister and everyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in Svetlana\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s home dimension, leaders Sergei and Komolak decided Sevtlana was either captured, or worse\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 brainwashed. They set out to use their better technology to bridge the gap between universes and come take our tech and rescue Svetlana. They equipped their tactical ship Raptor I with their new trans-dimension portal device and followed the Omega-13 signal to our new dimension. However, they activated their cloaking device to hide their approach while still inside the event horizon of the anomaly they had used for transport. This led to a massive anomaly spike similar to using the Omega-13 itself. It caused the same distortion that had brought our crew to this world, and thus our crew was sent to yet another new world. Komolak\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s crew was left behind, but so was Bill because he was in orbit on Odyssey station. Bill was taken captive by Komolak and Raptor I. They interrogated him and used Kentari slugs on his brain to force him to reveal his secrets and obey them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew discovered an abandoned base just as before. On the plus side they had fuel again. On the negative side there was no Kethane anywhere. They were able to local a different resource called Kethite and started developing tech to mine and refine it. They restored the communications satellites. They started a new Odyssey Station. They tracked down the Duna artifact again. It would just be a matter of time before they\u0027d have everything they needed to restore the Omega-13 and finally save the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same thing happened again where Hadfield came through late, but this time we were more prepared. Kesla had developed anomaly tracking tech, and was able to predict his arrival. We had a rescue ship in place ready to get him. Neil Kerman worked on the cure to his illness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKomolak and Raptor I had not given up. They worked for several months to track us down, and eventually did. However, they had needed to use the high gravity of their Eve to get the energy needed, and we were able to detect this with the satellites of our dimension. The effects were showing through to our Eve here, and so we sent a satellite to investigate more closely. Once we discovered what the cause was, and with Svetlana\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s insight into her people\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s plans, we knew what to expect and who was coming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKomolak had teleported down to the base we left behind. He procured some tech needed to bridge the dimensional gap more safely this time. They worked out a way to use their shields to prevent another anomaly spike. Komolak, Bill, and two guards teleported down to our base and assaulted Kranz\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s office to take him capture, but we knew they were coming. We were prepared, and took them captive instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill was sent to Neil to have his brainwashing reversed. The guards were imprisoned. Komolak was initially imprisoned, but we eventually talked him into working with us to help save both universes. Raptor I had slipped into another anomaly and was destroyed, so there was no way for his people to rescue Komolak even if he had declined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew was finally united in their purpose. They designed and built the Kopernicus and many ground modules to be used during the excavation of Duna. They set sail so to speak, but along the way ran into another ship that slipped in from yet another alternate dimension. The crew of the other ship was just out of phase enough to be invisible, but just in phase enough to interact with the solid surfaces and computers of the Kopernicus, and us with their ship. We figured out how to reverse the localized anomaly effects and prevent the destruction of both vessels, but Joseph was lost in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew made it to Duna, landed, excavated the artifact, and returned to the Kopernicus. They headed back to Kerbin and rendezvoused with Odyssey Station where the Omega-13 had been charging up and getting ready for the missing piece. The crew combined the parts, fired it up, and reversed not only the anomaly effects but time itself. They also strengthened the fabric of space-time to prevent the same thing from happening again when Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s experiment would inevitably be run like it was in the original timeline. This time there was no explosion, and so the events caused by the explosion never took place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be the end, if not for the questions of: What was Bob working on? What would have happened if he had continued its development? Were the anomalies truly stopped once and for all? Or were they just delayed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this could be the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr it might not be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-15T00:08:44Z\u0022 title=\u002209/15/2015 12:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Felbourn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noah_Blade","CreatedById":145789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T23:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efirst awesome finale! :wink:wait so odeyssey is a prequel AND a sequel at the same time!?
