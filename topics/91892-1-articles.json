But repairing them is a bit of one. I\u0027ve heard two ideas on this topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 1: Attempt to utilize the tendency of CN to \u0027reconnect/repair\u0027 themselves and provide a car that occasionally goes up and down the ribbon spraying out the same sort of tiny-CN we see now. Might work, but also isn\u0027t likely to be very good for people breathing the air downwind. Unfortunately CN is as bad as asbestos in your lungs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 2: The primary driver in all cost estimates for space elevators is the cost of launching the materials into space. Once you get one up, the cost of adding more drops dramatically. It would of course still be very expensive, but largely a small fraction of the first. Given this, the idea ends up being that once the first is done, set up at least one more at staggered intervals (the second one like 3-5 years later, third one 3-5 after that, etc). Once the first one starts reaching degradation levels where it is time to decommission it, you can demolish it in a variety of safe ways and then just rebuild another at its location.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T22:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SargeRho\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SargeRho\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpace Elevators on Earth might never happen, but what about other bodies?
