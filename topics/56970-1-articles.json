A realistic one-way probe is of little use now due to the rather low returns it grants. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us discuss how science gathering can be improved further. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne idea would be to make it such that parts like the goo container and such are only able to transmit once, but are able to store up to X number of results before doing so (similarly to how a command pod can store multiple EVA reports and surface samples). Or alternatively, to have a set number of uses, but for that number to be greater than one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone else have ideas with regards to this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, I did have a thought with regards to the other side of science -the spending of it. Perhaps in addition to just parts, there could be \u0022passive\u0022 things unlocked by some research nodes. For instance, an early node could unlock the EVA suits\u0027 \u0022jetpacks\u0022 in addition to a few parts, before which they wouldn\u0027t have them. Some later nodes could increase the amount of fuel they have or their power (the current EVA pack would be near the end of the upgrade path with regards to power and fuel). Or perhaps the runway and spaceplane assembly building would not be built until you researched an early node dealing with aerospace. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to do it would be to have a separate dedicated tree to passive stuff, to give players a new science point sink. With some passives you unlock being EVA pack stuff, a runway/improvements to said runway\u0027s length/etc, increasing the size limit for vehicles you build in the VAB or SAB, etc. Perhaps some passives would unlock an improved variant of certain parts if the original was already available. For instance, an \u0022improved scientific gear\u0022 type of passive science might unlock a \u0022T2\u0022 science part for parts which have a higher science cap then the original (i.e. if you had already gotten all the science you can with the original materials bay, the T2 would be able to get some more science from that location), giving you a reason to send the new variant of the same experiment to a moon you\u0027ve been before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what are everyone\u0027s ideas on the science situation, and how might it be better improved?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
