The game loads without a problem but crashes when I try to load a save or even create a new one. It shows a dialog box\u00A0just before crashing.

No new mods installed since then. The version of the program is 1.10.1.2939 and I don\u0027t know why Steam is not upgrading it to the latest 1.11\u00A0as it always did. I check Steam configuration and it\u0027s set to always upgrade. Could that be the issue? Any idea how to force this upgrade?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMarconi\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-09T10:59:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see this in your logs:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nd3d12: failed to create 2D texture id=4640 w=128 h=128 mips=1 d3dfmt=28 [0x887a0005]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis looks a lot like something I\u2019ve had before which was caused by an outdated graphics driver, so try updating your graphics drivers and see if that resolves the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal Productions","CreatedById":208620,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-09T12:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you tell me your graphics specs?
