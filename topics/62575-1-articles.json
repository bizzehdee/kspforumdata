You could have a mission control linked to the server that shows where all the craft are but the real calculations are done on the controlling PCs...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I don\u0027t know if this is how SQUAD are going to handle multiplayer but it sounds possible that way. What do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Further thought... you could implement a delay time for control from Kerbin to the spacecraft... bit like what is done in the RemoteTech mod. So you send the commands to the server which then sends it out to the spacecraft PC after the correct delay. The Spacecraft PC then sends back the data after the delay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically it would mean one PC per craft and one PC for the server.
