Those beasts are heavy, it takes a lot of torque to turn them around.

You\u0027ve already got the tanks, which are by far more expensive than the fuel they can hold -- just fill them up (well, one of them -- both would be a bit much). Use boosters to get to 10-20km; from there, one KR-2L plus one large tank worth of fuel should get you on such an trajectory that the Nervas can handle the rest. With some creativity, you may even mount several rockomax engines (might be cheaper). Keep in mind that you can additionally run the Nervas from as early as 2-3km (provided nothing is underneath them), and the final 600-1000m/s may come from Nervas alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve launched similar-but-larger contraptions without any trouble; but then again, I never tried a booster-only launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit to add: this is my heavy tanker / refuelling station. 173 tons empty, it went up on four mainsails that were discarded during ascent.

If you use the 100kg structural fuselage to mount the Nervas, they will tap the central tank for propulsion, no fuel lines required (150 funds apiece!)
