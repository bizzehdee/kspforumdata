land, etc.\u00A0 Certainly, when I get to the \u0022strip-mine a moon for science\u0022 phase of my career, I do Minmus before the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, Minmus can be quite challenging to navigate to if you don\u0027t have patched conics yet.\u00A0 It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoable\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and I\u0027ve done it, but the Mun is far easier.\u00A0 I imagine that a newbie would find going to Minmus without patched conics to be very challenging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I usually do, for my very first land-somewhere-other-than-Kerbin mission, when it\u0027s really early career and I have very few parts available and I haven\u0027t even unlocked patched conics yet, is go to the Mun.\u00A0 Even if it\u0027s just land-an-unmanned-probe-and-transmit-science, that\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of science points for very early career, and gives a big boost to unlock other useful parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I tend to unlock patched conics as late as I can get away with, because that frees up cash I can use for unlocking EVA which is a lucrative source of science, and for upgrading the launch pad, and then the VAB to get past the part limit.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022

do the \u0027satellite tourist\u0027 thing and build one to clear all of the contracts you have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of 1.0.5 there is finally a reason you might want to avoid doing this[1]:\u00A0 Satellite repositioning contracts.\u00A0 Since a minimal satellite is probably going to make its orbit with plenty of deltaV left, (especially if you\u0027ve reached the point of building them with Oscar-B/Ant rather than FL-T100/Terrier), those contracts become \u0022make two manoeuvres, get paid\u0022 until the fuel runs out.\u00A0 If you are going to do those contracts, make a point of giving satellites unique names and tag them once they run low on fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[1] Personally I consider it about as
