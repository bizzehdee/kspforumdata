It\u0027s a kludge - a hack. It\u0027s a dreadfully inefficient and problematic one. It is not even remotely close to what is physically happening, whereas patched conics have a basis in reality. It is accurate enough to simulate what happens in stable orbits around either body, and what happens when you go between. L points are a perturbation - an exception rather than the rule.
