I\u0027m not interested in doing the texturing part and it is not my strong suit, but I do create models on occasion. The model I am referencing can be viewed at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/4QpMVufaAVU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/4QpMVufaAVU\u003C/a\u003E. I\u0027ve made small tweaks since I made the video but that is it essentially. A lot of the pieces can share texture space. I intended to allow this model to be included in kspi extended. If my collaborator wishes inclusion to another mod, that can be arranged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can include all the images I\u0027ve used for inspiration if it will help the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T13:12:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe part looks very good, but it\u0027s not meant for KSP.

When you said poly\u0027s, Did you mean tris or faces? I primarily model in quads, so if you meant tris, the task will not be as easy. I was operating under the assumption that poly\u0027s = face count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reax","CreatedById":143112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T14:21:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ego with tri count for game stuff bud.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"somewhatcasual","CreatedById":102043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T23:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gotten the model down to 6269 from~35k tris.
