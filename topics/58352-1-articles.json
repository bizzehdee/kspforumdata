So you won\u0027t want to just go to the right for your gravity turn. You\u0027ll want to go 90 degrees counter clockwise from the red line on the navball. So if North is pointing to the right, you want to go \u0022up\u0022 on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do your gravity turn pretty much immediately. Unless you\u0027re going to crash into a mountain or crater wall, there is NO benefit from waiting until you\u0027re a certain height.

Reminds me of Apollo 13, \u0022I can just look out the window\u0022. I just did it by aiming straight for Kerbin almost immediately after lift off, and then get into an orbit on a plane that is pointing towards Kerbin. Then I can just burn on the backside of the Mun to exit towards Kerbin. It was easy for the most part.
