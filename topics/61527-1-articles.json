I thought that if they could boost your transmission of science that they would be more useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you send a lander to the Duna and want to transmit some science, but you don\u0027t get much for it. You also have a satellite in orbit around the planet that can cut some of the penalty off. Basically wherever you were it would search for the closest satellite in your sphere of influence, like on Duna, and if it found one, in Duna orbit, it would give you a small boost in science transmission and another one if you had a satellite in orbit around Kerbin. It would be limited to one satellite in your current SOI and one in Kerbins SOI to prevent satellite spamming, and also give diminishing returns for each satellite in the chain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think its a clever idea for encouraging the use of probes and sending them to other planets in advance of your landers, and I wanted to see what the community thought of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T22:53:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suppose, although isn\u0027t the opposite effect what would actually happen, since each successive transmission would result in minute losses of data?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T23:14:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it would be better if you just needed a satellite around the parent planet of the body you are on, so you wouldn\u0027t need to have satellites around all the moons. I really like the idea though, there should definitely be incentives for players who want to build infrastructure around the solar system.
