Some of it I wonder why it isn\u0027t in the game already yet. Every update I look for some of this stuff to no avail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Why are the graphics still missing within so many cockpits?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Why is there still only one landing gear choice? (Small landing gear). Why aren\u0027t there medium or large landing gear? God knows we have enough rover wheel choices. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Why is there no solution to mount landing gear straight on a radial body? Your aircraft fuselage is curved. Trying to mount them to work correctly on wings or radial engine mounts is also very hard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) There should be a validation button for builds. How many times have you gotten all the way up to space (or even to another planet) only to find that your fuel hose isn\u0027t working because another part is clipping through it and has broken it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Why is there still no way to do construction in space? Building pieces and lofting them into space and connecting them using docking ports feels like a hack. Why is there no robotic arm?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Why aren\u0027t there larger xenon tanks? I\u0027ve built arrays of xenon engines for larger spacecraft and for space station orbital correction. And you end up with crazy part counts having to paste like 50 stupid little tanks on your vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Will we ever be able to fly around within a space station? Move our little Kerbals through the tubes, look out the windows, visit the different compartments? (Suggestion here, maybe you could build in a system to spawn a tiny Unity universe that is the inside of your space station or vehicle?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Option for realism mode with consumables, air, water, waste, etc. (I know there are mods...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Why do the new structural air intakes in the 0.25 update only pull in .3 of 1.0 worth of air at sea level? It goes down from there. Are they broken??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was one more thing, I\u0027ll try to add later if I remember.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T01:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, welcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve moved this thread to our Suggestions and Development Discussion subforum, since that\u0027s where requests for new features and / or improvements to old ones go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertain of your requests, namely #5, 7, and 8 are on our \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not To Suggest list\u003C/a\u003E (under \u0022Robotics / mechanics,\u0022 \u0022Enhanced IVA / moving around in stations or rockets,\u0022 and \u0022Life Support\u0022 respectively). This isn\u0027t meant to be a criticism of the quality or desirability of the requested feature; we\u0027ve just received so many requests and had so much discussion of these features in the past that we feel that attention should be given to other features that might otherwise get buried under the flood of common suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, keep in mind that the answer to any \u0022Why hasn\u0027t [feature x] been implemented?\u0022 question may very well be that the game is still in development, and the developers may simply have been devoting their time and resources to implementing those features that are in the game as it stands now (which doesn\u0027t necessarily either guarantee or rule out those features being in the game in the future).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
