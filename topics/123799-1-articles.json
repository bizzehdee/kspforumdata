My question is, since I haven\u0027t gone to Eve since the last update, what is a good aerocapture periapsis for ships coming into Eve from Kerbin. I can\u0027t dip too low into the atmosphere because I (a. don\u0027t want to de-orbit some of my modules, and (b. don\u0027t have heat shields on many of my crafts, so I can\u0027t brake super hard and low in the atmosphere. I\u0027m just looking for an altitude that will at least get me into an elliptical orbit around Eve without burning my craft up in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some images of the crafts so you can get an idea of what\u0027s going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/BL3Y8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
