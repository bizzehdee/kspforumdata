I then pitched up to 30 degrees, and it held that attitude as well, however, it did drop the nose quite a bit before settling into place, thus forcing me to pitch the plane up to more than 30 degrees (35-40) to counter that drop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the weird stuff: First, I can report the same problem that many others have reported as well - when one controller is disconnected, the remaining 2 are not capable of keeping the plane still on their corresponding axes.

So when you roll, you occupy them doing the roll - and since there\u0027s nothing else left to control it, the craft pitches down.
