I mean, several weeks BEFORE 0.23 came out. I\u0027m talking about the \u0027hatch door\u0027 and the \u0027airlock doors\u0027. Each of those parts has a crew capacity of more than 1, and in the VAB/SPH the MechJeb \u0027vessel info\u0027 window accurately reflects the crew capacity of the ship as parts are added and removed. Also, the KSP \u0027crew\u0027 tab at the top is correct. But after launch, the MJ vessel info window changes the crew capacity number, and now each hatch part shows that it will only hold ONE Kerbal. Furthermore, trying to use Crew Manifest to transfer crew to the parts doesn\u0027t work. You select, say, the cockpit, and then the airlock doors, but when you click \u0027out\u0027 from the cockpit, the Kerbal doesn\u0027t transfer to the airlock, he goes into the nearest part to the airlock that can hold crew. Now, sometimes I CAN get a guy into the part, but when I try to EVA, it says \u0027hatch is obstructed, can\u0027t exit\u0027, just like on the Scarab and Lady Bug buggies. I\u0027ve even tried Vanguard to get someone to EVA from a hatch door or airlock, still no dice. I right click, select \u0027activate hatch\u0027, then \u0027start EVA\u0027, and it says something like \u0027no crew module detected\u0027. And this is when the airlock is DIRECTLY attached to a part that has crew in it, I\u0027m not trying to pull someone from the other end of the ship. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBah. That was all just FYI. Could there be a problem with the latest Vanguard plugin? It seems like this all started about the time that the latest \u0027improved\u0027 version was released. Or perhaps Crew Manifest? I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m just spitballing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the buggies\u0027 hatches being \u0027obstructed\u0027 could it be the collider for the sliding canopy that\u0027s in the way? Or maybe the \u0027hatch\u0027 model or whatever it\u0027s called, is sitting just a fraction too low, and the \u0027floor\u0027 is blocking it? I only bring this up because there have been times when I\u0027m putting a ladder at the base of the airlock doors (when they still worked), and it looked like it was low enough, but I got the \u0027hatch obstructed\u0027 warning. So I go back into the editor and move the ladder like TWO PIXELS down, and then it works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just trying to brainstorm some ideas for fixes.
