I don\u0027t expect everything you build to be fully compatible (though no part names have changed so your stuff will be safe). \n\nThe biggest change is the implementation of a soft boiloff mechanic. **Liquid Hydrogen will now slowly evaporate from most tanks**. This is slowish, but will cut into your fuel reserves on long trips. Plan accordingly, or... use the new insulated tanks (gold foil tanks). These tanks use a stream of ElectricCharge to stop the boiloff. As a penalty they are a bit more costly and have a slightly worse mass ratio. However, the non-insulated lifter tanks have better mass ratios than they used to.\n\n**CryoEngines 0.2.0**\n\n- Deprecated BDAnimationModules\n- Bundled a new plugin, DeployableEngines, which does the things that BDAnimationModules did\n- Added situation masks to contract parameters\n- Fuel tanks containing LiquidHydrogen are now split into lifting tanks and insulated tanks\n- Lifting tanks are all standard stock fuel tanks\n- Lifting tanks have good mass ratios, but LiquidHydrogen contained in them boils away over time\n- Insulated tanks are the large gold foil tanks that used to be in NF Propulsion\n- Insulated tanks have poor mass ratios, but consume ElectricCharge to stop the LiquidHydrogen from evaporating\n- Changes to the base masses, mix ratios and capacities of LiquidHydrogen tanks"},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-23T04:13:07Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t kept up too well with all the debate over boiloff.
