All I wanted to know was if it was ever going to be a feature and a possible date of arrival. You have provided both and I thank you. Yes, it is planned but arrival date is unknown.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobe","CreatedById":95803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T10:38:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI almost would prefer a dedicated mod manager whereby you can have greater control over how you incorporate each mod into the game. For example, it\u0027d be nice if mods were parsed in such a way that parts could be included or excluded simply by opening it in the manager into a hierarchical navigation window and checking/unchecking specific parts folders. This would simplify the process of stripping down a large mod by manually deleting folders and would make it easier to restore them if you decided you want them back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"madlemur","CreatedById":116597,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T14:40:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*cough*kerbalstuff*cough*ckan*cough*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceSniper","CreatedById":142182,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T07:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, but lets be honest, ckan doesnt even work very well, so far I am yet to update anything succesfully, it constantly freezes and I end up going to the curse website and doing it manually.
