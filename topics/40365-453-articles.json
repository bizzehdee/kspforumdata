It is basically an attempt to polish the kspi experience with a focus on clarity and usability. Most of the stat inflation has been muted for a more stocklike experience. Parts are parts mostly. No hidden upgrades. Most stat changing modes were removed to clarify progression. The focus was maintaining each part with a useful niche even after you\u0027ve progressed up the tree. Resource compatibility was improved to play nicer with other mods. (A general trend. CommunityResourcePack was the main thrust of that.) More module functionality was exposed for part file configuration. This was mostly as a result of tweakscale integration. Radiators now glow red hot proportional to wasteheat. I know temperature is a more correct, but I wanted a visual indicator for waste heat besides a resource bar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe future plans were to expose more functionality to the part files to allow additional advanced configurations to like upgrades and modes. Comprehensive part configuration is also needed to make the mode compatible with the many various universe resize packs. I also was working on removing treeloader dependance, and making upgrades tech tree/node agnostic to allow players more customization of their tech tree. And a sort of resource progression was intended, as well as more final, balanced costs for resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should note that I received a lot of good feedback on these changes, particularly the usability stuff. The negative feedback I received was mostly players complaining that they missed the advanced features like extra modes and upgrades and then there were those that I will kindly say probably enjoyed overpowered parts and \u0022realism\u0022. (Views which I understand, but I had to release at some point.) I had plans to address both of those complaints with the next version with part file configurations. There is already a \u0022classic kspi\u0022 configuration available. The guiding idea I was working with was that kspilite was balanced for stock ksp, and you could download module manager configs to suit your tastes or the universe you were playing in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also commissioned a new part, which roverdude kindly provided:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93308-KSPI-Lite-needs-a-model-for-it-s-impact-experiment\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93308-KSPI-Lite-needs-a-model-for-it-s-impact-experiment\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntended to give the impact experiment it\u0027s own part so that it doesn\u0027t have to override the stock experiment and confuse players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were many smaller bug fixes to kspi and ors. You can review my pull request history in my repo for most of them. I would be happy to help you whatever way I can. It\u0027s great to have you back. I had like a billion questions about the code while developing kspilite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those wondering about kspilite, there will only ever be one version of kspi. I intend to align kspilite to meet with fractals versions whenever there is a conflict. I expect that it will eventually be depreciated back to my old hobby version that I use personally, but still available publicly like my experimental version was for the last year. I will probably support .25, so that people that started saves don\u0027t have to delete their saves, but that will likely be the end of that little experiment. I had fun, I hope you guys did as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T12:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, and the telescope experiment is utterly broken and I haven\u0027t the foggiest idea how to fix it.
