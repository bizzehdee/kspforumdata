I don\u0027t think many games would come close to the experience you\u0027d get in jet packing across a planet or an EVA in low orbit. Let alone landing your space plane while in cockpit view.\n\nSorry if this has already been discussed."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T01:10:38Z","Content":"KSP can be made to work in Oculus (I\u0027ve seen it, though there\u0027s no stock support I\u0027m aware of so don\u0027t ask me how). You cant really get an appreciation of what that does from youtube but I imagine it would be cool as all get out. I\u0027ll make a note that if my mission control group can get some Oculus Rift kits (we have 1 already) we should look into that."},{"CreatedByName":"Dedjal","CreatedById":57220,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T01:12:30Z","Content":"Hum. Not my type of coffee, but I guess there are people playing KSP in first person view.\n\nPersonally, I feel a bit claustrophobic inside Jeb\u0027s head."}]}
