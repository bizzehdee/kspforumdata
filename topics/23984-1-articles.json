Well, they wanted to make massive changes that they knew they couldn\u0027t get right the first time, so they did their best and put out a version designed to test as many of their ideas as they could and greatly reduced its price over their usual offerings. Next, they changed to a yearly release cycle and started hammering out massive improvements using what they learned to create what is essentially win 8.5 in less than half the time a normal release would take, they also decided to offer this for free to Win8 users. This is all at the same time as porting like 95% of the windows code to arm, optimising it for that, then porting all of that to be used on phones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not gone completely smoothly but there\u0027s very little precedent to this sort of company wide paradigm shift so overall I\u0027d say they did about as well as could reasonably be expected.

That is the critical problem MS is working to address. People want portability, but people also need to be productive. That means we need a solution that can be both, the best answer for that is a tablet that can turn into a laptop and then turn into a desktop very easily. Sure, gamers and high demand people will need big PCs for years and years but that\u0027s a small portion of the population. As I\u0027ve said before, stock Win 8 is awful for the desktop side right now, but it\u0027s fantastic for tablets and pretty good for laptops. We know MS can do desktop very well, we also now know (and importantly THEY know) that they can do tablets well, the only thing left is to bring those together. You can dispute whether MS\u0027s path for getting to the end is the best way or not (I\u0027d say not quite) but the goal is exactly what is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the simplicity side, simplicity is not just about ease of use, it\u0027s also about reliability and consistency and that is what MS is focusing on for the mobile side. Over time I desperately hope MS brings more customisability to mobile but it\u0027s not as important as it is for desktop use. Win 8.1 is opening a huge amount up with a lot more customisation and desktop oriented features, it\u0027s also narrowing the gap between Metro and desktop. As for general desktop hackability, that\u0027s pretty much stayed the same or improved with 8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe share button doesn\u0027t hurt you, it\u0027s not in the way or forcing you. It\u0027s there because the basic UI needs to remain constant through the OS, it\u0027s also only really designed for the mobile side where it does make a lot of sense for people who use a lot of social stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Amram\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Amram\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eits good for the economy to generate more cashflow, its good for the user to have more options, i just dont think its wise to abandon the userbase that you have built your comany on for the last quarter century, on which you still rely, in order to put the newcomers at the top of your priorities.

Also, it is looking increasingly likely that Stardock will lose a lot of purpose with 8.1 as MS is basically just checking off everything they are selling and adding it to the stock OS. This is just naturally filling out and polishing the OS as they get time to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour mid section is mostly covered above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvidence is suggesting MS is not stupid and they are starting to lean back towards the desktop, the eventual result of this will be that if you live 100% through a desktop PC it will be as good as Win 7. It\u0027s not there yet but just look at the XP\u0026gt;vista\u0026gt;7 UX improvements if you doubt MS can do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf MS didn\u0027t take these risks now and invest in the unpleasant adjustment period this early they would be a much worse long term position.

They have consistently done enough to maintain the momentum over the last few years, they still screw up a lot but they get a lot right too. My personal view is that I will stick with them until the WIn 9 time (2015), if they haven\u0027t achieved their goals by then I will look around for alternatives. Unfortunately on that front neither Apple or Google are showing any intention of moving to the future, Apple wants iOS to take over OSX (while MS is making Windows take over mobile instead), and Google seem to think that chromebooks are a valid desktop substitute!
