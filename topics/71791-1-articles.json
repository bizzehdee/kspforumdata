The only mod that adds an ion engine that I have found is from ksp .22 and it works only with .cfg edits however I am trying to find an ion engine that can compliment KSPI as a slow efficient means of propulsion, which also is balanced and aesthetically pleasing. the .22 ones are pretty plain and don\u0027t suit the KSPI feel\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tychochallenge","CreatedById":85444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T01:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eare you talking about hybrid ion pack?

However, \u0022compatible\u0022 does not mean that it\u0027s properly playable. KSPI operates with such high amounts of power that a pack like Near Future Propulsion cannot be balanced against it. Even the lightest and tiniest KSPI reactors can power dozens of NFP\u0027s strongest engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth mods are balanced on their own, but there\u0027s a significant difference in the paradigm of how that balance is achieved. This design difference causes them not to work well together - in fact, KSPI doesn\u0027t work well with anything that consumes a lot of power and aims to compare or balance this against stock, because it elects to ignore stock completely in favor of its own numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, the safe assumption is that if two different mods implement the same thing (such as reactors and radiators), the parts are not interchangable by default.
