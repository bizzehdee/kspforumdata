The space race was a effort on both sides to what county had better technology and better economic system. The Soviets had lead in the beginning with many major firsts. Like the first man in space, first satellite and, first spacewalk. Although later the Americans caught up, effectively winning the race with the moon landing. Both America and Soviet Union launched a joint mission, thus ending the space race.

Using the mighty Saturn V rocket \u00A0got them to the moon. In total there were 14 missions which only 6 Of them actually landed on the moon. Tragically when Apollo 1s crew was training, a fire started. They were unable to get out and burned to death. Apollo 4-6 were unmanned test flights of the Saturn V. Apollo 7-10 were manned flights, either testing spacecraft or training for the real moon landing. Of course we all know Apollo 11, the first men on the moon. The historic flight took off on July 16th 1969 from Kennedy space center. Later, \u00A0on july 20th neil armstrong and buzz aldrin entered the lunar lander. When they were landing the computer was going to land them in a rock fill area. Neil took control and piloted the lander to safety with only 25 seconds of fuel left. After nearly 22 hours on the moon\u0027s surface, they left the moon. Later they returned safely to earth. Apollo 12 was the 2nd moon landing where nothing that interesting happened. Apollo 13 was a major failure in the Apollo program. The mission even started with problems, one of the 2nd stage engines on the saturn V rocket failed. But they made orbit fine. While apollo 13 was heading for the moon, houston told the crew to stir the oxygen tank. It caused the tank to explode, venting all of the oxygen to space. The Command module lost power, forcing them to using the lunar lander as a lifeboat. As they approached the moon the crew ran out of C02 removers, threatening to choke the crew. They had to rig some parts to use the different filters. After nearly 6 days in space the crew returned home safely. The rest of the missions, apollo 14-17 were uneventful. Apollo 15-17 carried a rover and allowed longer stays on the moon.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:30pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EPart 9: Outro\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EThese are the events of old NASA, how it began and the men who were pioneers. \u00A0Their struggles and triumphs.

The USSR got the first satellite and the first cosmonaut into orbit because they focused on short-term goals that would undergird their claims of superiority and bolster their political ends. They used a managed economy to push through whatever needed to be done; it\u0027s perhaps the most brilliant nonmilitary example of the success of a managed economy.
