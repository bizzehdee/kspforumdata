Power (in W) is (torque * ground speed / wheel radius) - or torque * revolutions (in radians/second) if that\u0027s more convenient - and the energy charge drain per second should be proportional to that based on your favourite guess for how many Joules there are in an EC (but the same proportion for every part, probably).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means there\u0027s a ground speed at which the engine operates at both max torque and max power. Calculate that once for each part; each tick, if ground speed is below that then apply max torque and calculate the (lower) power requirement; if it\u0027s above that, use max power and calculate the lower torque generation. There\u0027s no floatcurve for torque here at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo wrinkles. There probably wants to be a minimum speed for power calculations of 0.1 m/s or so - sitting and grinding the engine without getting anywhere will drain power from internal losses in the motor. The rev limit should still exist, applying an absolute upper maximum limit to speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRolling resistance is more complicated. For a given load it tends to be a constant force), hence taking power proportional to speed. The late David Mackay\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sustainable/book/tex/ps/253.326.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBeyond Hot Air\u003C/a\u003E has some useful rules of thumb here, one of which is that in motor cars it is proportional to 100 Newtons per tonne of the vehicle... but of course these are motor cars on asphalt. Rolling resistance is going to be higher on rough ground - and you might say higher still with tracks, but the difference between tracked and wheeled RR is much less on rough ground where wheels suffer more. It\u0027s also interesting that even given cars\u0027 relatively poor RR, air resistance is the larger term above about 16mph; on an airless earth-like body (eg Tylo) you could get up to the rev limit on the flat with ease.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think in U5 it\u0027s going to be straightforward to determine the actual weight (not mass) each part is bearing. I suggest assigning each part a max design load, probably directly proportional to the part\u0027s mass. If the weight on the part is exactly equal to the design load, drag is 0.08 times the weight on the part, 0.1 times if the part is tracked [1]. This does then want a floatcurve or similar; near the design load, changes in weight will change RR in direct proportion. Below half the design load, the curve will start to flatten out so that 0 weight there\u0027s still some drag (perhaps, conveniently, equal to the drag due to the part\u0027s weight alone on Kerbin, so eg a 50kg wheel weighs 500N on Kerbin so will always apply at least 40N of rolling resistance against the direction of motion); above the design load the curve should become more steep so losses spike when the part is overloaded. The calculated force can then be divided by the wheel radius to get the anti-torque to be subtracted from the engine output.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis max design load is closely related to the suspension defaults and maximum values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[1] This is based on a total thumb in the air guess based on various figures for offroad rolling resistance which varies wildly based on the nature of the surface in question. Short of querying the biome and making things slower in Deserts than on Plains, I don\u0027t think we want to get into that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, these values also might be slightly better on parts with larger wheels. We might notice above that all our calculations favour tiny wheels - you can get up to your maximum power at a lower speed (and indeed this is because the same torque makes for more force on the ground). Larger wheels give a smoother ride, which is why the safety bicycle wasn\u0027t really feasible until the pneumatic tyre; an Ordinary\u0027s huge wheel gives a reasonable ride even with solid tyres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParts with tiny wheels would also tend to have tiny suspension travel (and hence design load) but of course the real respect in which they lose out will be the maximum speed their rev limit implies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m afraid this turned into a bit of a saga. Sorry. However, I don\u0027t think any of it is really a call for immediate action, more assembling all my thoughts in one place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T03:12:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222526709\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022121236\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461201929\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022123074\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022damerell\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, damerell said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWall of text....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDude I really appreciate guys like you to help fill in blanks!

With a hard cap it\u0027s a bit harder to up the top speed of the tracks should someone so desire. With the soft cap, as released, top speed remains unchanged, but changing one variable in part.cfg would let someone adjust the speed to their preferences. The soft cap would shift upwards on its own, as a function of the new torque curve. I was always fairly happy with the long tracks, which I used most often, but the short ones with three road wheels and the skidsteer micro-rover bogies always felt waaaayyyyy too slow to me. I wanted them to have speed parity with the big ones, but never did get their speed upped accordingly. The hard cap also means using reverse to slow down is outright impossible when you crest the coded in top speed, a region where using Squad\u0027s brake button is an almost guaranteed frontflip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI quite like the idea of regenerative braking being used to give these things a bit more stopping power. Another point of using reverse as brakes is, for me and many others, analog inputs let us apply \u003Cem\u003Epartial\u003C/em\u003E braking. MechJeb will do this as well if you\u0027re using its cruise control module. With regenerative braking there\u0027d be enough force on hand at any speed to do this(IIRC this gets stronger the faster you\u0027re turning the drive motor) and you\u0027d be able to recharge quite a bit if not all of your batteries cruising down slopes.

MechJeb splits its modules across the entire tech tree without needing a million part.cfgs for each node. Honestly, though, with how late we get rover parts in general, I\u0027m fine with it just being the default state. By the time we\u0027ve got tracks, the ability to put them into space, the ability to feed their voracious appetite for EC, we\u0027re already technologically advanced enough that knowing the principle is a foregone conclusion.
