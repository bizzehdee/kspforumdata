Is there any method of orienting the part to allow it to attach in-line with the center fuselage?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T08:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry playing around with the snap-to-degree setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr for something experimental: Can you Alt-click-copy the center fuselage with just one connector attached to get a part you can then attach via 2x-symmetry?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I making any sense?

You could duplicate and modify a few values in the .cfg for the Mk2 to change it to a side-mount, but I don\u0027t remember the exact process for doing this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
