The attached files are a backup I made a day before finishing the build and the second is the station as it was saved just before launching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause it is a station, I attached an orange tank below with 6 launch clamps to it so it wouldn\u0027t fall and be destroyed by the launch logic. When I pressed launch, the ship was nowhere to be found and I couldnt select any ships. IIRC I hit revert but then the ship was broken, but didn\u0027t have either the orange tank or the clamps. The \u0022Vessel Name\u0022 and kerbal flag where there with no way to change it, and the parts where as seen from the pics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally fixed the VAB by hitting twice the new ship button.

The remedy for this is to delete the corrupt .craft which, as GiantTank pointed out, is generally small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you are able to actually load the .craft but it\u0027s somehow broken, or only that .craft doesn\u0027t want to load, then it\u0027s possible the file was corrupt another way. Sometimes this happens if you use some excessive clipping techniques, especially if the ALT\u002BF12 menu or UNDO is involved. You can sometimes tell if this is the case, because the .craft file will have an excessive part count (which you can see in the Load dialog). This can cause weird ghost parts or things to disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking inside your craft files at the fuel tank, it looks like the fuel tank was somehow connected incorrectly by the game. The links are broken and misreferencing parts. I have a suspicion that perhaps UNDO was used, or that the game failed to connect correctly while symmetry was on. Unfortunately, this means that your corrupt file is probably too much of a mess to manually fix. Or at least, it\u0027s probably not worth the time to fix it. I would say that the corrupt .craft was probably also responsible for the crashing/buggy behavior that you saw when launching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour .bak version looks okay, although I didn\u0027t inspect it too deeply. Hopefully that narrows down where your problem might have come from, so that you can avoid it in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T02:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll just copy the backup version and go from there then.

The difference in parts is way too much.
