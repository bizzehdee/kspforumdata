Seems most games I have bought for awhile now if they do have a manual it contains a very limited amout of information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I was developing a game the manual would be the very last on my to do list and probally be very limited. My reasoning it would take time, resources and effort away from other things and there always seems there are plenty of players willing to make some sort of guide, contribute to wiki, create charts with stats and other info, make a video and answer player questions on forums. This happens even if a comprehensive manual exist. A lot of people seem to look elsewhere for the information before going to a manual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also rather easier for a lot of people to learn with in game tutorials, not sure how good the tutorials Squad comes up will be or what exactly they will cover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO it is not a too bad of practice not to release a manual since the vast majority of gamers have access to a reliable internet connection and if the devs include a good tutorial. Personally the last thing I look for is a manual when I have a question about a game. I minimize and do a google search.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T19:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese suggestions have been moved to the Suggestions \u0026amp; Development forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T17:49:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E a game manual have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Controls information.
