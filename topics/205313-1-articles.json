Like a north monopole would be attracted to the south magnetic pole of a magnet and would move along the lines to get there. Kind of like how electric charges behave in electric fields.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever I\u0027m asking here because my intuition with these things is rarely correct. Like for an electrically charged particle in a magnetic field, F=VxB was very counter intuitive and I still haven\u0027t fully wrapped my head around it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m curious in the first place because, well for a lack of a better phrase, It is sort of for a world building thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-19T22:46:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo start with, keep in mind that you want to conceptualize everything in terms of field interactions, not interaction between the object and the field. The electrically charged particle in a magnetic field experiences the Lorentz force because its electrostatic field is moving through a magnetic field and the motion of one field through the other produces a field interaction. a\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is easier to conceptualize the F=VxB breakdown of the Lorentz force if you remember that (a) the photon is the gauge boson and thus the force carrier for electromagnetism, (b) a photon is a quanta of a transverse wave, and (c) the electric and magnetic components of that transverse wave are perpendicular. Because the electric and magnetic components of a photon are perpendicular to each other, electric and magnetic fields can only interact perpendicularly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what does the magnetic field of a monopole look like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlike dipole electrostatic fields, magnetic dipoles do not arise from the aggregate of negative charges on one side and positive charges on the other, but rather arise from the intrinsic dipole magnetic moment of elementary particles. The field of a magnetic monopole would be a monopole magnetic moment, which is NOT merely the bisection of a dipole moment, but something else entirely which we haven\u0027t ever observed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut our best guess would be to analogize to the Coulomb and Lorentz interactions.

And so, by analogy, a monopole in a magnetic dipole field would act the same as an electrical charge in an electric dipole field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, yes, your intuition is right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-22T10:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA magnetic monopole in a magnetic field would be analogous to a charged particle in an electric field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
