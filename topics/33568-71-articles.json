computing a more realistic (and therefore accurate) departure burn starting from the orbit you provide to the correct hyperbolic excess velocity vector.\u00A0 In short, the Compute Departure DV number

The porkchop plotter finds a good window and passes the departure and arrival times (UT) to the burn computer. Since I\u0027m unable to get the porkchop plotter to start with an assumption of a certain SMA and inclination, when I do finally add these details to the burn computer it sometimes gives me really bad suggestions (like burning retrograde with -5k dV to get to Mars). I suppose this is because (I\u0027m a physicist but no astrodynamicist so I\u0027m only guessing here) that the selected window works given the position in the synodic period but not with the relative inclinations. Do you have any advice for this situation? Something I have found which works, is to ask mechjeb for its best injection burn, and use mission architect to optimise a path near to that time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: OK, I have managed to figure out that I should correctly choose my RAAN for my pre-injection orbit and I can then use the launch window planning tool to figure out how to get there.
