However, he is now in the process of phasing out that address and will likely delete it or soft-delete it at some point in the near future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at the KSP store website I do not see a way to change the email address over. Edit profile just goes to the password reset page.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to do this? Or perhaps migrate it to a Steam account? Or enable an alternate access route?\u00A0I know that was a thing for old accounts many years back and IDK if it is still an option. I don\u0027t want to have to re-buy the game/DLCs for like what, $100 now? when I originally got the game for $23, although to be fair I have gotten far more than $100 worth of enjoyment out of this game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe recent password reset fiasco brought this to my attention. If it happens again after the email address is gone I will have no way to reset my password.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-20T00:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Kerbal Network since it\u0027s about the store and not the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea, since I don\u0027t have a store account.\u00A0 You might be best off emailing \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\u0022 class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u002241323431312e3335012a243323202d323120222431332e2633202c6f222e2c\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/a\u003E and asking them there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-20T01:10:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm.
