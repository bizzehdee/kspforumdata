Your rocket is somehow unbalanced. \n\nWhen my launches go to one side immediately like that, its usually because of some silly mistake like missing fuel line, but if that\u0027s all perfect then it must lay with the cargo, is the center of mass and thrust aligned? Even if your cargo CoM is slightly off, putting it ontop of a rocket will have further consequences however i notice your rocket is quite short. But still. \n\nI would consider rebuilding entirely, \n\nits probably an extra wing on that little fairing contraption thing, i dont know. Dont wings do some some jazzy \u0022lift\u0022 forces? ASAS will only help you go where you point, its help is really limited. It aint magic. \n\nBARING in mind the reaction wheels may spin a .5 tonne lander capsule with ease, but a 200 odd tonne launcher, in gravity - on the ground; there\u0027s going to be next to no \u0022control\u0022 given for your 1.5 kn of energy or whatever. \n\nI personally like SAS as its stands, and hope it wont change, i imagine with squads new aerodynamics SAS will be less useful ( or needed more) , as apparently SAS is already overpowered."},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T21:32:26Z","Content":"If you look in the bottom left you can see that the SAS is applying maximum force to try to keep the rocket pointing upward, but it just can\u0027t.
