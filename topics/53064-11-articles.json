If you experience a constant crawl, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s about ECLSS. For debugging, you should try disabling that mod, however. The same goes for RT2: If you think RT2 is at fault, just disable the plugin for a test run. But take care ONLY to remove the plugin, not the entire folder, as missing parts could cause some vessels being removed from your save. E.g. just remove GameData\\RemoteTech2\\Plugins\\RemoteTech2.dll to test if the RT plugin is at fault.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedievalNerd","CreatedById":84735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T02:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CheaterEater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CheaterEater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve been having a persistent issue with TreeEdit.

I have noticed that i can get around the small KSC comms range by deploying a simple probe core with a comms dish on it in between 2 girders covered in enough solar panels to charge it full in the day and enough batteries to last over night on 4x mini-landing gear powered either an \u0022ant engine\u0022 or single \u0022place anywhere 7 linear RCS port\u0022 (or by rover wheels once unlocked) to \u0022drive/steer\u0022 off the runway/launch pad. But once budgets come into play it will be abit wasteful to have to do this. I know we can alter its range via cfg file edits but is it possible to attach its range to tech tree nodes? It would feel far more realistic if the KSC had the \u0022latest\u0022 comms dish installed by default (even if at a dishes $$ cost) than to use a \u0022ground comms relay buggy/rover\u0022.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECilph is working on code to implement remote stations.

It should be known that DSN was built pretty early on, so it\u0027s a bit of a \u0027gamey\u0027 challenge to have to do a sat network so early on to keep contact with probes as they orbit the earth. I don\u0027t know when Cilph plans to implement this, he did mention a big change to the settings file for the next version.

This plugin (group of plugins really) is in early Alpha stage, as in there will be bugs and complications. KSP is in heavy development. The combination of the two means, if you don\u0027t like tweaking and starting saves over, do not use it. The mantra at the moment should be copy your KSP folder, add your mods, tweak until it works how you want, start a save, enjoy but do NOT change/update the mods installed unless you don\u0027t mind risking breaking your save.
