In practice, it isn\u0027t that simple and doesn\u0027t work out as well as predicted. Previously, pre-0.14, this was offered - people could download early release versions of KSP and play them, after which they\u0027d hopefully report bugs. This, unfortunately, did not go that well and resulted in a lot of issues with the Forums being an unreliable source of useful Bug Reports due to a high noise-to-signal ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, whilst things have changed a lot since then - we\u0027ve gotten a Bug Tracker and our Community has grown astronomically - I don\u0027t feel that the core issue is fixed by either of those changes. For me, the core issue is that we simply aren\u0027t in a place in development where pre-releases would be of a benefit to the player or to us. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the Experimental phase we do large amounts of minor bug fixes, some severe bug fixes and a lot of tweaking. These are cycles that require very specific, dedicated and precise feedback from the Testers and that\u0027s something that is best done with small Teams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething else that\u0027s worth noting is that you mentioned how the quantity of players downloaded the pre-release, potentially buggy, builds would be pretty low. In my opinion, it would actually be the complete opposite. If you\u0027d just heard that your, hopefully, favourite game has a new, but potentially broken, version out then you would probably download it as soon as you can. Thus, we would have \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of people downloading the builds and then proceeding to be disappointed that areas of it were unrefined and/or broken. Unfortunately, a notable percentage of those that dl\u0027d it and had issues would take to the Forums/Community and express their disappointment and dissatisfaction in a less-than-desirable manner - something that no-one would benefit from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the number of builds that we go through during Testing is pretty high - at times it\u0027s almost several a day - and as NoMrBond said very well, that would strain our servers immensely if we had thousands of people downloading them every hour. As has been mentioned in previous responses, we still do use the public as \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through\u0022\u003Eguinea pigs\u003C/span\u003E testers, just in a more informal sense and in the manner of further testing a well-tested and playable update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, it\u0027s not something that \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E have ruled out completely, but it\u0027s something that I won\u0027t be considering, or planning for, in the near future or during this current phase of development.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tokay Gris","CreatedById":58301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T22:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ted\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ted\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOverall, it\u0027s not something that \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E have ruled out completely, but it\u0027s something that I won\u0027t be considering, or planning for, in the near future or during this current phase of development.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, it was an idea.
