Many of the second stages use twin rocket engines, and these would be covered with a conical decoupler. The basic layout being a fuel tank above, then 2\u002B rockets which have either their own stack nodes or are (as mine currently are) surface attached. The decoupler (which is a big cone with a series of colliders to form a hollow) is attached to the tank\u0027s bottom stack node. Then the next stage is attached below that. The theory being, when the stage is disconnected, the engines slide out from the hollow of the decoupler\u0027s collision mesh, and off you go. And here\u0027s what should happen;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uPKoiSN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uPKoiSN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, the engines keep hitting the edges and I\u0027ve made them a bit explosive (this stage engine was to be gas core nuclear, which is a bit reactive), and so the result is usually one engine clips, explodes, takes out any other engines, which also explode, and I have a full tank of juice with no rockets, spinning madly in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThusly;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pNztsYJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pNztsYJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question is, have people run into this before? And, if so, what do people usually do? I know I\u0027ve used this system with parts from the FASA mod without encountering the same issue, but the mu file import doesn\u0027t tell me a lot about how collision meshes are configured, so I can\u0027t figure out how they solved it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is appreciated. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TiktaalikDreaming","CreatedById":136290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T09:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENever mind.
