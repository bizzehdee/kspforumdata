How do you do it? \n\nDo you go 1.25m and make it tall, or perhaps 2.5 with some room to spare? I\u0027d like to see some of your designs. \n\nSince the introduction of the offset tool, I have been using this arrangement:\n\n![20wortG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/20wortG.jpg)\n\nIt works great in a 2.5m situation because you can fit it all inside a fairing with some room to spare. Its light. It works great as an ascent stage for an Apollo style setup. Works great as a 2-Kerbal escape pod from a Space Station.\n\nThe downside is that it will somewhat mess up your IVA views, but that is relatively minor. If you go to the guy in the right can and IVA with him, your view is from the left can.\n\nI don\u0027t know if it is offensive to some due to the minor clipping, but I envision Werner simply telling *Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co.* to make the the Mk I Lander Can \u0022a double model.\u0022\n\n![9n7P14X.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9n7P14X.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T21:15:52Z","Content":"I just use a 2-kerbal can.
