Once on the pad it is fine, it is also fine in the preview image for the part, but on spawning it in the VAB it is displayed as deployed. Normally fixing this is as easy as unchecking the auto play animation check box in Unity, but I have already done that. It is very distracting to have the part deployed like this when trying to place the fairing over it, it sticks out so while once in the game it doesn\u0027t cause problems, in the VAB it is a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a 2 part animation. The first animation is a standard solar panel deploy part module. The second is a generic animation module you can deploy afterwards that closes the front 2 panels. The animation in the VAB starts halfway between the 2 animations at frame 279. I\u0027m not sure how to go about fixing this but also keeping both animations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kxjJhaV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kxjJhaV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AH7Su5R.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AH7Su5R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T08:05:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if you are still looking to resolve this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I had similar one recently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you have checked telescope clip (when setting animation clips), not tele_close.
