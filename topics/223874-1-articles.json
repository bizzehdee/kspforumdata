It took, two years, I think? I referred to it as, \u0022The Saga of Enoch Root\u0022. IYKYK. Going back now and rereading \u003Cem\u003EThe Gap Cycle\u003C/em\u003E by Stephen R. Donaldson. I haven\u0027t read it since he finished it, which is 28 years now. Figured I would dust it off again. I\u0027ve got a ton of new Tim Powers that I\u0027ve bought for my wife that I haven\u0027t read, probably move on to those next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
