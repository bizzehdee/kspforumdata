I started a career mode and I get all the tech and I have my Atomic Engines and I lift off to Duna and I get into orbit and I am starting my engines and i\u0027m about to get to Duna and then I look at my engines and they are almost out completely! ...! The setup I use is getting a big Rockomax X200-32 tank and 4 FL-T200\u0027s. Sticking them on the side of the Rockomax X200-32 and getting 4 fuel lines and attaching them to the rocomax X200-32 tank to then engine. (Therefor ATON of gas) Did they change the fuel Consumption of the Atomic Engine? ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T19:21:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dspan\\_000**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T03:42:50Z","Content":"They only use LF now, not oxidizer.
