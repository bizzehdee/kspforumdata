In it is a concept called \u0027Spatial IO\u0027 wherein you basically capture space and stuff it into a hard drive. One funny thing you can do is capture a person who happens to be inside the spatial cage. This got me wondering...if you had a hard drive or solid state drive large enough, could you suspend a human being in it? Would they survive at all?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo you could not, and no they would not survive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:11:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you meaning, converting a person to some digital state and reproducing them after some time?
