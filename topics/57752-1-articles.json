Space tourism is something that would fit well with the canon imo and could be seamlessly integrated into career mode. Building a nice, large colony with an offworld VAB/SPH would be another possible goal. Who doesn\u0027t want to have a VAB/SPH with landing strip on Duna and Laythe?

Once you are done you are either back to playing pure sandbox mode or have to start over from scratch.

I have great vibe about reaching another planet or moon- Dres is the one that I want to be on. For me, it\u0027s really about telling the community about my travels. The most useful way of making more out of your trip is by making it more homely- when I say this, I am talking about utilities. Say if you went to Duna. For me, this would be a pride moment. I will, of course, start with the flag ceremony. Then I would of brought a habitat module of some description which I can leave behind when I take off. I would also bring a compact rover for an excursion. Bringing flags and so on and planting them on nearby areas to christen regions. Then I\u0027d stay inside and take pictures. After this (which for me might take an hour or two IRL) I would go on a \u0022Deep Excursion\u0022 A really long excursion say, 50 km north, south, east or west or somewhere in between. Perhaps I\u0027d visit a probe which had landed before (they are normally what I aim for as I can see what terrain is near) after this, I\u0027d either wait for another mission to secure some kind of base or I\u0027d return to a mothership of some kind and fly home\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T21:09:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERover are not completely useless. Just one can make them useless. For myself. I\u0027m planning on designing probes for one way trips to hopefully mark out the biodomes. Which then I will build and land Kerbal controlled Rovers to go to each area and collect the data as well as dirt samples. Other then that. I will only use rovers since I have a very difficult time landing in the same spot on a planet or moon. As that has been the only way I can rescue my stranded Kerbals that cannot get back into orbit.
