At first I thought, maybe it\u0027s halfway between my AP and my PE, but there\u0027s too many obvious problems with that. So the question becomes, if I KNOW my inclination, HOW DO I FIND THE ORIGIN of my ascent and descent. It\u0027s simple, I don\u0027t. So I guess what I want is the ascending/descending node based on the planet I\u0027m orbiting versus Kerbol. I want to be on the same plane as the planet.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(snip)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, lemme say I totally agree with you; your inclination and nodes definitely need a display option; maybe not all the time but easily accessible without targeting another body. It can be frustrating, especially if you\u0027re just trying to line up an SSTO approach to KSC runway and need your inclination to be 0 to assist the line up...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, MechJeb and other plugins will display your numerical inclination, but not your nodes. Even without the numerical inclination, you can find your AN/DN by finding the point where your orbit crosses the equator of the body you\u0027re orbiting, provided it\u0027s orbit is on a 0 degree inclination around the sun. This is probably also true for bodies with a non-0 inclination around the sun, but I\u0027ve never tried so I won\u0027t claim it is. To figure out if it\u0027s descending or ascending, well... are you going towards the north pole (ascending) or towards the south pole (descending)? From there you can find the point you need to burn to adjust your inclination. What I usually do (around Kerbin) is use the orbit line of Kerbin in the map view to draw the equator, so to speak, then line up my orbit so that one side eclipses the other, and the point the two lines you\u0027re left with cross is one of your nodes. If you need a time on it, just stick a blank maneuver node there so you can see when it is.

Then we take the scale you gave (0,1), and match the number to the scale, producing a number representing where exactly the variableName falls within the scale -- transforming it from whatever it really is to a 0.0-1.0 number where 0.0 is the bottom end of the scale and 1.0 is the top end of the scale.
