So you\u0027re stuck carrying deadweight engines. HOWEVER, if the sizes of tanks 2, 3, and 4 can be increased so that they run out of fuel AFTER tank 1, then this might be a workable solution. Unfortunately, tank 1 kinda needs to be at least 2.5 meters, and there isn\u0027t a smaller 2.5 meter tank.\u003Cp\u003E(Idea: perhaps if replaced tank 1 with four (a center, and three satellite) of the FL-T100 (the smallest 1.25 meter tank)- then I\u0027d half the capacity of the new, effective tank 1.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the final stages of an Eve ascent rocket, so I\u0027m REALLY trying to squeeze out every ounce of delta-V possible, especially on the *relatively* simple final stages.
