The authors found using fingerprint Isotopes that particles in the meteorite, basically dust grains, prolly did not form in space, but formed in a classical Nova (reaction of a binary star companion with a dwarf) shooting essentially grains of dust into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPreviously people have been thinking that gas ejected from nova slowed down and interacted in places like our oort cloud forming dust, this study shows that the particles actually are ejected into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
