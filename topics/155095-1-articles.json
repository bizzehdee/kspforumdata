Now I\u0027m not sure on the exact specs of that laptop but they weren\u0027t anything to write home about. In the summer of last year I purchased a new computer with considerably better components: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU \u003Cspan\u003E@ 2.60GHz 2.60GHz, 8.00 GB Ram, 64bit, GeForce GTX 960M. You should by now know, through the way I typed that, I\u0027m no technical wiz kid but I do know it should be more than enough to run the game at\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eat least\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Elow settings. However whenever I boot it up (no mods btw) it stutters to the point where it\u0027s unplayable. Incredibly frustrating. I\u0027ve watched and read many articles explaining how to fix it. Even downloaded a performance fix. But nothing. I\u0027ve racked up a considerable amount of time on the game and love it to bits but this \u00A0is making me want to build my own rocket and fly into the sun tbh.

Do you have similar problems with other games, or is it just KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPotentially, you might try reinstalling KSP; the other possibility is that you\u0027re trying to control a 1000-part monster vessel, which will lag any computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other possibility that springs to mind is that your computer isn\u0027t being cooled very well; at the least prop the back up to get airflow, and there are dedicated cooling pads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"humphreytt","CreatedById":173853,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-16T20:42:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried all of those plus fiddling around with my graphics card setting.
