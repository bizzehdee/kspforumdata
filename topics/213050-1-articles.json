At that point, the time is still listed in terms of T minus, but the timer starts counting up. In my screenshot, I reached apoapsis 38 seconds ago, and the \u0022AP in\u0022 readout says T-00:00:38. Note my retrograde marker and vertical speed indicator; I\u0027m now on a collision course with Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022m7JnWjM.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022102.51\u0022 height=\u0022613\u0022 width=\u0022598\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/m7JnWjM.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI suppose I would have expected it to either read \u0022AP 78,270 m in T\u002B00:00:38\u0022 or \u0022AP 78,270 m in N/A\u0022; whatever would most clearly convey that I\u0027ve passed apoapsis and won\u0027t be reaching it again since I\u0027m suborbital.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncidentally, I actually believe it\u0027d be clearer if the \u0022T-\u0022 was dropped altogether. As in, if I were reaching that same apoapsis in, say, 60 seconds, I think it should read \u0022AP 78,270 m in 00:00:60\u0022. I think adding \u0022T-\u0022 gives it some flavor but it also doesn\u0027t make much sense, and it doesn\u0027t add any information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T07:48:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 07:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by whatsEJstandfor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
