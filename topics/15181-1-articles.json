Oddly enough, it was of a KSA flight to Minmus, apparently 15 years before the first recorded kerbal space flight, as well as before the invention of the black box it was found on. Here is the log, do with it what you want. I have added notes on any inconsistencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[-00h 00m 50s] Thorite 5 has arrived on launch pad. (the Thorite 4 is the only Thorite rocket ever created, and it exploded on the launch pad! the entire thorite series was discontinued! also, the number is the number of stages, not the version or then number of first stage engines.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[-00h 00m 56s] Pre-flight checks completed, XKal45 spaceplane ready on runway.

Ejecting uppenmost parachute. (...uppenmost? an ejected parachute? what?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[01h 01m 01s] Ejection of first stage confirmed. Igniting third stage. (no second stage? and if the Thorite 5 is anything like the 4, it should eject solid rocket boosters before the first stage...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[00h 30m 00s] Ejection of boosters confirmed. Total death toll of launch 300.
