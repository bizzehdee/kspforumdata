Ideally, you want a course that alows both extreme speeds and extreme G\u0027s: decent length straights followed by clusters of tight turns. Something that requires throttling down occasionally, but where the consequence of a slight error is mostly a slower time rather than an explosive death (not that there\u0027s anything wrong with an occasional bit of explosive death, but all things in moderation etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelying on the honour system isn\u0027t too much of a problem; screenshots as you pass the gates covers that. And an overly-competitive low-honesty player is just going to abuse F5/F9 to get past difficult collision-enabled gates, anyway.
