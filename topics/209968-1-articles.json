I agree that slow growth is bad for incentivizing discovery, but once you discover everything, can your population still grow? The ways I can see to fix this is to either have thousands of locations that can cause boom events, such as little surface features that become important in the end-game, or making boom events have criteria that no longer depend on new discovery; something like expanding a colony to fit 1000 kerbals while keeping your empire above a certain happiness level, kind of like Civ does it where you can technically continue getting golden ages forever.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-19T15:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the clearest quote, albeit very old now: (2020 PC Gamer)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C[Colonies are] capable of producing colonists through a method that we will not describe, for everyone\u2019s sake, after something that the player initiates called a \u2018boom event\u2019,\u201D says lead designer Shana Markham. Throughout Kerbal\u2019s new career mode, which the developers have nicknamed \u2018adventure mode\u2019, making discoveries and unlocking new technologies will trigger these boom events, which kick off various effects across your civilisation. In a colony\u2019s nursery module, for example, that means making new colonists. \u201CYou know, discoveries make kerbals happy,\u201D Markham says.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forgot nursery modules were confirmed(ish), so thats fun.
