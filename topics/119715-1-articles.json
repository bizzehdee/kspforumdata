The problem is either insufficient logic or erroneous logic.

A surprising property or behaviour; in particular, one that is purposely inconsistent because it works better that way - such an inconsistency is therefore a feature and not a bug. This kind of feature is sometimes called a miswart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. A property or behaviour that is gratuitous or unnecessary, though perhaps also impressive or cute. For example, one feature of Common LISP\u0027s \u0022format\u0022 function is the ability to print numbers in two different Roman-numeral formats (see bells, whistles, and gongs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. A property or behaviour that was put in to help someone else but that happens to be in your way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. A bug that has been documented. To call something a feature sometimes means the author of the program did not consider the particular case, and that the program responded in a way that was unexpected but not strictly incorrect. A standard joke is that a bug can be turned into a feature simply by documenting it (then theoretically no one can complain about it because it\u0027s in the manual), or even by simply declaring it to be good. \u0022That\u0027s not a bug, that\u0027s a feature!\u0022 is a common catch-phrase.
