The rover can be either manned, or unmanned (the former will be revised eventually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, RoverScience will not function unless the Rover Terminal is opened. This is done through the right-click menu of the Rover Brain part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do science with a rover, you must have a vessel with at least one wheel in contact with the ground. Wherever you land first with your wheels will establish a landing spot. Science is analyzed from science spots. To find a science spot you simply have to drive around; however, the farther you are from the landing spot the higher the chance of finding a science spot. Once a science spot has been found, the terminal will show the distance and bearing to the spot; heading and rel. heading will be shown as well. Simply drive to the spot (within 3m) and information will be shown about the spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease avoid using more than one RoverBrain on the same vessel!

Essentially what\u0027s happening is you can\u0027t analyze because there\u0027s a time you have to wait between analysis times. Since the variable holding the \u0022time since last release\u0022 was initiated as 0, if you\u0027ve never analyzed before (as in, first launching a vehicle), then a check of \u0022current MET\u0022 - \u0022previous time\u0022 != 30 days. If that makes sense. It\u0027s been fixed anyway, but the problem is the time delay check won\u0027t change at all if the MET hasn\u0027t started yet (no launch detected yet). For now you can fix this by simply timewarping full runs down to 0. Note the message on the terminal \u0022Must wait until next analysis can be made\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second bit doesn\u0027t make much sense. The total distance calculated doesn\u0027t really play into anything with the science though - it\u0027s just a neat thing I like to show the player. I\u0027m not sure though why it\u0027s not working for you. Maybe just wait until the next release. Please upload your .craft file though so I can test it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso by science gap if you mean the analyze delay then no, it\u0027s locked per vessel. So yeah, technically you can send a crapload of rovers to the same spot and analyze the crap out of the land but you\u0027ll be driving each one of them anyway. Later I\u0027ll be adding a body-locked delay to prevent this exploit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know how you find the mod after these issues and likewise sorry about them in the first place.

Most of my notes are therefore mostly ease of use and balance gripes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the rover is \u0022Searching for science spots...\u0022 it doesn\u0027t immediately give you a bearing. Since I am a lazy ******* who doesn\u0027t read the manual I thought I had to wait for the rover to give me a heading. Took a while before I figured that I had to randomly drive around to find a science spot. Rewording that sentence to \u0022Searching for science spots, drive around until the eggheads spot one.\u0022 or something along those lines might help to avoid confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bearings themselves give you more information than you strictly need. All you really need to get to your site is the relative bearing, all the others might as well be hidden to avoid confusion. It might also be a good idea to put in a small hysteresis in the heading system. As is the system gets rather schizo with left and right when you are heading the correct way, so printing \u0022Straight ahead!\u0022 when you\u0027re within 10 degrees of your heading will remedy that. Alternatively a rework into a visual representation would be much more intuitive. Say, an arrow that points to the target spot and goes from red to green as you get closer. But I realize this is much more work, so I can understand if you want to go with a text based system for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Total dist. travelled while searching\u0022 has a typo (it\u0027s traveled) and seems to reset after every science spot found. Don\u0027t know if this is intentional behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that I noticed is that there is no incentive to build bigger rovers with more instruments. This system works just as well on a tiny bare bones rover as a hulking Curiosity clone. Since the latter is a much bigger achievement it could be an idea to scale the science to the number of science instruments present on the rover. This is a pretty minor gripe though, tiny rovers are a thing IRL as well after all (Pathfinder, Chang\u0027e 3 etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy last point is the most important bit though. The science from this needs to be scaled down. Usually an instrument on the mun gives you about 100 science. This part alone can give you nearly 5 times that if you scope out the high science areas. It is just too good for a single small part. I\u0027d cut the science from this in half. It should give a bit more than normal science parts due to its interactive nature, but not by this much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that. This is the one mod I was still looking for. In my career playthroughs I was always skipping the wheels until I started base building, it\u0027s nice that they finally have some use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-09T00:18:04Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2014 12:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ralathon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
