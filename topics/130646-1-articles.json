Only had those quality-of-life ones at the beginning (KER, RCS aid etc) but now I got KIS/KAS and recently installed USI life support.

Everyone knows they are simply bad choices, too heavy for what they do. I just never considered them an option from the start, instead using cockpits or other stuff in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then decided to experiment a personal rebalancing of those, and just edited their weight to be proportional to their 1.25 counterparts. The mk1-2 pod now weighs 2.4 tons (0.8 per kerbal) and the lander can 1.2 (0.6 per kerbal). I have to say they feel a LOT more balanced now, like, in the sweet spot. They simply became a reasonable choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you guys done something like this for the purpose of balance?
