A Mk1 hitchhiker is absolutely necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy should there be a career progression which forces you into a certain order? There shouldn\u0027t. The explore phase 1, 2, 3 simply restructures the mission meaning that if you can\u0027t achieve a return trip for example, you still get a mission reward for phase 2, however if you wish to follow the phase 1, 2, 3 format it provides a realistic series of missions charting a certain body. Exploration is currently over for each body way too quickly and the only reason to return for the arbitrary procedural missions. Hence a player may finish the Mun missions with nowhere enough funds or experience to go to Duna, yet the mission progression implies they should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, testing parts at the moment is mundane and unoriginal.

Perhaps engineers can construct things in space, lock parts together for orbital construction, etc? I see most tech as pretty self-contained, the time for real engineering is well before liftoff, or if there is a problem. Someone in the forum suggested allowing engineers to disassemble spacecraft, which is cool. Say your lander has a small amount of fuel on the Mun, an engineer might strip off parts to lighten it, allowing takeoff. Any ideas are worth looking at, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAttributes \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 remove Courage and Stupidity as they are altogether and replace them with intelligence (affects engineering \u002B science), courage (improves craft reactions \u002B stability), agility (improves EVA manoeuvrability and survivability).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already view stupidity as the opposite of what I want, doesn\u0027t mother me.

Allow the builder to pick if the fairing will match the diameter of the engine itself, or the part it is attached to. That or have 1.25m decouplers all only make a 1.25m fairing, and 2.5m ones ALWAYS make a 2.5m fairing, etc). So if you have an LV-30 or nuke on a 2.5 m tank, and you use a 2.5m fairing, it will use a 2.5m fairing (I do this with PF already).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA Mk 1 Hitchhiker module is essential to allow players to gain experience with their scientists or engineers in the early stage of the game, while a pilot flies.
