They generally follow a set of rules which are often acknowledged to not necessarily be true. They usually paint them with reptilian scales even though we now know that\u0027s probably not what they looked like. We now know some have feathers, and for feathers you need follicles so they probably had some sort of skin. We have no idea whether it\u0027s like a rhino\u0027s skin, or a chicken\u0027s foot, so they\u0027ve stuck with the traditional way of drawing them even though they know that\u0027s almost definitely wrong. Paleobiology is quite an unscientific science. Occasionally evidence is black and white, but much of the time things start off as only being believed by part of the community and slowly over time seep into general acceptance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this applies with the spinosaurus. You\u0027re correct in questioning how weird it looks. With it\u0027s body proportions it doesn\u0027t really make sense as a skinny off-balance land animal. It makes much more sense as a highly evolved aquatic creature. You could put fleshy paddles on it\u0027s feet and tail and it\u0027d look like a nothosaurus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne reason they\u0027re confindent in drawing the nothosaurus as a highly aquatic animal is because it\u0027s an ancestor of the plesiosaurs which spend all their time in the water. It\u0027s not related at all to the spinosaurus, but it does look like a case of convergent evolution. They\u0027re not that confident of the spinosaurus\u0027 aquatic abilities yet so they stick to the status quo of arranging it\u0027s small bones as feet and hands instead of flippers, and drawing it like a badly proportioned t-rex; even though they know that\u0027s probably not how it was.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T06:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moar Boosters\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Moar Boosters\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Paleobiology is quite an unscientific science.
