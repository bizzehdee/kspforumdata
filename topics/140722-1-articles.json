I set it up\u00A0Apollo-style. Everything went relatively smoothly until I got into Dunatian orbit and started to worry about my fuel. I was pretty sure I wasn\u0027t going to be able to get back, but I\u00A0continued with the mission anyway. After being amazed at the power of the new 10m heat shield, I performed a suicide burn a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0too late and hit the ground at 8 m/s. Not a perfect landing, but it worked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is all actually my second try. On my first attempt, I forgot to add a decoupler between the transfer stage and the heat shield, rendering the entire mission useless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the flag-planting/waiting-for-launch-window routine, I took off from Duna and rendezvoused rather inefficiently with the mother ship. Transferring some remaining fuel from the lander into the service module got me some extra delta-V, but I was still worried about not having enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong story short, I ended up with about 300 m/s left after the trans-Kerbin injection, and realized just how much I overpower my rockets! I forgot to add a heat shield to\u00A0the command module, so Jeb, Bob and Bill very nearly became fried during reentry. In the end though, they were recovered safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really need to start taking screenshots! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
