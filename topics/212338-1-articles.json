I know some people enjoy using the lego block paradigm to construct things, but there isn\u0027t enough variety in the different sizes to focus in on a desired \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for a given stage. When placing such a tank, you\u0027d have a minimum size under which the part cannot shrink. But then, any time a part is attached to the stage the tank is in, or a later stage, the part would recalculate its size to reach a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for that stage that can be set in the UI. When other parts are attached, it\u0027ll update each procedural tank from the stage the part is attached to through to the first stage. If multiple procedural tanks exist in a stage, either it should evenly distribute procedural tank size to each, or maybe an advanced UI element to distribute say 25% to one, and 75% to another.
