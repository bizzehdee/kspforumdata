The term gimballed engine comes from the fact that the pivot mechanism is known as a gimbal, while thrust vectoring from the fact that changing the direction of thrust is to change what is known as its vector, hence, vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-16T07:10:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difference between gimballed and NON-gimballed engines on the other hand is that you can steer with gimballed engines, not so with NON-gimballed engines. Simple as that. It allows you to steer by subtly changing the direction of thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the game, with stock parts, the gimballed engine also has 1/8th less total thrust, with an appropriately lower fuel consumption though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"madmat","CreatedById":16054,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-16T07:29:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh thanks guys, I figured they worked the same but wasn\\\u0027t sure if i was missing something due to the different naming.
