You mean .26 the pre-christmas sales hypetrain? I\u0027m sure that something big is coming in .26 but it won\u0027t have much to do with destructible buildings.

I think they will try and update as many pixels as possible to generate a fresh batch of LetsPLays but seriously doubt any new in-game mechanics we be here before the new year.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
