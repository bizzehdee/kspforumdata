I managed to get the core parts into the game, but I can\u0027t figure out how to get the parts to share the textures. For some reason, if I have a folder with two models, one set of textures, and two part configs the game will choose one of the models for both parts, even though the model path is correctly set, while the rest properties are correct. So my core parts are using duplicate textures at the moment.\n\n![SLScoreTankAndBoosters.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/SLScoreTankAndBoosters.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T17:53:16Z","Content":"I\u0027m working on a mod called Constellation Essentials Continued, and I love your SLS booster.
