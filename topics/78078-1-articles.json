If you accepted all contracts you could, and then timewarped for a year without doing anything, you might be going bankrupt. Or if you decided that you didn\u0027t want those contracts anyway and cancelled them, you get the same result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note that rejecting a contract BEFORE accepting it does not cost you anything.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the game still has contracts to offer you, you generally get an advance payment for accepting a contract. You could use that to complete an easy contract, such as the jet engine ground test - it\u0027s literally a case of adding the part, going onto the launchpad, and pressing spacebar. You don\u0027t even need to bring fuel. Once you completed that contract, you\u0027ll get more money, which can help you complete another contract, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T09:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pauldbk99\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pauldbk99\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBeautifull grammar sir.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrammer are rated over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qazsedcft","CreatedById":114699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T14:44:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pauldbk99\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pauldbk99\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBeautifull grammar sir.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh the irony!
