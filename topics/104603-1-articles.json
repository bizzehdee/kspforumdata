In the full version we drag the maneuver nodes around until we get an intercept we like. I\u0027m not sure whether you can do that in demo. If not, the standard procedure is to get to LKO going east, then wait until the Mun just rises above the horizon (relative to your ship) and start your burn.

If (2), then you can try burning prograde to speed up, retrogade to slow down, or radially inward and outward to try and get closer. Thrust in short bursts to see what happens.
