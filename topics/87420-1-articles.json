I wanted to apologize for the problems you experienced sharing your error log. You are correct that Cryptbin supports larger pastes, substantially larger in fact. Unfortunately I was in the midst of rolling out some new features and overlooked a small glitch that was cutting longer pastes short. That problem has now been resolved and I hope that you will continue to enjoy Cryptbin and the features, as well as security, that it provides. If you ever experience problems in the future, please shoot us an email or send me a PM here and I will address them immediately. If you happen to have an account with us, PM me your username and I will enable the \u0022pro\u0022 features on your account. if you don\u0027t, feel free to create one and my offer still stands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks so much!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nonot8946","CreatedById":127401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T20:25:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022classyjakey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022classyjakey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKSP: 0.25 Windows 8.1 64bit\u003Cp\u003EProblem: Crashing on loading save\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods installed: KWRocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill happens on stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReproduction steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoad a save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELog:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cryptb.in/1GT6TsU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cryptb.in/1GT6TsU\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame problem, win64bit install.
