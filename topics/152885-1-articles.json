Obviously I have now found a lot of bad reviews about crashes and lost/corrupted saves. I\u0027d love to play the game again and don\u0027t have a pc but I also don\u0027t want to waste my time on a game just to have hours/days of progress corrupted or lost. I can deal with the odd crash with no loss of data and other little things, but what I don\u0027t want is to loose everything that to me is like paying a games company to flush days of your life down the toilet for you. Im having a hard time finding out if this issue has in fact been resolved yet or not any advice? I have read the post about a September update that fixed the issue but people then seemed to loose data changing the save file to patched version of game I may have misunderstood, if I buy now and start a fresh save with patch etc will my data be safe from corruption? Cheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erikinthebakery","CreatedById":166663,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T16:40:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the patch, it seems to be hit-and-miss. Some of my friends have been able to play fine with no save issues. Before the patch, the save issues were a lot of progress roll-backs when the save file got too large. When the patch happened, it caused some people to lose their save file completely. Post patch, some people are finding their save file corrupting/vanishing. If you are concerned about the idea of losing all of your progress, I\u0027d hold off for now. It could be fine and you\u0027d have no issues, but it might also not be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DutyStalker","CreatedById":172130,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T16:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your quick reply, I think I\u0027ll hold off for now then, I\u0027ve had issues like this before with games of XB store it drives me mad, it\u0027s bad enough when you spend hard earned money on a game that\u0027s faulty, but when you\u0027ve invested hours/days of your life into it as well, which you can never buy back or be refunded, It really hacks me off! shame as what I can remember the pc version was excellent game, will keep my eye on any patch releases for now and hopefully join the KSP one day \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T17:26:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222872107\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152885\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221480697494\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022172130\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DutyStalker\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n34 minutes ago, DutyStalker said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I\u0027ll hold off for now then\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmart move, you\u0027d be inviting frustration otherwise. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mibo22","CreatedById":170140,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-05T12:34:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking as someone who purchased the game for PS4, played for 20 plus hours, then lost all of my progress, then waited 6 months for any word and STILL haven\u0027t heard anything to spite posting several questions in various posts on the forum, I wouldn\u0027t hold your breath. \u00A0Its a huge bummer because aside from the gamebreaking save corruption issue this game is amazing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrCalvinator","CreatedById":171319,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-12T17:17:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the PS4 version, too, and a weird thing happened when it crashed and corrupted. \u00A0I managed to get into my save before the PS4 made it disappear, and all that was wrong was the craft files, and they were just missing. \u00A0All of my landed craft, such as my Mun base, were all working perfectly. \u00A0Everything was normal except for the craft files, and the constant \u0022save data is corrupted\u0022 screen every five seconds. \u00A0The corruptions must have to do with those craft files, and how they\u0027re stored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if adding more storage to the PS4 would fix it, or replacing it with SSDs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
