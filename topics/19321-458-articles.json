I\u0026#39;m guessing this is a result of the new aero system, but since installing 1.0.5 \u002B FAR, I\u0026#39;ve not been able to build a smooth-sided rocket that has been able to fly a proper gravity turn, instead, they always begin to tumble at some point. I\u0026#39;ve identified this as resulting from a center of lift / drag which is placed near the top of the rocket where the payload and fairings are, while the center of mass is far below with the fuel and engines. So far, I\u0026#39;ve been able to counteract this tendency easily by adding control fins near the bottom of the craft, shifting the center of lift / drag down below the center of mass, but at some point I would like to move on to launching without fins. The problem is, however, that absolutely nothing that I\u0026#39;ve tried up until now moves the center of lift down from the top of the rocket except adding fins down below.

The only way to revert the voxels to the former condition from the latter is to leave the VAB and return. Even this only works about 50% of the time by my estimate, as the other 50% of the time, attempting to show the voxels or the cross-sectional area curve lead to an NRE related to those activities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have checked whether this can be replicated on a bare bones install (Stock \u002B FAR \u002B PF only)\u00A0and it indeed can. FAR \u002B Stock fairings are updated properly as you add or change each piece, but FAR \u002B Procedural Fairing displays this behavior. Searching hasn\u0027t indicated that this is a known issue, but that doesn\u0027t mean I haven\u0027t just missed something along the way, but is there a way around this behavior and / or is this affecting aerodynamic characteristics at all?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
