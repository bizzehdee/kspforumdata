That pre-existing problem generally consists in having far too many weak joints between the controlling pod and the CoM of the vessel, and having reaction wheels just next to that controlling pod, and using an active SAS function and excessive gimbal, and trying to go sideways against the airflow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCertainly, if you have a large space station held together with docking ports, reaction wheels at the edges can cause significant flexing of the different parts. However, that is a problem that can be easily fixed by just letting go of the controls for a short while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe major problem generally occurs on atmospheric ascent. It looks like the reaction wheel is \u0022bending\u0022 the ship but in fact the forces exerted by reaction wheels are far too weak to do that. Take a few reaction wheels, stick them on top of a heavily-clamped stack of three or four fuel tanks and you\u0027ll find that they hardly budge even if you try to develop a rocking motion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what must actually be happening is that in the atmosphere, and particularly with active SAS, the reaction wheel induces a minimal amount of flex which then multiplies the far larger forces exerted by the engines (giving slightly different vectors to the momentum of each part) and by drag. That is (IMO) the real culprit. And that flex leads the controlling pod to overcorrect, which leads to oscillation that can rip a ship apart. However, it\u0027s the engines and aero forces which provide the necessary force to do that - reaction wheels on their own simply can\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat reaction wheels \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E do, however, is add joints, which can weaken craft as a whole. Putting a reaction wheeel in the middle of a tall stack (especially in the 2.5m scale) can actually make bending worse by doubling the amount of flexing in the middle of the stack. And that\u0027s why (IMO) moving the reaction wheel to the centre - thereby creating a double joint in the middle of a stack -\u00A0 is (IMO) a fatal solution to a wobble problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T00:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222508863\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136726\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460419254\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plusck\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 minutes ago, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe major problem generally occurs on atmospheric ascent.

I tend to avoid noodling by toggling engine gimbal on and off (except with the Vector, which needs to have gimbal reduced to about 10% to start with anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, I\u0027m not saying that an SAS wheel in the centre causes noodling, but rather that it makes it worse because noodling is due to excessive forces on joints. It\u0027s the flexing joints which make engines and lift/drag apply opposing forces to different parts of the ship, which are emphasised rather than damped by the SAS/autopilot function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe actual force applied by torque wheels adds slightly to that problem - but it\u0027s further compounded by the wheels being in the command pod too. The command pod goes very slightly off its original heading and tries to correct. The reaction wheels by the pod start to correct this quickly, but the engine/control surfaces at the base of the rocket have already sent a ripple of movement up the stack, so when that reaches the pod it swings the other way (and in the worst case, this swing is emphasised by the straining reaction wheels which haven\u0027t yet managed to correct the heading from the command pod\u0027s PoV) and starts trying to correct the other way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that happens is that once a joint starts to flex significantly, it seems to require much less effort to flex back the way. Perhaps reaction wheels alone are enough to send a pre-flexed joint back to opposite flex? I\u0027m sure this could be tested with large stacks of short fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(edit - one final thing when you said \u0022in the payload\u0022: fairing joints are terrible, so anything with a lever arm to flex that joint is going to cause problems. You didn\u0027t mention using a fairing but it\u0027s also a compounding factor. So basically, I suppose I\u0027m trying to say that reaction wheels should always be placed right next to the weakest joint, preferably on the side facing the CoM, so that they don\u0027t add weakness unnecessarily and don\u0027t have leverage to add to flex which is going to happen anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-12T00:46:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2016 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T01:32:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou guys have never choked up on a baseball bat?

The distance between the command module and the actual engine is also a big factor, as it tends to create a constructive wave across the length of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T00:39:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA note to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156657-hebarusan/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022156657\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156657-hebarusan/\u0022\u003E@HebaruSan\u003C/a\u003E, who\u0027s having some skepticism about the \u0022placement doesn\u0027t matter\u0022 (in terms of torque effectiveness);\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs several other posters have said here:\u00A0 it really doesn\u0027t matter.\u00A0 Really.\u00A0 Put your reaction wheels anywhere, they will have \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eexactly the same effect\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in terms of rotating the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s what the laws of physics say.\u00A0 It\u0027s also what the game actually does (I\u0027ve experimentally verified it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnderstanding just \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhy\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that is the case can be tricky, so I really don\u0027t blame you.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 For a detailed explanation of exactly why that is, take a look here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/127667-where-to-put-reaction-wheels/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;embedComment=2320917\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, reaction wheel placement \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E have an effect in terms of making your ship wobble, so you should use appropriate strategy there if you have a big, bendy craft.\u00A0 But other than wobble problems, no, it really doesn\u0027t matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T02:27:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222510754\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136726\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460507961\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA note to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156657-hebarusan/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022156657\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156657-hebarusan/\u0022\u003E@HebaruSan\u003C/a\u003E, who\u0027s having some skepticism about the \u0022placement doesn\u0027t matter\u0022 (in terms of torque effectiveness);\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, at this point I accept that I\u0027m probably* wrong, since this community is rarely unanimous if there\u0027s any real room for doubt.
