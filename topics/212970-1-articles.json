If i time warp in low altitude around the Mun or Min the craft goes into a completely uncontrollable spin when I exit warp. To the extent that the ship flies apart and the orbit is drastically changed. This happens with multiple ships. The one savings grace was that if i only did short warps it would give it less spin and i was able to reorient and then do another short warp. But if i Warp through say a quarter of an orbit to begin a decent burn the ships would be lost.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTogether we shall slay the kraken!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T04:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170629-saphera12/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022170629\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170629-saphera12/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@saphera12\u003C/a\u003E, your problem has been moved from KSP 2 Suggestions and development to KSP 2 Bug Reports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razor235","CreatedById":16436,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T06:09:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got a theory this is related to the orbital decay reported in low orbits, especially at Mun and Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silvia Dragoness","CreatedById":218990,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T06:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happened when I was trying to rendezvous my lander with my orbiter after my Mun landing.\u00A0 I was controlling the lander, timewarping in steps during the rendezvous process, and when I finally got close to the orbiter, it was spinning like mad with parts stretching away from each other.\u00A0 I switched to controlling the orbiter and used a super brief timewarp to kill its rotation, and was left with this (spoiler\u0027d so it can be collapsed to save space):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079191224763813948/1079191225237786644/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game thinks all these parts are still connected to each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T06:15:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 06:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Silvia Dragoness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaphireFalcon","CreatedById":108872,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T07:52:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have encountered similar problems:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen timewarping\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen loading save created an orbit just fine.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seem the vehicle gets \u0022hit\u0022 by the Kraken.
