I made an elliptical orbit that allowed my probe to pass through the atmosphere at about 85k, then left. I dropped a stage in that orbit that was out of fuel, and then I decided to watch it descend to get a real idea of what aerobrakeing does. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my confusion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe velocity of my debris is always the same at peri. The ap is falling, and velocity at AP is dropping each time. So the distance and time from AP to PE drops with each arrival at PE, so why doesn\u0027t velocity drop as well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlah, I should have waited to post this.
