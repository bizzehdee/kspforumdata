The new SAS takes away from realism more than contributing to it in the case of probes... which is why I adamantly insist these changes don\u0027t affect the flight computer. I just like this mod too much as is to see it adopt some terrible design decision that Squad will probably end up changing more in the future themselves (or that someone will make another mod for). Heck, I wonder if I could write something with MM that upgrades probe cores as you unlock better tech...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, you\u0027ve unlocked the OKTO2 and want to launch a satellite using the Stayputnik design (ya know, for visuals more than anything, where\u0027s the fun in my satellite design being restricted?)... it doesn\u0027t make any sense in my mind that your engineers and programmers can\u0027t figure out a way to get the new software into the old probe design... it seems like a very rushed decision by Squad (they probably were more focused on the actual Pilot skill) to fit the probes with the new SAS rules. It makes sense that you start with the lowest tech, but it\u0027s silly that your probe designs are literally unable to be adapted to new technology... uh... aren\u0027t they just cases with a bunch of circuitry? Couldn\u0027t one simply... replace the circuitry? Why when I have a full tech tree would my engineers build a Stayputnik \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E SAS?

I think it makes sense that older technology is just that, older technology. I must agree, I think that completely restricting the flight computer to the same standard as the SAS isn\u0027t a good idea, but I do think that having some sort of progression in the level of direct control that is possible is something that would enhance the experience while still maintaining a high level of abstraction to maintain playability. One possibility that comes to mind is something linking to KSC building upgrades rather then probe core SAS. Fewer levels involved, and it doesn\u0027t have to be just things like holding on nodes. MAybe that\u0027s the first level, then you get delayed commands, then you get queued commands. Or something. Just a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that popped into my head on this discussion is that I like the idea that different probe cores have different levels of SAS because it\u0027s what would represent local control vs. direct control from KSC through RT. The point is if you \u0022send an SAS hold node command\u0022 through RT to a probe and signal is subsequently lost, the probe is continue to hold that heading; whereas if you are holding a heading with the flight computer and loose signal the vessel will become adrift. I can think of some cases immediately where this would be relevant and that is aerobraking to enter orbit and for landing purposes. I\u0027m not sure how this works works currently in RT, but it would make upgrade to probe hardware and software more useful. Especially if you are running a failure mod like DangIt! and there is the potential for antennas to break and batteries to short circuit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gribbleshnibit8","CreatedById":113278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T03:06:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to modify the settings file using MM?

At least for a four sat net. I figured, meh, long as there\u0027s always one sat over mission control who cares if they keep trading places? I can see two places it can cause issues now, if they do drift relative to eachother it\u0027s a much bigger problem to deal with because now not only is there a large gap, but it passes over mission control over time. Also, if a sat goes down for any reason, then it\u0027s region becomes a dead zone, which also will pass over mission control eventually. Now I\u0027m not bringing this point up in vain. I\u0027m not usually one for success, being a man planning to build a tiny house on a trailer but what if some one were to simply spam LKO with sat relays for example? Perhaps a sim of future space traffic? Anyway, my point is, should there still be a penalty for not achieve the afore \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ementioned\u003C/span\u003E pedestalled keosync orbit? I mean, if it were feasible for some reason that you could have so many sats in orbit that it wouldn\u0027t matter what altitude they were at, and you were willing to launch \u0027em all cause you\u0027re an enterprising young kerbal, should there be a reason this network does not function as well as a keosync network?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts are yes. I feel like constantly having to re-route signals from one sat to the next should cause a significant increase in signal delay. It should be possible to mitigated through some sort of upgrade later on in the tech tree, and immediately in sandbox of course. Some sort of \u0022komputer assisted automatic routing unit\u0022 or some jazz like that.
