The last part I\u0027m putting together for the new version is a 3.75m quad-engine. Its stats are very close to the NASA-SLS style one from the ARM pack. This one is in the category of \u0022alternate appearance for a previous stock option\u0022. The existing quad-engine has always bothered me, in that its engine bells look tiny compared to the thrust it generates (each nozzle is equivalent to a skipper), and also the bi-radial symmetry doesn\u0027t do it for me. So I wanted something functionally similar, but with a much beefier set of engine bells. Plus, from a realism standpint, atmospheric rockets benefit from longer bells, whereas vacuum rockets benefit from wider ones, so having some length makes sense for lower-stage lifter rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo differentiate it a little, I gave it a tiny bit more thrust, but with the caveat of costing slightly more, and also having a slightly lower vacuum ISP. Basically what that means, is that it gives you just a hair more thrust \u0022out of the gate\u0022 for your heavy lifters (3330 vs 3200), but the efficiency improvement with altitude is a little slower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.necrobones.net/screenshots/KSP/KSP%202014-10-29%2023-28-20-82.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202014-10-29%2023-28-20-82.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.necrobones.net/screenshots/KSP/KSP%202014-10-29%2023-28-46-33.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202014-10-29%2023-28-46-33.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.necrobones.net/screenshots/KSP/KSP%202014-10-29%2023-30-22-59.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202014-10-29%2023-30-22-59.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.necrobones.net/screenshots/KSP/KSP%202014-10-29%2023-31-29-64.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202014-10-29%2023-31-29-64.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.necrobones.net/screenshots/KSP/KSP%202014-10-29%2023-29-02-54.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202014-10-29%2023-29-02-54.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T18:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, the new release is out.
