However, I\u0027m having a rough time with water landings: crew tanks appear to be water soluble, which kills everyone on board. I\u0027d rather not have to always make sure I end up on land, as I don\u0027t want to have to pay that much attention to routine crew missions. Has anyone figured out a reliable way to safely land crew tanks in the water? I\u0027ve tried a number of configurations, including landing the thing horizontally to reduce the amount they\u0027re submerged, but they always just disappear, and I\u0027m already at the point where the number of parachutes I mount on these things is just absurd.

I think it\u0027s an issue with this particular part. (I may try transporting the crew in the 2 man landing cans, although that won\u0027t do any good for my mass.)
