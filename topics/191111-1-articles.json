Nothing rolls with any particular speed or responsiveness, planes that could previously sustain an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E of ~45\u00B0 now only ~5\u00B0.

When I apply pitch they simply increase in climb rate while staying flat as a pancake. Great if i want a flying wing, not so great if you build anything else. Sidenote: flying wings require serious work to get right, I doubt they\u0027ve been unaffected either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven my U-2 look alike plane which is one of my successful designs (40 m.s^-1 lift off, 24 000m cruise altitude, 20\u00B0 max \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u00A01200m.s^-1 cruise speed [for a glider with an engine!]) fly\u0027s like a winged brick carrying \u00A0a particularly obese blue whale.

For rockets this is less of an issue but the same sluggishness is found in most of my designs. And max \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E seems to have been at least halved in most designs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIs anyone else getting this or similar?\u00A0Is this something that has been\u00A0mentioned in patch notes?

Although this could be a false positive as I played around with control surfaces and angle of incidence on those aircraft. Also it seems the atmosphere is much thicker than before.
