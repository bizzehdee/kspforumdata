So I can just land a fuel ship and fuel up all my vehicles instead of having to go through the hassle of maintaining a space station and having to run my ships back and forth from the surface whenever its needed, or whatever other reason there may be. Or maybe something that adds a way to create fuel/mine fuel on the surface of a planet and then use the same concept to fuel nearby ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T11:39:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachment System lets you dock two vessels with a cable, so you can then transfer fuel between two parts on the docked vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T11:56:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a refuelling mod on Spaceport (thread was destroyed in the forum crash).
