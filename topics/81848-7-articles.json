I started spaceplaning in stock before I switched to FAR, but that was some time ago. However:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the looks of it, the setup there is a central RAPIER flanked by turbos, yes? The plane could use a touch of polishing (ditch at least one ASAS unit, to start with) but it looks as if it should be orbit-capable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first bit of advice would be to turn off the automatic mode-switching on the RAPIER and set an action group to toggle modes instead. You don\u0027t want it to start burning oxidiser until the last possible moment. Once the air runs low, shut down the lateral engines and run on the central one alone (thereby dropping your intake air requirement by 2/3rds, as well as avoiding all chance of an asymmetric flameout). Once that one starts to choke, gradually throttle down to extend it further. A single-turbojet basic plane can get over 2,000m/s and 35,000m altitude in stock aero if flown right. Your plane above should easily manage 30,000m and 1,500m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d be better with a 1 turbo / 2 RAPIER arrangement; that way, you can leave the central turbo running in conjunction with the RAPIERs during final ascent.
