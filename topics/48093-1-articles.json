I have a few ideas here with the first being to add the radar altimeter in a drop down o the UI or like the velocity change bar next to the nav ball used with maneuver nodes. This will make landings so much easier. A horizontal speed indicator with a top down display similar to the nav ball would also be very useful. This could be just a simple square with cross hairs and a velocity mark. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor general flight, I would like to see fuel remaining as more than just a quantity reading. Seeing a display or remaining delta v or estimated burn time remaining for a stage would be fantastic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIVA needs the velocity required bar form the maneuver nodes added as well as time to node. That is the reason i rarely fly IVA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T01:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIVA already has most of this data, Radar Altimeter being one of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVertical velocity indicator is in both screens.

But, in my opinion, are a low priority compared to the rest of the features that need to be added to KSP (SCIENCE! being the next one.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can check out SteamGauges(I think) if you want a nice looking set of HUD Gauges.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
