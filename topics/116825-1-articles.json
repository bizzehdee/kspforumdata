There would have been no time to launch a probe to take nice pictures. Since there were telescopes around, we just pointed them and took as many pictures as we pleased.\n\nYes, probes are awesome and they provide some otherwise unobtainable data, but a telescope is a much more versatile instrument.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why does Hubble have amazing images of deep space objects, yet Pluto and Ceres look crappy from it\u0027s images of them?\n\nBecause Pluto is tiny, while DSOs are absolutely huge."},{"CreatedByName":"How2FoldSoup","CreatedById":82003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T20:01:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Why does Hubble have amazing images of deep space objects, yet Pluto and Ceres look crappy from it\u0027s images of them?\n\nThe simple answer is exposure times and relative sizes. Those beautiful nebulaes you see are dozens, sometimes thousands, of light years across. The simple difference in sizes between these two objects are many many orders of magnitudes. There is also much more light being emitting or reflecting off of these massive structures compared to pluto allowing your camera to absorb more photons and detail."},{"CreatedByName":"SuperFastJellyfish","CreatedById":57985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T20:15:31Z","Content":"Since we\u0027re speaking of relative sizes of bodies, I\u0027ll just leave [this here as this is my favorite flash doohickey](http://htwins.net/scale2/)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T20:26:16Z","Content":"And speaking of apparent sizes and angular diameter, Pluto is about 0,09\u0027\u0027, while Helix nebula is 22\u0027 (22\u0027 x 60 = 1320\u0027\u0027).\n\nSo, Helix nebula has about 15 000 times larger apparent diameter."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T20:32:23Z","Content":"The simple answer is that they are different tools with different qualities and weak points.
