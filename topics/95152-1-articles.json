But I\u0027m actually not really looking for directions on how to do that *just* yet. One must walk before they can run, after all. I was really just looking to figure out what I was doing wrong with my MK2 SSTOs, and from there I\u0027d start working on launching things like rovers and CubeSats from MK2 SSTOs, THEN I\u0027d work my way up to MK3. Half the fun of KSP for me, anyway, is blowing stuff up in spectacular ways and then puzzling out how I can make it work better on my own. I was just stuck on this CoL thing. But now that I know I totally misinterpreted distances, I think I\u0027m set for a while.
