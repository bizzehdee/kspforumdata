Only then do you kick on the rocket motor and pitch up again; a short burn should get you into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrdinarily when I do a single-stage rocket take off, I shoot for a launch TWR of 1.2 (the idea being that all that thrust I have at the beginning I shouldn\u0027t need once I\u0027m up there) and hope to be fiddling with the throttle to keep it somewhere between 2.0 to 2.3 shortly after the gravity turn. The principles of space launch are similar regardless of whether you use rocket or spaceplane, so I imagine that\u0027s where you need to aim. You might try a decoupler on the back of the nuke with an RT-10 attached, or perhaps an FL-T100 and an Aerospike. I make no guarantees as to what that\u0027s going to do to your plane\u0027s flight characteristics; really all I can offer, though.

Once in orbit, you can deactivate them, refuel and use the LV-N for cruising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding more LV-N would hurt you delta V a lot because of their heavy weight, which is why I think using light (albeit with less ISP) engines to help the LV-N seems a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I tend to aim for a max speed of ~1500 m/s on jets only by flying high and adapting thrust as I climb (you can go even faster with more intakes, depends on how you like to fly), so I usually need ~700 m/s to achieve orbital velocity. This can be done with fairly weak engines, especially in a thin atmosphere (can\u0027t remember precisely, but 35 km sounds like a good altitude to disengage the jets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the fuel / LFO ratio, I usually define a goal and proceed by trial and error. Some of my planes are tight on fuel after re-entry, some others can achieve LKO, re-enter THEN circumnavigate Kerbin : it mostly depends on what kind of missions the plane is designed for (cargo lifter, crew rescue, R\u0026amp;D, IP travel, etc...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterplanetary nuke-powered SSTOs are fun to design and fly, good luck with yours!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-22T09:29:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2013 09:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by el_coyoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
