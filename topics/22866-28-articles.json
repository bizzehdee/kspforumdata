Because the gun fires more accurately when a target is moving head on against it, as it doesn\u0027t need to calculate target lead. Real CIWS have multiple and programmable firing patterns and speeds. My system also not only leads a target, but if the target it moving fast it will alter it\u0027s firing pattern and firing speed as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne point to make is that if the ship only had one CIWS and you could smartly find an angle to approach where the CIWS couldn\u0027t fire (an arc obsured by it\u0027s own ship) then you might have really god results, the closer you get the less probability of getting shot down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA weapon that could zig zag or go really slow to avoid being labeled hostile would be the way to trick it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T15:00:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally slow zig-zagging low-flying missiles...sounds very dangerous, and VERY kerbal!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fox62","CreatedById":23673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T15:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr go the other route and hit it with a Rod From God when it\u0027s in port.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strongest_2hu","CreatedById":67784,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T17:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t seen this mentioned yet, how did you make the deck walkable when the ship status displays \u0022splashed down\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fox62","CreatedById":23673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T19:04:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(goddamn 10 character limit!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfiniteDice","CreatedById":57451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T22:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKAS was the old method.
