No, it wasn\u0027t. In fact I find it to be pretty new compared to what I used in pre-0.14 times.\n\nEDIT: I remeber using C7, NovaPunch ans some other things back in the days. One of them had an RC probe core that still functioned as a normal capsule and had kerbals in it. Someone even created a cannon that could be loaded only once. It was fun.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T23:25:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 11:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T00:56:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I dunno but i\u0027m fairly sure it was B9\n\nB9 is like the new guy! ok he\u0027s a suave new guy but there are lots that are way older.

And there was Sunday Punch. I think KW and C7 are a bit newer, but they were definitely around in the very early versions. Eh it\u0027s been a while. The mods were small and didn\u0027t add much, plus there was so little content in the game itself that there was almost no point.
