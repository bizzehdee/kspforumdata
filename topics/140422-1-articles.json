Suborbital hops and orbit trips? Perfectly possible. Carrying 4 tourists to orbit the Mun and then land on Minmus and return? Not gonna happen in 30 parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T13:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I don\u0027t quite know why you are having problems. I am playing on super-hard mode right now (50% funds and 50% science) and I love the tourist contracts because they are so profitable. Here is my \u0022Virgin Galactic\u0022 suborbital tourist bus -- trivial to fly and land on the runway at KSC for a 100% refund on the upper stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.virtualrealitytoursllc.com/pix/v_galactic.png\u0022 alt=\u0022v_galactic.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T13:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYah, it\u0027s a good idea to be really judicious about what contracts you accept until you can raise the 30-part limit.\u00A0 Orbit\u0027s perfectly doable, and reasonably profitable in early game.\u00A0 Fly by the Mun, also doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my own career games, I\u0027ve found that boosting the launchpad is a handy early upgrade-- it\u0027s\u00A0a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E cheaper than upgrading the VAB.\u00A0\u00A0 And it lets me use whacking great SRBs, which in turn lets me loft more rocket while keeping the part count low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use suborbital/orbital tourist contracts a lot in the very early game as a handy reputation builder to unlock more useful contracts.\u00A0 Once I get far enough along that I can get to Mun/Minmus without awkward ship-design gymnastics to deal with low tech and/or part limits, though, I tend to taper off and avoid tourist contracts-- the payoff is terrible, in terms of reward per hour of my time.\u00A0 They tend to be extremely time-consuming contracts that don\u0027t actually pay a huge amount of money, so they quickly turn into a really tedious grind for me then; I switch to other contract types.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T14:47:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use the longer distance\u00A0tourist contracts as a way to shuttle science/rescuees/personnel back and forth between a destination and KSC\u00A0and get paid doing it.
