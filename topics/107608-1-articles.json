However i never actually got anything into the SOI of any other planet (however i think that is bound to change soon).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve started back again at KSP when 1.0 rolled around and so far 2 missions stand out first, a rescue missions, after landing on the Mun valentina managed escape it and get into a kerbin orbit, began burning to lower the periapsis and go back home.... a puff of smoke comes out of the engine, no fuel left, an enormous bounty of science...... oh, and valentina stranded in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had never managed a rendezvous, or managed to dock anything before, usually for me if you ran out of fuel you were as good as dead. I decided to do try to do something i never did before, a rescue mission, i needed valentina to bring back home her science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rescue was hard, i sent a probe with an empty cockpit, i thought my rescue probe was, as the rest of my crafts, overengenired, i was yet again underestimating my craft and overstimating my skills. I managed to set up a rendezvous, the orbit of both ships weren\u0027t the same but i went ahead and did it, switched to valentina, took the science, waited for the time to be right and took the jump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina was in an EVA jump for well over 10 minutes before she got into the rescue probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooked at the fuel gauge, i thought i would have to send another rescue probe, anyways decided to try to lower my orbit as much as possible with whatever fuel i has left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch to my surprise i had the shallowest of reentries when i ran out of fuel, but that was all that i needed, the science made it back to kerbin safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing was landing a massive outpost. I was just going trought contracts and took one to build an outpost on minimus that paid big bucks, i though it would be like the rest, needing space for 5 kerbals and some random parts. However this one was diferent, and i didn\u0027t notice until it was too late (i am too stubborn to not complete a contract once ive taken it), it wanted space for \u003Cstrong\u003E12\u003C/strong\u003E kerbals and a mobile lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could guess from my previously mentioned mission that i won\u0027t be bothering to assemble anything so it had to be in a single launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso with my experience with landers i didn\u0027t to make it into a goddamn skyscraper so i ended up sticking a bunch of mk1 cans around the lab instead of stacking hitchikers containers on top of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final lander was stupidly ugly and huge, it had also needed a launcher according to its size which ended up with a hefty price tag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt felt amazing when it finally touched down and never fell over or had a fatal loss of control over it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nadreck","CreatedById":89087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am only about 10 hours (my time, 20 days kerbal clock) into my first V1.0.x career (luckily have been able to move it to each of the successive release) on my hard mode: standard hard except 50% each funds, rep, science, but only 100% penalties. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in my first non vanilla rescue contract I simply took one of the Mk 1 capsules off my two capsule tourist contract craft that had my recently unlocked OKTO. Given that I had a fair bit of fuel left on it\u0027s last flight, I figured that taking off the extra Mk 1 pod would give me all the extra \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV I needed to make it to a 2,000,000 orbit and back after rendezvous and rescue. I managed to launch near the ascending node and get into an orbit that was only 8\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 off from the derelict, found a course that would take me out to it with the descending node coming up just before a close approach, created a maneuver node about half way out to tweak the rendezvous to about 2.5km then when I got there killed relative velocities while closing in on the target \u0022pushing\u0022 the relative velocity vector closer to the anti-target indicator. My rescue Kerbal managed the space walk easily, gets on board, and I know it is going to be tight with about 20 units of fuel and orbital velocity just over 600m/s. So I decide to optimize and wait for the AP and then brake with the remaining fuel only to see the fuel run out with my PE at 91,000. So my rescue Kerbal jumps out of the ship maneuvers to just behind the engine, impacts it ever so gently then pushes with his reaction jets for exactly one unit of fuels worth, checks the orbit and orientation, PE down to 82,000, orientation just outside the retrograde bubble, so after centering in the bubble he approaches and pushes again down to 1.0 units in the back pack and the PE is now mid 50\u0027s so back in the craft to refill the jet pack, out and push until the PE is 32,000 and then rider her down to a safe landing in one of the oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Vlad","CreatedById":106306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first rescue contract came up almost immediately after I\u0027d made my first successful orbit, and, since at that stage of career mode, $54,000 is a lot of money, I accepted it, but then built a two-man rocket with some pretty basic parts, though fortunately I had my workhorse 909 already...don\u0027t think the mission would\u0027ve been possible without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some reverted test launches (my version of computer models. Could use sandbox mode, but too lazy) I get the rescue ship orbit ready and send her skyward with Jeb at the controls (Val got the first orbit, so I gave Jeb the first orbital rescue). Rocket, somehow, proves a little shakier than it did in the tests (probably pilot error...) but makes it to orbit with what I figure is plenty of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I don\u0027t have plenty of is battery power for the reaction wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, over the course of the next eight game time hours I make adjustment burns, first to let the stranded Kerbal\u0027s pod catch up to Jeb, then to meet up. Doing this requires me to steer prograde or retrograde with SAS on for a few seconds, to save electricity. Despite the lack of constant fine control, I end up within .3 kilometers of our Kerbonaut from the lesser agency and she spacewalks over and hops into Jeb\u0027s craft, probably wondering why all the lights were turned out and a note not to plug any electrical devices in was on the control panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then it\u0027s time to re-enter, with precious little battery power. I point retrograde, burn, again using brief spurts of SAS, hoping to save enough I can just leave it on through the big flaming slow-down. Down we go, don\u0027t have any trouble holding the craft stable until fire starts to burn away the heat shield but as the capsule starts to rock, I turn SAS on. It lasts longer than I\u0027d feared but shorter than I\u0027d hoped, and the ship is still trailing fire when it starts to tumble end over end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe holds together, though, but a new problem arises when I realize that she\u0027s going waaaaay faster than I expected her to be at that point. Plummeting in over some mountains, I pop the chutes after the flames die down and the partially deployed silk slows me up, but...nowhere near enough. They deploy, finally, but I\u0027m not fully slowed fast enough and the rescue ship hits the ground harder than is safe, destroying the heat shield. It sort of bounces when it hits, though, and when it hits the ground again, it stays together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb and the KSP\u0027s newest recruit get out of the pod and await the arrival of the recovery team and probably clean spacesuits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarted re-setting my chutes to open much much higher after this mission. Thing is, I\u0027ve done things on KSP that were probably more difficult, but I think that may have been my most harrowing mission since I got the game, due to the low tech level, small budget and the new re-entry danger.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
