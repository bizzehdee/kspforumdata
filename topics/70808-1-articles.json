So I got to brain storming on a few ideas which could fix that, and here\u0027s what I came up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Telescopes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Possibly in a couple varieties, for instance: a small one one could place on a satellite, a larger in-line one for use in larger space ships, or a giant 3.5m one the size of the entire lab module or a large fuel tank, something akin to the real world Hubble telescope in appearance. The idea of these would be that they would remain in orbit and generate science based on their view of the sky, for instance: getting more science for (obviously) being outside atmosphere, but still more for being farther away from the sun (reducing glare). Maybe even have a few flavors of them, like radio telescopes, infra red, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Research labs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially simmilar to the telescope idea, but a \u0022micro-gravity research lab\u0022 of some kind which would slowly generate science over time. Of course requiring constant flow of electricity and the presence of Kerbals to make it work. Could have plenty of potential for funny quotes as well given we\u0027ve all seen footage of astronaughts having fun with microgravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- External experiments rack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething for the Kerbals to visit while on EVA, this would be something simmilar to the materials observation bay but instead of yielding science upon recovery, would yield results and be refreshed via direct intervention of a kerbal on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Soil sampler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEffectively: a robotic arm or the like which would allow an automated probe to perform the same action as a kerbal on EVA, ie: collecting samples from the surface of a body. Obviously this would require return, so this doesn\u0027t exactly address my initial inspiration, but I thought it was neat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Cameras:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is probably the oddest of these ideas: basically the idea would be to be able to take photos from your probe, rover, station etc, and these would be transmitted back to the KSC and put in a \u0022gallery\u0027 of some form. Basically integrating into game the idea of taking screenshots. These could then net a small amount of science based on what you got in-frame, maybe even have special bonuses for finding easter eggs like the monoliths. These could even be integrated into career mode some time down the line when costs and public interest are factors to be considered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Core sampler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind this one is basically \u0022soil sample on steroids\u0022: basically a large component which requires a kerbal, constant flow of power and time to extract a sample from the surface of an object. This, like most of the others i\u0027ve listed are the sort of things you\u0027d have to \u0022set and leave for a bit\u0022, in order to get a return out of them, thus incentivising longer duration structures and missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note on balance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are NOT in my mind a replacement for having big sample and crew return missions, rather something which would generate a \u0022slow but steady\u0022 flow of science points as opposed to the big jumps you get from acomplishing a major mission. of course with time acceleration there would be room for abuse there, but since when is that not the case with time acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xrayfishx","CreatedById":76147,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T07:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of them are good ideas, I can\u0027t disagree with any of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T08:07:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore variation in Science collection is always a nice idea, and the parts you\u0027ve thought would be very cool, but the problem is the tech tree. The tree needs a major rebalance, as it is very easy to unlock with a few science parts just in the Kerbin System... So more parts really wouldn\u0027t be needed; all they need to do is add multiple difficulty levels for the tech tree, with the harder ones not only having more nodes with less parts in each (still same amount of parts though), but increased node science cost too.
