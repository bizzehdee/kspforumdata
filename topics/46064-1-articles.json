{"TopicId":46064,"ForumId":34,"TopicTitle":"[1.05] Fusebox - electric charge tracker and build helper. 1.52 released 24th Jan 16","CreatedByName":"Ratzap","CreatedById":75982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T21:57:31Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Ratzap","CreatedById":75982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T21:57:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like many others have lost missions to forgetting to attach a solar panel or got a probe alllll the way to it\u0027s destination only to discover that it runs out of charge 1/3 of the way round the dark side. So I set about writing a plugin which will stop me being so daft - Fusebox was born.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s active in the SPH/VAB and in flight. In the editor when you load a ship or select a root part it will open up. It shows you the amount of battery you have (in build maximum = current always of course), the amount of generated charge per second and the amount of drain per second. The latter are rounded to 2 decimal places. If the drain exceeds generation, drain will turn red and it will print a message telling you how long your battery will last at that drain. There is an adjustable warp halter based on battery level and an orbital darkness calculator so you can optimize your battery levels for specific flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will need a little common sense in the build phase as the plugin cannot tell if your panels will all be able to see the sun or not. It cannot tell that rover wheels will not be burning charge while en route to the Mun etc. To that end there are the filters, click sub groups in and out of the calculation in order to see if certain part groups are balanced - fiddle with it, you\u0027ll soon get the hang of it. Click the toolbar icon to switch to concise/minimize mode (it also minimizes the filters), click again to re-open. The plugin remembers window positions and filter settings. Click filters to see the filter box, click a filter on/off to include/exclude from the calculations. Pick GUI style by clicking settings. Also in settings is the toggle for emergency warp halt and the threshold for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew technique used to avoid references so the one build in the zip does all the supported mods in the release notes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGotchas: reaction wheels are estimated in the VAB and untracked in flight - the KSP code as it stands does not return any usage information so it\u0027s impossible to find out. The estimation in VAB is based on observation of one axis full torque and the published documentation of how it\u0027s supposed to work. This is why the reaction wheel filter is off by default.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to Hakan for the initial CKAN config and Pamidur for the RPM addin code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know the drill, pics or no clicks:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AM7z88b.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AM7z88b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbalCurse: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/220284-fusebox\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/220284-fusebox\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDropbox here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71576136/Fusebox_1_52.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71576136/Fusebox_1_52.zip\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnown bugs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience lab - same as wheels, impossible to know when it is using charge\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdated to 1.52 - Recompiled for 1.0.5 and updated DLLs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdated to 1.51 - Recompiled for updated DLLs, added kOS support\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdated to 1.50 - Added support for modded solar systems (RSS, 6.4x etc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdated to 1.45 - linked to latest and some fixes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdated to 1.41 - Linked with latest AntennaRange, Aviation Lights, KAS, NF Solar, RT2, Scansat, TacLS, Telemachus.

There\u0027s no setup or hot key, so long as it loaded with KSP it just appears. If you check the file position and it\u0027s still not showing up, look inside your \u0026lt;KSP_Home\u0026gt;\\KSP.log, see if there\u0027s any errors there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T08:25:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes, that is what i did.

C# will allow some wiggle room on dynamic link loading but you have to reference the assembly something is in at compile time to get a .dll out. As soon as that happens, the presence of that assembly is checked when KSP loads the dll and if it\u0027s not there it defers until the end of the load process. If it is still not found by then, the dll load for fusebox fails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout all I can suggest is use the With_kethane build when you don\u0027t have KAS loaded. Aviation lights are very low drain so not seeing those shouldn\u0027t be a huge problem.
