It boils life support down to one\u00A0main resource with a couple others (mulch and fertilizer) to make greenhouses and long-term bases and stations work and recyclers filling in the middle. Whats nice is you barely have to think about it very early on and players have time to adjust and take on more as their missions become more complex and ambitious. I also really like having a simple habitation mechanic--though\u00A0I think if anything a stock implementation could boil that down to one value rather than having both hab and home timers.

I\u0027d still have a food resource, because with TAC-LS I often have carbon extractors adn water purifiers, but no way to regenerate food, I carry minimal water and oxygen reserves, but large food reserves (still not that massive). TAC-LS by itself doesn\u0027t have a food recycler, so I modded that in (as other mods do too, such as KPBS, with its greenhouse.)

Hopefully a stock implementation would be a bit sleeker than any of them. I think the one thing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E gets right is it combines air, water, and food into a single resource\u00A0so players can work around one timer. After all, if you run out of any of the three you\u0027re dead (or on strike or frozen or whatever), so \u0022supplies\u0022 are just an aggregate value meant to represent the amount of those three things a kerbal consumes in a given time. (In \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E its 1.8 supplies per hour, which I might rather be calibrated to exactly 1/hour for stock to make the math easier). The byproduct is Mulch, which one could assume is a combination of waste-water, CO2 and compost. I think Roverdude is right that making a 100% closed loop life support system is not realistic, so the addition of Fertilizer mass as a catalyst for greenhouse recovery both to extend long missions and to allow for permanent bases is a pretty solid solution.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other thing to keep in mind is all the work that goes\u00A0into balancing this system as a gameplay mechanic. Its important both for greenhouses and recyclers that their mass and form-factor create sensible break-even points for players to consider. For instance there\u0027s no real need to use a greenhouse going to Minmus and back--you\u0027d have less mass just using supplies--but using recyclers might make sense depending on how many kerbals you\u0027re bringing. (Again I think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E could use some tweaks in this department. I\u0027d love it if the big recycler covered more kerbals and we got a 1.25 inline recycler to fill in the middle, etc.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSame goes for Habitation. Its great because it creates an actual gameplay incentive to bring habitation parts so they aren\u0027t just heavy role-playing decoration. I also like the way it works with kerbal-month ratings and multipliers, but\u00A0I think a stock implementation could just dispose of the home timer. Just like with supplies the important thing is to keep that end-of-the-day value to 1 per kerbal. It might also be nice if habitation was more of a perk mechanic than a penalty mechanic, like if happy, well-habbed kerbals gain experience faster.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-29T16:47:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2019 04:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-29T15:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u2019t use Life Support, although it would be an exciting option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u2019s discussions like these that I always have to think of\u00A0when I\u2019m being told that a DLC \u201Cadding functionality offered by mods\u201D is worthless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be fair, life support, scantech and remotech offer extra realism I\u2019d love to see in the stock game.
