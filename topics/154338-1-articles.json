Might be a bit short on radiators, but OTOH it might very well not, depending on how fast you get the ore in (a refinery needs about 200kW of rejection at full use, and I only see 150kW that can act on it on the three deployable radiators). But that is only going to slow you a bit in the worst case. I\u0027d make it a bit shorter, for looks, but the extra length could also make a tractor design work (you tow the asteroid behind you instead of pushing it). That is more stable structurally if you are suffering from a wet noodle syndrome, but then again, I should just recommend you the wonderful autostrut function, which can be activated mid-flight between, say, the docking port and the heaviest part (AKA the asteroid), to make everything solid as a rock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and make sure you have a decent amount of tankage in the stage you dock to it to do the pushing: you can refuel it between burns, but you need enough storage space to do a decent burn.

This asteroiding thing is becoming downright \u003Cem\u003Eeasy\u003C/em\u003E for me, the trickiest thing is navigating the asteroid with such tiny burns spaced days apart, takes a lot of maneuver node wrestling and head scratching.
