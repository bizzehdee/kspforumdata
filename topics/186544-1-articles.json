Issue is as soon as I leave Kerbal orbit all my controls except esc to menu and right clicking the fuel tanks have stopped working. I have tried 12 times and read up on several pages on the net. Tried alt f12 and my debug menu does not come up at all, has this changed PC version? Also Does this have something to do with new maneuver menus? Rather frustrating at this point.
