If you launch outside of an ideal launch window, you won\u0027t reach the point at the same time the planet does. There are a couple of crude solutions to this.\n\nIf your burn causes you to reach the target orbit ahead of the target planet, you can burn longer to arc beyond the target orbit, allowing the target planet to \u0027catch up\u0027 and intercept. (Assuming the target is outside of Kerbin..)\n\nIf you reach the orbit behind your target, you can adjust your solar orbit at AP to \u0027catch up\u0027 to the target planet, which will require at least one more orbit around the sun.\n\nThe same techniques can be used to reach inner planets. The penalty you pay for launching at non-ideal times is you use more DV, and it takes longer to reach the planet."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbochuck","CreatedById":149032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T02:10:34Z","Content":"If you don\u0027t mind mods, KER and protractor tell you the angles.\n\nEssentially you need to burn at the right time so that you get to your target when it\u0027s in the right spot."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T04:27:28Z","Content":"In terms of what you see when you look at the map window while you\u0027re planning your nodes:\n\nIf you launch in the optimal window (i.e. you\u0027re doing a [Hohmann transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit)), then you\u0027ll notice that your transfer orbit is *tangent* to both the origin and the destination. That is, it\u0027s an ellipse whose periapsis just touches the inner planet\u0027s orbit, and whose apoapsis just touches the outer planet\u0027s. The orbits don\u0027t \u0022cross\u0022-- they gradually converge, so that you\u0027re travelling parallel to the planets in question.\n\nA non-optimal launch will involve violating that in some fashion. It\u0027s visible in the map window as a path that *crosses* the orbit of either the source or the destination or both.\n\nAnswering \u0022how\u0022 isn\u0027t super trivial-- there\u0027s only one optimal trajectory, but there are an infinite number of non-optimal ones, depending on how much time you\u0027re willing to take.\n\nI usually end up doing one of the following, depending on whether the target planet is ahead of the ideal position for launch window, or behind (and by how much).\n\n**If the target planet is** ***ahead*** **of the ideal position (but not too much):**\n\nI eject slightly inwards. Instead of launching in the same direction as my origin planet\u0027s orbit around the sun, I launch somewhat sunwards of that, so that my path takes a slight \u0022short-cut\u0022. I aim to arrive near-parallel to the target.\n\n**If the target planet is ahead of the ideal position (by a lot, like a large fraction of 180 degrees):**I go for a bi-elliptic transfer. I make retrograde burn to drop my orbit periapsis down close to the sun, then do a prograde burn at solar periapsis to zip out to the target planet. I aim to arrive near-parallel to the target.\n\n**If the target planet is** ***behind*** **the ideal position (but not too much):**\n\nI eject slightly radially outwards. That is, instead of launching strictly prograde in the direction of my origin planet\u0027s orbit, I eject somewhat outwards from that. I aim to arrive near-parallel to the target.\n\n**If the target planet is behind the ideal position (by a lot, like a large fraction of 180 degrees):**\n\nThis is just a nasty situation, it\u0027s hard to come up with a solution that isn\u0027t incredibly wasteful of dV. This is basically the worst-possible situation, and if I find myself in this position, I generally just wait it out until it\u0027s something more manageable."},{"CreatedByName":"satnet","CreatedById":147366,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T05:10:29Z","Content":"You might want to check out [http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/).

So if you know what the angle between Duna and Kerbin should be from the tools mentioned above, a good strategy is to wait an extra day or 2 before actually ejecting. The added dV is minimal compared to adjusting the departure angle.

Using it you can create nodes for these planned burns and just observe how the trajectory changes.\n\n For example, instead of waiting for optimal Eve transfer, I choose a slightly less dV-optimal trajectory that would take some half a year longer (but considering the optimal window was in more than half a year, that was a fair deal.) Now my Eve-bound probes are nearly skirting Duna orbit. Instead of fuel-optimal pro- or retrograde burn relative to the Sun, the ejection burn had a strong Radial component, which (depending on location) can simultaneously raise apoapsis and drop periapsis. The orbital injection is a neat tangent, like in Hohmann transfer, but the ejection from Kerbin system was \u0022outwards\u0022, into a wide arc that gives Eve time to catch up with the ship that now is trailing behind Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T07:14:29Z","Content":"Bonus: you can get the [Transfer Window Planner](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93115) as a mod ingame, too! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T08:15:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Bonus: you can get the [Transfer Window Planner](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93115) as a mod ingame, too! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI second this, it\u0027s an absolutely brilliant tool for planning a burn ahead of time, and it adapts to your current game conditions, including any planet packs you might have installed.
