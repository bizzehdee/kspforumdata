In fact, all modules are equipped with chutes on descent configuration, so the base is deployable not only to low gravity worlds, but also to any rock with atmosphere to brake with. After individual drops, the rover that comes with the Comm module (which acts as node) can pick up each module and join them in your desired configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum kerbal capacity is 14, but since the shuttle only has a capacity of 5, and I require an abort capability at all times, I usually have them at less than half capacity. But I\u0027m thinking of sending another shuttle to Mun, so I\u0027ll reach the nominal crew of 10 before I start the rotations. Yes, I do those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is, however, a trick you can take advantage of to minimize again the number flights: you can bunch the modules together for cruise to the destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/rBF8EUg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rBF8EUgs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rBF8EUgs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Mun I sent each module on its own (early testing), but after doing MOI one too many times, I decided the next time I was saving burn time time by doing a bit of docking. Not only do you save that, you can also \u0022stage\u0022 the nuclear cruise stages to get more effective range, which I might need on the next one, because it is going to Laythe, the maximum supported range in the brochure. I might have to eat into the fuel tanks of the base, but that\u0027s why I\u0027ll be taking a non-official kethane module to refill with (non-official modules not supported, but welcomed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). Oh, and while we are talking about tricks, it was also on that flight when I performed the assembly on orbit, and just dropped the whole thing in one piece using only the engines in the fuel modules. Minmus is so easy to land in!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd speaking on the nuclear cruise sections... Yes, I know, the T/W is pitiful. But that\u0027s all you need in space! Just plan accordingly, and take it into account while launching: the stage you finish orbit insertion with has a T/W of about 0.1. So \u0022aim high\u0022 while going to orbit, because it will take a while to circularize. Or in other words, take your gravity turn with a lot of leisure. After staging each of them is capable of independent de-orbit maneuvers to comply with the clean space act, of course. so no need to worry about that. Some modules lose their RCS, though (no need for that on the ground), so might need to worry about that if you want to dock them somewhere afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch vehicle, by the way, is pretty much the same for everything, just slightly scaled on account of some modules weighting more than others. Not my most elegant launcher, but it is both simple and powerful enough to put these into the proper escape trajectories, and that\u0027s enough enough in my book. A bit of a weird wobble on the launch pad, I\u0027m not really sure why, but it\u0027ll ease on liftoff. I think the game doesn\u0027t like having docking ports as stress points. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Z7SBqGg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z7SBqGgs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Z7SBqGgs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch more pictures in the album, of course, from early testing on kerbin through orbital assembly to surface operations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/AHjJM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Mine has 2x X800-2 fuel tanks, 2xTL10 kethane tanks, a big converter in the middle, and some drills and some other necessary crap slapped on to the basic thing: adapters, batteries and sensors and whatnot. Don\u0027t forget to add some landing method, mine was a detachable flat probe with eight rockomax 24-77\u0027s and RCS, so I could ditch it after I landed and save on parts, and I would dock it on the belly after launch (which is why it needed to be so flat).
