I can no longer control this Kerbal, he is just one giant space-vegetable on EVA on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the mod did it, and I\u0027m not asking anyone how to \u0022fix\u0022 anything, I am trying to solve what happened on my own, I just don\u0027t know what a few things in the persistence file mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the \u0022crew\u0022 section, there is a \u0022idx\u0022 number down at the bottom of each crew member, and recruit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of my crew members have an idx number of 0, 1, or 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept Joncan Kerman, the victim of this strange incident. His idx is \u0022-1\u0022, the same as all of the recruits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking maybe changing idx to 1 might solve the issue? I will try it and come post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am still curious what \u0022idx\u0022 means, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecond question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now have a vessel in my persistence file that is the remnants of Jonzer Kerman... Does this happen for all Kerbals on EVA? or is it a strange byproduct of the command seat nonsense?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerberus738","CreatedById":100744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T22:16:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei don\u0027t have an answer to your question sorry... but i would really like to see a picture of a kerbal riding another kerbal.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei would assume he\u0027s back in the recruit pool? see if you can recruit him again! and his body is just floating debris in space? neat!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T22:55:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure idx refers to Index. -1 being Inaccessible (like recruits or KIA kerbals) 0 being availible for mission, 1 being assigned to mission, and I have no idea what a 2 would be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"User Unrelated","CreatedById":74021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T22:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried changing his IDX to 1, nothing happened. 0, nothing happened, 2, nothing happened...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up \u0022teminating\u0022 his flight, and cloning him into a new recruit.
