The power is entirely irrelevant, it could be infinite or it could be close to 0, either case there is not enough energy to melt a kilo of aluminium.\n\nI also don\u0027t see why you\u0027d claim I made the amp hours of a heavy duty battery up rather than just Google it.\n\n[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=amp\u002Bhours\u002Bof\u002Ba\u002B6V\u002Bheavy\u002Bduty\u002Bbattery\u0026oq=amp\u002Bhours\u002Bof\u002Ba\u002B6V\u002Bheavy\u002Bduty\u002Bbattery\u0026aqs=chrome..69i57.1683j0j4\u0026client=ms-android-h3g-gb\u0026sourceid=chrome-mobile\u0026espv=1\u0026ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=amp\u002Bhours\u002Bof\u002Ba\u002B6V\u002Bheavy\u002Bduty\u002Bbattery\u0026oq=amp\u002Bhours\u002Bof\u002Ba\u002B6V\u002Bheavy\u002Bduty\u002Bbattery\u0026aqs=chrome..69i57.1683j0j4\u0026client=ms-android-h3g-gb\u0026sourceid=chrome-mobile\u0026espv=1\u0026ie=UTF-8)\n\nFirst result.\n\n\u003E Using the \u0022system\u0022 BlueCosmology seemed to envision, I would say the interesting characteristic would be if the rate of energy dissipation exceeds that of the energy the batteries are capable of supplying per instant.\n\nNope, that\u0027s another way it\u0027s almost definitely not possible with two batteries but it doesn\u0027t matter. The energy in two batteries just isn\u0027t enough, it doesn\u0027t matter if all the energy is released at once or over years.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It takes 30 seconds to say \u0022Well, you know the system could be setup with 2 lantern batteries due to safety concerns. 10.4V at 150mA (roughly adjusted based on Energizer 1209 datasheet) isn\u0027t going to kill you and hence the system is designed to have those batteries replaced until the ingot is formed. But proving that the system will not work in the slightest is something else entirely.\n\nVery simple to show it will not work in the slightest.

If a big company dominates the market, and a smaller company comes in as competition, the big company can quite easily undercut their competitor and take the hit until they\u0027re out of business. Then things go back to the way they were. Prices are lower for a little, which is good for the consumer, but it doesn\u0027t usually make financial sense to challenge such a monopoly by going into competition against it.\n\nSome of the most classical examples of monopolies are utility companies. If a giant conglomerate has bought up all of the power stations, distribution networks and consumer sections of the sector, in a vertically and horizontally integrated model, it is nearly impossible to get a foothold. Building a power station is not a cheap thing to do. You sink a lot of money into the initial project, with no prospect of payback for years, and even when it\u0027s built, you have nobody to sell it to, because your competitor owns the distribution network, and isn\u0027t going to threaten their monopoly."},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T10:11:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s what net neutrality is really all about, sure Comcast can do a few evil things, but there are always competitors; it is the lack of CONSUMERS researching into the companies chosen for to be their ISP that leads to those evil things persisting.

In a lot of areas you do not, unlike you seem to claim, get to choose your ISP; there often is just one or maybe two that give reasonable coverage and speed. So in the end, they indeed can force you to take their offer or have nothing. And that\u0027s where net neutrality shines: it forces them to behave instead of monetizing on this.\n\nThe very simplified model where you respond on there being too high prizes (say due to an [almost] monopoly) by opening your own business is simply wrong. There are many reasons:\n\na) Huge companies have entirely different ways of doing things (look up how amazon forces publishers to comply)\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Huge companies are the only ones capable of doing things on a large scale (ISPs, world-wide shiping, air trafficing all fall in this category)\n\nc) There often is only enough demand for a single provider; so a second one might lower the prizes, but then neither of them would be profitable (then a huge company will prevail because they can simply wait until the small one goes bankrupt)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T10:14:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 10:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ZetaX**"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T13:18:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You appear to be responding to Fel\u0027s post through me.

Why is the seller allowed to remove themselves from any moral obligation? Trying to trick someone into buying something for far more than it is worth, requires an intention to harm the buyer.

No, I do not agree that a seller has an obligation to shell out millions of dollars to compensate some fool who burned his mouth on a cup of coffee because he didn\u0027t have the common sense to check the temperature before taking a huge gulp of it. That is something I definitely do NOT agree with. However, there was also no intent to harm on the part of the seller in this case. There is nothing to gain by trying to deceive the customer into thinking a cup of coffee is cooler than it really is. The buyer would buy the coffee whether it is too hot to drink or not.
