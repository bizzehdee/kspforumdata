So, you model one piece, get it to orbit, then you model next module, get it to orbit xD Like in real life. While the actual first mission was going on - taking FGB to orbit, US was building Node1 on the ground. That is how I am building my main KSP station, when I see that something is missing, I model my own modules and send them up =)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WCOLE360","CreatedById":57227,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T15:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds confusing.
