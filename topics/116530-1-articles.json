I could simply add in multiple versions of the part that unlock at different nodes, but then you run into linearity issues (\u0022what if I\u0027ve unlocked this node but not this node?\u0022, etc.). Additionally, I\u0027d like to avoid having more than one part in the mix for simplicity\u0027s sake.\n\nFor someone completely unversed in plugin development (or programming in general, really), is there a way of accomplishing what I described?\n\nEDIT: I should note, I was inspired by MechJeb\u0027s user experience, how MechJeb has a controller that determines what you have researched and unlocks the correct modules accordingly independent of the part itself, but I had a hard time making sense of exactly how this was accomplished from MechJeb\u0027s source.\n\nEDIT2: Found a [possible solution](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123323-WIP-Merill-s-plugins-PartUpgrade-NoseConeWithTank) via a post I missed during my searches by Merill.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T00:55:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by albany\\_**\n  \nadding edit: note."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T04:55:42Z","Content":"If you want to do this yourself, the basis of it is gating functionality behind a node state check\n\n    if (ResearchAndDevelopment.Instance.GetTechState(nodeID).state == RDTech.State.Available)"}]}
