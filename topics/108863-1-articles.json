So yeah I can\u0027t get a fast encounter. I was trying to increase both radial and pro-grade velocity to get a fast encounter, and increase normal to match inclination. To get fast encounter I\u0027d probably have to get it into kerbin escape trajectory, but I can\u0027t find an encounter with that.\n\nI didn\u0027t save the game at that time so no picture yet, I\u0027ll try to get picture when I attempt it again...."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T04:39:21Z","Content":"You can go easy and try mechjeb. It has an advanced transfer option where you can choose between asap and minimal dv usage transfers. It will show you a graph with how many days it will take and how much dv will be used. You can choose at any point you like to on the graph and leave the burn to mechjeb."},{"CreatedByName":"enroger","CreatedById":140528,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T06:35:14Z","Content":"Thanks everyone! Problem solved, got transfer window planner. Turns out I need to burn retrograde to Mun\u0027s orbital velocity, felt stupid to not tried that the first place. Took 700m/s and encounter in 2.5 days, Rocket to Minmus!"}]}
