I haven\u0027t had time to re-read everything here, but I am getting the idea :-) I absolutely love the depth people are going into with processes!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few points I wanted to make/ask about (and I admit I am leaving out a lot of smaller details and smearing over some things to make it simpler):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSummary point: Electrical power plants give us the very most bang for the buck we can get as far as multi-use technology, so we could look at what we can do with it chemically to reduce the need to ship bulk feedstocks, complicated (and delicate) equipment, and losses during chemical transformation steps. We could\u00A0also look at how we can make things smaller and/or simpler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSabatier and Fischer-Tropsch (and generally, almost any)\u00A0processes are large if they are designed for continuous process. They can be smaller for batch process.. much smaller in fact. But, the apparatus wouldnt produce as much over time, and would have to be reset by a person (kerbal) somehow.. perhaps an engineer or scientist. Industrial processes can be adapted to batch form and made very portable. So, this may be a way to make smaller units for a small bootstrap base/colony as a sort of Tier 1. Adding robots to do this work for you would get back to the large size problem, but might be a good example of multi-use technology, if we assume we can make robots with multi use capabilities in the not so far future.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are many other ways to produce these various chemicals that are needed for sustenance and fuel that are not used on Earth industrially because they are not cost effective.. on Earth. On another planet is an entirely different question. (De)Methylation, for example, of an organic material can be accomplished literally hundreds of ways, with varying yields and results.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCatalytic organic chem processes\u00A0are much simpler to run than their industrial counterparts, but take a long time. Very little energy input usually, though.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMicrowave chemistry along with ultrasonic chemistry is currently being used to accomplish a lot of interesting things in various baseline and green\u00A0chemical processes, and usually only require\u00A0some sort of substrate (like zeolite) to replace the heavy duty oxidizers or catalysts\u00A0and etc that are normally used.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI would think preference would be given to any electrolytic form of a process that exists, even if it is not in current use industrially, as this allows a simple way to oxidize and/or reduce things in huge numbers of ways using only one basic thing.. electricity (and some sort of electrolyte, which is often renewable)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhat we would probably use on another planet at first for all of this is simple hydrocarbons, since they can be made from water and carbon. Nitrogenous compounds would not be easy to make if the remote environment were not rich in nitrogenous things, or didn\u0027t have a nitrogen atmosphere. If, on the other hand, there were a Nitrogen atmosphere, you could make\u00A0Nitric (and Nitrous, though is is usually oxidized to make more Nitric) acid from electricity, Nitrogen and water, and then use that reacted with any local carbonate\u00A0material to make Nitrates. Which could then be used to make high energy nitrogen compounds... or \u00A0you could use it directly, but I would think you would want to store it as Nitrates. Mind you.. if there are no nitrogenous compounds on planet.. we\u0027d be in serious food trouble. We would have to import a lot of nitrate anyway.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGiven the above, I would think we would be\u00A0developing Alkane (Methane, Ethane) and Alcohol rockets,\u00A0power sources, heating/cooling plants\u00A0and for general use, and the exotic stuff would be reserved for special cases. So I don\u0027t honestly think that anyone would put in the energy to develop a method to produce UDMH, for example, on Mars.. at least, not for awhile. Oxygen can be stored in various intermediates as well, without the need to store it as liquid. Methane obviously can easily be stored as liquid, as can almost any alcohol. I mean, for high test\u00A0use, wouldn\u0027t we be looking at things like Pentanol or Hexanol? Hexanol would pack a damn good punch, and all you need to produce it other than O2, H2 and C\u00A0is some ethylated Aluminum, which is regenerated as an oxide of aluminum when you\u0027re done with it. I haven\u0027t looked it up, but I am guessing you could build Hexanol another way that didn\u0027t use that process, given that it looks just like a series of hydroformylations/hydrogenations away from Methanol... that is to say, you can use a process that needs no Aluminim to do it from 1-pentanol, and I don\u0027t see any reason this process couldn\u0027t be adapted to smaller chain alcohols. In practice, you would end up with a mixture at the end, which you would purify by distillation, so the yield would be poor.. however the remaining fractions could undergo the process again and you could get more.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I am suggesting is this: We know that there is a lot of Oxygen, Hydrogen and Carbon out there in space (that are relatively easy to get to). We can\u0027t say the same with surety for NItrogenous or metallic compounds. Also, we might be on a planet that is abundant in, for example, sulfur, so we might look at using that as an agent to help us along. But in 100% of cases, we KNOW we will find O2, H2 and C. In some form. If we don\u0027t, it\u0027s unlikely we would want to do anything on that particular rock anyway, regardless. So..\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would\u00A0start with simple hydrocarbons and stay away from nitrogenous compounds to start. Then all you need to do is ship a hell of a lot of solar panels (we have solar cells now that are very light per watt)\u00A0and batteries, and you would be able to bootstrap a base with only food, luxury goods and machine parts as inputs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis restricts the rocket engines you can use, sure. But we know a Methane powered rocket is not only possible, but likely to be developed to a high level of perfection in the next couple of years. We also know that Methanol can be used as a fuel cell input directly, and that alcohol is a viable propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, there are potentially hydrogen blimps that could be used as transport and drone stock, if a planet had a decent atmosphere and not a lot of wind. You could have rovers with in situ solar recharging, and a small alcohol fuel cell for emergency power. \u00A0Electric \u0022gliders\u0027 for long range flight, perhaps heavier than air ones (partially hydrogen buoyed)..\u00A0And so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt some point you would find nitrogen containing minerals, salts, or etc. Then..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you can produce NItric Acid by the cart load and make whatever you like from it. Ammonium Nitrate is the first thing that comes to mind, which is a great way to store nitrogen, and also is a good fertilizer. Then we would only need to solve the P and K part of the plant biology spectrum to make things realistic enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt\u00A0this point, If you want a hypergolic propellant, then NTO\u002BHydrazine (straight up) will do, and anhydrous Hydrazine can be produced from liquid Ammonia, electrolytically (1958). NTO can\u00A0produced catalytically from Ammonia (1950\u0027s), so you have a handy single source feedstock for this stuff. All you need to make either one is O2, N2 and H2. And producing ammonia is also possible electrolytically, at a lower temperature than Haber-Bosch (2005). So you could now have a high power hypergolic propellant with pretty much only the things you have found lying about on the ground, or in the atmosphere, and some solar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe people would be bringing along the bacterial cultures you need\u00A0for food production (aka, you would use feces and urine\u00A0as an addendum to your soil system to make it properly balanced) so you don\u0027t need to worry about that. You could also ship soil samples in suspended form to preserve the unique qualities of each biome you wanted to replicate. Etc etc. All of that could be contained in a \u0027soil science\u0027 module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, just producing food, water, O2 and purifying out toxins for exhaust or reuse in situ will be very hard, but doable fairly quickly, as long as there is a supply and comms \u00A0line back to Earth to work out the kinks, plenty of power, and there is enough emergency food and water there to sustain the populace for as long as it will be between \u0022now\u0027 and \u0027 the next time you can launch a resupply or rescue\u0027. And that\u0027s just Tier One. Maybe that\u0027s what the focus would be at first?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo.. some thoughts. I hope this helps the process!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-07T04:06:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2016 04:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Dr.LoveJoy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadding too many details :-)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr.LoveJoy","CreatedById":147729,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T04:30:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, perhaps this reference may help:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://voitlab.com/courses/thermodynamics/index.php?title=Co-Electrolysis_of_CO2_and_H2O_to_Create_Fuel_and_Oxygen_on_Mars\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://voitlab.com/courses/thermodynamics/index.php?title=Co-Electrolysis_of_CO2_and_H2O_to_Create_Fuel_and_Oxygen_on_Mars\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would ignore the cost estimates though.. they have just gone down given SpaceX\u0027s accomplishment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: Just read the last three pages and I see people are all into thinking about this stuff.
