All the work you put into editing - time slicing, launch counters, etc are very much appreciated. Also, I like the way you post *all* missions, not just the successful ones. It makes it more exciting to watch because we never really know what to expect. I laughed like a madman at your last episode when that poor kerbal started cartwheeling into a crater on the south pole of the mun. A shame he didn\u0027t survive to continue on with the mission but it was worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I hope the issues with Youtube are sorted out and you can post more videos. I\u0027d love to see a successful outcome to the Mun rover / Munolith discovery mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JMBuilder","CreatedById":30493,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T05:32:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI REALLY want to see GRUNT-45 in action again.
