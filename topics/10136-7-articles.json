All the work you put into editing - time slicing, launch counters, etc are very much appreciated. Also, I like the way you post \\*all\\* missions, not just the successful ones. It makes it more exciting to watch because we never really know what to expect. I laughed like a madman at your last episode when that poor kerbal started cartwheeling into a crater on the south pole of the mun. A shame he didn\u0027t survive to continue on with the mission but it was worth it.\n\nAnyway I hope the issues with Youtube are sorted out and you can post more videos. I\u0027d love to see a successful outcome to the Mun rover / Munolith discovery mission."},{"CreatedByName":"JMBuilder","CreatedById":30493,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T05:32:42Z","Content":"I REALLY want to see GRUNT-45 in action again.

I\u0027ve gotten some amazing things off the ground with just stock parts in 0.16. GRUNT was a huge part of the last video series. I know we can see the old fellow flying again!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikeboy","CreatedById":32689,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-19T14:45:43Z","Content":"I am a big fan of the series and saw you post in the warp clamps thread, I\u0027d like to see you do something with them."},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-19T16:19:26Z","Content":"So, was the Valkyrie crash the fault of the design or the pilot?"},{"CreatedByName":"Katalliaan","CreatedById":12399,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T22:34:26Z","Content":"Matt\u0027s live over at [http://twitch.tv/thewinterowl](http://twitch.tv/thewinterowl) right now, doing a bit of Muon-hunting."},{"CreatedByName":"moomoohk","CreatedById":13907,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T01:26:12Z","Content":"Hey Matt!\n\nI can totally help with modding the live streams chat if you need a mod."},{"CreatedByName":"wmu3182","CreatedById":49968,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T07:08:59Z","Content":"white owl \n\ncould you please put roc 75 on the craft list but put it as a zip file"},{"CreatedByName":"wmu3182","CreatedById":49968,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T09:29:54Z","Content":"um hi white owl\n\ncould y ou pleas upload grunt 45 and roc 75 but in zip files as i cant run . craft on my mac"},{"CreatedByName":"Scraggz","CreatedById":26408,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T11:17:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E um hi white owl\n\u003E could y ou pleas upload grunt 45 and roc 75 but in zip files as i cant run . craft on my mac\n\nYou are stupid.

You now have save files so you put the ships in there instead unless you want them to be accessible to all users.\n\nHe is generally right though wmu3182 and welcome to the forums."},{"CreatedByName":"cameronrichards56","CreatedById":35741,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-07T13:49:28Z","Content":"hey matt any ksp on youtube today"},{"CreatedByName":"cameronrichards56","CreatedById":35741,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-07T18:09:14Z","Content":"how did you manage that silent hunter is not rocket science"},{"CreatedByName":"SunJumper","CreatedById":27062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T09:13:04Z","Content":"Although you want to return to sandbox, the lack of science text like \u0022You have found a mysterious green substance\u0022 may take away from the atmosphere. If you want to combat this, just edit your save file to get a large amount of science (I believe the minimum for Yargnit\u0027s tree is about 30k) to unlock all the parts. Basically, sandbox with science text. \n\nOnly downside is if you want to add new parts, you must research them individually (but at no science cost)."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T10:01:24Z","Content":"It\u0027s aliiiiiiiive!!!"}]}
