That\u0027s the only way i know with hyperedit... Haven\u0027t used all of its features yet cuz it\u0027s quite a mighty tool... one small mistake in using it could screw up your game.... :S\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T21:37:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t used HyperEdit a lot, but it\u0027s one powerful tool... I suggest that when you use the land function, input a value that is slightly above the current terrain height, this should stop your rovers, etc. from being destroyed due to the fact that they are spawning under the surface. Be careful with HyperEdit! It could do some serious damage to your game with one wrong move! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman8000","CreatedById":88507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T14:18:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to use the land function on hyper edit and select the target location you want it on. I would recomend that you orbit first then select the land part, also select a distance like 100m, or 20m from the surface then land it your self..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
