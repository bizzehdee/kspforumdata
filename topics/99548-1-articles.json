I know a friend who acquired their copy via Steam as you appear to have done, and for some bizarre reason it defaulted to launching the 64 bit version, which is... less than stable. In his case, the stage button wouldn\u0027t work and the staging light stuck on purple instead of green.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry going into your KSP directory (c:\\program files\\steam\\steamapps\\ksp or something similar) and launching KSP.exe manually (instead of KSP_x64.exe), see if that improves things. You don\u0027t need to have Steam running, as the game doesn\u0027t use any DRM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what 5thhorseman said. Try starting a sandbox-mode game or a career mode game in normal difficulty, see if that fixes it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toejam","CreatedById":155069,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-21T21:18:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ran into the same problem where an f5 quick save wasn\u0027t working. \u00A0However, I think they just moved it. \u00A0If you go back to the space center and then pull up your esc options you can save from there. \u00A0I preferred the old way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T08:43:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/155069-toejam/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022155069\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/155069-toejam/\u0022 id=\u0022ips_uid_4\u0022\u003E@toejam\u003C/a\u003E, Ossie posted this in February so there\u0027s a good chance he\u0027s figured it out by now, F5 and F9 do work but you need to make sure your F keys have not been toggled to another mode, for example as media keys on some laptops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toejam","CreatedById":155069,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T01:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyup, got it. \u00A0gracias.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
