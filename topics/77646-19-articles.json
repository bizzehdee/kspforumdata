It\u0027s probably far harder than we think to get something somewhere besides LEO. We should, for all practical purposes, avoid aiming too high. Safer to do so than aim high for something higher than LEO. Anyways, even that would be a HUGE accomplishment. It\u0027s space (or really close to it, depending on the LEO height we\u0027re looking at). Just that opens up lots of possibilities for data collection (maybe instruments like spectrometers and other instruments that collect radiation and force data, and other instruments of such nature that one could use to find data correlations at certain times [i don\u0027t know, this all seems neat to me] and even though it might not be something very far beyond our atmosphere it would still be \u003Cem\u003Ereally awesome, man.\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that for our first mission, we can pretty much only do LEO (If we\u0027re extremely lucky, maybe GTO).
