I\u0027ve played KSP pretty much since the earliest aplha and ever since then I have never designed a succesfull spaceplane. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut recently, with the implimentation of 0.90 I\u0027ve been looking into a budget way of bringing Kerbals into orbit to man my stations.

After loads of tweaking the wings and thrust I atleast got it to fly but it still flies like an absolute brick. The turning rate is terrible and once I reach higher altitudes it becomes impossible to keep the nose pointed up wich sends the plane casually drifting down back towards the surface. It doesn\u0027t spin out of control or anything and can be landed relatively easilly but it\u0027s impossible to get it into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some more pictures to help with the troubleshooting process:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/thJPXFg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022thJPXFg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KLly47P.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KLly47P.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O4MTKlX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022O4MTKlX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7I3e9Gj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227I3e9Gj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yea as stated.. The goal of this craft would be to take Kerbals into orbit to deliver them to my stations and bring back the Kerbals already there. It doesn\u0027t need to be capable of lifting heavy loads and doesn\u0027t need an insane amount of Dv. The furthest it would have to reach as far as my current plans go is a 800Km circular orbit around Kerbin where my furthest station is located.

Also, LV-Ns do not have sufficient TWR (0.11!) to push that plane into orbit, especially without turbojets and with such a heavy ship. I would recommend trying to make a small SSTO from stock parts and experimenting with different mass, lift, jet, and rocket engine combinations.
