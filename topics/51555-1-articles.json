Try using a small hardpoint or even just surface-mounting it to the main body. The planes you are talking about did not have the engines THAT far off-center. Also, the fact that your pylon is a wing in front of the CoM means that it tries to spin your plane around, which is very bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
