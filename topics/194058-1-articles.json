one does not speak of approaching\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Magic Boulder any more than one speaks of landing on\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Duna.\u00A0 This convention is reinforced, perhaps, by the forum\u0027s insistence on ascribing a sense of intent to the random mesh problems (\u0027Magic Boulder ate my ship!\u0027, for example).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany people believe that Magic Boulder went away with the Asteroid Redirect Mission update (alpha version 0.23.5), but it was missing for some time before that.\u00A0 I am not in a position to say anything about the developers\u0027 motives, but my understanding is that it was removed by accident; its code, as anyone who has actually encountered the thing knows, was a bit weird.\u00A0 The story goes that since the Tracking Station will automatically show anything that is either a vessel or a celestial body, Magic Boulder could not be either of those, but some of the updates to the game in version 0.19\u00A0meant that the game would refuse to load anything that was not either a vessel or a celestial body.\u00A0 Not being a coder, myself, I can only say that it sounds plausible, but I lack both the professional expertise and the insider knowledge\u00A0to verify it.\u00A0 I do know that current asteroids (meaning the post-alpha 0.23.5 asteroids with which\u00A0we are presently familiar) are technically regarded as vessel parts, which is why you can dock to them and move them about, and, presumably, why they show up in the Tracking Station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is also true that other planets were added in alpha version 0.17, so Magic Boulder was not in the game for very long.\u00A0 Assuming the wiki is correct--I certainly don\u0027t remember the dates--version 0.17 was released on 19 Sep 2012, and version 0.19 was released on 16 Mar 2013, so it would have been in the game for not quite six months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-22T13:16:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2020 01:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
