Mobile Processing Lab, Pilot, and 2 Scientist.\u00A0 Figured this would help speed up my science gathering.\u00A0 At some point after launch and gathering data, I forwarded the game to a point where I could not revert back to pre-launch of the lab, and I realized.....I had not put an antenna on the final version, so all that science was sitting there, unattainable.\u00A0 \u00A0I also didn\u0027t have a method to bring the Kerbals home.\u00A0 I had an engine with enough fuel to get them out of orbit, but I had no heat shields and no parachutes.\u00A0 A rescue mission would need to be launched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the thing:\u00A0 I had never done an orbital rendezvous before, and never docked.\u00A0 I tried a few times on my own....fail.\u00A0 EPIC FAIL. I scoured the forum for help.\u00A0 Found a few pointers.\u00A0 FAIL.\u00A0 Found this great guide:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83437-illustrated-tutorial-for-orbital-rendezvous/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EIllustrated Tutorial for Orbital Rendezvous\u003C/a\u003E. Fail, but not as bad.\u00A0 The tutorial really helped me get in the proper orbit and get within 500m-5km of\u00A0 my target.\u00A0 That took me a few hours of trial and error.\u00A0 But, every time I got close, I\u0027d watch my lab get closer, and closer, and then zoom right by me the other direction.\u00A0 Use the orbital markers to thrust forward.....and there it goes the other way.\u00A0 Try and try, fail and more fail.\u00A0 I must have spent 10 hours just loading, getting close, but never close enough or slow enough, and to the point my craft was going to run out of fuel before even getting a chance to dock.\u00A0 I tried for days. I left the game alone for days.\u00A0 I was [...] this close to posting here a few days ago, looking for any other pointers on redezvous with craft, because I had read the guides, and it just was not working for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hadn\u0027t played for a day or two, frustrated with my failures, when I decided to load up the game this morning.\u00A0 For whatever reason, this morning it just all clicked.\u00A0 I got an intersect point down to 500m and about 12m/s.\u00A0 The biggest thing that had caused me failures was not fully grasping how the target markers worked.\u00A0 I saw the whole PUSH/PULL notes in\u00A0 the link for Orbital Rendezvous but, until you really have tried it or done it properly a few times, it was hard for me to grasp just how that worked.\u00A0 But, once I did the correct burn and had the normal target and the prograde marker lined up properly, it then hit me how to do the push or pull in each direction.\u00A0 I got my rescue craft to about 15m away from my lab.\u00A0 Still took me a good hour or two of loading and unloading to dock.\u00A0 I have no mods, and I found the normal camera view to be horrible for trying to dock, and didn\u0027t see much help from the Docking mode.\u00A0 After multiple attempts, I really just ended up bumping into the docking port to dock.\u00A0 Maybe I\u0027ll break down and get a docking mod, or maybe with some future rendezvous I will find a better camera mode to use and find the stock docking mode is actually useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut today, I rejoice in finally bringing Valentina, Bob, and Milsey home from orbit.\u00A0 I am less than 50 science away from getting the scanning technologies, which should help me unlock more science and prepare for Mun and Minmus landings. Really enjoying the game since switching from console to PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-24T22:16:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongrats!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes the best thing is to get some time and distance from a problem, stop thinking about it; get a good nights sleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt all comes together when you come back to it, your mind has been working on it without you even knowing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-25T00:58:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad to hear the penny finally dropped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince my first docking, I\u0027ve always just used the stock combination of external view and the nav ball markers.\u00A0 I used to (in sandbox or science, where I had full \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E capability) lock the \u0022to target\u0022 mode and use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E translation to get the \u0022to target\u0022 and \u0022prograde\u0022 (which is target closing velocity) to match.\u00A0 Not sure yet what I\u0027ll do in career, where my most experienced Kerbals can\u0027t yet hold anything other than celestial heading, prograde, and retrograde.\u00A0 Won\u0027t matter until I unlock docking ports, I guess (should be soon; I just researched the Mk. 1-2 Command Pod last session).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne very small mod that is more useful than you\u0027d think for docking, as well as a lot of help for landings on airless bodies and just making maneuver node burns, is \u0022Better Burn Time\u0022 -- when you have a target set and are close enough to contemplate docking, it\u0027ll give you a running status of predicted closest approach, how long until then, and how long your burn to zero out relative velocity (it won\u0027t tell you direction, but the nav ball has that).\u00A0 With Better Burn Time and the standard rendezvous techniques, rendezvous and docking become a lot easier, without needing a big GUI docking alignment mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-25T03:32:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI consider docking the biggest hurtle to get over in this game.\u00A0 There\u0027s nothing like the first time it works, especially when you need it to do so!\u00A0 Before you know it, docking will be second nature, and you\u0027ll be building interplanetary craft in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still can\u0027t even begin to fathom how this game is played with a controller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongrats!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-25T10:08:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYay.\u00A0 Well done, and a huge welcome to the forums.\u00A0 Oh, and a Merry Christmas too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRendezvous and docking are hard at first, don\u0027t underestimate how big an achievement the first one is.\u00A0 Your experience was similar to mine, I checked the tutorial videos etc and eventually my son helped me out, but my first \u0027solo\u0027 felt really special.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve done a few it times it falls into place much better.
