This is known to cause problems. If you need to switch programs, either run KSP in full-window mode by using the -\u003Cem\u003Epopupwindow\u003C/em\u003E flag, or hit Alt\u002BEnter to change to windowed mode before switching programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from that... hm. It might be worth trying to copy KSP\u0027s game folder out of the \u003Cem\u003Esteamapps\\common\u003C/em\u003E folder and running KSP elsewhere (not the Desktop or Documents folders, either; try somewhere like C:\\KSP or C:\\Games\\KSP). Every now and again I see some issues with permissions crop up, where Steam seems to forget to properly set the permissions and such. If it works outside the Steam folders , you can get it to work from those folders by altering the permissions on it. I\u0027m not 100% how to do so with Windows 8, though. If you get stuck, you can always Google it. Basically, you need to make sure you have read/write permissions on all of KSP\u0027s folders, files and subfolders, as well as Ownership of them -- including the main KSP folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know how it goes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bayliss","CreatedById":79975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T15:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have not been, Alt \u002B Tab \u0027ing out or leaving during the loading process.
