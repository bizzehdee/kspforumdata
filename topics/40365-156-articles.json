I had it rebuild the file and checked it after I visited each ship. The ground station shows nuclear power and relay = False (as it should be). The first satellite (A) showed relay = True after I visited it and reset the transmitter, but the transmitter showed 0MW transmitted.

That\u0027s why I think A got reset to False after I set B,C to true. But some process is taking place when a vessel loads that resets the values for other vessels. That seems breaky to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you talked to Cliph about his algorithm for RT2 connections? It should work perfectly for building and maintaining the connection graph. You have a few added complication with each node having 2 net values for contributions to the network, you have a constant for a loss coefficient, but beyond that it should all be simple math to determine how much power is in each node in the network - and that only needs to happen when a ship moves behind a planet/moon or emerges from one, and that\u0027s not very often.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-02T01:35:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2013 01:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by johnsonwax\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Makeone","CreatedById":79935,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T02:18:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022 data-cite=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEither you misunderstood him or I am misunderstanding him.

I had it rebuild the file and checked it after I visited each ship. The ground station shows nuclear power and relay = False (as it should be).

That means if you create a relay and leave it alone, it should work fine because it will read the proper state from the text file but otherwise it will get reset into transmitter mode and you\u0027ll have to turn off the transmitter and set it back into relay mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one relay limit is totally unrelated to this and has nothing to do with the save file.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T03:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022power5000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022power5000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere is the log\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/ksp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.filedropper.com/ksp\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the science overview and station science those are the only science related mods I have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck how your science mods are modifying the existing science experiments because you have in your log file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[LOG 11:40:09.237] [DTMagnetometer]: Activated (forced)\u003Cbr\u003E[B][ERR 11:40:09.238] [R\u0026amp;D]: No Experiment definition found with id magnetosphericExperiment[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you go into GameData/WarpPlugin/Parts/Resources/ScienceDefs.cfg you will see...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEXPERIMENT_DEFINITION\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E[B]\tid = magnetosphericExperiment[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\ttitle = Analyse Magnetosphere\u003Cbr\u003E........\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d guess one of your other mods is messing with the science experiment definitions causing the magnetometer one to be deleted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ExEvolution","CreatedById":93868,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T04:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seriously can\u0027t figure out how to get anything with this pack\u0027s engines to even lift off, other than the DT Vista Inertial Fusion Engine.

If electrolysis works like normal generators, it\u0027s consuming a negative amount of the resource; in other words it\u0027s withdrawing negative oxidizer from the tanks. Aluminum flows to the entire ship, much like monopropellant, which is why you\u0027re seeing it increase. If you run kethane, set it up like you would set up your converter lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second: That\u0027s just normal rocket behavior. Try putting a rocket consisting of a command piece, single liquid fuel tank, and a single liquid fuel engine onto the launchpad. Before you fire up the engine, disable the tank\u0027s flow of either liquid fuel or oxidizer. The engine will still consume the other resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, I\u0027m using the DT Vista engine with MechJeb limiting acceleration to 3 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E and a joystick with the throttle all the way forwards.
