This method was the source of many problems: if the SRB had too much delta-v, my solar orbit would have been too elliptical, if it didn\u0027t had enough delta-v exit the SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter several wheels breaking, I decided to put landing legs on the rover(the tiny one) to prevent it from flipping and to protect the wheels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter countless attempts to drive on Duna without flipping a rover, I decided to place the chutes I was using on two decouplers. After placing of some sepatron on the SRB(in order to have enough delta-v to escape kerbin SOI) and the addition of two small boosters on the rocket(to have a decent TWR on lift-off), I finally been able to make the rover land on Duna, I dithced the chutes and drove it without flipping it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I was desperate enough to place the wheels higher hoping it would do any difference)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust after that, I made a manned mission to the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn in order to relax.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal note: The last sentence show that KSP is NOT like real life: imagine if NASA\u0027s engineers, after landing Curiosity, said:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We finally landed that rover on Mars.

So everything\u0027s going fine. I get to Duna and all that; get about 500 science. Get back into orbit. Then I realize I\u0027m low on dV. I spend about half an hour trying various return trajectories, before finally finding one that comes \u003Cstrong\u003Ebarely\u003C/strong\u003E within my dV and time restrictions (I\u0027m playing with TAC.) So, finally, I\u0027m on my return trajectory, which is going to take me through the atmosphere to aerobrake. Then I get a freak Mun encounter that the map view didn\u0027t tell me about, which pulls my trajectory clear out of the atmosphere. I have enough dV to get inside the atmosphere enough to get a capture, but not a full brake. After the capture, I\u0027m on a fairly steep collision course (a 60-90 degree angle with the tangent to Kerbin) with Kerbin, and mind you this is a vehicle consisting of probably more mass than a single mini white parachute can safely save at that steep a trajectory.
