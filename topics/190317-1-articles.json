However, I\u0027ve never attempted to fulfill a satellite contract with satellites I\u0027ve docked with another ship for transport to their destination, so I wanted to know if docking those satellites with the mothership and then undocking in Eve orbit and flying them to their designated orbits will still fulfill the contract requirements. I \u003Cem\u003Eassume\u003C/em\u003E it will, but I\u0027d be pretty bummed if it didn\u0027t and I had to send them separately, especially as I\u0027m playing a career mode with a set minimum launch schedule and it\u0027ll be many hours (prolly 20\u002B of game time) before that ship even arrives at Eve for me to find this out on my own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-12T01:58:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends, on a lot of things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, if you build all 4 ships (the actual ship and the 3 satellites) AFTER the contracts are accepted, you should be totally fine. The problem with satellites losing their \u0022newness\u0022 is when they dock to older ships already launched, and gain that older ship\u0027s time stamp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, even if the mothership is already built you may be fine. I\u0027ve actually docked satellites to refuel a lot of times and in the contrary to what many people say, I\u0027ve never had a satellite contract not fulfill because of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThirdly, what sucks is the only way to know is to do it. You can test it before you eject to Eve by detaching the satellite from the mothership temporarily and seeing if it still satisfies the \u0022build a new satellite...\u0022 clause of the contract, in the contract window in flight that will have a check if the satellite is still valid. However there\u0027s never a guarantee that it\u0027ll still be good once you get to Eve. And there\u0027s no way to test it before launch and docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourthly, if the game and you disagree that all your work was worthy of the contract payment, by all means go into Alt-F12 debug mode and complete the contract. It\u0027s not cheating if it fixes a bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cubivore","CreatedById":121404,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-12T02:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI accepted the contracts a while ago as a way to basically make the large cost of the ship pay for itself on arrival to Eve.
