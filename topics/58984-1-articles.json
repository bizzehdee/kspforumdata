Basically, the engine gives twice as much total thrust from the same amount of fuel as any of the stock engines except the ion engine, so if you\u0027re using any significant amount of fuel, the extra fuel mass you\u0027d have to bring would be more than the extra mass of the engine. Now, if you design small focused probes, you\u0027re less likely to need the fuel amounts that would make the LV-N worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, as the mass of the craft increases, whether from payload or from fuel, the delta-v you get from an LV-N increases compared to the amount of delta-v you\u0027d get from any other engine. This is more true in the case of the payload mass increasing than fuel mass, but it\u0027s still true in either case. Even the lightest stock pod, the OKTO2, on top of an FL-T800 fuel tank, gets more delta-V from an LV-N, despite it\u0027s extra mass, than it would from an LV-909 or a Rockomax 48-7S. Now, I\u0027ll admit that in the case of a probe that light, you\u0027d be better off breaking it into separate stages or adding drop tanks from the delta-v point of view, but as your payload mass goes up, that gains less and less.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T21:05:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45155-Mass-optimal-engine-type-vs-delta-V-payload-and-min-TWR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45155-Mass-optimal-engine-type-vs-delta-V-payload-and-min-TWR\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sgt.
