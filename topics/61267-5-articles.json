I launch as many orange tanks (usually 5-7 empty) as I can in one go to LKO fitted with a few docking ports of each type, batteries and a couple of RTGs, some lights and storage for 1500 mono (emptied except for 50) and some RCS control. Next I launch some dorm space for Kerbals, maybe 10. Every craft launches to it with pretty much the same lifter so there is a variable amount of leftover fuel which is transferred to the station. The last stage of the lifter then detaches and has the capability to deorbit itself with seperatrons. The payload is then parked at the station until it is time for the mission, when it departs. It gives pilots a break (I like to think there is a small bar) and lets them rest up on their way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EuuAsL8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EuuAsL8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a while this gives me the ability to launch a much larger craft empty of fuel that will dock with the station and then carry on fully fueled.

The tug went back to Kerbin station after dropping off some fuel at Duna station.

Nothing wrong with that either - modern war planes would be un-flyable without computer controlled fly-by-wire systems.

For circ burns I\u0027ve learned to use them as guides only. Specifically, I set one up at my initial apo and pull prograde until I get a roughly circular orbit. I used to struggle to make this perfect but not anymore. What I do now is start the burn as per the node, when I get towards the end I throttle way down and watch the orbit in map mode. With a low throttle your new apo will rise nice and slowly and you can easily hit X at just the right time. To me this is much easier then it is to try to get the node just right (and then burn it exactly.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can now achieve perfect circular orbits every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also had some success with a related method for going to the mun.

I also burn a bit late. So if for example I set the node and get an encounter with an peri of 100k, and if it looks like moving the node a teeny bit to the right (clockwise around Kerbin) would help me get a lower peri, then rather than try to move the node that last tiny fraction (and blowing it) I\u0027ll just start my burn a bit late, which is the same as rotating the node a bit. Through trial and error you learn about how late to burn. Last night my peri per the node was about 150k, by starting my burn at the time of the node (rather than splitting it half before and half after) I got a peri of 30k. Again it\u0027s very helpful to watch your orbit while you\u0027re burning so you get a sense of what direction it\u0027s going, and if burning more or less will help or hurt.

That seems to be a tricky thing for a lot of people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Center of lift slightly behind center of mass. This is the spaceplane mantra. Learn it, love it, live it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your distribution of lift control is also critical.

Center of mass can be kept consistent throughout the flight. Just don\u0027t put any fuel in the central fuselage of your plane; mount the tanks to the side instead, perfectly level with center of mass. That\u0027s how commercial jets in the real world tend to do it, in fact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You can toggle intakes between open and closed. So set up an action group to toggle all intakes and all engines, and only use that to activate your rockets (and deactivate your jet engines).
