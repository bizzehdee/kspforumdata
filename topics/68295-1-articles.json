But a few hints and tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild in the spaceplane hangar if you want bilateral symmetry, in the VAB if you want radial symmetry. You can save a subassembly in one and load it in the other, letting you combine things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cubic Octagonal Strut is godly. You can basically attach anything to anything at any angle with it. And it\u0027s massless and dragless so won\u0027t throw your ship off balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe debug menu can be opened in the VAB/SPH (Alt\u002BF12, or Right Shift\u002BF12 for Linux players) and allows you to enable part clipping. This lets you freely put parts intersecting each other, giving you more design freedom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you aren\u0027t part clipping, sometimes it takes a few goes to get a part in place. Trying different orders can help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember you can use parts for purposes they weren\u0027t intended for. A classic example is clipping the tail connectors into the bottom of a fuel tank and mounting engines on them, which gives an elegant five-engine cluster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T01:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook at reference images of what others have done or some cool sci fi concept art and try to adapt those designs into your own style.
