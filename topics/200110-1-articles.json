Then I can Lock the ramp to that angle. Since the angle may differ for each location I land I can\u0027t ideally set a default angle. Also, the traverse rate \u002B manually adjusting the ramp\u00A0causes inadvertent movement of the vehicle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for considering!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
