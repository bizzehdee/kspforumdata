If there were dimmer, coloured lights like those used on aircraft (red= port/left, green=right/starboard) it\u0027d mark locations just as well without the glare and flare. (And if they\u0027re colour coded as above, it\u0027d help with orientation even more.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are already dimmer versions in-game on the batteries and reaction wheels, so it\u0027s doable; I just don\u0027t know how much of a hit the graphics engine would take by implementing brighter and user-placed versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(We can do without the anti-collision strobe, though, thank you very much.
