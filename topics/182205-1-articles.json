The world names remain consistent between home world settings, so a player could have multiple saves in a single KSP installation; one or more for each home world. This also saves the player from having multiple KSP installations, saving disk space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is what happens if someone imports a stock save file into a KSP installation with Alien Space Programs installed and Kerbin is the home world setting. Kerbin is still the second celestial body defined, but it is renamed internally to \u0022Bin.\u0022 As a result, an imported save will have contracts and milestones saved for Kerbin, but not for Bin. World-firsts such as \u0022We have entered orbit,\u0022 will re-trigger. Contracts tied to stock Kerbin won\u0027t load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve already tried searching and replacing text in a save file to work around this, and I\u0027m partially successful. I\u0027ve managed to preserve contracts by editing the body name from \u0022Kerbin\u0022 to \u0022Kerbin^n,\u0022 which is the stock localization text for Kerbin in en-us. Contracts that say, \u0022Kerbin at site xxxxx\u0022 seem to be preserved. But I haven\u0027t been able to avoid re-triggering world-firsts. Kerbals also seem to get double credit for activities at Kerbin / Bin if they\u0027ve done the activity before the import and do the activity again after the import.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat else should I edit in the save file to ensure a stock save can import into this system where the home world is \u0022Bin\u0022 internally?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
