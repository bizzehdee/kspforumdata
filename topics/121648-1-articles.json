They have to use lots and lots of parts and the resulting base lags like a *****, falls apart/breaks easily and is a pain to setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Every base looks like it was patched together with duct-tape out of shipwrecks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The base doesn\u0027t have any real utility, and this is probably the most important point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow what I\u0027m thinking about would be the ability to construct actual static buildings like the VAB and KSC or the kerbinside buildings/bases that would just sit there not eating any CPU-time but also they would serve as fully functional bases where you can build ships (using stored resources) and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese bases could have different upgrades or different modules and would be built/managed through a graphical interface and a top-down view like you would in a city building game or a strategy game, maybe even setting up possibly sophisticated production chains (like anno does) to get to the good stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery base could have a hive-view \u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A0 la XCOM allowing you to see the different modules, to build stuff etc and to manage your resources/power production/space or similar things (probably unnecessary, a top-down/global view would be enough). You could build ships directly on them using onsite/stored resources. You could build a runway if you want, or a very tall VAB or some lifesupport farms or other advanced buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing small, automated vehicles or construction modules you assign orders to collect building materials from the ground and then sit back and watch them build a base over time like you would see in a strategy game (or you collect the resources yourself, drive a building unit or some kind of vehicle with a build unit and initiate the process yourself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously I\u0027d still need to think of some game mechanics to make this interesting, to have some kind of long-term appeal, some real use for the bases. I\u0027m not a fan of the game\u0027s science system or the game\u0027s career mode (both I find rather unrewarding and all over the place), I think what the game ultimately needs is a real sense of conquest. You never really feel like you conquered anything even with the biggest base setup on a far-away planet. Or maybe opening up some new sandbox possibilities with the bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously I still have my hands full with scatterer and with my IRL job, so I won\u0027t be working on this anytime soon but I just wanted to get this idea out there and possibly discuss it with others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-25T14:00:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2015 02:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T00:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea.
