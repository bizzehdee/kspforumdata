(I\u0027ve yet to see an add-on package that I like, most seem too sci-fi esk for my tastes, and I enjoy playing within the limitations of the standard parts). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe keys to making this rocket: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Solid rocket motors have different attachment characteristics than liquid fuel tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You don\u0027t need to fire every component in your rocket if you set the \u0027fire time\u0027 to a stage after the point where they separate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I use three solid rocket segments that I never fire as \u0027structural components\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting with the main capsule, I have a decouple, two liquid tanks, liquid engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow this is a decouple, a tri coupler, three SAS modules, 6 liquid tanks and engines divided into three stacks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow attached to the sides of the previous stage are 3 solid rockets using side mounting brackets. Below each solid rocket is a tri coupler and three stacks of a SAS module, three liquid tanks, and a liquid engine. In the center, under the middle stage, is the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then used three of the new structural beams in the latest patch to bind the 12 engine stage together. It CAN launch without this binding mechanism, and you get some interesting oscillations, but it is very difficult to fly. With the structural members it flies quite easily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a total of: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12 Liquid Engines in the 1st stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 in the 2nd\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 in the 3rd\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(using traditional definitions, not the ones in this game) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing a similar mindset, and continuing to \u0027step up\u0027 with this mentality, you could build a \u0027pyramid rocket\u0027 like those envisioned by Heinlein and 1930s sci fi authors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present this rocket already has more than enough delta V to escape the Earth. If I shoot for orbit I usually get there with at least half to a third of the middle stage, and a full upper stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, was just posting as requested. Feel free to discuss or criticize at will ;-) \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Stargazer","CreatedById":5248,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-23T12:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, forgot to mention, there are parachutes above all three of the solid motors making the outer rocket stages recoverable, but the central core stages are disposed of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-23T15:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont understand why we cant attach liquid fuel tanks on the other side of the radial decoupler in the first place xD\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Stargazer","CreatedById":5248,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-23T17:14:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tim_Barrett\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tim_Barrett\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont understand why we cant attach liquid fuel tanks on the other side of the radial decoupler in the first place xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably for several reasons: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Most rockets only have strap on solids. There are SOME rockets with strap on liquids (mostly on \u0027theoretical\u0027 rockets like the Falcon 9 Heavy), but for the most part the only ones that are strapped on in the manner of the radial decoupler are solid. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Strap on liquids would take more complicated / heavy decouplers than their simpler, solid brethren. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - The game\u0027s in Alpha. Devs have lots of things to add, can\u0027t change everything at once. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - Most multiple liquid engine rockets are contained within a single shroud, with several very large fuel tanks cross feeding a number of engines, instead of having separate tanks for each engine. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Androsynth","CreatedById":7150,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-27T00:10:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, I clicked on this thread and was surprised to see what looks like the exact design I\u0027ve been working on! All stock parts, of course (wouldn\u0027t have it any other way). The rocket you\u0027re showcasing here is extremely stable if it\u0027s anything like what I\u0027ve built. There are a few key differences though. Also I\u0027ve expanded the design considerably, to the point where I\u0027m able to hit 40,000 meters and still have 28 full liquid fuel tanks to spend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion for you: do you find that the parachutes are powerful enough to actually save your rockets? Impact tolerance on those things is horrible, and they have a propensity to explode \u0026amp; take out their neighbors too. I find that a single parachute won\u0027t save much more than a single solid fuel casing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, how does your velocity look as you\u0027re making your way out of the atmosphere? How long is it taking to reach 40,000 meters? I don\u0027t know why but I\u0027ve been going with that as a benchmark for my rocket\u0027s performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
