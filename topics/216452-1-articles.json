Instead you would only use 10% of 30 tons to reach orbit, which is 3 tons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you increase your propellant flow you run out faster and you will need more than 10% propellant, which eventually means your spaceship is back to a large propellant tank with a tiny payload... which defies the entire point of a heavy scifi \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScifi ways of dodging waste heat: If you don\u0027t want to waste more propellant just add extra energy to propelling it. Normally this is limited by how much heat an engine can tolerate... but what if the reaction happened OUTSIDE the engine?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScifi Scenario: Scifi rocket nozzles are like super batteries that can store enough electrical energy to equal their mass/weight at maximum. They can convert the stored energy with 100% efficiency into tactile kinetic energy. In practical terms what this means is a liquid sprayer down the throat of each nozzle sprays propellant down the inner walls of the nozzle. Yet when the nozzles\u0027 tactile kinesis is activated the propellant squirted down them is moved so fast it ionizes and become a plasma plume as it exits the nozzles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain Question: It costs no waste heat to convert the stored electrical energy of the nozzles into tactile kinetic energy... because of scifi conceit. Yet I am also aware that moving propellant fast enough to heat it would ALSO heat the nozzle from the sheer heat the propellant is generating as it is accelerated out the nozzle. So have I dodged the waste heat bullet with my scifi conceit? Or have I just made the matter much worse? Meaning that the plasma plume is so hot it begins to melt the nozzles... which releases all their stored electrical energy at once with a blast that would wipe a small country off the face of the earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dunno.. I would like to think that the heat on a rocket nozzle from a plasma plume thrusty and efficient enough to burn 3 tons of propellant to orbit carrying 297 tons of propellant/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E could be managed with regenerative cooling but I dunno. Granted if we use multiple nozzles... like 16 you divide that heat by 16 so it\u0027s not as much. Or maybe it requires a hundred... I dunno.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr maybe 3 tons is just unrealistic and I would need to use more to reach orbit, like ten tons... and just refeuel in orbit with a fuel tanker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-13T09:42:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2023 09:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-13T13:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn early 23rd century, with the discovery of I-Can\u0027t-Believe-It\u0027s-not-Paper (digital, cheaper, better alternative to paper), the world finally went almost completely paperless, effectively collapsing the inkjet cartrige market almost overnight.

Another propellant saver is a slower than light vacuum translation drive which translates or moves space past the ship at the same rate of it\u0027s current acceleration. So just do a\u00A0 quick 3g burn, shut it off, and let the translation drive let you slow warp at 3g.
