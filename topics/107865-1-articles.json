She doesn\u0027t fly pretty, but she\u0027ll get the job done, and bring 16 passengers along for the ride. (Alternatively, you can replace the cabin with a cargo bay.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PpCoXsQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PpCoXsQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/Jovus/Trial-Mk-3-SSTO.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/Jovus/Trial-Mk-3-SSTO.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fly to space, hit the staging button for take-off. Leave the runway at around 80m/s, promptly put the gear up and pull into a 30 degree climb. Continue climbing until you get to 10km, then level off until you reach ~ Mach 1. (Probably more like Mach 0.93 or something; don\u0027t sweat exactitudes.) Once you get there, climb to ~14km without losing too much speed. Then, enter a ~10 degree dive to punch through the Mach barrier. Once you\u0027re going something like Mach 1.4 or 1.5, pull up and begin climbing again. Around 18km, level off and ride the power curve. You\u0027ll start to overheat from atmospheric effects; that\u0027s fine. Once you hit Mach 3.5 or so, pull up gently until you get to 20km, then ride the air level until your airbreathers die down to around 400kN of thrust. (You do have a thrust readout, right?) Finally, switch to rockets by pressing 1 (which also toggles the air intakes) and pull up sharply to get above the drag. Level out once your Ap is around 45 or 50 for a more efficient right to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWARNING: this is intended as a proof of concept, not as a workhorse. In order to become a truly useful spaceplane, it needs some modifications, such as solar panels, and probably a little tweaking of the flight surface placement to aid stability. It is my hope that if you\u0027re having trouble using Mk 3 parts for SSTO spaceplanes, this design will offer you a starting point for getting it right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_2","CreatedById":63827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T14:02:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice no-nonsense SSTO.

For one thing, there\u0027s going to be an LFO imbalance for most flight paths. For another, you\u0027re right about the intakes and possibly the wheels. I just threw this together in about 45 minutes to see if it could be done after seeing that people were having trouble with it, and thought I\u0027d show the fruits of my labor in case it helps anyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were making this thing serious, I\u0027d probably also put a smidge of dihedral on the wings. It tends to show a bit of corkscrew instability at high altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the canards, I think even in an optimized design I\u0027d keep them. For one, they add some pitch authority, and I\u0027m not comfortable just leaving that to the horizontal stabilizer on a beast this big. For another, they make it look like it has eyebrows. Everything needs a small touch of flair when it can get away with it, no?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
