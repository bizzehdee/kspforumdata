I got hooked on space when I visited the Apollo exhibit at the London Science Museum. Tom Stafford\u0027s Apollo 10 command module \u0022Charlie Brown\u0022 is on display there. It\u0027s the only Apollo command module on public display outside the United States. They also have a British Black Arrow satellite launcher on display.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t remember how old I was, but I know I was old enough to read, since the first thing I did when I got back was to grab load of books on space travel from my local library. They mentioned a base on Mars during the 1980s (1980s? That\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Enow!\u003C/strong\u003E) They also mentioned something called Project Orion, which was a means of travelling to other stars and was powered by something called \u0022new killer bombs\u0022. I wasn\u0027t sure what those were, so I asked one of the really smart kids at school how they worked and he said they were powered by \u0022weapons grade urine\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the books were out of date and didn\u0027t mention that the Apollo programme had long since been torn to shreds by the Nixon administration. Undeterred, I watched the launch of the \u0022school teacher in space\u0022 aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger on BBC Children\u0027s Newsround. Space exploration was apparently so important, that they have to send school teachers just like my school teacher to teach us kids how to be astronauts. Obviously, astronautics was something that every school kid had to know how to do. Afterwards, it was made clear that space exploration was\u003Cstrong\u003E so important\u003C/strong\u003E, that the astronauts and the school teacher were gladly prepared to \u003Cstrong\u003Edie\u003C/strong\u003E to make sure it happens.
