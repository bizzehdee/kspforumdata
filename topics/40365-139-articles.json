You WOULD indeed get power with the set up depicted in the diagram, you just wouldn\u0027t get a whole lot without using insane numbers of solar panels. Look through the last dozen or so pages where people have been discussing a MJ-\u0026gt;EC/EC-\u0026gt;MJ converter part. The size/number of solar panels you need gets ridiculous rapidly when you start comparing solar power generated in Kerbin orbit and the power output of even the un-upgraded nuke reactors. Also, I think a lot of people exaggerate the nuke reactor\u0027s issue of needing to be refueled. They last for years at low power and the smaller ones last for years even at full power. You can throw a small docking port anywhere on the nukesat and periodically dock a maintenance ship with a science lab on board and reprocess the fuel. Or you make the reactor/generator pair able to separate and just dock a new pair when the current one runs out of fuel. Or you can just throw a brand new sat up into orbit. Or in the upcoming 0.8, you can dock a crewed vessel with the nuke sat and just EVA and quickly take out the old fuel and put new fuel in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally find it much easier to just lob a half dozen nuclear power sats every couple game years. I will occasionally do a maintenance flight because I enjoy the realistic aspect of having to do maintenance on a satellite. Whenever I do use microwave power, by the time my constellation of nukesats needs to be replaced/refueled, I\u0027ve moved on technologically. It\u0027s a very niche technology for me and I admit I don\u0027t often take advantage of it as often as I could.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the picture of my 33 Kerbal, 16 science lab, super science point generating space station. Been on station for almost 2 years and I\u0027ve only had to reprocess reactor fuel once. There is a docking port on top so I can bring in supplies or whatnot as needed (LOF and in 0.8, uranium fuel). The amount of science this thing generates is insane. I sent it out to Moho with just basic radiators and reactors and generators. Upgraded those parts as I unlocked (rapidly) the tech. All 16 labs are operating at full power and both reactors are still only burning at 30% each. I had to attach an additional module with some extra radiators until I was able to upgrade the ones that came on it, but other than that issue, it has worked brilliantly for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nUacXrw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nUacXrw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eadrom","CreatedById":91728,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T14:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MilkyPandolu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MilkyPandolu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey, sorry if this has been solved before (I\u0027ve done some searching and haven\u0027t found anything) but I\u0027ve been unable to get this mod working with my game at all, I\u0027ve reinstalled the game, removed all other mods and did a bit of troubleshooting but I can\u0027t get it to work, it crashes my game at the first loading screen. it goes until \\WarpPlugin\\Spaces\\sci\\internal\\crewtestinternals then either freezes, crashes or comes up with a runtime error.
