That is the experiment that come to mind right now but I can certainly update with the others i have had problems with later. I should also note that the crash was happening before installing that mod as well. Need to launch KSP and look through all the experiments again but the vanilla experiments seem to be the ones that I have this crash with the least of all though it has happened. This crash also only happens when the experiment window is opening, before it is displayed, not when trying to transmit.

I\u0027m currently trying out if making the lab access the relays will help (before it only had direct connection to kerbin), but i was really hoping to be able to make direct connection for relaying science.\n\nEDIT: The whole thing does work when the lab can access relays, so that part is confirmed. still, this is more about the direct connections\n\nI understand from CN\\_Warren\u0027s post that without a relay connection, the transmission is not supposed to work. So it comes down to this: are direct connections between two craft supported or not? and if they are, have i encountered a bug here?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, CN\\_Warren said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@\u003Cfont style=\u0022vertical-align:inherit;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont style=\u0022vertical-align:inherit;\u0022\u003Eboeserwolf93\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/184272-boeserwolf93/) \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The plug-in is a relay, but this spacecraft does not seem to be connected to any relay satellite.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The spacecraft antenna should have a short, at least one relay connected to an antenna.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This short antenna should be 100% green, which will be better transmitted.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It is true that the repeater antenna is connected to the repeater antenna, and it seems that your distant spacecraft is connected to Kerbin, so for now you do not have to relay.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Please note the information in the game wikipad.

Direct connections can also work through relays, so the source vessel connects to a relay (or multiple relays), then the relay connects to the vessel with only a direct connection antenna.\n\nIt can sometimes be hard to know if there is or should be a direct connection between vessels, as those aren\u0027t shown in the map view network graph.\n\nIt\u0027s also possible the vessels close to Kerbin might not always work as expected. A lot of the network code seems to work on the assumption that you are trying to find a connection between a vessel and Kerbin, so the system might be getting tripped up because it keeps finding Kerbin in the network graph, which is considered an end-point connection. That shouldn\u0027t be a problem, but it could be; it can be hard to test all of the various possible network connection possibilities."},{"CreatedByName":"LEGIONBOSS","CreatedById":139013,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-12T01:45:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, DMagic said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@LEGIONBOSS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/139013-legionboss/) It should work fine, the docking port mechanics of the flexible ports are basically the same as the stock ports.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What does the flexible port say when you right click on it?
