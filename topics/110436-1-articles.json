The real \u0022top tier\u0022 is, as you say, the model just below with all the hardware/tech/extras and a little less skimmed off the top for margin (profit).\n\nPS, love my Note 3. It\u0027s great. No real problems with it at all. Except it\u0027s battery is not lasting quite as long as before, no idea if I\u0027ve a runaway app or let the battery get a bit overworked.

I personally really like the 5.0 UI. Clean, fast and does what I need it to. I\u0027ve had two iPhones, but the moment I got an Xperia Z1 I knew there was no going back to iOS.

Great looking phone with a big display, nice camera and fast CPU, plus it\u0027s IP58 rated so you don\u0027t have to worry about it breaking if you use it in the rain etc (but the screen may do funny things when there\u0027s water on it).

No product is pointless, it is just your opinion that it is pointless, and your opinion is not relevant.\n\nJust because there is a gold version of the Watch(Edition) doesn\u0027t mean Apple is a terrible company. I fail to see how this sentence of yours was relevant in any way.\n\nI use iOS because it is polished, built with care and has the largest app library, and is very welcoming for developers.\n\nI use Apple products because they feel premium, they make you look more impressionable, they are of the highest standard and are supported for a long time. Cheap Android phones or tablets impress no one, have tons of compatibility issues, and are overly complicated for something as simple as a phone.\n\nApple has always been the innovator on the market. This post will be too big to name all of the innovations and influences they created. Most of Android and other OS\u0027s that we see today have their roots from Apple.\n\nWindows was ripped from Mac. Android was ripped from iOS. IA like S voice were ripped from Siri.\n\nCapacitive touch screens in phones were ripped from the iPhone. Tablets were ripped from the iPad.\n\nSorry but Apple was always the obvious leader here. \n\nQuestion to OP: why is there a multi-choice poll when it should obviously be a single choice one?\n\nAnd why are the names of companies and OS\u0027s not capitalized?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T14:28:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 02:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceXray**"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T14:43:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I use Apple products because they feel premium, they make you look more impressionable\n\nWhen you buy a phone to feel better you might have issues..."}]}
