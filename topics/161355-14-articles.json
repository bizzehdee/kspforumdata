People are really attached to KSP. I have been playing since June 2013 and I have put in literally thousands of hours (some weeks more than 40). I have never found it boring and I have played career a new way each time and redesigned craft over and over. This is more than just a game for many of us. I was born in 1959 and grew up in awe and wonder of the space program and what has been accomplished since. This is a way for me to participate in all that in a fanciful way. To imagine what it was like to deal with many problems associated with creating the vehicles and the amazing amount of planning involved as well as understanding the real life orbital mechanics in a way that was not available before. Many computer games are a diversion; this for many of us is a passion. SQUAD and Harvester made this possible and many others have carried on the work and participated in creating features and mods. KSP is important to some of us in a way that many people might not understand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it sure doesn\u0027t hurt that my REAL last name is Manley.

While I am unsure at what the business relation is now (T2 purchased the IP to Kerbal, and SQUAD is to continue development as a\u00A03rd party,\u00A0SQUAD is a wholly/partly owned subsidiary, etc), even under the best case scenario, this\u00A0comes with some very significant new consideration, such as their existence within the T2 environment (be aware not to compete/bump with release dates of other titles/updates to titles) and T2\u0027s overall goals and strategies. T2\u00A0made an investment in KSP/SQUAD, and any company worth their salt will not let an investment run wild and hope it pays out in the long run; they will put checks and balances in place with periodical monitoring to make sure their investment is on track for returns (the red tape). Remember, while T2 makes their business making games in the broader sense, as a for profit company, they are legally obligated to have their shareholder\u0027s interest at the forefront. While very few companies are dumb enough to burn bridges with and warrant hate from their consumer base (*cough* EA *cough*)\u00A0, we as gamers/fans are no longer the only audience SQUAD must be mindful of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reiterate, I love KSP. I want to believe this will for the benefit of both SQUAD and T2. This is not me trying to be a downer or negative, just adding a bit of realism to this ordeal and putting my thoughts into words. If this event HAD to absolutely happen, T2 is by far the best option out there as far as AAA publishers. As someone who is adult enough to learn to back/support based on quality and consumer respect instead of hype, T2 is one of the few game companies i stand behind still. Been a fan of GTA since early PS2 days, love Bioshock/Borderlands and play Civ avidly. This deal will offer resources SQUAD would have been hard pressed to come by on their own, which ideally will turn into a better KSP product/experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end you can throw me into the \u0022mixed feelings\u0022 population.

Those stories are but a few cases in a large publishing house.

A large publishing house taking over does seem to have its benefits with its larger budget,\u00A0but at the same time TT has had a spotty history which reflects in some of its games. The thing that TT must, and I mean must understand is that KSP has a big community and has high visibility to the point it has gotten the attention of NASA,\u00A0the ESA, and Space X. With that, TT has to understand it is make or break under the scrutiny of the aerospace industry.\u00A0Even though this is not a level of oversight or finance backing that these organisations are involved, but in much the way of reputation as the scientific and aerospace community is very strict and may\u00A0frown upon a poorly constructed project in such a way that it could hurt TT games and possibly effect the opinions of some of their other partners.\u00A0It\u00A0is a absolute feat that KSP has had such recognition from such organisations, and from my understanding, from engineers to professors\u00A0that the aerospace community has watched KSP\u00A0carefully. Not only the aerospace industry but also especially those in the modding community (a huge backbone to KSP\u0027s success).\u00A0Should TT games treat KSP as a cash grab\u00A0like some of their titles, the effect could ripple in a way that financial support from investors could curtail. KSP is used as a teaching aid, a way for some to relax with a physics sand box game, for some to simulate and experiment with ideas, and for me to keep some of my perishable skills while having fun.\u00A0The visibility in the community is such that if\u00A0dismissed could very well cast a vast shadow over TT games. This is in my analytical\u00A0opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that said, the best of luck to TT games.
