The Heracles Project was started to create a defense ship for operation in kerbin SOI to defend against possible enemies (you know who you are). But it failed horribly. As expected of course. The engineers got the battlecruiser part down...but not the launcher part. Here is a documentation of the cruisers maiden flight:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zp8yHGo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zp8yHGo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first set of boosters fall in slow, laggy motion off temstars amazing supernova.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WRXtxNI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WRXtxNI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShortly after (random time warp thing in the way...?) the cruiser decided to separate from the launcher, and then the launcher responded by running in to the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1zwOUZB.png\u0022 alt=\u00221zwOUZB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChaos ensued as the mission controllers franticly tried to find a self destruct button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jAM3fvM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jAM3fvM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately there as none...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GntyYbA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GntyYbA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end the pilot on board died, as did 6 other kerbals on the ground. 23 people were injured.
