Still do them. However, a lot of what you\u0027re going to produce will probably go on YouTube, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with YouTube is if you don\u0027t deploy to YouTube in 16:9 exactly, you get stuck in a 4:3 ratio (or stretched by their systems, which usually looks horrid). Most current monitors are a form of 16:10, which means full-screen gets wonky unless you\u0027re going to actually adjust your desktop. Depending on your Video Editing Software will depend on exactly how much you can adjust that prior to compression and export. Either you\u0027re trimming or squishing your game visuals though, no matter how you approach it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of that, I recommend you get Bandicam or another recorder that you can set to an exact area of the desktop. Bandicam is relatively cheap (full copy was $40 for a single PC license) and works quite well. It also can be set to exact settings (1280x720, for example) so you can size your game window into the recording window exactly. This will let you take out the game window borders by dragging them around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of this will depend on exactly what you\u0027re intending to do with things. In general though I recommend you try a bunch of different software with their trial packages and see which you\u0027re most comfortable with during recording and post-production.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"natonator200","CreatedById":129900,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T15:24:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, thanks for your advice. here\u0027s my conclusion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObs: i got a \u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003ECould not initialize DirectX10\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u0022 error message\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMirrlilis Action: looks awesome, demo sucks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efraps: didn\u0027t try\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebaditcam: didnt try\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDXtory: works great because i figured out how to remove the water mark(my personal choice)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T03:46:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use FRAPS for raw capture (running in 1600x900 window mode) then resize down to 720p and convert to x264/mkv using Handbrake before uploading to Youtube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/sR69tmy4qSY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlightly fuzzy due to the resize step, but still legible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
