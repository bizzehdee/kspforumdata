Let me illustrate.\n\nBring the Wayback Machine to 1969 to The Love Bug, when we all get to meet the rascally car Herbie. Now in the big race in the movie, one of Herbie\\\u0027s wheels is seen rolling away by Jim and Tennesse and they think the wheel looks mighty familiar. It is familiar because it is one of Herbie\\\u0027s wheels that had just come loose. This happens until all of Herbie\\\u0027s wheels come loose, thanks to the sabotage of Thorndyke, a competitor.\n\nSo, I come here to ask if any of you have had a Herbie moment during a mission, when you might see a module or part come flying by and think to yourself that it looked very familiar, and then turns out to be a part of the current rocket that had come loose on its own. Now I did say parts from your current rocket, but stories about how you see a part fly by from a previous mission that looks like something that should still be on your rocket giving you a bit of a panic moment would be just as fun to share."},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T05:49:20Z","Content":"Plane attack on debris, 5th try.

The craft continued spinning, and the other wing his the one that had broken off.\n\nResult: No wings.\n\nMission: Successful. The craft was low enough that the cockpit and a small section of fuselage remained intact. You know, any crash you can walk away from."},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T20:11:20Z","Content":"Yep. Jettisoned a stage, used RCS to move away rom it, did a few minor orbital adjustments and saw one part of the jettisoned stage wizz past - and then got hit by the other. Not *exactly* a Herbie moment because the stages had been deliberately detached, but similar."},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T22:54:59Z","Content":"I experienced such a moment in real life, and it was perhaps the most frightning thing I ever saw. Fortunately it wasn\\\u0027t from my own car, but the wheel of a boat trailer blew out in front of me and seconds later broke off entirely. As in that Herbie scene, with the weight of the trailer now detached, the wheel actually accellerated while bouncing across four lanes of a busy freeway. It then deflected off the center barrier and bounced back across the freeway, including once mere feet in front of my car, before it rolled out of sight behind a gap in the sound wall. It was near miraculous that it didfn\\\u0027t hit any cars in all that distance.\n\nAnyway, that\\\u0027s my story."},{"CreatedByName":"Thiel","CreatedById":13126,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-15T10:18:11Z","Content":"I lost my decent stage that way once.

However, today I was working on setting a land speed record with Tosh\u0027s CART pack, which resulted in such a moment during the testing phases. My finger slipped off the canard control, which were angled down to keep the vehicle from taking off, resulting in half of it splitting off and flying past me. \n\n\u003E ![screenshot42e.png](http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/9521/screenshot42e.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-01T10:26:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2012 10:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Rich**"},{"CreatedByName":"Anachronda","CreatedById":23187,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T05:10:35Z","Content":"As I\\\u0027ve mentioned in other threads, my big problem with rendezvous is patience.

On the way to orbit I lost all but one of the ZO2 PowerTech solar panels much to my mild horror. However after a brief moment in Kerbin\\\u0027s shadow while in orbit, there were so many ZO2 tanks onboard the vessel that the lost ZO2 was relatively little so I figured one solar panel was enough. I oriented my ship prograde and was about to activate MechJeb\\\u0027s Mun transfer maneuver (I\\\u0027m perfectly capable of doing it myself but MechJeb is easier) when I noticed a part drifting by that just happened to look like my current vehicle\\\u0027s engine... somehow it had come loose and the vessel became stranded in LKO.\n\nA daring rescue mission ensued that ended in complete success thanks to MechJeb\\\u0027s new Rincomp integration that allowed me to perform my first rendezvous ever. I was pretty proud when the rescue capsule touched down intact. In fact I still am. Can\\\u0027t wait for real missions to be implemented."}]}
