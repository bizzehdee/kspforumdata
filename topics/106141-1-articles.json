It seriously is the weirdest thing I\u0027ve ever seen. First we thought it was a coincidence, but when we kept a close eye on it we found this really was the case. It only worked when we passed within a meter or so. Any further had no effect at all. Also, it wasn\u0027t consistent; you could pass it ten times without the thing turning itself off... completely random.

I could build you a movement detector with an antenna, a few NPN transistors, resistors and a capacitor, that will detect the movement of large conductive objects (like people) around the antenna. Humidity in the air will change the amount of charge gathered by the antenna.\n\nI\u0027d assume the radio was doing something similar, although it\u0027s hard to tell what exactly was going on inside that was turning it off."},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T22:03:36Z","Content":"ive had hard drives that have appeared to die chug along for years without actually failing. some time before i switched to ssds i had a 1tb drive to lock up for long periods for no reason. reinstalling the os didnt help, but the problem went away when i removed the drive and replaced it with an older one. however when i put the \u0022dieing\u0022 drive into another machine it ran fine. lo and behold it is still useful enough for use as an axillary backup and also support a few linux partitions as well. i haven\u0027t had a problem with it in years and it still chugs along just fine. ive had this happen to other sata hard drives and ssds as well. \n\ni want to attribute it to faulty sata controllers because in most cases a failing hard drive will work without glitch in another rig. but when you fall back to k.i.s.s. it makes me wonder if the cables are to blame. so ive come to the conclusion that sata cables and connectors really dont hold up well to a lot of plug/unplug cycles and will become loose and can creep off the connector entirely of its own devices. a simple application of the \u0027wiggle it\u0027 technique and all systems nominal. you might want to question the sata cables that come with your mobo and spend some cash on higher quality cables. but ive saved enough of those surplus cables to apply the use once and throw away practice and the problems with sata drives quickly went away. never had these kind of problems with earlier ide drives. \n\nive heard of situations where applying too much torque to a hdd screw can damage the drive, destroying the precision tolerances needed for a modern hard drive to function. ive always favored hand tools even when i was a system builder. but ive seen people use big power drills to install a hard drive and wonder what they were thinking. its a computer, not a house. at least use the torque setting to prevent over tightening. that sound of mashing planetary gears and over torqued motors always makes me cringe. \n\na general rule of thumb is if a piece of hardware fails, remove it immediately. depending on whats wrong with it, it can ruin other parts over time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T22:05:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 10:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke**"},{"CreatedByName":"Flymetothemun","CreatedById":17689,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T22:51:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ~snip~\n\u003E \n\u003E i want to attribute it to faulty sata controllers because in most cases a failing hard drive will work without glitch in another rig. but when you fall back to k.i.s.s. it makes me wonder if the cables are to blame. **so ive come to the conclusion that sata cables and connectors really dont hold up well to a lot of plug/unplug cycles and will become loose and** **can creep off the connector entirely of its own devices.** **a simple application of the \u0027wiggle it\u0027 technique and all systems nominal.** you might want to question the sata cables that come with your mobo and spend some cash on higher quality cables. but ive saved enough of those surplus cables to apply the use once and throw away practice and the problems with sata drives quickly went away. never had these kind of problems with earlier ide drives. \n\u003E \n\u003E ~snip~\n\nI\u0027m sorry, but when I read this this came to mind.\n\n![SATA.jpg](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MdnSVV0SU8A/VUKxhiTcaFI/AAAAAAAAAmg/4cBAYYzi3AU/s534/SATA.jpg)\n\nOnce again, I\u0027m sorry."},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:56:26Z","Content":"i dont blame you, those things are evil. never had one problem with the older ribbon cables that these things replaced. i think the sata specs were designed with servers in mind, so you could have trayless hot swap bays with their own backplane. general consumer grade cables get the short end of the stick. but its ok, i expect everything to go mSata eventually, as i noticed mSata slots starting to pop up in mobos lately. nothings better than eliminating cables entirely."}]}
