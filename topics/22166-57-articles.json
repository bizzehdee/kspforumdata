In the game, there are really two separate universes, the normal size one, and another one that is 6,000 times smaller. This smaller universe is called ScaledSpace.

The ScaledSpace model of Kerbin is the one present on both the title screen and the map view. So, if a geodesic Kethane map is drawn onto the ScaledSpace model of Kerbin, the map will appear on the title screen, and the map view, as the same ScaledSpace Kerbin is used in both instances.
