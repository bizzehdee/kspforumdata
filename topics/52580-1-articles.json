I didn\u0027t get my goal, with every stage only having a TWR of 1.6. The only problem is that the launch clamps just fall off when I try launching it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HH7nmgw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HH7nmgw.jpg\u0022\u003E. The rocket weighs 726.39t, has 12k Delta-v, and has 24 launch clamps to try and keep it on, which don\u0027t work. Surely they should be stronger, as they are attached to the floor?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T08:36:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry adding a second ring of clamps, above first one.

Looking at yours OP, lower your rocket so it\u0027s just above the pad and raise the launch clamps. Like any other part the launch clamp attachments experience physics and will break off if poorly placed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T12:09:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dooz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dooz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELaunch clamps are pretty strong it really depends are were you place them\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELower the rocket until the engines almost touch the ground.
