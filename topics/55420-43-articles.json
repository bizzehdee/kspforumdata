New game, career mode, .90 install, Toolbar 1.7.8. I have a bunch of mods installed, but some of them deactivate themselves until you upgrade a required building. In the Space Center and Tracking station, I had the generic icon for the toolbar. I clicked on it to configure visible buttons. The only one that was available at that time (apparently) was Trajectories. But Trajectories auto-hides itself on the Space Center screen always, and auto-hides on the Tracking station until you upgrade it. As soon as I selected it to be on the toolbar, the toolbar disappeared and I can\u0027t get it back on either the Space Center or Tracking Station scenes. Screenshots forthcoming (I need to sleep for a bit). Suggestions on how to recover from this? And perhaps (for idiots like me) there is the possibility of a \u0022restore defaults\u0022 setting that when clicked in *any* scene, resets the toolbar in *every* scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny, at first I didn\u0027t see a reason for this with the stock toolbar at the top of the screen.

Toolbar is back in all scenes now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I believe this is a bug. If a mod is set to always hide its button in a certain scene, and the user selects that as the only visible button in the toolbar, the toolbar disappears with no in-game way to recover it. My suggestion (as a player, not a coder) would be to change the interface to keep the generic button visible if no other visible buttons are selected.
