In my opinion space flight game without axial tilts is very defective and I would do it from very start, when planets are monochromatic spheres and ships are cubes.

That\u0027s not necessarily a bad thing, but those kinds of solutions can tend to be a little buggy, which is why I\u0027d be hoping they do a thorough job of it when they get around to coding axial tilt.

What you expect in the circumstances and what happens invariably tend to be ever so slightly different. Much better, in my opinion, to fix it thoroughly and implement it as a core game function where it doesn\u0027t need to be fudged.
