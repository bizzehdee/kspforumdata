planetary craft designed for smaller missions between worlds.\u00A0 It comes with mining and refining capabilities to keep it flying, twin Nerve engines for longevity and efficiency, a rear docking port from drop tanks and small cargo or for bringing it along with larger craft.\u00A0 It has a crew capacity of 6, but only really needs two to be fully effective, a pilot and an engineer.\u00A0 It\u0027s also equipped with 8 airbrakes and 4 parachute for atmospheric descent.\u00A0 Here it is with it\u0027s launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022

would with any other lander.\u00A0 Keeping the nose pointed retrograde while landing, so coming down tail first.\u00A0 The engines will be enough to land you in most locations with no need for the airbrakes or parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna landing:\u00A0 Duna is a special place that requires it\u0027s own landing profile.\u00A0 You start your entry like you would for any atmosphere lacking world.\u00A0 Tail first.\u00A0 Use the engines to slow yourself down as much as possible.\u00A0 As you enter the atmosphere, deploy the airbrakes to help slow the craft down and conserve a little fuel.\u00A0 Depending on where you land, you may or may not get any use out of the parachutes...\u00A0 Even with the chutes deployed, the thin atmosphere of Duna means they are not enough to land with, you\u0027ll need to use the engines on the indignation to help with landing.\u00A0 If you like, you can even just land using the engines alone, but at a slightly higher delta-V cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin/Laythe landing:\u00A0 For atmospheric landing, treat the craft like a space plane with horrible aerodynamics.\u00A0 As you start entering the atmosphere, deploy the airbrakes.\u00A0 Point the craft to prograde so your flying in nose first, then using a little help from the RCS if needed, bring up the nose so that your pointed 10 - 15 degrees above prograde(nose up position).\u00A0 The nose up position will help the craft slow down faster.\u00A0 As the craft bites into the atmosphere, carefully manage the nose up orientation keeping it at or below 15 degrees up until your speed has dropped to at least 1,100m/s, preferably slower.\u00A0 At this point, bring the nose down a little to keep the craft under control.\u00A0 At some point, the craft will probably try to slide out of position, fight it.\u00A0 The craft getting out of position and/or trying to flip inverted is not bad, but fighting it helps with braking and will slow down the craft a bit quicker.\u00A0 In the thicker atmosphere, you can try flying the Indignation like a space plane, but it\u0027s aerodynamics are bad and it\u0027s not going to produce much lift.\u00A0 Once you\u0027ve got your speed down to a safe speed, deploy your chute and get the craft facing tail first.\u00A0 Be sure to deploy the landing gear before landing as well.\u00A0 It helps a little. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022

landing: You should be able to land the craft the same as you would for Kerbin Laythe, but speed is going to be a huge issue here.\u00A0 Eve has much higher gravity, and that relates to higher orbital speeds.\u00A0 So finding a way to bleed off as much speed as possible is key if you dare to attempt an Eve landing with this craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo increase its range, I\u0027ve included the fuel module from the defunct Octopus tug.\u00A0 Adding one tank to the indignation should get you around 900 additional delta-V.\u00A0 A second should give you another 600-700, and so on.\u00A0 These fuel modules are simple and fairly cheap(they can be made cheaper by ditching the rcs and drone core) and are made to be docked with the craft in orbit.\u00A0 Use them wisely and leave them in orbit when you try landing, unless you want to soften the landing zone with debree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you enjoy this craft.\u00A0 It is the first craft I\u0027ve been able to make that can fly between planets and I
