systems designer on multiple previous projects.\u00A0 Beyond that, I also considered the needs of a variety of different player types, trying to envision features that would please them best without breaking the bank on dev costs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the design was written, it included various amounts of scoping at the level of the entire design - what features could be cut if we didn\u0027t hit them - and within each documented feature - stretch goals that I\u0027d hope we meet that even if they were not met, would not invalidate the entire feature.\u00A0 I tried to include features where if the engineers were behind, the artists could just work on something that did not need engineering time to inject into the game, and vice versa if the art team was behind, to introduce a level of elasticity to the scheduling.\u00A0 Of course, this was coupled by great effort from the dev team, and them working with me to understand the scope \u0026amp; effort behind each feature involved.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is a good general principle for any level of work on building a game - not putting the cart before the horse, validating assumptions on what you can and can\u0027t do, and building off of work you\u0027ve decided is a key early priority for technical and/or gameplay reasons and then moving on from there.\u00A0 \u00A0 This is something I learned to do from working in the industry for a couple of decades and seeing the good, the bad and the ugly on development processes at a range of studios.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can introduce huge inefficiencies to the overall development process when you deviate from good game design \u0026amp; development practices.\u00A0 You can have developers complete work that needs to be thrown away or heavily modified later because you put the cart before the horse, or bet on something being finished and had your art team work on it while the engineering team didn\u0027t get to it.\u00A0 You can create designs that please a small portion of your target audience, or just yourself, that don\u0027t work for a broader audience and can\u0027t be tested until the last minute when its too late to adjust them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeyond that - you can burn out your staff by whipsawing them between different targets or making off-the-cuff adjustments due to poor design \u0026amp;

Especially the last line is what encapsulates a lot of the responsibility you have when you\u0027re in a leadership position. The higher you go, the more you lose the privilege of saying it\u0027s someone else\u0027s job to do this or that. You need to know your limits and especially you need to recognize what it is that you don\u0027t know and be humble about that. Most of all if you choose to commit to doing something you\u0027re not sure can be achieved, then it\u0027s 100% on you if that fails. And even if something just goes wrong and there was nothing you could have done about it, as a leader it\u0027s still your responsibility and nobody else\u0027s. Sometimes things go bad in multiple ways (which was clearly the case with KSP2) and all you have left is to choose the manner in which you fail. It can be incredibly unfair at times but it comes with the role.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for Nate, I\u0027m a little less harsh on him now after watching the video but I think he should have known he was going to fail and choose a better way to go about it. But he chose dishonesty over integrity and in the end it doesn\u0027t matter how much of the failure can be attributed to him, everyone who wears the title of a director or a manager is at least partially responsible, fair or not. After all the real damage was suffered by everyone in the studio who lost their jobs in an already precarious job market.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocoscacao","CreatedById":225696,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-27T08:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224393245\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224924\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716785067\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107035\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022moeggz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, moeggz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbeing sold by the guy who now is known to be willing to lie to get you to buy products\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUh... ain\u0027t that the truth for every salesman?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
