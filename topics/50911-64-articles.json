I\u0027m very early into a new career save with a lot of hard-mode mods, including KCT. The odd thing is, this symptom only crops up on \u0022real\u0022 launch attempts and not on simulation attempts. (I\u0027ve already posted on that thread with this issue.) Could CollisionFX be a culprit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bring my question here because my symptom seems to be connected with KJR physics load delay. This is my first kerballed launch, with a thrust-limited SRB-Hammer. I\u0027ve tried just straight nozzle-on-the-ground, propped up by tailfins, and moored by a FASA Redstone launch clamp. The results are the same -- during physics load into the flight scene, my craft\u0027s collision mesh bounces off that of the Tier1 Launchpad terrain. Usually this results in popping up 5-10m into the air, which often causes the SRB to explodify when it lands but not always. Can\u0027t stage-activate or context-menu-activate the engine until well after I\u0027m re-landed (which triggers an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101801-Achievements-1-7-0-Earn-145-achievements-while-playing-%28KSP-25%29-%2812-2-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAchievement\u003C/a\u003E which is a problem because I can\u0027t activate SAS until after I have control access again. A few times I ended up subterranean, and thrust doesn\u0027t seem to work when the nozzle is embedded into the terrain.
