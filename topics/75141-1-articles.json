Add a proper water instead of just flat texture - flat texture works from an orbital distance, but the closer you get - the worse it becomes. At some distances you can clearly see tiling, which is... horrible. Feels like a cheap game from \u002790s. It\u0027d basically require 2 shaders - one for distant water (say: 1000m\u002B) which will be basically a flat surface with little bit of mirroring (reflective diffuse?), and another for up-close water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Add some god-rays - cheap, quick, makes game look much better, though it will look unnatural once the ship gets in a low sun orbit. But it\u0027ll still be much better than nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Add some normal map specular shaders for certain, selected elements of a ship. Most obvious one being solar panels and a glass on electric lights but it\u0027d work with parts covered in a golden foil - for example LV-909 Liquid Fuel Engine. Pure specular shader can also be applied to all of the windows - it\u0027ll give you an illusion that they\u0027re reflective under certain angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course - all of these should be purely optional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that these are just stock shaders included in Unity and ideas for changes that require minimal amount of work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor something more time-taking they could go for implementing cube maps that would depend on an orbit and based on that - create proper reflective surfaces. Add on top of that normal maps to all of the elements and suddenly KSP would make a huge leap forward in terms of visuals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Explorator","CreatedById":75632,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T18:28:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with everyone, the shaders that work with models are really all that we need, personally if they do add it it should be last\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
