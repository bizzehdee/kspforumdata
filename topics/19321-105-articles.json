If the control input changes from one constant to another, the system will reach 67% of the commanded deflection 1 time constant after the command is initially issued, reaching ~98% of the commanded deflection 3 time constants after the deflection occurs. It\u0027s selected not because the modelling is simple, but because it makes modelling the control surface response in a more advanced control system (say, a more intelligent SAS) far, far simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time I tried increasing the time constant, SAS became far, far worse at controlling my planes in every case. Every time I tried decreasing it SAS has had an easier time handling the issue. The problem is when you have a not perfectly balanced plane, and SAS commands a deflection that \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be enough to bring things under control, but the control surface hasn\u0027t reached that deflection yet. So it commands more deflection, and when the control surface blows past the balance point the plane starts heading in the other direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason it\u0027s hard mode is that it makes SAS far less forgiving. And since SAS got fixed in 0.21 and \u0022fixed\u0022 further in 0.22, people have assumed that SAS will be perfectly fine with whatever they throw at it.

Your issue is caused by uneven flexing in the plane / a lack of sufficient yaw stability and is a perfectly realistic and intended behavior. What I\u0027m talking about is getting a plane up to supersonic speeds and the computation freaks out and causes a single frame of larger-than-realistic lifting force on one wing, causing the plane to suddenly start rolling, but the force causing it disappears the next frame.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T18:24:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure exactly what is causing this issue but I have narrowed it down to FAR.

I was less concerned about a needle-shaped rocket than I was about using the same tanks as sort-of trailing edges to taper between a larger payload fairing and smaller upper-stage motor. I can understand some sort of vortex effect of wind coming around the large fairing and pushing back onto the tapered tank; I\u0027ll see about getting a screenshot (in the VAB right now) to try to explain more clearly. It could very well be my limited understanding of how trailing edge drag functions; but I would think that the larger fairing would create more of a vacuum effect behind it (underneath from a vertical standpoint) as opposed to massive amounts of drag from what is otherwise a very aerodynamic body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Image follows; fair warning it was taken at 1920x1080 so is too large to preview on imgur. The part in question is just below the fairing adapter/decoupler and has (at least to my eyes) the same taper as it, but it has orders of magnitude more drag than the fairing plate just above it. (Hash marks are where the fairing adapter starts if you aren\u0027t familiar though you probably are)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/7LQcmNK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImage link\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-28T00:09:50Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2013 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Shad0wCatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T03:39:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom of the fairing tapers less than the tank below; it\u0027s the relative change in diameter that matters, not the absolute change diameter, and the fairing adapter has a smaller relative change in diameter than the fuel adapter, so that would result in lower drag on the fairing adapter.
