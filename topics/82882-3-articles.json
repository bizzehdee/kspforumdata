It is all well and good to add some things because they are realistic and fit the mod\u0027s theme but this is a game, and things in a game should generally have some purpose or reason for being. From a gameplay perspective, it wasn\u0027t different enough to be interesting in my opinion nor did it fill any specific need that the normal fission reactor didn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T20:40:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thorbane\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thorbane\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI liked the old reactor setup better.

The only reason I used it was because Fractal based it on real world concepts, and AFAIK, the ISP and energy outputs were based on the real physics involved, not game balance questions. I haven\u0027t played Wave\u0027s new version yet, I\u0027m a bit concerned the later reactors have been dramatically nerfed beyond their real-world equivalencies, although I\u0027m looking forward to seeing what he has come up with and will hold comment until then.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI chose gameplay over realism. It\u0027s not really a choice for a video game though. It is a preference, and we can debate all day over what it better, but the core issue is that our values and priorities are different. I respect the realism asthetic and I sympathise with it a bit, but we also need to be honest that in a game about green men on a tiny earth...some things are going to behave differently that the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
