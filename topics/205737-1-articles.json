That\u0027s a shame. Because I\u0027ve just encountered an infuriating bug that made me want to eat my own eyeballs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a repair mission to do around the Mun, repair a satellite. So I loaded a ship, clicked the Cargo icon\u00A0 in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and\u00A0 edited the Engineer\u0027s inventory so that he was carrying 4 repair kits, instead of a parachute. I then saved the ship and launched. I got to the Mun, rendezvous\u0027d with the satellite, and put my Engineer on EVA. Only to find that his backpack inventory had reverted\u00A0 to default - a parachute and an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E pack, instead of 4 repair kits and an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may be thinking I didn\u0027t actually save my changes to the ship. I thought so as well. So I loaded the ship again in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, edited the Engineer\u0027s inventory to include 4 repair kits, but this time I added 4 repair kits to the Lander Can\u0027s inventory as well. I saved the ship, and launched. I checked the ship on the pad, to discover that while the Kerbal\u0027s inventory had\u00A0 indeed been changed back to default, the 4 repair kits I had put in the Lander Can were still there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...it looks like the game doesn\u0027t save any changes you make to a Kerbal\u0027s backpack inventory in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Either that or I\u0027m doing something wrong. But all I did was open the top Cargo menu icon in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and drag-n-drop the repair kits into the inventory from the Cargo side menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there aren\u0027t going to be any more patches for v1 then this bug report is a little pointless. But I just wondered if I was going crazy or if others had found the same thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-25T03:23:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224059037\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205737\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221637809463\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002283805\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TimKerbin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, TimKerbin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmade me want to eat my own eyeballs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre they tasty?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout any other info, it\u0027s hard to say.\u00A0 How about a log file for us to take a look at?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Staticalliam7","CreatedById":216180,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-25T06:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure that you have to enable \u0022Persist Kerbal Loadout.\u0022 Might help, or completely unrelated.
