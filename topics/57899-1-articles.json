I\u0027m trying to launch a craft with four goo containers up to a height of 250 km, then letting it fall back down for recovery. Due to technology constraints and a little bit of personal pride, I\u0027m trying to get the craft to land deadstick--that is, once I separate the final stage on the way down and activate the parachute, I have no more control over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this is that my craft won\u0027t stay pointing retrogade. It flips over so that the parachute is destroyed by the force and heat of reentry, and the heatshield is uselessly pointing upward! (This is long before the parachute properly deploys.) How can I keep my craft pointing up with no active guidance? I\u0027ve tried making the center of mass lower, but I don\u0027t think I can change the design much further.
