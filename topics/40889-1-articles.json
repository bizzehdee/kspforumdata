Maybe in the mission control building players could set up a series of maneuvers for a flight, look at dV required, time the launch window, etc. Custom \u0022events\u0022 could be placed along the flight path to add detail to the mission as well.

There was even someone suggesting a chalkboard for the mission control room where you draw out flight plans, just to help yourself brainstorming things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, it\u0027d definitely be cool to lay out flight plans before launch, maybe utilizing a countdown timer to get all precise with some tasks. You\u0027d still be able to mess them up, though, if you missed your burns, turns and whatever else typically goes wrong. So it\u0027s a really good suggestion for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T00:17:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFlight planning is actually on the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPlanned Features list.\u003C/a\u003E Hopefully it\u0027ll come sooner rather than later with the development of career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E a planned feature, thread locked.
