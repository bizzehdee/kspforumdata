There have been a lot of racing threads with half-baked rules and they aren\u0027t satisfying. I have real-life racing experience and let me tell you, if you don\u0027t pin it down 100% then someone will ride that loophole to the end. So let\u0027s get it right before we start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been considering starting a challenge thread for racing. The ones I\u0027ve seen so far have mostly devolved into jets\u002Bmassive downforce, or people letting mods with game-changer parts enter. They don\u0027t really promote good vehicle design, and I\u0027m looking for a way to measure performance of various interplanetary rovers. Much in the same way that most race leagues don\u0027t let you race a car unless it\u0027s an actual production model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m considering is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInterplanetary rallycross.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 leagues: Kerbin, Mun, Minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll stock parts are allowed, ONLY stock parts allowed, and in any configuration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, you will be downloading a save file which contains a course on all 3 planets. This will likely be in the form of flag checkpoint gates and/or dropped parts which look like arrows to keep you on course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe course will have good straightaways, a few twisties, and at least one hairpin which will be large enough to turn smoothly through but I intend most people to half to take it at 10mps or slower. Catching air is allowed and I will ensure that there at least a few bumps to put your handling capability through a test. But course design should eliminate using high-speed gliding and the airplane wheels which do not turn as a legitimate strategy. We may also need to add a rule that the rover must be in contact with the ground at all checkpoints, or perhaps even a \u0026gt;50% air = disqualification rule. Perhaps the checkpoints will be gated? I prefer not to artificially limit the height of your rover but perhaps we can agree on a reasonable height. opinions please. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELow gravity worlds are tricky, which is why I am leaving the construction options open. I don\u0027t want to disqualify using rockets for downforce because they help and a lot of people do use rovers with an inverted engine for this purpose (myself included). I already know some people will be using them for steering and everything. The fairest way to deal with this is through design of the course, someone using that much fuel will have a difficult time carrying enough to get through the course without crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you run off-course, you must turn around and re-enter at the same point you left at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourse layout I will attempt to make around 10mins total at 20mps pace, might take 3 laps or so. It should short enough to be fun and not tedious, yet long enough have fast sections and to make sure wheels are doing most of the work and not a buttload of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERover must be manned by at least 1 driver, and he has to survive. The vehicle can be in any condition at finish as long as the driver is in it and alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you enter a time for more than one planet, it has to be the same craft design. 1 race team, 1 car. Yes this means if you take jet turbines to Mun they are dead weight. Either deal with it, ditch them, or forfeit that planet\u0027s time. This rule is to encourage building a competent rover that is interplanetary and versatile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you build a different rover and want to use it\u0027s faster time instead that is fine, just all 3 leaderboard times from same person must be the same rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo refueling/pit stops. If you get a busted wheel then hop out and fix it but no going off-course on purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoring will simply be ranked times for each planet, we could also figure out some type point system for overall performance to promote having 3 good times. Maybe just multiplying all 3 ranks together, 1 is best. Suggest taking video for fun and profit, especially if you post a remarkable time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this time there are no bonus points/etc. If you make it more difficult than it has to be by bringing a busload of kerbs or enough fuel to go back to Kerbin, that\u0027s on you. For enhanced fun and profit of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you think. Also let me know if you want to help lay out a course. or if you have a super cool mod that would make it easy because this will get tedious. and possibly laggy. I\u0027ll try to keep part count to a minimum and visibility to a maximum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we have to make a mod for purposes of laying out a non-laggy and easy to navigate course, that may be ok. But I would REALLY prefer that everyone can participate in this with an out-of-box install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpinions, please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading, here is a picture of my team landing for practice\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3bBt7wG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223bBt7wG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-28T02:58:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2013 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by automcdonough\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lyndonguitar","CreatedById":61194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T14:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy idea, the entire Course should be video-captured. then It\u0027s just a matter of who\u0027s got the shortest video (provided that you completed all the courses), \u002B the craft file of the vessel you used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be a good challenge!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen a certain deadline finishes, the top and the 5 next closest entries\u0027 videos would be edited side by side and then It\u0027s like a real race!\u003C/strong\u003E Complete with commentary if someone wants to do it\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-28T14:37:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2013 02:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by lyndonguitar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"automcdonough","CreatedById":12249,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T14:49:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be pretty cool. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree video would be best.
