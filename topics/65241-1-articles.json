Applying the rule is no exact science but be sure that we keep a close eye on the forum games and do step in when things become too serious. Commercial initiatives are things which have the intent of making money by selling a product or service. This rule too is only applied when there\u0027s blatant cases: you\u0027re more than welcome to make a thread about another game you like in the Space Lounge and provide a link to the website of that game, whether it\u0027s free or not. However, you can\u0027t post links to sites such as ad.fly or any products you\u0027re selling yourself. These are just examples, but they should give a small insight as to where the line is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T01:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee my explanation here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59177-Why-is-roleplaying-forbidden?p=795586\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post795586\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59177-Why-is-roleplaying-forbidden?p=795586\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post795586\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, it\u0027s a beehive you do \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 want around. We generally draw the line at roleplaying when people make up personas to play their games with. As long as they\u0027re playing the simplistic forum games as themselves and not starting too much trouble, we usually leave it well enough alone. Any threads that are looking like they\u0027re starting to become roleplay are usually looked over and we make a collective judgement on them. If you\u0027re worried about a thread entering roleplay territory, just report the post that seems to have begun said foray into roleplay territory, and we\u0027ll have a look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what would happen if mods took the law into their own hands (and/or ignored every written rule), I invite you to take a look at Facepunch forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-09T01:45:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2014 01:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vexx32\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FEichinger","CreatedById":58255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T10:23:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to report any perceived misconduct of a moderator to either the \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGlobal Moderators\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E, or to the \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECommunity Manager\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E.
