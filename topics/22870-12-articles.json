My frustration level is rising though, because of the different part lengths (height?) not matching one another. It\u0027s hard to build symmetrically when that happens. It would be nice if the cubes, for instance, were actually cubic. When the cube strut splitter tube has 2 sides that are different lengths than the other four, it throws things off. You can rotate another tunnel to line it up, but that still leaves a gap if you split again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame thing goes for the tri-hexes. It would be nice if its splitters matched up to the cubes properly in height. Add in the new octo parts, and you\u0027ve got yourself a headache. Considering the parts are all distributed together, one would expect a certain degree of interoperability between the different sets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should be a plan in place that the length of (N) CubeStrutTubes = the length of (1) OctoStrutCargo, for instance. If that ends up being 1:1, great! If it ends up being 2:1 or 3:1, fine! Just so long as there is some combination of parts that will make the lengths match. But if the length of 1 OctoStrutCargo = 1.13 CubeStrutTubes (for example), there\u0027s no way to match them up. Or even worse, as it is now, 1 OctoStrutCargo = 1.13 CubeStrutTubes, except when you rotate it and it changes to 1.17 CubeStrutTubes. Whatever metric system you\u0027re using, they should match, being internally consistent. As it is, I have to make a hodge-podge of adapters and shivs to make the lengths match. Which sucks, because...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like these parts! I want to use them for everything, but I have to fight them to do it.
