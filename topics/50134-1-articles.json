I find it a bit arrogant to pretend to be able to make predictions beyond 10 or 20 years.

I caught a news conference on NASAtv yesterday discussing the small asteroid mission and the latest info seems to indicate a 2024 launch is more likely. I wish I could find the relevant video online, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be posted yet. The coolest part of the whole discussion was the information on the capture probe itself. It will be using the Solar Electric Propulsion system with an amazing 30 tons of xenon. 30 tons! They also mentioned 150 m/s several times in the presentation at roughly an 18 month burn. In addition, they named the likely candidate asteroids, for both the small asteroid mission and the proposed later large asteroid mission (relative to the small one) . I should have taken notes! A shame it isn\u0027t available on NASAtv at the moment.
