I\u0027ll start by contributing what I know, and I will edit this entry with any high-quality information provided in this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, this should end up in the wiki. Devs and mods, please help, you are probably the only ones with definitive information on this. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach part can have a certain heat level. They heat up, and the level is unknown until it reaches the \u0022overheat\u0022 level, at which point a red bar is shown next to the part. If the bar fills up the part will definitely explode. Sometimes it seems the part has a chance of exploding before bar is full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat is generated in proportion to engine throttle, with each engine having a different heat generation rate. Each engine also has a different heat tolerance. Every part most likely has a heat tolerance, but it seems engines are the only ones capable of showing overheat bars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat can also come from the atmosphere. The denser the atmosphere, the greater the heat. This mechanism is poorly understood, but it seems there is a constant level for each planet, and whether you are on the dark side makes no difference right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat dissipates from engines with time. It may be possible for heat to be conducted into connected parts. closely connected solid engines are known to overheat faster when they are tightly packed. it may be possible that heat can be conducted to nearby parts and not just connected parts, but I doubt that because of the added computational complexity of ranking nearest neighbors each physics step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy anecdotal evidence indicates that no liquid engine will overheat in a vacuum even if left at full throttle, It seems they can all dissipate heat fast enough that the overheat bar stabilizes at a safe value. For this reason it seems heat is only a concern for tightly packed engines, and landing on moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease contribute any knowledge you have \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-12T19:41:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2012 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T22:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe values in the cfg files suggest that, yes, every part can have heat conductivity.
