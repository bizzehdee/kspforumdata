I can\u0027t see how this would be done in the UVW modifier--exporting UVs from a different mesh isn\u0027t working (I think you need the same geometry). Just want to know if this is possible.

So both of them should have the same general geometry. Your just projecting the high poly mesh onto the low poly mesh as a normal map. So if you have something like rivets on a panel and those rivets are made from spheres, you can still have a square panel without having to make any additional mesh and you can project those rivets onto the low poly mesh with the normal map. However, if you\u0027re doing something crazy, then you should post pictures to show what you\u0027re trying to achieve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
