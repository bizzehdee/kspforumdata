It wouldn\u0027t make things any more fun, it would just mean I\u0027d have to sit around doing nothing for a few more seconds/minutes between each transmission, or be constantly hitting time warp for brief periods to warp through the delay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oddible","CreatedById":74605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T19:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis suggestion is not to implement something artificial, it is to resolve something that is completely unrealistic and artificial. Imagine if the ISS reported the same exact results for the same experiments 100 times each day. If you examine the goo then examine it 2 seconds later not much is going to have changed. Another option would be a significantly diminished return if unless you wait a specific amount of time. So for instance you get 40pts for examining it, if you examine it again 1 minute later you get 2pts. If you wait an hour or two you get 4pts. If you wait a day you get 20pts. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T20:21:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI 100% agree that repeating transmissions over and over is silly, grindy and tedious.

So in your save-file the craft would list the parts, and the parts would list all the places that the experiment was performed. Once performed at a location by a particular part it cannot perform that experiment at that location again by that same part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example of a low sub-orbital flight with 3 thermometers (called A, B, C).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the launchpad you perform a reading of all three and transmit A and B but store C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile in flight you read A and B but only transmit A (storing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the upper atmosphere you expose and store the results of A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn landing your payouts are something like: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/3 from each stored result, 1/6th from each transmitted result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have 2/3 of the total available science from the on Kerbin surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/2 the total available from the Atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/3 from space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn your second flight of the same type you expose and transmit all three on the surface and all three while in the atmosphere, you then store all three form orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou payoffs from this flight would be 1/2 on the surface, 1/2 in the atmosphere, and 1/1 in low space. This would give you: 4/3 from the surface, 1/1 from the atmosphere, 4/3 from orbit but when calculating the payoffs it simply caps the payoff to the maximum so in two flights you have maxed out the thermometer experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would make one further change, instead of requiring the player to interact when he performs an experiment I would make the readings and experiments automatic, and make transmission automatic provided the antenna is deployed. The player would manage their power usage by deploying or retracting the antenna, they could also prevent transmission by clicking on an experimental apparatus and saying \u0022Save next result.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefits I see to this are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Less player interaction. You could just make 6 flights with the antenna deployed and forget all about doing experiments. You would automatically get the full science just being in the right place at the right time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. No grinding for fractional points. One of the more annoying things is when you have 119 science and need one more you don\u0027t want to regret not performing experiment X an additional 3 times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. No ridiculous completing the entire tree in 2 flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the grinding is a byproduct of their silly formulas for diminishing payoffs which ensure that you almost never get 100% of the science of a particular experiment. They spent all this time thinking about series that sum to 1 without using a simple min() function.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-19T23:00:28Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2013 11:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DAVIDESCOTT\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
