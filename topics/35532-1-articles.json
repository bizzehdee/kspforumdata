Thing is I\u0027m sure I read somewhere that it could snap under load like if its being pushed by a rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone tried this or seen a thread they can link me too? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDave\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T23:17:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt can snap but if you take it slow, and watch the oscillations you can easily avoid it. If your rocket is bending more than about 10 degrees at the docking port, throttle down. If your ship weighs about 10 tons, you can easily do full throttle. 25 tons, maybe about 2/3 throttle, and 100 tons, good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Danger2007","CreatedById":71663,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T12:44:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool I\u0027ll give it a go, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T12:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s safer to pull ships like that, put the engine module at the tip, with several atomic motors radially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way it won\u0027t bend by the inertia of the rest of the craft\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T13:27:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe alternative is to build a design that utilizes multiple ports. Three is generally considered standard; I use four myself. Proper alignment becomes a pain in the backside; it\u0027s a tradeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy own observation is that docking ports tend to break once you get much past two to three gees of acceleration, depending on how much mass they\u0027re pushing ahead of them. Plus you have the aforementioned wobble problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T13:52:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can either use the senior port, triple normal ones or get quantum struts for excessively large ships.

Once it\u0027s out of a heavy gravity well, the extra support shouldn\u0027t be all that necessary, unless your craft\u0027s center of mass is off the main axis or you\u0027re really pushing hard on the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis shot shows what I mean, used it when lifting the components of my space station.
