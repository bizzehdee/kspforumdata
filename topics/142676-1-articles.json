If you intend spacecraft pointing to be a game mechanic, its going to have issues when on rails to off rails - because the craft will not have rotated during its orbit to point at its target. If it goes behind a planet, then it will have lost its pointing when it regains a line of sight - and unless it happens at random to sweep over the correct LoS, which is at that moment transmitting, its unlikely to regain stabilisation.
