It\u0027s been fifteen iterations and this software crashes to desktop upon just loading a MP4 video source with the \u0022wrong\u0022 set of codecs. Its included transcoder suffers from the same problems. I\u0027ve had to transcode to WMV using Expression Encoder to work around it, but that doesn\u0027t help the seemingly random CTDs from adding too many subtitles, or trying to trim a music track, or breathing on the keyboard funny, or looking at the screen wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy comparison, Microsoft\u0027s old standby Movie Maker works, but is very limited. Adobe\u0027s Premiere and Premiere Elements don\u0027t work without admin rights, which is completely inexcusable since Windows Vista and UAC, never mind on 7, 8 and 10. Yes I\u0027m picky; when I see a product stamped with Microsoft\u0027s \u0022Designed for Windows\u0022 logo I actually expect it to follow the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt674655(v=vs.85).aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elogo requirements\u003C/a\u003E.

VideoWave supports one video track, three audio tracks, two or more overlay tracks and three or more caption tracks, plus has a selection of effects, transitions, and a few other things. I think the Hosers In Space series pushes what I know about this application and any replacement is going to have to match this functionality.
