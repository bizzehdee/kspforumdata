Meaning it\u0027s immediately available when you start a game, which entirely defeats any sense of progression).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhy this is being done (It is widely assumed that Squad is providing this just to pacify the console players and \u0022clear their [Squad\u0027s] conscience\u0022 in the face of (seemingly knowingly) doing very poor releases for console... KSP is a game that should never have come to console).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nYour perspective regarding Kerbin isn\u0027t properly formed. The timeframe of KSP is set between roughly the 40\u0027s and 70\u0027s. LOP-G (\u0022Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway\u0022), a checkpoint station envisioned to be placed in orbit of the Moon has yet to leave the realm of fantasy, and the ISS is a well aged project, and KSP has no better (in terms of advancement, not in performance vs other) propulsion systems in stock than the single nuclear rocket and a single ion engine........ But now Squad has out of the blue, gone and put a working space center \u0022effectively landed\u0022 on the Mun...? KSP is not a strategy game where you get to pick as various factions and get a different start point accordingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t mean to bash or trigger the forum moderators but these are very largely the reasons the community is in an uproar about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Squad had chosen to implement, let\u0027s say, a city builder game sort of mechanic for deploying space centers, it would be far better received and well worth charging up to 5x KSP\u0027s normal price. As it is, it makes more sense to learn to use the Kerbal Konstructs mod, build your own space center, and share it. And these are known to be unlockable so they don\u0027t threaten your sense of progression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere your perspective is relatable is that as anyone reaches the late-game there is no question that everyone would welcome the ability to launch all their stuff from anywhere except Kerbin and appropriately, have major bases or space centers on bodies other than Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
