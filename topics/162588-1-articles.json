I would use force as a multiplier (there\u0027s a big difference between you stroking the bear and the bear hugging you). If there\u0027s friction (no comment) I would use that as another multiplier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB: I understand we can\u0027t have convection between different craft, it would be unbelievable without fluid dynamics. But transferring heat through radiation should be possible.

Other data might be transferred between touching kerbals, I don\u0027t know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB: It would facilitate the creation of switches, relais, valves, timers, electrical motors, alternators, actuators etc. You could create anything, even computers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMore importantly, it would make the distinction between parts in the tree and separate craft more vague. The ability to transfer resources would open the door to stock robotics without potential problems like the IR team is facing from time to time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHow I would do it:\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nResource transfer has had a big upgrade recently and it\u0027s great. As we all know, resource transfer has fixed flow values. I would make them configurable for modders. Via the context menu, I would give the user the ability to choose flow direction. I would also give the user the ability to create separate circuits through the context menu: the part interacting with the collider of the separate craft (for example a shaft) would have a context menu with the ability to split ElectricCharge into EC_Circuit1, EC_Circuit2 etc. Also I would change the way control surfaces, landing gear etc. work: the user chooses in the editor which resource and which circuit it would use. No resource available means no movement.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLast but not least: like Advanced Tweakables I would make it an option in the main menu.

Maybe it would be best to calculate a projection and an average distance of the immediately visible to the part, assuming we are treating it as a point source of heat. Which then asks the question is it a point source, emanating heat in a perfect sphere? I\u0027m not sure how good of a model that would be though. Radiators for example don\u0027t project all of the heat from one single point, heat tends to radiate from all points of the radiator, and more so in certain places (the big flat part) than others (the edge). So, how would that be modeled? I guess one of the ideas is to model it as a flashlight, similar to the current stock lights, instead bathing parts with heat, not light.
