As an avid hiker and professional masochist, I would love to climb/hike up them. Not only are they big but they also seem to be extremely detailed, down to every individual rock. It would be a shame if the devs didn\u2019t add an intuitive way for a kerbal to climb up them in the future. So here\u2019s my idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EGear\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming that there\u2019s an inventory system like Kerbal 1 or various mods, you would be able to equip a pack that has all the necessary gear you would need to climb any mountain in the kerbal universe. This would include:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRope\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n2 ice axes\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCrampons\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTent/Temporary shelter\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGameplay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ice axes and crampons are self explanatory. Ropes main use would be to secure your \u00A0kerbal to said mountain, just in case you slip or accidentally press space. Every 10 meters or so you would place a hook to attach a rope to (this would also delete you previous hook just to make things less complicated). You would also be able to attach a rope to another kerbal for rescue missions \u0026amp; multiplayer. If kerbal 1 falls and kerbal 2 isn\u2019t secured, this would cause kerbal 1 to pull kerbal 2 off the mountain and both of them would perish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a bonus, it would be cool if there was a winch part for rovers. A kerbal would pull the hook attached to the winch and place it on anything they desire. This would be good for pulling rovers up steep slopes and pulling broken vehicles to a different location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tent would be used for if you wanted to do something else or to resupply a Kerbal\u2019s oxygen (if thats a thing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EConclusion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only would a feature like this aid in exploration, but it would also open up new possibilities in science. Imagine if there was some special rock or land feature on a planet, but it\u2019s on a mountain at a 70 degree slope. You could climb up there using a kerbal/rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-03T21:36:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat feature, good for both stock and mods.
