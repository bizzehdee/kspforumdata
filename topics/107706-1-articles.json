No mods are allowed except KAC and similar. The debug menu is not allowed. Ion engines can be used, solid fuel engines can be used, liquid fuel engines can be used. There must be a kerbal in ship ship, however this doesn\u0027t restrict probe cores. Science can be collected freely, and contracts can be completed on the way.
