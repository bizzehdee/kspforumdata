When you create a reaction in a tube, with tons of pressure, tons of explosive, tons of payload. To be perfect, you have to calculate massive amounts of probabilities, before you even launch the thing. So if all we are going to do as a nation, as a space program, or as people, is worry about that 1% mortality rate, or the risk of explosions, well why is there even a space program? Do you realize, that in WWII millions of people were killed. In afghanistan, over 1,000 people have been killed. So really, I would have a better mortality rate, by tying myself to the side of a trash can filled with tnt with a redneck motor on it, and firing myself upwards, than war.

As for Columbia\u0027s reentry failure the loss of heat-shielding had been documented in many other cases back to the start of the program but the administration did little to address it, not to mention that in each case the spacecraft returned in one piece, that would have lead NASA to believe that it was not too great of a concern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to hear a great tragedy then we should talk about Apollo I, 3 of the greatest Americans lost their lives because some engineers failed to remember about what can happen in a 100% Oxygen environment from their intro to chemistry class.
