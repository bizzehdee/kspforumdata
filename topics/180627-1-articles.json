They mentioned things now being more easily offloadable to the gpu for amd. Does this in any way effect this game or mean more things can be loaded to gpu.Say like the craft part or joint logic to allow bigger parts. Or anything that can allow the physics to be done differently to get more performance or functions in the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe customizable physic options. You choose where to offload your phsyics! 8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr would kerbals just get wavy flowing hair?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking about it. If you can get wavy hair in game easily. Doesn\u0027t that bode well for air base physics simulations for aircraft parts? What can we do with this? 8o\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-16T09:06:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2018 09:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-16T13:38:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUmm....not much. Maybe a slight bump for AMD users assuming it\u0027s actually implemented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing the GPU to process physics has the same limitations as using another CPU core. It\u0027s hard to multi core physics on a single vessel, that hasn\u0027t changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI doubt KSP will see any benefit from this at all, assuming it even uses the latest version of PhysX which I also doubt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-16T13:38:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2018 01:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Rocket In My Pocket\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
