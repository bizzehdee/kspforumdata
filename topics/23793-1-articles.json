All the cities on the surface had been destroyed, the only survivors living in the few underground bunkers and fortresses which were fortunate enough to survive. the population of the world was about 7 million Growing tired of living underground because the surface was too radioactive to live on and would take years of terraforming to restore, the people began to look to space. On December 10, 639 A.C., the greatest scientists, engineers, and aviators in the world met to discuss the future. They ended up forming the Kerbal Exploration and Expansion Project (KEEP), whose goal it was to break free from the confines of their planet and take the Kerbal race to the stars. They built the Kerbin Space Center, which was simply a launch pad, vehicle assembly building, plane hangar, and a runway. The first rocket launched was the Peace I, named for the fact that Kerbalkind had finally come together to achieve something epic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Peace I is the first artificial satellite launched from the Kerbin Space Center. It has no onboard power generation, but it has enough batteries to last it a while.
