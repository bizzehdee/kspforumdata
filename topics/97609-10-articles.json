At some point - i think it was Version .20 or .21 i created a infographic to show how the game developed and how much people didnt see how it did develop. unfortunately i lost track and at some point the interest in updating that graphic.. but well, such things happen. Point is that going now to 1.0 has its Pros and Cons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0 is still some psychological Version number for a lot of people as it normally means \u0022complete\u0022 - everything that comes afterwards is maybe a nice addition by the manufacturer but one has to consider something in 1.0 as done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont like this Versioning scheme for the simple reason that it is incompatible to projects like KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad was just adding version numbers and might as well just said KSP27 is \u0022Scope complete\u0022 and exits Early Access. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut by renaming it to 1.0 they just created a situation since this version number leads to confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will still be updates. There will still be additional content. There will be, as far as i know there has been nothing said against it, a move to Unity5 and of course this all will be for free since that is something that was promised long ago.

If so just think about how many hours you have spent on KSP enjoying the game so far and how much time you spent on your last bought AAA title in contrast.. i am sure the AAA title will loose in terms of hours played and the joy you had..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough... long story short. No KSP is not ready for 1.0 as the development of the game is just not compatible to that version scheme, but it damn sure is ready for 1.0 in the sense of completeness and enjoyability.

Many games are no longer a \u0022reach release and be done with it\u0022 model. We have plenty of examples of that, such as Minecraft, Payday 2, and scores of others. Payday 2 and Minecraft were both still buggy and arguably dry on features at release, but have continued to add tons of content that have made them incredibly well-reviewed and successful games. I envision a similar process for Kerbal Space Program. Speaking personally, I\u0027ve dumped hundreds and hundreds of hours into a -singleplayer- game. That\u0027s incredibly rare for me. When they add multiplayer it will completely take the game to a new level for me, and I am certain for many others too. Just because it hits release and is a bit buggy and perhaps still incomplete in terms of features does NOT mean these \u0022critical reviewers\u0022 will win over the day. And honestly, I think the whole game review industry has been vastly overrated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, and my first paragraph leads into my second one, I feel we may be a bit jaded on the subject of KSP. For someone who reviewing the game (presumably if they haven\u0027t played it a ton like many of us have) this game is incredibly deep. Sandbox mode alone may hold hundreds and hundreds of hours of gameplay. Think back to when you first played this game. Getting to Mun alone was this amazing accomplishment, never mind that first time stepping onto Duna or another planet. I think for the majority of us who have played the game for a long time, who love mods, and have played the game a ton sometimes we forget how incredible those first and many hours can be. Let\u0027s not forget that fact for the many new people and reviewers who may be playing this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I say yes, it is ready. You can\u0027t wait for Unity 5 (who knows when it will be released?), you can\u0027t wait for (insert feature here), and bug fixing is an ongoing process even AFTER 1.0 release. That\u0027s how games tend to be these days, and honestly, KSP in terms of \u0022bugginess scale\u0022 I feel is pretty low for me compared to the many games I have played. It has plenty of issues to fix, but most of them are far from game breaking - and hopefully any that are will meet the bug hammer during this final phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, 1.0 means we\u0027re that much close to multiplayer, which for my money is going to put this game on a Mincraft level of success (well, perhaps somewhere in the vicinity of it, which would still be pretty darn awesome).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0 does not change anything to me. Let\u0027s get this thing released and move on with the process of more features, content, and bug fixes that comes with that process of games these days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, even though there is a bit of negativity in this thread and I disagree with some of the sentiments behind it, I feel it\u0027s still pretty awesome how passionate people are about KSP. Honestly, outside of a very few individuals, I feel the majority of the sentiment behind the \u0022heck no it\u0027s not ready\u0022 side is that people in this community want this game to not only be successful, but to be perceived well by EVERYONE. That\u0027s awesome.

They explicitly stated that this is no where near the last update and that everything after this update will consist of many community recommendations. Everyone that is freaking out needs to calm down. On the other hand it is unwise to release all these features in one update and call it finished.
