Either that is paint judging by the random patterns of flames, or possible fuel leaking out of cracks somewhere.

Those exhaust plumes kick out a huge amount of radiant heat, especially when there\u0027s more than one engine involved (each engine kinda shades the tank above it from its own plume, but the neighboring plumes have an unobstructed line of sight). Surfaces exposed to that are often covered with an ablative coating that keeps the underlying structure safely cool by boiling and burning away. The tail end of the Space Shuttle main tank did the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fleb","CreatedById":63851,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T15:23:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like it came straight out of KSP design school.
