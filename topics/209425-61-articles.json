I\u0027m past the blind panic stage and into the mourning period even though it\u0027s technically still working... It started with a bunch of bluescreens within anywhere from 5-30 minutes after booting. I was about to start ripping out hardware but I decided to fix the event log (it had an issue I discovered the other day but didn\u0027t figure out exactly how to fix it until earlier) and when I was able to check it, it spammed that Drive C was corrupt and unreadable. So I ran chkdsk which went to town and scrolled stuff by so fast I couldn\u0027t read most of it. Orphaned files, corrupted files, index errors, etc... SMART data says there were CRC errors and POR recoveries (not even sure what that is at the moment). I ran some SMART tests, it passed the short test but crashed pretty much everything at the end of the extended test. Rebooted and chkdsk ran again and fixed significantly fewer things. The system is up now and still not quite right but SFC says everything is fine. The event log is pretty quiet now and the system appears to be stable but a couple of my programs aren\u0027t working right. I\u0027m... kind of scared to do anything right now. I have a backup of the SSD from a couple days ago so it\u0027s not like I\u0027m going to lose everything even if it completely crashes, but I really don\u0027t want it to go out like this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T11:01:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative hypothesis is that something else is causing the bluescreen and corrupting the hard drive in the process.
