To launch 64-bit, I have to right click on KSP in Steam and launch as 64-bit. Is there any way to fix it, and is it happening to anyone else? Also, I reinstalled KSP, so mods are not the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turf","CreatedById":161356,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T13:04:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake shortcut to open the KSP_x64.exe, blam!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, this workaround fails when you need to use Steam, for some reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-24T13:07:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2016 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Anbang11\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
