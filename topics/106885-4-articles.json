When I was new, I spent a lot of time in my early career mode play (0.25, I think?) biome hopping on Kerbin and getting all the science there I could. What a waste of time. Even with really basic parts, it\u0027s not hard to do a Munshot, a simple flyby - hell, you don\u0027t even need orbit, just enter it\u0027s SOI and grab science. A low-altitude orbit with a Kerbal popping EVA reports over each biome gains hundreds of science, and requires practically no tech. Minimus after, and you\u0027re well into the 300-cost science tech. I never even bother with Kerbin science anymore, not at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a big fan of Career mode, but in an odd sort of way. I love contracts, see, but I detest having contracts be my only source of income. I\u0027d love to see government funding based on reputation, with Contracts as extra income and the KSP version of Quests. Contracts are an excellent source of \u0022What should I do next?\u0022 and the Career mode progression sets limits on your play which (in my personal opinion) makes gameplay so much more exicting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I just had \u0022Explore Gilly\u0022 come up. I take that, then decline a few random contracts until I get more Eve related ones... Then, with a set of Eve/Gilly based goals, I set about designing as cost-efficient and multi-purpose a mission as possible to achieve the various contract goals plus any others I can cram in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying to achieve a multitude of goals in a single, cost effective and efficient mission makes the game a world more fun for me. I find in Science/Sandbox mode, it\u0027s too easy to just throw parts at a problem with no limits, and that\u0027s fun for a while but (for me! YMMV!) it doesn\u0027t hold my attention long enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found 1.x\u0027s Career to work a lot better for me than the previous ones, as the more varied contracts allow for more interesting complex missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing this - these multi-purpose efficient missions - has totally removed grinding from career for me. I don\u0027t ever do missions I don\u0027t want to do, and instead just work them into things I do want to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA key point is that you don\u0027t have to do missions you don\u0027t want to.
