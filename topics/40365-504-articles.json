You should be able to right-click a part and retrofit it, either from controlling the ship you need to upgrade or from an EVA kerbal near the part. It may cost you a little bit of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf ships launched after installing TechManager and acquiring the node aren\u0027t getting the upgrade, that would be a bug. It could be the already-reported bug where the VAB Thermal Helper shows unupgraded radiator performance even when the radiators do spawn as upgraded on launch, so make sure you\u0027re checking what the radiators are doing in flight and not just in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"INSULINt","CreatedById":104803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T03:01:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MerlinsMaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MerlinsMaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey Guys,\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know of a way to hack KSP Interstellar so that you don\u0027t have to use those annoying precoolers?
