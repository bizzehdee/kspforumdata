Sometimes things are in an unexpected place when you\u0027re doing an Editor selection. Heat-control parts are a bit scattered at the moment, not all in the same class. I may try something with Mod Manager to remedy that. And some parts seem to be in multiple places, which makes some sense but I wonder how it\u0027s done. Some people are a bit more careful about names and descriptions, and I can find things bt searching .cfg files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you get useful parts you remember from the v0.90 days.

I know it\u0027s not in the current Firespitter, KAX, or the test versions of B9_Aerospace. It looks like a flat disk, no animation or anything. Nothing complicated.
