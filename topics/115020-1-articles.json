Sometimes things are in an unexpected place when you\u0027re doing an Editor selection. Heat-control parts are a bit scattered at the moment, not all in the same class. I may try something with Mod Manager to remedy that. And some parts seem to be in multiple places, which makes some sense but I wonder how it\u0027s done. Some people are a bit more careful about names and descriptions, and I can find things bt searching .cfg files.\n\nThen you get useful parts you remember from the v0.90 days. Maybe the parts Mod hasn\u0027t been updated, maybe you just haven\u0027t installed the particular Mod that had it. Which is what I have been looking for.\n\nThere was a simple model of a radial-mount comms antenna, something for aircraft, mostly. I know it\u0027s not in the current Firespitter, KAX, or the test versions of B9\\_Aerospace. It looks like a flat disk, no animation or anything. Nothing complicated. As a concept it\u0027s something useful.\n\nI can\u0027t even remember the name.\n\nAny idea where it might be now?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T23:43:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wolf Baginski**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T13:21:12Z","Content":"Found it!\n\nThere\u0027s a couple of small antennae in the Blackleg Industries modpack, both designed for surface-mount, the circular one which I described and a long narrow one.\n\nI don\u0027t know why I\u0027d left that one out of my 1.0.4 install.\n\nI think I get a bit nervous about the amount of stuff to install when a new KSP version comes out."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T09:07:22Z","Content":"For part organizing/searching:\n\n[Filter Extensions](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104231)\n\n[Quick Search](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95168)"},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T00:05:25Z","Content":"QuickSearch is a great mod, and really a necessary feature anytime you have any list with more than a page of items.
