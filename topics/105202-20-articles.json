The pioneer outputs in supplies almost exactly half of what it consumes in mulch, which is the same efficiency as the nomomatic. However, the pioneer does it 4x faster than the nomomatic. So, the description is at odds with the functionality, but which one is right? I suspect that Roverdude\u0027s intention (correct me if I\u0027m wrong Roverdude) was that the pioneer should actually run at 25% efficiency, not 50%. The reason I suspect as such is because of the electricity consumption. The pioneer processes 4x faster than the nomomatic with the same level of efficiency, so it should probably use around say 4x the electricity of the nomomatic? However, it actually uses only twice the electricity. If the efficiency was only 25%, then the electricity usage would kind of make sense. Of course, perhaps the pioneer is fandangled technology compared to the nomomatic, but I suspect it needs to be a nerfed a little bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never raised an issue on Github, but will give it a shot now.

But I\u0027ll try to help some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst thing is this, an mks/ Oks orbital station will never keep up with consumption. There is currently some confusion among me and a few others of exact returns on the chain but I\u0027ll give approximations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have the pioneer module on your oribtal station, this will be recycling somewhere around a 50% return of your mulch (waste) for 4 kerbals, so you are losing at least half of your initial food during this life support recycling loop(or possibly a little more, depending on any loss during kerbals consumption idk if there is any). This module recycles mulch (waste) directly into more supplies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you have an aeroponics module on your OKS orbital station it will be recycling your mulch (waste) at near 90% returns also for 4 kerbals I believe. (So 10% is lost or possibly a little more if there is some loss when kerbals consume supplies, idk) But this process recycles your mulch into organics. So you also need to have a kerbitat module on the station to convert these organics back into supplies, this is at a 1:1 conversion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eif you do the 2nd option of an aeroponics for recycling with the kerbitat you need to be sure to turn off your greenhouse converter on the pioneer module\u003C/strong\u003E, otherwise you will be running both recycling loops and wasting half your mulch in the pioneer module that loses 50% of it through the processing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital was designed not to keep pace with consumption, you can get close, but not self sufficient. This is due to conservation of mass and other design choices by Roverdude. If you start with enough food though and have sufficient recycling for the # of kerbals in a station then it should last longer than a day with the 2nd option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour third option for an OKS orbital station is to add a bunch of storage, then fly in a bunch of water and substrate so you can produce more supplies then you are using (depending on # of kerbals of course) but it will not last forever you will need to resupply water and substrate now and then to keep the production process going. This can be done either by flying a craft yourself, or using the logistics module depending on your situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehope this helps some, and the return %\u0027s I stated may not be exact, it could be slightly lower. I\u0027m not sure if kerbals consume supplies and produce mulch at a 1:1 ratio or not.

It was very annoying, because I was unable to do anything to rescue them until I unlocked the Klaw, as the craft did not have a docking port, and I was unable to EVA the Kerbal to move to a rescue vessel. Giving the ability to wake a Kerbal for an hour would offer solutions for rescue, as I could have either woken them up and EVA\u0027d them to a rescue craft full of food, or woken them as they approached Kerbin and landed them.
