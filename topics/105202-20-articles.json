I just don\u0027t want my chart to have incorrect info.\n\nYes, the config file aside, I got the same results you are indicating when testing it empirically. The pioneer outputs in supplies almost exactly half of what it consumes in mulch, which is the same efficiency as the nomomatic. However, the pioneer does it 4x faster than the nomomatic. So, the description is at odds with the functionality, but which one is right? I suspect that Roverdude\u0027s intention (correct me if I\u0027m wrong Roverdude) was that the pioneer should actually run at 25% efficiency, not 50%. The reason I suspect as such is because of the electricity consumption. The pioneer processes 4x faster than the nomomatic with the same level of efficiency, so it should probably use around say 4x the electricity of the nomomatic? However, it actually uses only twice the electricity. If the efficiency was only 25%, then the electricity usage would kind of make sense. Of course, perhaps the pioneer is fandangled technology compared to the nomomatic, but I suspect it needs to be a nerfed a little bit.\n\nI\u0027ve never raised an issue on Github, but will give it a shot now.

I think most modules hold only 2 kerbals. Maybe the MK III hold more? Haven\u0027t paid much attention. But mks parts are intended for base building and usually made to account for a certain # in the whole base not just the module itself. Idk how to put this but they aren\u0027t really intended to be used with this mod unless you\u0027re building bases somewhere. (They are but not alone or for ships) I suppose you could slap a pioneer on a craft as a part. But that isn\u0027t really the intent so that is the reason for 4 kerbals. A small surface or orbital station.\n\nI think it was intended to be 50% because that is still quite lossy as he says. Lol. I think the aeroponics was meant to be 75% or maybe it\u0027s going to be changed to 75% once MK IV modules come out as the MKS mod hasn\u0027t gotten them yet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T03:58:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:28:27Z","Content":"I\u0027m having two oddities that I\u0027m fairly sure are:\n\n1) related to each other\n\n2) my fault.\n\nHowever, I cannot figure out what the problem is.

I sent a 2-person, 2-ship (with docking ports) mission to Mun with no supplies (I expected to be home well within the 15-day window) and when I undocked them, one correctly showed that 5 hours had gone by, the other reset the timer to 0:00.

But I\u0027ll try to help some.\n\nfirst thing is this, an mks/ Oks orbital station will never keep up with consumption. There is currently some confusion among me and a few others of exact returns on the chain but I\u0027ll give approximations. \n\nIf you have the pioneer module on your oribtal station, this will be recycling somewhere around a 50% return of your mulch (waste) for 4 kerbals, so you are losing at least half of your initial food during this life support recycling loop(or possibly a little more, depending on any loss during kerbals consumption idk if there is any). This module recycles mulch (waste) directly into more supplies.\n\nif you have an aeroponics module on your OKS orbital station it will be recycling your mulch (waste) at near 90% returns also for 4 kerbals I believe. (So 10% is lost or possibly a little more if there is some loss when kerbals consume supplies, idk) But this process recycles your mulch into organics. So you also need to have a kerbitat module on the station to convert these organics back into supplies, this is at a 1:1 conversion.\n\n**if you do the 2nd option of an aeroponics for recycling with the kerbitat you need to be sure to turn off your greenhouse converter on the pioneer module**, otherwise you will be running both recycling loops and wasting half your mulch in the pioneer module that loses 50% of it through the processing. \n\nOrbital was designed not to keep pace with consumption, you can get close, but not self sufficient. This is due to conservation of mass and other design choices by Roverdude. If you start with enough food though and have sufficient recycling for the # of kerbals in a station then it should last longer than a day with the 2nd option.\n\nyour third option for an OKS orbital station is to add a bunch of storage, then fly in a bunch of water and substrate so you can produce more supplies then you are using (depending on # of kerbals of course) but it will not last forever you will need to resupply water and substrate now and then to keep the production process going. This can be done either by flying a craft yourself, or using the logistics module depending on your situation.\n\nhope this helps some, and the return %\u0027s I stated may not be exact, it could be slightly lower. I\u0027m not sure if kerbals consume supplies and produce mulch at a 1:1 ratio or not. If there is loss when kerbals consume then the % will drop.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T22:26:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hevak","CreatedById":122200,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T23:43:35Z","Content":"Also I forgot to mention, that if your base or a ship loses EC for too long, you will lose all supplies on board."},{"CreatedByName":"Andy81le","CreatedById":95393,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T20:28:55Z","Content":"Is it possible to add the icon to blizzy\u0027s toolbar?

It stemmed from the thought that these are trained Kerbonauts, and it doesn\u0027t make any sense for them to just quit working and sit there twiddling their thumbs when they run out of food, to the point that they won\u0027t even deploy parachutes to save themselves when plunging through the atmosphere. So I thought up a different explanation:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbals, in times of danger, have the ability to go into hibernation, allowing them to survive indefinitely without food. While hibernating, of course, they are completely helpless, and cannot interact with the outside world.\n\nThat takes care of the explanation for how the mod works, and opens up some other interesting possibilities.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E All command pods are equipped with a mechanism for waking a Kerbal from hibernation, and can do so at any time. However, the combined stress of running out of food, hibernating, and being woken from hibernation, means that the Kerbal will be unable to reenter hibernation until they have had a chance to rest and recover at the space center. Moreover, unless the Kerbal is fed within an hour of waking from hibernation, they will starve to death.\n\nIn my current save, I have a Kerbal who ran out of food on their way back from Minmus, and are just swinging in a big orbit around Kerbin. It was very annoying, because I was unable to do anything to rescue them until I unlocked the Klaw, as the craft did not have a docking port, and I was unable to EVA the Kerbal to move to a rescue vessel. Giving the ability to wake a Kerbal for an hour would offer solutions for rescue, as I could have either woken them up and EVA\u0027d them to a rescue craft full of food, or woken them as they approached Kerbin and landed them. I\u0027m not sure how possible any of this would be, but please let me know what you think!"}]}
