I\u0027ve tried it and it works, but the problem is, now I\u0027m building larger ships and I need more RCS ports. So putting a big group right on the center of mass won\u0027t work anymore.

This is because while you can balance them to the ship COM during construction, that COM will change as fuel gets used during flight.

If a ship can have just the one fuel tank per stack then by balancing the components above and below it you can reduce shift from LFO depletion to next-to-nothing, and monoprop tanks can be placed at or balanced around the CoM like RCS thrusters themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
