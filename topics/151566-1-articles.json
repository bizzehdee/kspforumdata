Normally, when you transmit science, you transmit everything, and if your battery runs out you continue transmitting as it reloads (but it\u0027s a lot longer and\u00A0in the meantime you can\u0027t control your ship since EC is always at zero). This button make it so that it checks that you have enough battery to transmit your science in one go, without running out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr not.

Once you start transmitting it will consume the necessary power until the transmission is completed. If you run out of power before completion the transmission will fail. The science will be stored but the electricity is lost. Once you have restored your power you can try again.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0027Allow Partial\u0027 can be buggy but will allow you to transmit large packets even with small batteries. When \u0027Allow Partial\u0027 is used the transmission starts as normal but when you run out of power the transmission is paused until you have generated enough power to resume. However this will keep your power levels between zero and almost nothing leaving you with a pretty much dead craft until the transmission is completed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-05T21:16:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2016 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tex_NL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndrewBCrisp","CreatedById":57119,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-05T21:31:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA-hah! \u00A0This sounds useful. \u00A0I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve run into a situation where I\u0027ve needed this function before, but it\u0027s good to know it\u0027s there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58254-tex_nl/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002258254\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58254-tex_nl/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Tex_NL\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E for your answers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
