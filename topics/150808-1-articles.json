But if that\u0027s wrong and Duna is basically in front of Kerbin, then you can just set up a normal maneuver node. Adjust the position and deltaV to get your Close Approach as close as you can. You\u0027ll still miss by 10s of billions of meters on the close approach. But then you do a mid-course correction to adjust your trajectory quite a bit. On the other hand, if this is a relay sat that you\u0027re sending, then it doesn\u0027t actually need to get captured at Duna. You can get it halfway\u00A0and then circularize at that point, and it\u0027ll be pretty well positioned to do relay stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T15:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no way around it... you\u0027ll need throw \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E at the problem until it goes away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two possible ways to do this. The first is a high energy transfer. It is the more straightforward of the two solutions, but it only works (when going to an outer planet) when you\u0027re somewhere between \u0022just missed the window\u0022 and maybe at most half a Kerbin year past that. To do this, you burn past Duna\u0027s orbit in such a way that Duna happens to be where you cross Duna\u0027s orbit at the same time you get there - and then, you hit the brakes like mad. This may involve making your ejection burn at a radial-out angle, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E costs vary wildly depending on where exactly Duna is at the time and how aggressive you want to be.

What you do is, while Kerbin may be one year out from being in the ideal position for a transfer window, you can make your spacecraft \u0022skip forward\u0022 by assuming a solar orbit that\u0027s lower than Kerbin\u0027s, thereby creating its own transfer window. First, you escape Kerbin retrograde, lowering your orbit - as if you wanted to go to Eve or Moho instead. The lower you go, the faster you get to Duna, but the more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E you must expend. Once you get to your low solar periapsis, you circularize there. Then you can just make a maneuver node with a classic Hohmann transfer to Duna, and drag-and-drop it around your low solar orbit until you get a Duna encounter. The combined trip time of getting to solar periapsis plus getting to your node plus getting up to Duna from there will be significantly shorter than the time it would take Kerbin to reach its transfer window plus the time for a Hohmann transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, for what it\u0027s worth: you can also elect to perform a high energy transfer instead of a Hohmann transfer for the final intercept, saving even more time (at the cost of even more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-25T15:21:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2016 03:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T15:18:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an image from my favourite KSP transfer planner.

The cheapest option (above the upper limit of the porkchop plot that Starhawk posted) is simply to push your orbit up somewhere near Dres and then catch Duna on the way back down, but you\u0027ll be catching Duna nearly a whole Duna orbit (800 days) later and that makes it fairly pointless: you\u0027d be quicker waiting a whole Kerbin year before leaving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo rather than doing any of that, you\u0027d be better off simply waiting. By burning a touch more radially-out at the optimal transfer date, you meet Duna much sooner. So you can have your relay sitting in polar orbit \u003Cem\u003Eweeks\u003C/em\u003E before the rest of the expedition (taking the most efficient route) gets there, at a very modest cost. If you don\u0027t need weeks, just send them all on the same route (or even all on the same vessel, splitting up in sun orbit), and make a slight mid-course correction to bring the relay\u0027s arrival time down to a few days before the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd just to be clear: there is no point in trying to leave earlier to get there earlier, it just doesn\u0027t work that way.

It\u0027s the highest difficulty, highest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E transfer destination in the game. That applies even when you hit the transfer window perfectly... and quickly grows beyond that if you\u0027re off by as little as an hour. That\u0027s because Moho orbits the sun so rapidly, the window just flashes by. It comes back every couple days, but you better be precise about it! Even the burn itself is sensitive, small errors add up quickly into major correction burns later-on. With Eeloo, by contrast, you can miss the window by days and then burn sloppily in the general direction and still not notice much in the way of correction necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, Moho windows vary in quality more strongly than those of any other celestial body. There can be a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost difference as high as 10% between two windows even if you hit them perfectly. This is because of Moho\u0027s high inclination and eccentricity. More than one person has been left stranded in Moho orbit because the same ship that worked last time suddenly doesn\u0027t have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to return home anymore. Bring a contingency buffer!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those reasons, many players forgo the in-window Hohmann transfer and opt for the longer-duration but easier to execute out-of-window apoapsis transfer. In which you wait until Kerbin is lined up with Moho\u0027s apoapsis, which happens to coincide with its ascending node relative to Kerbin. That means you can easily fold the entire plane change into your ejection burn for extra efficiency. Lower your spacecraft\u0027s orbit until it just brushes up against Moho\u0027s orbit at its periapsis. Then you let the spacecraft loop around a few times in solar orbit, while making a node at periapsis every loop to check if you can make a cheap burn (prograde works, but retrograde is preferred) that gets you a Moho encounter at a later date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut hey, if you can nail both the Hohmann transfer window and the burn, and stay under 8500 m/s total cost by the time you\u0027re circularized in low Moho orbit, you can confidently say that you can fly any mission profile in KSP without breaking a sweat \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-25T21:22:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2016 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
