And when you have to test things for contracts, how on earth do you get those parts BEFORE you research them!? aaaaa\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is in line with reality, if nothing else. NASA, for example, will research or design something (Say, a Saturn V stage) and then contract it out to a company for testing and production.

For experimental parts, again, kind of simple - the parts aren\u0027t certified for general use, but you have a prototype of them.
