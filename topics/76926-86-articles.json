I however found it could be rather tedious and was very buggy. Of course, with a system so complex and still in a quite early stage there are bound to be bugs and glitches, but when combined with the enormity of other mods I found that the only thing left to do was delete all the mods in my GameData folder, and re-evaluate every single mod I was using to see if I really needed it and if there were any alternatives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkillful was one of those which got re-evaluated. I found BDArmoury to be more gentle to lower-end systems (My CPU and RAM leave a lot to be desired, and I tend to run a heavily modded version of KSP). BDArmoury\u0027s mouse-tracking weapons was something I really liked, along with the hit markers for fixed weapons such as the GAU-18 or Hydra-70 rocket pods. I love the dumbfire rockets (guided rockets was one part of SF that always bugged me), and although I didn\u0027t like the bomb hit markers at first, I found when fighting against the Guard mode and SAM sites, etc. it made high-altitude bombing much more practical. Now onto the main part of this post: Suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sure you\u0027ve had some of these suggestions before, and I am going to try and keep it brief and simple. Here goes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I noticed a lot of modders have created addons for BDArmoury. I find some of the addons created by modders are quite lovely and fill several gaps such as the Mk84 2000lb bomb by VentZer0, or the M31 MLRS missile by Damaske. I took a look at Spanner\u0027s Boomsticks as well, but I found a lot of these parts I could create homemade versions of myself using a mishmash of BDArmoury and Infernal Robotics parts (I also disliked the rough textures, but that\u0027s nitpicking). Have you ever considered speaking to the authors about integrating these addons (or parts of them) into the core BDArmoury mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Have you considered making heavier, longer-ranged weapons like rail guns? The howitzers are lovely, by the way. They can often be difficult to use in space though, especially if you haven\u0027t the time to match your velocity before you whizz past that space station you\u0027re trying to destroy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Have you considered making heavier, harder hitting bombs like 1200lb Tallboys or 22000lb Grand Slams? From a gameplay perspective, nuclear weapons are excessively powerful and not particularly worth the effort to develop imho. What about cruise missiles?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) An idea I had for a bomb would be a Mk82 or Mk84, outfitted with a thermobaric warhead. The idea being that it would cause less damage than a conventional warhead (less effective against buildings or armoured targets), but cover a much larger range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) This suggestion could tie in with suggestion 4). As mentioned earlier in this post, part of the appeal of Skillful was different types of warhead or ammunition. Do you plan on implementing different magazines for weapons, or different warheads for explosive ordnance? Another suggestion might be tweaking the RPM of weapons like the Gatekeeper or the Vulcan. If you have limited ammo, you could set the weapon to a lower RPM. On the other hand, if you\u0027re carrying a lot of ammunition you might want to chew through your ammo in order to send a devastating hail of bullets that will strike fear in the heart of any Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Another part of the appeal of SF was fuel fires and damage states on parts. Do you have any plans on implementing a similar system? Imo, it would diversify the number of potential outcomes in a situation and make combat much more dynamic and interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Could you possibly add explosive warheads (nosecones, inline warheads or whatever) so we can make our own weapons systems such as ICBMs or kamikaze vehicles?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Ok, this is probably not the greatest suggestion, but how about weapons for Kerbals? Grenade launchers or shoulder-mounted weapons systems like Javelins, Stingers, etc. If there\u0027s some pesky AA guard that prevents you approaching an area, drop off a squad of Kerbals and send them in to do the dirty work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-10T18:02:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2015 06:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kill3rCat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eclipse842","CreatedById":111524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T20:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kill3rCat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kill3rCat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI appreciate your help, that seems to have solved it. Thanks! You are quite right, I should have gone back a few pages and read. I only looked at the posts on the same page which I was posting as I assumed it was a fairly recent issue. My bad. However, please mind your tone. Your wording isn\u0027t much of a big deal and very little offense was taken, but there are plenty of ways you could have phrased your reply which would have been less... shall we say, rude or blunt?\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBahamutoD: I love this mod. I used to use Skillful, before I found this. Skillful is an amazing mod. There are parts of Skillful I really like, such as the different munition types, vessel damage and fuel fires. I however found it could be rather tedious and was very buggy. Of course, with a system so complex and still in a quite early stage there are bound to be bugs and glitches, but when combined with the enormity of other mods I found that the only thing left to do was delete all the mods in my GameData folder, and re-evaluate every single mod I was using to see if I really needed it and if there were any alternatives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkillful was one of those which got re-evaluated.
