Bad idea! Acceleration, remember!\u003C/em\u003E - Hm... I have a funny idea for that. Depending on the tech level, when kerbals were subjected to acceleration (any form), they could be thrown on the ground while one kerbal sits on a chair and controls the craft (low level), be holding onto something (mid level) or all sitting in chairs (high level). But I think that would take a lot of programming skills, and i think that it would be very hard to do. Also, it was just an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI just think we need more \u0022regular\u0022 capsules.\u003C/em\u003E - I agree on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECrew capacity wouldn\u0027t scale linearly.\u003C/em\u003E - I think that a developer of this mod (in theory) could just round down the number of kerbals. For an example, an capsule can hold 4,759 kerbals. The dev would round it down to 4, so that one kerbal doesn\u0027t lay down on an edge of the cabin (lol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ethe weight would go up much faster than the diameter (square-cube laws, heh)\u003C/em\u003E - Of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eany integrated ladders would have to scale as well\u003C/em\u003E - Don\u0027t forget that Kerbals don\u0027t scale. But you could also use TweakScale for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eany hatches would specifically have to not scale\u003C/em\u003E - The hatch could be a part, so that when a Kerbal does an EVA, the mod would search for the closest hatch and put him there. Or we could have giant hatches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ethe RCS capacity and internal batteries would be hard to scale accurately if the crew capacity changes (more space for Kerbals means less space for anything else)\u003C/em\u003E I think that if you have \u0026gt;6 crew members, you are probably going to put batteries, RCS, etc. somewhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ereaction wheel strength would have to scale nonlinearly (due to the aforementioned square-cube laws)\u003C/em\u003E Well, same answer of the previous objection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that sums it up.
