If it\u0027s daytime, then it will be just like it is right now. If it is sunset, then the lightning would change a bit(mainly on the outside) and the skybox would change. Same applies for sunrise and nighttime. That would at least make the VAB/SPH have an actual time of day, though still not a daytime cycle, which would be difficult to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1Revenger1","CreatedById":64201,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T23:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat would work, does anyone know if time passes in the SPH or VAB building?
