The answer here is, just focus on progression. If you can\u0027t save a kerbal after reaching that speed, work out why not and get it done. You may need to grind some science, and there\u0027s a lot of it waiting in space.

You have to unlock the tech tree, but don\u0027t have to worry about paying for anything. It introduces the parts in manageable chunks and, as you get more science points the further from home you are, it encourages exploration. Crew reports, EVA reports, surface samples and observing the strange Goo canister at both the launchpad and runway give you some easy points early on.
