What trolling? I assume Sharpie is making a single station to fulfill the Mun and Minmus contract and will also put the tourists there. To which I\u0027m advising him to design the station to survive reentry, so he can recover it in Kerbin, with the tourists still inside, once he finishes all contracts.\n\nFor an added bonus and if he\u0027s also sending up astronauts from his crew roster for xp, if he has enough delta-v, he can send the station just beyond Kerbin\u0027 SOI after he\u0027s done with Minmus and return it to Kerbin for extra xp for the astronauts. But he\u0027s going to need some 1,000-2,000 extra delta-v to be in the safe side. Doable with Nervas, not so sure about using chemical rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"Ripper2900","CreatedById":146418,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T06:23:23Z","Content":"You need to being them back, yes. But you don\u0027t have to do all of them on a single trip. \n\nYou can however make a full monty mission, because the station-missions doesn\u0027t require your station to stay in mun or minmus orbits, just to be there in 10 seconds. So, you could make one, fill it with tourists, send it to orbit minmus, then transfer to mun, and finally land it back at kerbin. Good luck."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T07:06:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Uh? What trolling?

When I read your post I was thinking of a proper space station and not just the kerbal box with a docking port that satisfies some contracts, so the suggestion that he drag the whole thing out of orbit when all he needs is a flyby seemed like schmuck bait."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T12:39:07Z","Content":"It\u0027s only a few hundred extra delta-v to return the stations and avoid clutter ... the issue would be landing them."},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T13:31:06Z","Content":"Luckily ships don\u0027t need to actually be space stations to fulfill space station functions and they don\u0027t need to stay where they are.\n\nTake a piece of paper and write down what you need at every step of the way. So for example if you need space for 20 Kerbals in Kerbin orbit but only space for 4 tourists, leave behind modules with space for 16 Kerbals in orbit, then go to Minmus (maybe leave transfer stage in orbit), land, do your science, take off (leave empty fuel tanks etc. behind), redock with transfer stage (for transfer or just for fuel), go to Mun, land, take off... you get the idea. Just make sure to plan accordingly for every step (including return)."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T16:01:09Z","Content":"Well, I needed a station for Minmus so I tackled the opportunity that someone funded the construction for me... so it\u0027s genuine.
