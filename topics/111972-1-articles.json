Getting to a particular desired orbit can mean adjusting both your angular momentum and your energy, and while it\u0027s always most desirable to do burns at periapsis/apoapsis to maximize efficiency for both, sometimes you don\u0027t have that choice (e.g. if burning at periapsis would be the theoretical ideal, but you\u0027re on a suborbital trajectory and your periapsis is deep underground, then you may have to compromise if you\u0027re not a fan of lithobraking). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
