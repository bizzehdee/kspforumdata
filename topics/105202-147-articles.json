Warehousing is not the same thing as Scavenging.\n\nI have some follow-up questions:\n\nIf this works in only 1 direction, does this mean that mulch is not picked up?\n\nAssume I have Vessel 1 with 1000 supplies, and Vessel 2 with space for 30 Supplies, which has 2 Kerbals. The supplies for 2 Kerbals last approx. 30 days with all recyclers considered. If I leave the vessel and go to the tracking station, timewarp 30 days and come back to vessel 2, they immediately turn into tourists. Then after one second, the scavenging mechanic kicks in and pushes supplies from Vessel 1 to Vessel 2. The 2 Kerbals turn back into fully functioning Kerbals.\n\nIs this correct behaviour? Because that\u0027s what I\u0027m seeing. That is slightly awkward, because this requires me to constantly set timers so my poor Kerbals don\u0027t starve.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-12T14:32:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2017 02:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Kobymaru**"},{"CreatedByName":"dboi88","CreatedById":150676,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-12T15:08:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 36 minutes ago, Kobymaru said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks, I think I finally understand.
