Honestly launching from stratolaunch is a bit dumb in the first place as it is a much more complex system than just launching vertically on a bigger rocket. For one using Cyrogenic Fuels is a lot harder because how do you keep them cold, Solids are a lot harder to use but can be stored but are not all that precise. You also have to design the booster to be aerodynamic with the load and have a good dropaway profile, which means the booster is more expensive (see Pegasus XL for another air launched rocket) Building/modifing the mothership can be challenging (they are essentially trying to strap 2 747s together).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoverall i think this is a BAD idea...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ffa500;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027century gothic\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMOD NOTE....
