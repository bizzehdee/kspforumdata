Might help someone.  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\nCommon question is how to reduce \u0022sawfish effect\u0022 of plane, to wobble as less as possible with SAS turned on. There is several mods that attempts to improve this behaviour.  \n\nBut first step in wobble reduction is in creation of stable craft. When craft start to loose pitching, SAS increase pitching trough control surfaces and engine gimbals. When you set neutral pitching moment in high AoA area (most often mistake), craft will loose lift by large amount. When graph blue line start to drop rapidly, that is AoA when stall starts. Small thin lines tells how craft will behave when fall back to lower AoA until craft is controllable again. Thanks to Tetryds on clarification about stall effect and how it is represented trough FAR graphs.\n\nCraft on picture can have 23 degree of AoA before stall starts, however it is not wise to set neutral pitching moment at AoA just little lower than 23 AoA.  \n\nFor several reasons. FAR graph shows only pitching momentum from craft hull wings and control surfaces, you need to consider also momentum from engine gimbals and also momentum of inertia from previous craft movement. Those forces could push craft in AoA that is larger than it is shown in graph and that little extra can push craft in stall AoA area.\n\nAlso if you choose large AoA where drag is significant, despite high L/D ratio, craft will start to loose speed. With speed loss, craft will also loose lift, this is more important at high speeds and high altitudes where small changes in lift can cause significant height loss where drag is even higher and cause even more drag forces. Or even worse scenario, craft can be disintegrated due to overheating.  \n\nThis is more important in creating of spaceplanes than it is if you try to build fighter. For fighter planes, rapid loss of speed and high AoA is desirable to achieve high maneuverability, but is not SAS friendly and something you want from spaceplane.\n\n![2YvCKN5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2YvCKN5.jpg)\n\nPicture shows only graph for low speed. This craft have similar L/D line for 2/3/4 mach, so those graphs were not shown, but don\u0027t foreget to check those too when you build spaceplane."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T19:30:35Z","Content":"Excessive dihedral effect seems plausible. I did have the wingtips angled up a touch, removing that and slightly enlarging the tail significantly helped, but the plane still wanted to bank over once I hit about Mach 1.2 at 13 km, and I\u0027m also getting red L-beta again at say M1.7. It seems troublesome to fix the derivatives and the dynamic simulation, sorting one breaks the other is what I seem to get,\n\nSaying to reduce the wing sweep seems odd, I thought delta wings were good for supersonic aircraft??? Reducing the sweep is something I can try though, though it\u0027s one of the fiddlier things to do with stock parts.\n\nAs far as the nose goes, sure, I can change it, but is it really likely to help stability much? I just tried a 2.5m adapter and a nosecone A and that made things \\*worse\\* in the analysis.\n\nkcs123 pitch authority isn\u0027t directly a problem any more. At subsonic speeds the main wing\u0027s Col is already near-level with the CoM, both being around the middle of the payload bay. Of course the tail pulls that back, but in flight it will be making less lift than the wings. It \\*does\\* seem like pitching up affects the roll stability, and that\u0027s something I don\u0027t really understand and if it\u0027s a real effect doesn\u0027t seem to be covered by FAR\u0027s roll analysis tools."},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T20:18:55Z","Content":"Trough various craft design, I have found that small vertical wingtips on the edge of main wings helps a lot with rolling stability. Add those if you have reached limit with dihedral angle of main wings. Something similar I have done on [craft shown in few posts back](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/109098-official-far-craft-repository/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2328216). That craft, despite it size have really low drag. That was accomplished by respecting smooth cross area change from nose to tail.\n\nIn previous iteration of similar craft for KSP 1.0.2. I have found also trough design process that even small change in swept angle, like 2-5 degree can make significant difference with stability. That is more noticable if you try to create craft for 360t of payload only, like I did in past. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to accompish with stock parts. Swept angle on stock wing parts does not often offer swept angle for craft you want to create. That is reason why I love procedural wings so much, makes whole design process much easier - meaning less time is needed to place parts in proper order to create larger surface area.\n\nAnyway, trough test flights, check out visual aerodynamic overlay. I have found that if you form lifting surfaces in a way that overlay arrows crosses in one point in large distantce from craft hull, it helps with roll issues. Not exactly best picture that describe what I want to explain, not even best scientific explanation, but it was practical for game purpose. Worked for me, at least.\n\n![57mr3hp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/57mr3hp.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T20:27:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 59 minutes ago, cantab said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m also getting red L-beta again at say M1.7\n\u003E \n\nWhat? How come you are losing roll stability as your speed increases with highly swept wings, that\u0027s weird.  \n\nI suggested you to reduce dihedral because sometimes too much stability can cause your system to become unstable, having the derivatives red however means that you don\u0027t have enough.  \n\nI suspect it\u0027s your tail, it looks like you have a built in AoA on them to keep your nose up, that will behave badly when supersonic.\n\nSincerely, I am not sure if it\u0027s worth to fix that design, even if you fix it there is a chance that it will behave badly when carrying heavy payloads.  \n\nI recommend you to throw away those wings and try a different approach.  \n\nAlso, start with decent vertical stabilizers, on the top of the craft, and make it fly well before you add the constraints, it\u0027s easier to modify something that works than to fix something that does not.  \n\nEdit: specially because you will know what you changed that caused it to fail, and try a different approach."},{"CreatedByName":"Paul_Sawyer","CreatedById":152646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T20:51:15Z","Content":"Hey guys, what do you think of this design?  \n\nBeen messing around with it for some time now, and I must say it looks really cool to me.

Only real problem I see is controlling the first stage after seperation, while still ensuring the second stage reaches orbit. Possibly either make both reach orbit, and then return the first stage, or use SRBs for the final burn. Or use stage recovery and loads of chutes..."},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T20:11:24Z","Content":"I was thinking of having enough fuel on the first stage to enable a skip reentry, basically the first stage would reach a 75 by 27 km orbit, and then separation would occur, the shuttle would circularize, and the booster would fall down into a skip reentry.\n\nI managed to do a Falcon IX style booster landing before, I had to launch at an angle so that I could drop the booster onto the southern continent but that was before we had shuttle SSME\u0027s stock, consequently it was pretty easy to get it wrong and slam into the ground too fast.\n\nMaybe VTOL would do the trick, Even with a forward flying craft some rocket assist might increase booster survivability\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-28T20:12:33Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2015 08:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Halsfury**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T15:06:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 20 hours ago, Halsfury said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I see you compensated for the increased length with canards so that you could get a bigger cargo bay,\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E One thing though which I have always found interesting, I wonder if it\u0027s possible to make a space shuttle with a returnable, flyable first stage.

Adding the canards makes it much more user friendly."}]}
