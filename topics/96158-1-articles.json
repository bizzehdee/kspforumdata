However in a few other crashed games Jeb was not killed, fired or resurrected. I moved him from active status to inactive status, so he would not be automatically pulled for further ground missions (i suppose this is a form of firing, but his experience stats stick with him if he goes on a launch mission), I have been rotating nauts in and out of active status. In most cases for Jeb, this was done at the very beginning of the game, before any missions were undertaken, whereas the game crashes occurs much later in the game after almost a dozen missions have been completed. In all cases except one all pilots were returned home before the next mission preceded. Most games were in hard carreer, however one was normal career (It actually locked up the fastest). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 0.90 I think the sticky needs to be rewritten to deal with the specifics of possibilities in 0.90.

I\u0027m not sure if you are asking for this, but here is a more detailed explanation...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Kerbal\u0027s TYPE determines who \u0022owns\u0022 him. There are four options: Applicant, Crew, Tourist, Unowned. As far as I can tell, the game doesn\u0027t use \u0022Tourist\u0022. An \u0022Applicant\u0022 shows up in the applicant pile at the astronaut building. \u0022Crew\u0022 is someone on your payroll that you can put out on missions, etc... And \u0022Unowned\u0022 is basically kerbals that you haven\u0027t rescued yet for rescue contracts. That is \u003Cem\u003Eall \u003C/em\u003Ethat the TYPE attribute is used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA kerbal\u0027s STATE determines what he\u0027s doing at the moment. There are four options: Available, Assigned, Missing, Dead. \u0022Available\u0022 means that the kerbal is...well...available for use at KSC (putting on mission, hiring, firing, etc...). \u0022Assigned\u0022 basically means the kerbal is out on a mission. \u0022Missing\u0022 is for kerbals who have died in a game where spawning is allowed. And I\u0027ll let you guess what \u0022Dead\u0022 is used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo let me be explicit, if you move players from active status to inactive status, and they have accomplished some goal (say launched a craft) then while they initially appear to be a candidate again, what they really are is disappearred, since they can never be a candidate, again.

Kerbals are deleted from the candidate list in an odd way. Each kerbal has a timer associated with them. If they are in the applicant pool when that timer expires, they are removed from the game. This is done so that applicants \u0022expire\u0022 after a certain amount of time in order to generate new applicants. The thing with veteran kerbals is that their timers are usually in the past. Specifically Jeb, Bill, and Bob all start out with their timers at 0 (zero). While you are in the astronaut complex... If you delete a kerbal, they are moved to the applicant pool (which is maybe what\u0027s leading to your confusion). This is so that if you make a mistake, you can \u0022rehire\u0022 them right there. However, once you leave the astronaut complex, they are removed from the applicant list if their timer is expired. You have just \u0022fired\u0022 them and they aren\u0027t coming back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to tie that in with the explanation about TYPE and STATE...

Since the players are not firing them and the game is doing something other than firing them, in essence they cannot be fired. This lack of a definition is the cause of the bug.

As such he will show up on the candidates list and active list at the same time [bug N \u002B 2](verified twice). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is why there is confusion about activity and firing. Traditionally if one fires someone he is removed from his status he would not be a candidate; instead identified but banished as not to be rehired; this would fix the games problem, creating a term called Banished. In actuality chuck appears to be demoted but still active. If a pilot is fired he should not default to the next mission, even if the game is not closed. I hope you see what I mean by this is a complex and confusing bug the outcome of \u0027firing\u0027 depends on when you closed the game and how long since it was closed or the kerbal was \u0027fired\u0027.

Kerbs could be moved from active to inactive status up until some point in the game, in which this or something else caused a crash. Since reinstating Jebediah\u0027s profile recovered one game we have to assume that this is at least part of the problem. In the last few games I was playing I was rotating pilots in and out of hired status all was going well until I get to the top of the (45 sci) level of the tech tree. Here is what is observed combined with these, again I did not close the game after every hire or fire because I had no reason to expect this was a problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Remove the kerbals from active status, put a kerbal with bad stat in. May or may not complete one faux launch for a mission and Jeb Exp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Roam and MK1 roll around KSC gathering science, rolling back to pad to get full salvage. Lots of small sci. This may also include the use of Mat science and goo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. level up, using KSC science I usually get two middle of tier 4 (45 pts per)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At tier 4 begin going after altitude missions followed by orbital mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Around this point in the game the lock-up occurs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot say when exactly I opened and closed the game, generally I don\u0027t play more than 2 hours at a sitting so I think that the game was closed and opened at least once. Roaming KSC takes alot of time with or without exploits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO, there is something more to this problem than what you have identified and what I have identified, maybe I have to wait a really long time for those timers to expire and crash the game, seems reasonable but not certain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout 2/3rds there, couple more issues that need some work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T02:35:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo but I can rehire chuck, he has not been deleted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd So following this statement I rehired chuck and sent him on a mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eat least as far as the game is concerned\u003C/em\u003E can be used as a placeholder name for what it actually is, because the observations suggest that it goes undefined.

I\u0027ve actually explained it in my post above, but I didn\u0027t explicitly state it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why Chuck is a stalker, is because of the timer (ToS) that is attached to each kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny kerbal that is in the Applicant pool has a ToS in the future. That ToS in the future is what defines when that kerbal falls off the Applicant roster. If you hire one of these guys, then fire them, the ToS timer remains unchanged. If you\u0027ve managed to fire them before the ToS timer is expired, then they will happily hang out as an Applicant until that timer expires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb, Bill, and Bob start out with a ToS of 0 (zero). So when you fire them, they go into the applicant pool. When you exit the Astronaut Complex, the roster is scrubbed for Applicants with expired ToS timers, at which time they are deleted. So if your newly fired kerbal has a ToS in the future, he won\u0027t be deleted and will still haunt the applicant list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, how does that come back to crash your game later??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, lets say you hire a kerbal and put them on a couple flights. You later decide you don\u0027t want that kerbal and get rid of him. He logged an achievement and you fired him, but the game hasn\u0027t crashed even though the \u0022Bug support sticky says firing a kerbal with achievements results in the game locking up.\u0022 That\u0027s because his ToS hasn\u0027t expired yet, so he\u0027s not actually deleted from the roster (because he\u0027s still listed as an applicant). After enough time passes by, his ToS expires. At some point, the game will scrub the roster and delete all the applicants with expired ToS timers. BOOM, save game goes corrupt, well after the fact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are correct, there is a lot behind this bug. I can go on and on about the permutations, but most people on the forums don\u0027t care for pages and pages of why this thing is broken. The bottom line is that fired kerbals eventually fall off the roster, and that causes the game to lock up. There\u0027s a separate bug where the ToS timers aren\u0027t being reset when you hire a kerbal, and this is causing a delayed response from this bug (a timebomb if you will). This is probably why you can\u0027t get the game to reliably crash with the circumstances you are trying to replicate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also sounds like there is a separate bug where fired kerbals are showing up as assignable crew members with the new crew management interface. I will try to explore that to confirm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you\u0027re talking about my kerbal roster fix, I\u0027ve taken care of (hopefully) all of these firing permutations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you hire a kerbal, change your mind, and fire him before you leave the astronat complex, he stays listed as an applicant. However, if you hire a new kerbal and exit the astronaut complex, he\u0027s officially on your books. If you go back and fire him, he happily moves over to the applicant list in case you made a mistake and really meant to keep him. But once you leave the astronaut complex after firing him, he\u0027s completely dismissed and won\u0027t return. That\u0027s also true for the original three. They move to the applicant list so you can change your mind, but once you exit the complex they are completely dismissed. I \u0022think\u0022 this is what you\u0027re looking for...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I should add that the bug that causes the lockup actually isn\u0027t in the roster itself. The problem is with saving the game. When saving a game, KSP runs through the achievements and contracts and tries to reference kerbals by name. Unfortunately, there isn\u0027t any error checking to handle a case where the kerbal no longer appears in the roster. Part of what you are witnessing is that the only way to keep the save bug from happening is by repairing the crew roster so that in the process of saving, KSP has something to reference. That\u0027s the piece of the game that we (as users) have access too. Sometimes we have to be creative when fixing a problem when we can\u0027t get at it directly. In essence, the lockup bug is being bypassed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-11T02:54:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2015 02:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T14:33:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, how does that come back to crash your game later??\u003Cp\u003EWell, lets say you hire a kerbal and put them on a couple flights.

What I\u0027m trying to say is that you have found a new bug (where he\u0027s showing up as a crew member in the next flight, despite being an applicant) and it is a different bug than the one that causes the game to lock up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also presume restarting KSP prevents this second bug from happening, because the crew manifest handler is wiped out. That\u0027s good news, because that means it\u0027s probably easily fixable. That\u0027s not the case for the roster bug, it will persist across KSP restarts, and took a lot more integrated fixing and roster management. (Also, it is my own fault that the roster bug is misleadingly named, since it\u0027s not actually a bug in the roster.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me restate again. The bug that causes the lock up is not actually a bug with the roster. It is a bug in the scenario module save routines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t check into at the moment, but this second bug sounds fixable within my existing crew roster fix.
