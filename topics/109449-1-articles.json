Every time I start the game the window is always back asking me if I want to send the info about my game to help Squad. It doesn\u0027t matter if I say yet or no, it always comes back. Also when I change my choices the whole window flickers in an unhealthy way. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/emYAXc3.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/emYAXc3.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething similar when I physical time accelerate, it acts like it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever time accelerated and warns me about the ship falling apart.
