It\u0027s my first thread here. Anyway, I done screwed up. My game crashed while my favourite pilot was soaring over the Mun\u0027s surface in EVA mode, and when I reloaded the game, by the time i could get back to flight mode he was missing from the tracking station. I loaded up the lander thinking it hadn\u0027t saved for a while, and naturally the first thing I did after that was press f5 (stupid). Obviously the game had saved over Bobvin\u0027s death and I\u0027d just erased my last backup. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is this: Is there a way to resurrect my poor pilot with his skills intact, and preferably to put him back in the lander that\u0027s now sitting cold and dead on the mun? I\u0027m no stranger to save file editing, so if it can be done, please let me know. I\u0027m the kind of person who will throw out my entire save file over this kind of screwup, so any help would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColourOfFire","CreatedById":135926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T09:59:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to the persistent save file, look for the roster, that has all your kerbals in it. Change the state from dead to available if you want him back at HQ. To retain his skills you have to change some other numbers as well I believe, the number of performed flights IIRC, if you look through his stats in the save file it\u0027s pretty hard to miss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor putting him back in the lander you need to go to the lander command part in the save file and insert his name at \u0027crew = \u0027 and set the status of the kerbal to \u0027assigned\u0027 instead of available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T10:02:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 10:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ColourOfFire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T13:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat ColourOfFire says should get you on the right track.
