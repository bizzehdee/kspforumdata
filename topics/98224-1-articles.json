The top stage has four LV-n Motors attached to a TVRL400 Quad adapter. I then use 4 tr-18a decouplers attached to another TVRL400 quad adapters Which is then connected to the bottom stage. When I send this to the launch pad it flops. I guess the quad adapters are not strong? So I think no Problem I will go add three trusses to each side of the weak point and drag the strut connector between them. Can not get them to connect. Is there some magic point on the modular girdle segment I am supposed to attach to? I have tried all four sides of the end square and the thin x like cables. I have tried symmetry three and 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I go: forget the strut connector I will just use the big girdle segments. Can\u0027t get them to connect back to the rocket. I have attached a picture. I know there has to be something simple that I am missing but my frustration level is off the chart right now.
