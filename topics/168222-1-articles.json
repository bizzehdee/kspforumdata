overall performance is about the same.\u00A0 I\u0027ll get a yellow clock when flying any vessel with more than 20 or so parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had the laptop since October.\u00A0 Over the past couple weeks, however, I\u0027ve been running into serious lag.\u00A0 What used to be an intermittent yellow clock with a 20 part vessel is now a solid yellow clock, proceeding at close to half actual time rate, with the same vessel size.\u00A0 Worse, when flying an aerospace vessel (glide reentry orbiter or HOTOL spaceplane) I\u0027ll get near-freezes, where engine sounds continue to play and altimeter and velocity displays update, but there\u0027s no response to control inputs for several seconds.\u00A0 If this occurs at low altitude when attempting to land, it\u0027s prone to cause a crash, and if at high altitude, it can lead to overcontrol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running essentially stock: the only mod I have is Better Burn Time, which ought to be completely quiescent unless I have a maneuver node set, or am close to entering or leaving atmosphere, to a rendezvous with a set target, or to impact with a body like the Mun.\u00A0 Even when active, it\u0027s not demanding;

On top of that, it uses shared system RAM for video and textures, warming that up as well, and having to share the same bus.\u00A0 The additional heat, in a laptop, will quite quickly force the CPU/GPU to start throttling cores down to manage it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to find the detailed settings for power management - the high level default \u0027performance\u0027 setting is no guarantee that you\u0027re really getting the best speed out of the system, often in the detailed settings there is still considerable limiting going on. Just be aware that it will lead to higher temps and may thus not really help in the end - you can\u0027t completely stop CPU/GPU from throttling. I haven\u0027t seen it on Linux, but on Windows the Intel HD graphics driver itself has a set of performance settings as well; see what you can tweak there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMostly though, I think you\u0027ll have to lower your graphics settings considerably, especially the graphic detail and effects. A big gain could come from using whatever tool you can find to force-limit the FPS for this game at a fixed, low value (KSP does not honour its own setting and will race frames at max speed at regular moments in the game); I\u0027ve found 30 fps to keep fans quiet on some lower spec laptops I\u0027ve installed KSP on.

hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, any time you\u0027re wondering \u0022why does X perform poorly?\u0022, the first thing you need to do is to identify the bottleneck.\u00A0 For most computer games, the bottleneck is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egraphics\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, so \u0022get a better video card\u0022 generally makes things better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, KSP\u0027s a bit different.\u00A0 Yes, it does depend on graphics, and a crappy graphics card can slow it down.\u00A0 However, it also has a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecomputation-intensive physics model\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and that uses the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ECPU\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, not your graphics card.\u00A0 Either one of these two things (the CPU, or the graphics) could be slowing you down.\u00A0 So before you can try to make things better, first you have to locate where the pain point is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s how you can tell the difference, generally speaking:\u00A0 The graphics card has problems with \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Erendering big pretty things\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (e.g. looking at Kerbin from low orbit), but doesn\u0027t care all that much about part count on your ship.\u00A0 The CPU has problems with \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eships with lots and lots of parts\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, but it doesn\u0027t care at all which way the camera\u0027s pointing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, here\u0027s a simple test:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPut a ship in low Kerbin orbit.\u00A0 Then pan the camera around.\u00A0 Try looking at the ship from below (so all you see in the background is the sky).\u00A0 Then try looking at it from above (so you\u0027re looking down at Kerbin).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIndication that your graphics card is struggling:\u00A0 Does the direction the camera\u0027s pointing make a big difference in your frame rate?\u00A0\u00A0 For example, does it seem fast and smooth when you\u0027re looking at the sky, but slow and choppy when you\u0027re looking down at Kerbin?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the direction your camera\u0027s looking makes a big difference in frame rate, then graphics are likely the problem.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnother indication that CPU isn\u0027t the problem would be if it doesn\u0027t make a lot of difference between a 10-part ship and a 200-part ship.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nCPU, on the other hand, is more likely to be your problem if it doesn\u0027t matter much which direction your camera is pointed (e.g. it doesn\u0027t matter much \u0022is Kerbin filling the screen or not\u0022)... but you have problems with ships that have a lot of part count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother potential bottleneck is RAM, if you\u0027ve got a system that doesn\u0027t have much of it.\u00A0 You only have 8GB, which may or may not be a problem depending on how much RAM KSP is occupying and what else may be running on your system.\u00A0 A symptom of RAM bottlenecking is if things run at pretty smooth framerate, but every few seconds it seems to lock up for a bit before continuing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...So, anyway, the thing to do here is to figure out \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhere\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the problem is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the problem is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egraphics\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E:\u00A0 either put in a better graphics card, or else go into your game settings and turn your graphics options way way down (low terrain detail, low-res textures, etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the problem is CPU:\u00A0 well, you\u0027re basically just hosed unless you switch to a machine with a faster CPU.\u00A0 Try to fly ships with lower part counts.\u00A0 There may be some game settings to adjust the fidelity of the physics model, but I\u0027ve never needed to tinker with that (and am not in front of a KSP computer at the moment), so I can\u0027t really help with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the problem is RAM ... put in some more.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022

excellent since upgrading batteries).\u00A0 Ubuntu MATE doesn\u0027t appear to have any detailed performance settings for the Intel GPU, but I recall this issue occurring more or less equally whether I\u0027m looking out into space or at Kerbin from low orbit (or in atmosphere), so I doubt GPU is the bottleneck.\u00A0 I do run pretty modest graphics settings, out of long habit (seems I always have

And talk of upgrading RAM really brought back some memories. My Tandy 1000 SX was a beast. With dual 5 1/4\u0022 floppy drives and 128k of RAM (yes, kids, I said k). I spent an unGodly amount of hours playing \u0022Pirates\u0022 and the like (before Sid was famous enough to have his name in the title). It was a game called Camelot, though, that brought need of an upgrade. Bought a memory stick and installed it with my dad. Bumped us up to a whopping 256k. I was really rockin\u0027 then.

Your problem had me thinking about when I bought my current laptop 2 Christmases ago. I was spending a small fortune, so I did my homework as I saved over the months. The gaming mantra was always GPU, CPU, RAM, SSD. With KSP, that seems to get rearranged a bit. Going CPU, RAM, GPU, SSD. I\u0027ve heard plenty of guys say they run 8gb just fine. With zero visual mods and graphics turned way down, that would lead me to believe that your CPU is to blame. The Intel HD graphics really are horrible, though. That\u0027s pretty much the entire reason I spent so much. For years I would see messages saying graphics were turned down, and some games wouldn\u0027t play at all and would just say \u0022upgrade your graphics card\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, not that it\u0027s much help, but I\u0027d say CPU or GPU. If you\u0027d like, I could run a quick experiment tonight. My MSI has a button that shuts off the 980 and runs strictly off the onboard graphics.

Benchmarks leaded me to understand that the on board graphics was still my bottleneck. My KSP clock was always green so I was not dropping physics frames. My last update was a Nvidia GT 1030. It is a SFF case with a sub 200 watt proprietary power supply that is not easily upgraded, so it was the GT 1030, or nothing. I got another 20% increase in GPU performance. At this point, KSP is bottlenecked by the CPU. With something like a life support mod, KSP drops down to about 30 FPS.
