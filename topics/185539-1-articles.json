Heat shields are blocking fuel transfer. Crossfeed doesn\u0027t seem to work through heat shields anymore. This makes space station refueling only useful for vehicles that don\u0027t have a heat shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reproduce problem, create a new ship.

If that fails as the test fails for me, then redo the same test but minus the heat shield and the fuel transfer works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nScratch this, discovered issue was I had moved to hard mode. That is a silly setting in advanced. How are you supposed to refuel at stations without having to make ridiculous hoops around the parts that don\u0027t cross feed.\u00A0 Create a large radius radial attachment just so a fuel duct host can cross the heat shield barrier seems really wrong.\u00A0\u00A0 If the fuel ducts lines would allow placement across flush surfaces, having heat shields block cross feed would be ok..but the fuel ducts don\u0027t work across flush parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mystifeid","CreatedById":187479,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-17T06:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223619913\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185539\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221560704328\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022198037\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fragtzack\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, fragtzack said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow are you supposed to refuel at stations without having to make ridiculous hoops around the parts that don\u0027t cross feed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen converting ore to fuel, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s will fill all attached tanks regardless of crossfeed barriers like heat shields or klaws.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith smaller craft you can place a disposable in-line docking port below the heat shield.
