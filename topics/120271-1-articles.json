The idea was to pack as much KSP as possible into a single compact model, and I ended up with a space station with a docked spaceplane. So I started by using the craft file import script to get the meshes into blender. Thanks to esinohio for help with some of the part meshes that I failed to import properly. This model is optimized for \u0022frosted ultra/extreme detail\u0022 from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.shapeways.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShapeways\u003C/a\u003E, trying to push the envelope of this material. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main steps to a printable model were: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* either thickening or removing thin details like handrails\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* incorporating features from the normal maps and textures into the meshes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* making sure that the connections between parts are solid enough \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(stock connections often have a slight \u0027disc of air\u0027 between them where the model would fall apart)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* making the meshes manifold (\u0022water-tight\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* hollowing the model to make the print cheaper\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.shapeways.com/product/H7BA2BKUP/ksp-station?optionId=57787392\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELink: Model on Shapeways\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station is 1.25cm diameter which corresponds to 1:200 scale. Printed with a wall thickness of 0.3mm, the whole model uses about 2.2 cm^3 of material. At 0.3mm, the gigantor panels are quite flexible and arrived slightly bent. Convoluted surfaces like the tanks and science lab seem perfectly robust. For the handrails 0.2mm deep and wide was a good measure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design relies on the \u0027print it anyway\u0027 option, so I can violate the design rules here and there. The plane had small convoluted escape holes, which was not the best idea because there was support material left clogging the service bay and intakes. I\u0027d recommend to either leave generous holes so the stuff can get out easily, or only a tiny hole (like 0.1mm, seems necessary to mark the interior as hollow) so it stays inside. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I had a self-imposed deadline for the print, it does not have all the details that were initially planned, but I am very happy with how it turned out. It is quite difficult to take decent photos of the transparent material (I\u0027ll post better ones when there is some paint on it). The details come out well, however some of the smooth surfaces have a slight grain to them (only noticeable for surfaces at right angles, and I already sanded the spaceplane wings). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3pBoaas.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223pBoaas.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpinning this idea further, it would be nice to have a construction kit like arc5555 did with his \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84621\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ekerbal paper models\u003C/a\u003E. So the main manual work only needs to be done once for each part. I could imagine two ways of making this work: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Printable meshes that let you build in blender, so if you place them next to each other they will intersect in a way to ensure a printable connection. In principle it should also be possible to tweak the existing blender import script to use these meshes instead of the in-game ones. This would be my favorite for models in tabletop-scale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Like above, but instead of intersecting add some plugging interface to the stack nodes, so you print individual parts and snap/glue them together yourself. The interface might be as simple as a centered hole for inserting a pin. This way might be more fun to physically play with but will lead to models with visible seams. This is probably better suited for larger scales, together with cheaper materials or a home 3D printer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor best results these meshes would be optimized for a specific scale and material (the most critical factor being wall thickness). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing a slow painter with lots of other unfinished projects, I probably won\u0027t make another KSP model anytime soon. So I won\u0027t drive this idea of a construction kit any further, but would be happy to help if someone else wants to do it. Are there others interested in modelling at this kind of scale?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-24T21:48:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2015 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pellinor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parkaboy","CreatedById":64208,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T18:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice job, that\u0027s pretty neat!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWalrus123","CreatedById":119099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T19:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T21:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo more tabletop players or scale modellers here? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I built and primed the model, to allow some photos that actually show something.
