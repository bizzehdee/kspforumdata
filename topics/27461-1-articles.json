I am limited by my inability to place these objects whereever I want. This person has done it too - the front of his wings are covered in RAM intakes which require a green orb, but there are no other objects there for them to lock to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/xqQ5EUZOvl8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholas4132","CreatedById":30242,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T23:11:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022green orb connectors\u0022 are usually called connection nodes or just nodes. It appears they are using the small cubic strut. The cubic strut is tiny, can surface attach just about anywhere, and provides a node to attach other parts to.
