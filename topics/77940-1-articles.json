There has been a 64 bit hack for about a good month now, of which a small number of mods has been found to be incompatible with. For myself, this has been limited to mainly KAS and KerbinSide. However, a lot of these incompatibilities comes from bugs within the 64 bit Unity engine (the game engine that KSP sits on top of), and not because of bugs within the mod or KSP itself. This is also aggravated by the fact that the 64 bit hack is not a version of KSP that has seen any kind of quality assurance from Squad. The incompatibility with KAS is a prime example of this. In addition, mileage varies greatly with the 64 bit hack depending on your computer\u0027s operating system, driver software, and hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that being said, it is a possibility that the official 64 bit version, when 0.24 is released, could have much less bugs involved, meaning better mod compatibility. But of course, this remains to be seen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"agises","CreatedById":89502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T12:57:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs user of the linux 64bits version I can say I have no problems with mods because of 64bits(including kethane, kas and more), so I guess will be the same with the official 64bits windoze version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESalud.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SebFierce","CreatedById":78259,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T13:00:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me it has been fairly consistent. Part mods or other mods that don\u0027t include any program code (for example dll files) usually work just fine.
