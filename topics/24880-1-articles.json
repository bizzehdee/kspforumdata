My workaround is docking each component on the side opposite its command pod, then ejecting the pod via decoupler. You can then go end its flight if you don\u0027t want the debris hanging around. If you want to save its pilot, just EVA him into the station; I usually just erase them such that they may fly another day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Quantum Strut mod is also very useful; in my opinion they\u0027re too easy, but station wobbling is a major problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could play like a real man and go to the part.cfg file for command pods and set rotPower to 0. On one hand, station wobbling probably wouldn\u0027t be a problem anymore. On the other, it\u0027d be far more challenging (in space you\u0027d rely entirely on gimbals and RCS) and realistic. A little crew capsule can\u0027t actually turn a ship around, at least not without a lot of electricity to provide a small amount of torque with a gyroscope. Maybe the in-game explanation is Jeb, running excitedly along the inner walls of the capsule, like a perverse, dangerous hamster wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brusura","CreatedById":57899,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T07:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHehe lol at hamster Jeb \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E , thanks for the hint Ringer I could actualy make a second version of the pod one with with rotPower set to 0 and use it as I need, I also took a look at quicksave.sfs to see if I could change the behaviuor after the launch, but there are only things related to positions and resource or.....
