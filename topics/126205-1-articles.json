I saw that in 200 days it would pass close to Kerbin. Periapsis about 11000 km, inclination about 150\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) I launched a probe. Through a series of maneuvers I adjusted orbit a velocity to pass close to the asteroid in it\u0026#39;s periapsis at the same time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) I missed by 600km, I went to a series of maneuvers to rendezvous with it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5) I achieved docking with the asteroid, then I ignited my engine to close the orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut nothing happened. None of the objectives accomplished, even the 10 seconds stability. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes anyone know if I missed anything?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThx\u003Cbr\u003E\nLord Corwin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=silver][SIZE=1]- - - Updated - - -[/SIZE][/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEerrmmm... seems that closing the program and opening again did the trick to solve it :confused:\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-22T23:14:36Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2015 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordCorwin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T23:46:44Z","Content":"\n[QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=silver][SIZE=1]- - - Updated - - -[/SIZE][/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEerrmmm... seems that closing the program and opening again did the trick to solve it :confused:[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis may be a bug, same thing happened to me with a space station contract, things weren\u0026#39;t checked off until I closed/reopened. :confused:\n"}]}
