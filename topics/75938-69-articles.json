I can\u0027t understand all of your changes to the AG stuff, but I like it better than my various attempts over the last 24 hours. I actually managed to break everything but the TweakScale context menu entries for all of your parts in my attempts to modify how the AGs worked. I was just about to have another go at it when I accidentally launched Github and saw your change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELove the new texture on the long track, too. Now I don\u0027t feel so... weird... when testing it. I hate it when parts are given that default white instead of a real texture. even a 2x2 texture with no alpha and pure white is preferable to no texture at all. At least then it could be made Paintable using \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E plugin. The next thing I\u0027d like to tackle for these wheels and such are the redundant/unused textures that are still being published with them. With ram at a premium in KSP, we need to eliminate anything which might be loaded, whether they\u0027re kept loaded or not, to reduce load times and ram usage. Fortunately I\u0027ve learned how to read the MU file format rather well in notepad\u002B\u002B to look for the referenced textures and clean things up. I think the only real culprits are a few wheels with an extra texture that looks the same as the one referenced, and a few tracks with an extra texture that looks like a tread-mark or something that also isn\u0027t used from what I can tell. I\u0027ve also done some work on a few normals that were lacking and darkened/sharpened a few things that I thought could use it. The really large wheel set in particular has had a little update that reduces the blinding brightness of the suspension and attach bars so that they look metallic instead of glowing fluorescent (dependent on video brightness settings, I suppose.) I\u0027m no texture artist, but I dabble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T23:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood news is that the latest TS stuff has been working faultlessly.

I run too many mods that all need to function with KSP in its current version in order to be able to load the game and still be able to do anything with it. Physics warp always screws with everything. It\u0027s not only multiplying time, but also the physics simulation with it. That\u0027s why physics warping a plane in the atmosphere, while throttled up, which is not properly strutted or whatnot will essentially create what we call \u0022unplanned rapid dis-assembly\u0022 in which your craft tears itself apart and proceeds to go boom, or otherwise fly off in separate directions. This could also mean that the repulsors cannot keep up with physics (in this case the physical phenomenon known as gravity) running at hyper speed pulling the craft down toward the ground. Similar effects can be seen with wheels that have especially weak suspensions, or aircraft that experience what I mentioned earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way of looking at it is that the planet really sucks.
