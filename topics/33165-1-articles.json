The only real limit is the largest fuel tank and the largest engine you can find. Modded fuel tanks and engines that are larger than the orange can and mainsail, even if they follow the spirit of the stock parts, reduce overall part count and the number of structural points on the craft. I am not familiar with a few of those mods, but I know KW Rocketry has at least a 3800 thrust engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T21:09:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not interested enough to post pics, but my standard Duna rocket gets an orange tank and 8 FL-T200s into orbit, usually with most of their fuel unspent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat makes what: 2880\u002B90*8=3600 liters of fuel. Which, when combined with the oxidizer needed to burn it, weighs 32\u002B8=40 tonnes. The best part is, it all goes to LV-Ns, meaning my craft can easily escape Kerbolar orbit with thousands of m/s remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI estimate that the delta V budget of this final stage is somewhere around 8000-10000 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this is a bit of a broken challenge, \u0022whoever has the least lag with millions of parts.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust put as many engines as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be better, I think, would be fuel spent vs. fuel in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, my Duna craft uses 26 orange x64s and 26 x16s to get all that fuel up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein other words, I spend 93600 liters powering mainsails to get all that fuel into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my fuel payload / fuel spent ratio is a (likely abysmal) 1 Fuel in orbit / 26 burned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Woops, just remembered it has an added X16 and X32 in the final stage.
