It definitely works for me. Are the keys remapped or maybe a mod is interfering? Does it say anything when you try to switch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to get around the carrier plane despawning is to get it flying high enough. If you can get it to cruise a bit above the magic 22km line (i forget exactly where the 0.1 pressure line is), it won\u0027t get deleted when you go out of range. Get it a little ways above 22km, or get it going fast enough to actually have time. This can give you some extra time to get the space ship to orbit. Then use map mode to switch back to the carrier plane and land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
