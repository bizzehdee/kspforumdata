I docked another ship to my mothership\u00A0earlier without any issues, but whenever I try to dock a rover (pictured below) to my mothership,\u00A0the mothership\u00A0starts wildly flailing around, not quite enough to rip it apart, but still enough to separate some docking ports (strangely, the docking ports in the second picture were the only things to come off, the one holding the rover seems unaffected though)\u00A0and make it impossible to fly. The issue happens whenever I dock that type of rover, I haven\u0027t tested to see if it still happens with ships other than the rover.
