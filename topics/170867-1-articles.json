The thing is I don\u0027t know why and it might actually be a bug, or I am just missing something. I hope you guys can help me! the problem:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor reentry I aim the periapsis at about 65-70 km height, I have a probe body (able avionics package) and some science experiments all with a heatshield attached and a parachute. Even though everything is definitely behind the heatshield during reentry, first the two antennas kind off on the side of the shield start to heat up and eventually explode. Weird, but I\u00A0don\u0027t care about that. Later however, when the G forces really start to pile up, my probebody starts to heat up! It will then eventually explode and since it is a structural part of the vessel that means game over. I don\u0027t understand since the body is not directly behind the heatshield, it is in the middle and it is one size smaller than the shield. I have tried this with multiple reentry trajectories but it always happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you guys can help me!

Behind your heatshield, your reentry vehicle should taper inwards like this: (\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeatshields are not magic deflector shields, and reentry plasma likes to curl in a bit from the edge of your heatshield.

Your reentry vehicle is not a good design for anything except suborbital. That small shield can\u0027t protect something the same diameter as itself. Your experiment package and just about anything else above is exposed to convection heating and you should expect to have\u00A0 bad time of it.\u00A0 Frankly, the material bay should be taking damage and eventually melting a lot sooner than it probably already is. (it most likely would be aluminum, weakening at 450K and outright liquefying at 850K)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 2.5m shield would protect it from a reentry from full orbital speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alabastine","CreatedById":185180,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-15T22:32:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys. I know real reentry craft are a lot more tapered in than this, but the parts that are just as wide as my craft are absolutely fine (unless the craft is not pointing straight down). And the probe itself is quite a bit smaller than the shield (and science experiments). So would this probebody survive reentry at all? Like without putting a ridiculously oversized shield on it? (In my opinion 2.5m is ridiculously oversized for a small 0.6m or whatever the exact size probebody)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince it took quite a while for this post to be approved by mods I indeed noticed the temperature tolerance of the avionics package is quite low. I tried the exact same design but with the early controllable core. This guy has a lot higher temp tolerance and indeed the entire thing survived reentry without dificulties. Apart from the fact that a slight wobble would incinerate the photo experiment. But that can be managed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you guys ever reenter the avionics package? And did it indeed require a 2.5m shield?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the advice!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
