You can add the colliders and do all of the editing, but to export you need part tools, and to have the part tools \u0022script object\u0022 attached to the top object in your hierarchy (it should be a Unity empty object with your model attached as a child of that)\n\n[This post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65356-0-23-PartTools?p=1878643\u0026viewfull=1#post1878643) has a link to the 0.23 part tools download from sarbian, which is the newest one."},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T02:45:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Do we still need the Unity tool package for making collision meshes in unity? Because if so where can I download it the link [on this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65356-0-23-PartTools)is just takes me to the KSP main website.\n\nYou could make a collision mesh in Unity but it would not be attached to a textured part KSP could utilize, which sort of defeats the point. \n\nThe part tools do other things also, such a directory assignments, etc. I suppose if you created an invisible part it could have a collision mesh without the part tools. Something like a sci-fi phase shift weapon, or a force field. \n\nYou need Part Tools 0.20 added to \n\nthe [unity]\u0022\\Editor\\Standard Packages\u0022 directory\n\nOnce you create a new project you will select the part tools from the opening check box, but after you go to your project you will need to show the project directory in windows explorer (popup menu selection) and then got to the assets\\part tools folder. \n\nYou need to remove the three added tools (02.0 versions) and replace with the 0.23 equivilents.\n\nIts a pain. There is a video on how to do this\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71CIu-Pkn3k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71CIu-Pkn3k)\n\nIts awful corny (and slow) but it\u0027s better than anything else out there IMHO. \n\nMaking the collision mesh, well, and getting the triangle count below 255 without compromising the part, you are on your own."},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T03:01:17Z","Content":"I also made a Unity basics tutorial;\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFWF6Qv9Dhk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
