I can agree with the point on how we are not able to currently experiment, but we shouldn\u0027t just blindly accept theories without evidence or attempts at least to falsify that theory.

I would argue that if you have no way to test a theory it doesn\u0027t belong in science, but I also can\u0027t think of a way to bring complex mathematics back into the fold of science with this harsh criterion so I am a bit torn.

BTW, if you want to follow unprovable theories, theology\u00A0can fix you up, one heretical branch of theology uses occams razor and the scientific methods as its basis. Going back to the unprovables is a kind of reverse evolution.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe universe is a quantum universe, which suits me fine because im a statistian. Once you dive into the\u00A0quantum view you immediately have the possibility of many outcomes, but at least on the relatvavistic\u00A0scale they coalesce in the observable through mass action. The outcome of quantum scale physics are a set of parallel probabilities. The most probable outcomes end up being realities except\u00A0when the scale is reduced. An example of small scale events\u00A0are radiation induced mutations. In this case you cannot predict the decay of the particle, its direction of irradiation or even that it will ionize some nucleotide, its a spontaneous corruption of a common process, which we accept as this thing called evolution.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut quantum interactions accumulate on the mass\u00A0\u00A0scale and have predictable outcomes as binomial probaility distribution increases,\u00A0the relative width of the confidence range decreases until at population its a single unique value. If the deBroglie wavelength is smaller than the smallest dimension, then you should be able to test a hypothesis about the object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are dealing with mechanics on the planks scale, or with particles you need alot of observations, cause we cant observe quantum time or length. So far as yet we\u00A0are unable to test the existance of gravitons, its science. Gravitational constant may\u00A0not be constant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin circumstances were the universe does not give you a consistent answer, proof or disproof, use statistics. If you cannot prove where something is,\u00A0\u00A0disprove all the places something cant be. Examine the universe from different perpectives until the\u00A0only place where credible can be found is the place not eliminated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also argue that the process of analysis is subject to statistics, there is a recent paper on dinosaurs where the \u00A0collective of discoveries is evaluated to propose diversity and estimating gaps, the binomial probaility distribution/poisson distributions are very good at this. I have frequently used these to postulate gaps in human evolution, which oddly get support from genetics a decade later. This problem is that fossiles appear\u00A0\u00A0like\u00A0\u00A0quanta,\u00A0\u00A0but they do not tell the state of the system but the state of an individual in an unknown number of systems, so in looking for systems it is more likely to satisfactorily estimate the number of systems without knowing the state of individuals in a system at any given time. This creates place holder hypothesis which float over typhonomics, as new data appear they can be binned into the placeholders and need not interfere with the state of other existing systems unless warranted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a bias in many sciences that becomes profoundly evident in paleontology, something does not exist outside the known\u00A0bounds until proven, unfortunately this creates a rather large ascertainment and cladistic bias. When you try to mesh physical/paleoanthropology and \u00A0ancient DNA genetics, which is not an interpretation of how things evolved, but the blueprint of evolved or evolving state (and it begs the environment, phenotype, genotype head butting contest) one runs into mutual disbelief. An example of this is desinovan, its DNA is shared in a mode of southeast asians, and peaks in papua new guineans now claimed to be a single admixture event, but physical anthropology has no evidence of desinovans in the region. And the physical evidence from the region is of some other dwarfed species. Its sometimes not smart to be too\u00A0constrained by known evidence when it is certain that the known evidence is fractured, its not a license to contrive evidence, but its like creating imaginary numbers to solve\u00A0problems. The problem is that PA and ancient DNA analysis has filled in some of the gaps near the placholders i created almost two decades ago, but still haven\u0027t filled in the most important gaps, so as random data pours in you are still surprised, even if you create placeholders to catch the surprises. Science is sometimes a tempest.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith quantum\u00A0mechanics you do not need to prove everything with perfect observation, but as stated above, we can get carried away, ignore occam, and create a theory in which the universe has 13 dimensions in it. But we also have to be aware of the contrary, the limits of observation are massively larger than the scale tick-tock and step of the universe, theres alot that can happen in that quantum equivilent of space time that we cannot observe. It goes without saying that the smaller the scale of observation, the more indirct those observations become until at some point on has to question observation itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T05:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, science needs to be proven with data.
