Any trajectory entering an SoI is by definition an escape trajectory for that SoI (if it doesn\u0027t impact the body, skim atmosphere or snag a gravity assist on a body orbiting inside the SoI). \n\nBut...\n\nIf your entry trajectory is very similar to the body\u0027s orbit (and it looks like yours is), it is possible for a combination of floating point imprecision and frame stepping to create a new trajectory with an Ap barely inside the SoI boundary.\n\nSo congrats on hitting a KSP rarity!"},{"CreatedByName":"A35K","CreatedById":145429,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T18:39:02Z","Content":"Well, if it works it will be helpful, since my probe is running low on fuel!![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T18:51:22Z","Content":"At the very least, it will be a very easy capture that won\u0027t require much fuel!"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T19:07:33Z","Content":"BEWARE, BEWARE when the map shows you capturing for free. What invariably happens is that you want to warp to the SOI change shown on the map. However, because your whole trajectory plot is glitched up, the SOI change shown isn\u0027t in the right position, either. So you\u0027ll be warping along at high rate thinking you\u0027re still far from the SOI change, and suddenly BAM, you\u0027re in the target SOI with no warning. And almost invariably, you\u0027re on a collision course. And because this only seems to happen when you\u0027re going to a moon, the SOI isn\u0027t very big. And because you\u0027re a high warp, you can\u0027t reduce warp fast enough to save yourself before impact.\n\nSo, on those rare occasions when I see an \u0022auto-capture\u0022 on the map, I do a little burn to force the map to redraw and get rid of this glitch."}]}
