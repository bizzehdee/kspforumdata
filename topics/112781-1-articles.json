What invariably happens is that you want to warp to the SOI change shown on the map. However, because your whole trajectory plot is glitched up, the SOI change shown isn\u0027t in the right position, either. So you\u0027ll be warping along at high rate thinking you\u0027re still far from the SOI change, and suddenly BAM, you\u0027re in the target SOI with no warning. And almost invariably, you\u0027re on a collision course. And because this only seems to happen when you\u0027re going to a moon, the SOI isn\u0027t very big. And because you\u0027re a high warp, you can\u0027t reduce warp fast enough to save yourself before impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, on those rare occasions when I see an \u0022auto-capture\u0022 on the map, I do a little burn to force the map to redraw and get rid of this glitch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
