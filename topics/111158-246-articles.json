There\u0027s no intended moderator asked.\n- The nature of the question asked is not a violation of a moderator\u0027s personal time. When we are here, we are volunteers, but we are performing a service on behalf of *Private Division* and *Take Two Entertainment*. So, technically, it\u0027s not personal time when we are here, or at least in my eyes.\n- The nature of the question allows me the flexibility to ignore it. There\u0027 not invasion of privacy. There\u0027s no threats, no demands. It\u0027s a question of curiosity, similarly to what I am asked by my college students when they ask me, \u0022Doc, what do *you* do for fun?\u0022 Humans are naturally curious by nature - similar to a cat. It\u0027s one of the reasons we like to explore - some of us more than others.\n- The question was asked in a thread called \u0022Ask the mods questions about the forums\u0022 and we\u0027ve had a lot of questions, both about ourselves, the forums, and life in general. The question was not sent in a PM (private message) which ***could*** have been seen as a violation of the forum guideline. Or, it was not sent to us in a discord message, or other social media platforms. Therefore, the last part of the guideline also does not apply to the post.\n\nWith all that taken in consideration, this is why I never considered the question a violation of the forum guidelines. It\u0027s a question asked out of innocent curiosity and in a thread where similar questions have been asked - and answered before. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) It\u0027s all good, [@BekfastDerp13](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/214450-bekfastderp13/) and [@AtomicTech](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/210823-atomictech/)."},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicTech","CreatedById":210823,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-11T13:32:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, adsii1970 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ignore [@AtomicTech](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/210823-atomictech/).

And I also have a Ph.D., too. So, I\u0027m no dumb onion here. Let\u0027s view your post in light of the forum guideline. I am giving you folks a rare look into how my mind works when it comes to how I moderate. I sure hope the rest of the moderation team, specifically [@Vanamonde](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/) doesn\u0027t get too upset with this...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Cu\u003EThe forum guideline specifies that violations of the guideline must:\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Must be an unwanted violation of my personal time.\n\u003E - Or must be an unwanted violation of my privacy.\n\u003E - Forum members cannot contact me outside of the forum/KSP community to discuss moderation work unless an invitation by that moderator is offered.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Cu\u003EThe post by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/214450-bekfastderp13/\u0026do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022214450\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/214450-bekfastderp13/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@BekfastDerp13\u003C/a\u003E asked \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat moderators do outside the forum\u003C/strong\u003E?\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - The nature of the thread allows moderators to ignore the question since it did not ping any moderator specifically. There\u0027s no intended moderator asked.\n\u003E - The nature of the question asked is not a violation of a moderator\u0027s personal time. When we are here, we are volunteers, but we are performing a service on behalf of *Private Division* and *Take Two Entertainment*. So, technically, it\u0027s not personal time when we are here, or at least in my eyes.\n\u003E - The nature of the question allows me the flexibility to ignore it. There\u0027 not invasion of privacy. There\u0027s no threats, no demands. It\u0027s a question of curiosity, similarly to what I am asked by my college students when they ask me, \u0022Doc, what do *you* do for fun?\u0022 Humans are naturally curious by nature - similar to a cat. It\u0027s one of the reasons we like to explore - some of us more than others.\n\u003E - The question was asked in a thread called \u0022Ask the mods questions about the forums\u0022 and we\u0027ve had a lot of questions, both about ourselves, the forums, and life in general. The question was not sent in a PM (private message) which ***could*** have been seen as a violation of the forum guideline. Or, it was not sent to us in a discord message, or other social media platforms. Therefore, the last part of the guideline also does not apply to the post.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E With all that taken in consideration, this is why I never considered the question a violation of the forum guidelines. It\u0027s a question asked out of innocent curiosity and in a thread where similar questions have been asked - and answered before. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) It\u0027s all good, [@BekfastDerp13](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/214450-bekfastderp13/) and [@AtomicTech](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/210823-atomictech/).\n\u003E \n\nThanks Adsii!"}]}
