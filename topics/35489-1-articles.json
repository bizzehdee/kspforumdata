The thread is ambiguous on this (as much as I can tell), so I\u0027m not sure what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there another part pack that rivals KW? If the devs aren\u0027t supporting it anymore (and I understand why, with constant updates to the game, keeping a mod current is a daunting task), is there another that adds the same/similar parts to the game? The clean cut Apollo-esque look to the parts was a huge bonus for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could mod a lot of the stock parts myself, and I have made minor tweaks to various parts, but replicating the entire pack is beyond my capabilities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if they aren\u0027t supporting it, what are the chances that the game devs incorporate it, parts from it, or similar parts into the stock game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T15:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKW is working on 20.2, as I have it (and love it).

Also has no where near the options as KW has(it still needs fleashed out a bit imo...still damn fine looking parts for sure). Honestly the only mod I would consider in direct competition with KW is the NovaPunch pack. Other than those 3 most other launch vehicle mods are somewhat restrictive in how usable they are (mainly packs that replicate actual launch vehicles, Bobcats soviet pack is a great example of this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason people got all ruffled in KW thread is that the mod was updated to work in post 0.20, but not as optimized as it could be (honestly I think a lot of that was due to Ba9\u0027s remarks about KW in the B9 thread just after their 0.20 release). And then a couple people started demanding that Winston post whats going on with the mod, so thread locked due to jackassery haha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
