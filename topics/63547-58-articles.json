Max RPM of the N2 stage, the percentage of that value where the fuel flow is introduced and combusted, and the parameters of the N2 (high pressure compressor) stage so you can calculate what it produces in terms of pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think once you have that, you\u0027re golden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, once that works, forced flameouts due to improper engine pressure would be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAJE uses a steady-state model not a transient model.

I suspect I could code a plugin myself that did something comparable to the aforementioned, but I\u0027m short on time usable for KSP mod work. It also seems like it\u0027d make sense to include in AJE, given how it handles props.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been looking at videos of WWII-vintage piston engine startups as research, and there\u0027s a certain pattern that asserts itself: The starter engages (most of the engines I\u0027m looking at have electric starters) with a distinct electric whir as the prop turns slowly, almost deliberately. Then, the engine itself engages, typically with a bit of a burst of smoke. At this point linears and radials diverge: Linears typically start up fairly smoothly and begin sounding like they normally will at idle. Radials instead cough and sputter for a good few more seconds - and put out significantly more smoke, too - up to half a minute, from what I hear due to needing more effort to clear out oil in the cylinders. Ideally, that\u0027s the sort of startup patterns I\u0027d want to have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is, is such a thing even possible, and if so, what would it take?

(Dangerous territory, that.)\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been fiddling with setting up sounds for the engines of the RealPlanes mod (Genius Evil has let it go, and I\u0027ve picked it up). I\u0027m finding that FSengineSounds is not at all up to snuff - I\u0027m finding I can\u0027t get pitch variation from power, for example. So I was considering, what would it take to solve that? I suspect I could code a plugin myself that did something comparable to the aforementioned, but I\u0027m short on time usable for KSP mod work. It also seems like it\u0027d make sense to include in AJE, given how it handles props.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been looking at videos of WWII-vintage piston engine startups as research, and there\u0027s a certain pattern that asserts itself: The starter engages (most of the engines I\u0027m looking at have electric starters) with a distinct electric whir as the prop turns slowly, almost deliberately. Then, the engine itself engages, typically with a bit of a burst of smoke. At this point linears and radials diverge: Linears typically start up fairly smoothly and begin sounding like they normally will at idle. Radials instead cough and sputter for a good few more seconds - and put out significantly more smoke, too - up to half a minute, from what I hear due to needing more effort to clear out oil in the cylinders. Ideally, that\u0027s the sort of startup patterns I\u0027d want to have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is, is such a thing even possible, and if so, what would it take? If it requires me learning C# (cripes, that\u0027d make... 27? 28 languages now? I hear it\u0027s not hard if you already know Java...) and getting to coding, so be it - I\u0027ve faced worse, it\u0027ll just mean the results will be a while in coming since I\u0027m short on time.
