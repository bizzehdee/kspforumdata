I did think of putting sandbox first but actually there are sandbox games that don\u0027t last that long. If you base a game in a city or a war then even if the player has a very large area to explore it all kind of looks the same after a while. Kerbal has all the land areas of earth at an insane scale to any other game (apart from Minecraft which is infinite). Then it adds all the other planets and moons with different gravities and such. Minecraft has biomes to add to player. Setting alone would never keep a game interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESandbox\u003C/strong\u003E. You don\u0027t have to do anything/ you can do anything whenever. People like stories but we get a lot of plots in games and mostly they are the same. Someone is bad, someone killed someone you care about. Someone is trying to take over the world blah blah blah. How about \u0022here is a space program, have fun\u0022. Freedom to go anywhere and see anything you like makes people spend much more time on games. Skyrim actually had this problem, after getting level 50 I realized I should probably do more of the main quest but just the bits that were on my path anyway. I saw reviews that said one problem (tongue in cheek) was there wasn\u0027t enough to keep you on the main quest. I\u0027ve clocked up over 200 hours on Skyrim but it doesn\u0027t have...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuilding\u003C/strong\u003E. House, base, space station, spaceship. Am I talking about KSP or mine craft? With enough imagination and a bit of skill you can make anything. Anything. Imagination is almost endless when not crushed by society. Designing things and then making them takes time but it is also a very basic human skill and very enjoyable. We love to build and get such a warm glow when we do, this is why engineers are the happiest profession in the world. Even though they are defiantly not the best payed they are still the happiest in absolute terms not just adjusting for pay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules\u003C/strong\u003E. You might think a game without rules would be fun but without some difficulty\u0027s it just becomes painting and painting with only the games parts. Some struggle helps give us the feeling the end product is real and an achievement. I got very board of mine craft creative because of this I think I only spent an hour or two with it. The struggle of figuring out the rules and why to get round them is very satisfying. Even in sandbox KSP unless you turn on most alt-f12 cheats you will have to figure out how to get stuff into space and not explode/run out of fuel/go haywire. Learning is actually fun when it\u0027s not just data you have to assimilate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods\u003C/strong\u003E. They had to be in this list. I stopped playing Minecraft until I found mods like Tekkit and Hexxen. When I found these they probably added hundreds of hours to my play time again.

As the investment to create games gets higher and higher, companies are less and less likely to take chances on game genres that aren\u0027t already established. So we get Shoot People in a Slightly Different Way 5, Drive Really Fast in Photorealistic Cars 4, and Endorsement-filled Professional Sports Game 2014.

KSP appeals to the intellect in a way most games do not. There is a delay of gratification that makes your accomplishments more satisfying. It takes smarts to do well in KSP, not just the quick reflexes and relentless practice that most other games reward. It doesn\u0027t dumb down difficult concepts to make them easier, it challenges you to figure out those difficult things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s customizable.

I\u0027d give long odds that some modder has felt the same way and made a mod for it, likely thinking of things you didn\u0027t. Want more data for design and flight? Mods. Want hyper-realism and greater difficulty? Mods. More eye candy? Mods. Beautifully crafted replicas of real rockets? Mods. ISRU or theoretical propulsion systems? Mods.

I\u0027ve played for about 2-1/2 years now, and I still learn things all the time that make me better at KSP, as often as not from some new poster here who\u0027s been playing for a month. I don\u0027t know that any other than a very elite few can say they are fully expert at all aspects of KSP with nothing left to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s different. As the investment to create games gets higher and higher, companies are less and less likely to take chances on game genres that aren\u0027t already established. So we get Shoot People in a Slightly Different Way 5, Drive Really Fast in Photorealistic Cars 4, and Endorsement-filled Professional Sports Game 2014. KSP is fresh, and engages parts of the gamer mind that the repetitive other genres do not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s SPACE. I\u0027ve loved space exploration since I was in grade school, a game that lets me be the rocket scientist, mission controller and the astronaut is incredibly appealing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s cerebral. KSP appeals to the intellect in a way most games do not. There is a delay of gratification that makes your accomplishments more satisfying. It takes smarts to do well in KSP, not just the quick reflexes and relentless practice that most other games reward. It doesn\u0027t dumb down difficult concepts to make them easier, it challenges you to figure out those difficult things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s customizable. Don\u0027t like some aspect of KSP\u0027s gameplay or wish there was a certain part in the game? I\u0027d give long odds that some modder has felt the same way and made a mod for it, likely thinking of things you didn\u0027t. Want more data for design and flight? Mods. Want hyper-realism and greater difficulty? Mods. More eye candy? Mods. Beautifully crafted replicas of real rockets? Mods. ISRU or theoretical propulsion systems? Mods. Your mix of mods can make the game just about perfect for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It keeps getting better. Each new release adds more features and bugfixes, and mods keep getting more refined and capable. I took a break from KSP for a few months in late 2012, when I came back to it the game had changed considerably for the better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s got a great community. For all that KSP is mostly a single player game, the level of interaction I\u0027ve experienced in KSP\u0027s community is a well above any other game\u0027s community of which I\u0027ve been a part. People are incredibly helpful when a player is trying to get over the initial hump of difficulty or otherwise struggling, they congratulate each other on their accomplishments, and there are tons of high quality tutorials, videos and other community-generated content out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I\u0027m addicted, and I don\u0027t see it changing any time soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHIS is precisely why I like KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T15:30:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it comes down to one thing. You tell your own story. There\u0027s so little background that you fill in most of the details yourself. Internalised story telling is pretty powerful stuff.
