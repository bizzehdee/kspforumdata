You have to have several hundred or thousand for them to mean anything. I have seen so many zeroes that I feel like FUNds have lost their meaning as a currency. I could have millions of funds and it wouldn\u0027t matter because it doesn\u0027t look too different from 100k funds. What I\u0027m saying is that the sheer amount of money to keep track of numbs my feeling of accomplishment when I actually get a good money award. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy proposition is that we either make FUNds worth 100x more (all costs in the game would follow suite) so that 1k would be worth as much as 100k but without all the zeros \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. This may sound a bit strange at first, but I assure you if you focus attention to it you\u0027ll soon realize that there\u0027s just too many zeros to keep track of and it interferes with perceptions of how much your budget is worth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither that OR we implement a \u0022k\u0022 system where instead of displaying an extra 2 zeros at the end of your total FUNds, a \u0022k\u0022 will be placed there as a placeholder, so that the same value is expressed without a need to be conscious of how many zeros there really are in your budget. I believe this will make buying and rewarding much more cleaner and understandable so that FUNds can have a more clear value to the player.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strikerklm96","CreatedById":102539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T00:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a recurring problem in video games, numbers growing large for seemingly no reason. But the problem with keeping things small, is that you lose precision control, so then deciding whether something costs 2, or 3, can be a big difference. But if you can say 2.5633, then you can set up costs very precisely to keep the game mechanics balanced. And someone mentioned earlier, if they just added commas, a number like 300000000 would be much easier to read: 300,000,000\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T22:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it\u0027ll lose precision, one can handle that like the altitude - once you are billions of meters from the planets surface, one is simply no longer interested in every meter - that\u0027s why there\u0027s K, M and G.
