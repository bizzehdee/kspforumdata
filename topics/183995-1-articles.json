If your stack is 1.25 , 1.875m or 2.5m it can rest behind the deflated heatshield. It isn\u0027t as aerodynamic as a fairing but not bad and should help your incentive to aerobrake. While it looks ugly I once managed to clip a fairing under the heatshield by dragging the heatshield out, build the fairing within tight margins and then lower to see if it\u0027s build right and then repeat. There\u0027s a slight threshold at which the point of the fairing goes to far to the top where it will suffer heating damage. That\u0027s probably directly under the node when the heatshield is inflated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother method I found is that you can place empty 2.5m ablator heatshield within a 2.5m stack to redirect the bow shock if heat cripples away with the checkerboard shrouds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides that the best use are the ablator heatshields and ultimately the fairings. If using a winged craft to aerobrake enough wings and good attitude hold of 90 degrees should be good enough on 2400K parts if aerobraking and a fairing is capable of 2700K. The biggest issue is earo capture which involves interplanetary encounter speeds and is done with heatshields often. Fairings being able to withstand more heat should work better but have a lot of drag that goes with it so you need a wing or rear fairing design or anything else that drags to counteract otherwise your craft will tumble I expect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-24T20:48:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2019 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aeroboi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-25T00:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223589075\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183995\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221556132259\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151656\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zosma Procyon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Zosma Procyon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill an aeroshell protect a vehicle during entry to Eve\u0027s atmosphere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA fairing alone will usually not be enough. Except perhaps when the vessel is really lightweight. Entry heat is a function of airspeed and atmospheric pressure -- if you\u0027re so draggy that you already slow down in the thin upper atmosphere, you may not experience much heat overall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can protect low-heat parts if your entry vehicle isn\u0027t too stable, sways a lot, and tends to expose parts that can\u0027t stand much heat and will go poof in an instant. In that case, wrapping said parts in a fairing offers at least some degree of protection. That\u0027s pretty marginal, though, and I\u0027d first give the vessel a good sharp look and try to replace the parts in question with something more heat-resistant, or move them to a safer position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
