If it\u0027s not turned on in the launcher the game crashes on load. I don\u0027t know if this is possibly due to a mod, but I don\u0027t think so as it runs fine with the AMD compatibility mode turned on. What I find especially odd is that I am using an NVIDIA card. This is not a particularly big deal, I just primarily want to know what the AMD compatibility mode does and why it may be affecting my game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
