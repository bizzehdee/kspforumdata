Then I reverted to the lab, slapped shiny new aerodynamic nosecones on the three boosters\u0027 flat tops, and launched that. Again straight up, until the boosters cut out. Against my expectation, the more aerodynamic variant actually achieved *less* height (16.5 km vs. 16.6 km). So what is the point of the nosecones? Should I be using them or do they actually interfere with the rocket? And in a similar vein, does sticking winglets to my rocket do anything other than add weight? I mean, obviously you need wings for spaceplanes, but on a rocket going straight up...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- What are the advantages of having RCS?\u003C/strong\u003E I have the option to research it right now, and I know what it is - little maneuvering thrusters.

There\u0027s *got* to be an easier/more informative way to do this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- What can I do with a Stayputnik in career mode?\u003C/strong\u003E I have googled up a thread that shows you how you can make a great unmanned probe with it, and cites the main advantage as being available early. But frankly, I am 2-3 tech levels past the Stayputnik, have unlocked everything on those levels, could research the next probe command module right now if I wanted to, and I still don\u0027t have access to any parts that are actually usable for probing. For the purposes of generating science, I have mystery goo, the junior lab, crew reports, EVA reports and surface samples. The first two lose 80% of their data value on transmission, and the latter three cannot be done by an unmanned probe at all. Am I missing something here? Why would I want to take advantage of the early availability of of an unmanned probe command module when there\u0027s no science to be generated with unmanned probes until much later tech levels? I just want to make sure that the idea of probe construction didn\u0027t completely go over my head and I missed a cool feature because I didn\u0027t understand it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-29T13:49:48Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2013 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T02:54:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are building a plane, yes pay attention to the aerodynamics.

Some rockets you may want to add winglets to help steer the gravity turn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS is needed to control large vehicles if the reaction wheels are not strong enough to move it. But if you plan on doing docking RCS is almost required to move the vessel the way it needs to move. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine gimbal helps control and steer the vehicle in a given direction when the engine is pushing.

Nosecones are rather pointless, although Squad says they improve stability. You should add winglets (AV-R8 Winglet is best) onto the sides of your rockets to stop quaking and overall fly smoother. Turning on SAS (press t) is the #1 thing for stability though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: RCS is important for maneuvering well in space, but isn\u0027t necessary and can be gone without. You can wait on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: If an engine has vectoring, its easier to steer while on. Useful for main stages, but not really a concern otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Vanilla ksp doesn\u0027t give many stats. Mods solve this, but overall it\u0027s not that important. Weight is important for making symmetrical rockets, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: The Probodyne series is much better in terms of probes, and the stayputnik really isn\u0027t that useful.

I\u0027ve always wondered about the aerodynamic benefits versus the weight... As for the tail fins, they help quite a bit. Put them around the bottom of your rocket for stability. Steerable fins are nearly essential for controlling tall staged rockets in the lower atmosphere without having to use large SAS units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- RCS clusters and fuel tanks usually come out heavier than SAS, so if you\u0027re not docking you can typically forgo RCS on smaller craft in favor of just SAS (remember, pods \u0026amp; probes include some SAS). However, the more mass you have away from the center of gravity (larger, longer craft) the more torque you will need, so RCS clusters out at the ends of your larger crafts allow for much greater turning capability. Finally, RCS is a must-have when docking. In addition to the W-S-A-D-Q-E controls for yaw/pitch/roll pivoting around your GOG (used with either SAS or RCS), note that you also have the I-K-J-L-H-N controls to vector straight in all six directions (which can only be used with RCS). Watch any docking tutorial video to see how the RCS vector controls are essential for docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Engines with vector control are useful for turning your rocket during ascent. They can also be useful during orbital burns, but don\u0027t rely on them in space because they are ONLY useful during burns. Again, with a tall staged rocket design it can really help control your craft, especially in the upper atmosphere when the fins are no longer effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I agree the unmanned probes currently have pretty limited usefulness. For collecting science manned missions are almost always preferable. Unless you\u0027ve unlocked new science parts and wish to return to somewhere you\u0027ve already collected crew/EVA reports and surface samples from. Mainly I use them for ferrying things up to orbit and docking stuff without tying up Kerbals and worrying about returning them home safely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amram","CreatedById":8067,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T04:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP just adds up total drag. So it takes every part you have, and adds the drag together, and there\u0027s your current craft drag. There\u0027s a bit more to it, but for the sake of understanding why nosecones seem to not really help, thats about all that really matters. it doesn\u0027t care that your tanks or boosters are behind the cone, it doesn\u0027t hide them, so their full drag is still counted as if the nosecone were not there, as to KSP\u0027s drag model, it isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the nosecone does three things, two of them negative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt adds yet more drag to your craft. Less than other parts, but its still more than you had. Considering its not helping you reduce drag anywhere, this means your total drag just got larger, not smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt adds mass. Everything has mass, nosecones are no exception, so now you must lift the nosecones mass too, which reduces your thrust to weight ratio by a little bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey have less drag than other parts, so all things equal, the other parts will be slowed more than the nosecone, so the nosecone will have a slight tendency to assist you in holding a prograde alignment. However its small to the point of almost insignificant. Fins at the base of your rocket are a better investment for stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if your playing stock aerodynamics, your choice is whether or not you care about appearance.
