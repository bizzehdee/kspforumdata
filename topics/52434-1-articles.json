That being said, I would love a part that relies on being in ORBIT (true orbit, not suborbital) to generate science. I would also like this part to slowly generate science over time. This part should come in 3 sizes, a 1m, a 2m, and a 3m. The three meter I realize is odd because we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have 3m rocket parts, but that would be part of the challenge and there are enough mods out there that have 3m parts that it would be worth it. In addition, it would be comparable in size to Skylab. To balance this part out, it should provide a trickle of science not enough to make it worth sitting there with time warp on 100000x and getting enough science to unlock everything in a single Kerbin year. The 3m part should produce 100 Science per Kerbin year and should be 6m long. The 2m part should produce 29.6296296296 Science per year and should be 4m long. The 1m should be produce 3.7037037037 science per year and should be 2m long. (The science values are based off the VOLUME of the parts involved) The parts should also consume a fair bit of power (a couple of RTGs will not be enough). Another characteristic of this part would be the constant transmission and generation of SCIENCE, no right clicking and transmitting. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYES THIS COULD BE IMPLEMENTED WITH THE NEW TRANSMISSION INCREASING PART\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlso if you are a MOD maker and use the third idea, all I ask for is a small shout out in the readme and link so I can download your mod. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETLDR: 2m Materials bay, inline goo containers, and a special station part that passively produces science\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dun Kirk","CreatedById":11365,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T09:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Espace station = camper \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027d be nice to have a 2m master science part, which contains all the science stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T13:11:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA science lab module for space stations is coming, however it will not generate science over time as getting science or really anything for simply time-warping until you have enough of it s not something the devs want to add.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B787_300","CreatedById":31055,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T14:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPulstar I realize that, that is why my idea produces a Trickle of science not a stream and not a flood.
