The B9 set gave me the parts needed to build a crescent wing, I used the C2-H cockpit from the KAX pack, which looks solidly subsonic, and fits all the 2.5m cylinders\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was flying well, so I climbed to 8000m over Kerbin. I\u0027m still trying to turn well, but the design was stable, straight and level. I opened the throttle wide. The airframe\u0027s critical Mach number was a little over Mach 0.8, with shockwaves starting to appear at that speed. It was obviously way over-powered, and the speed kept rising. The flames started at about Mach 2.8 and it didn\u0027t look like a plane that could go that fast. But it stayed stable until the aft fuel tank, also getting heating from the engine exhausts, exploded at Mach 3.6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then tried a version using S2 fuselage parts from the B9 set, and made a big mistake. The centre of mass was too close to the centre of lift.
