There seems to be an absolute limit to how big you can build things before it falls apart on the pad or in flight, even with tons of bracing and even inline tank-to-tank strutting. It\u0027s a massive headache for me and I can\u0027t figure out a way around it. I also just don\u0027t like having to put 5000 struts on moderately sized rockets. It\u0027s kind of immersion-breaking to have them in the first place, though I can forgive that if I could have stronger strusts so I don\u0027t need so many of them.

Back in the day, the game used to show how much fuel every single tank had. They fixed it so now only the fuel of entire stacks shows which is great. However, with an asparagus or otherwise cross-fed design, they still show fuel draining out of all the tanks instead of the last ones in the daisy-chain. This gets annoying as sometimes it can be hard to tell how close you are to staging if the fuel levels all are pretty close. One day, I\u0027d like the fuel gauges show only the last tanks in the chain draining; that would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Highlad","CreatedById":64590,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T20:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tommy99534\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tommy99534\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would sort of like to see an animation for Kerbals taking samples, like they pick it up and put it in their pocket.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there is a good, simple idea that would improve the game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torham234","CreatedById":58574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T21:53:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed a fair point well made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://danrpaulsen.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pickupa.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022pickupa.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skydrow","CreatedById":188534,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T22:00:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I think would improve the new update is more probe parts and science parts, such as a robotic arm that can collect samples and a small chamber that can hold samples.

Because Mods are not supported is the biggest argument I can offer. I would like to see a lot of the more popular (or best features of similar mods) become part of the core game. Many of the popular mods are beginning to wane in their support, ISAMapsat and Mechjeb for examples. The game takes long enough to play (I could spend 3 days tweaking a ship design and not get anywhere with it) and not get very much accomplished. Many of these mods provide tools and features intended to make the game more realistic and more enjoyable to play. I can tell you that without Mechjeb, I would not be sitting at my PC burning for a planet holding a heading for an hour, or even 16 hours if using an Ion Engine. Missing tools to aid in design (again much like MJ offers with the Delta V breakdown), where in the wide wide world of any planet would be a decent place to look for discoveries (like ISAMapsat), or the means to replenish supplies once you\u0027ve made it to that far far away planet (Kethane baby!).

(Ever land on the dark side with no way of telling how far above the ground you are?) Also allow for manual toggling as the speed indicator does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Stable spaceplane maneuvering. Flying a plane is always in extreme moves with lots of jerkyness. There are no subtle ways to maneuver. Maybe even some \u0022counterweight\u0022 pieces to aid in putting weight in areas of the plane to help keep it balanced. (I almost always need more weight in the front, give me a heavy nosecone).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Improve strength between in-line mated components. I feel that stacked parts should be considered welded or bolted together and should not require a boatload of struts used as nuts and bolts to hold two pieces together.
