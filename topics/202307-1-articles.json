So here\u0027s the challenge:\u00A0 make a lander that survives the highest possible landing speed. To better elaborate\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) there is only one factor for ranking, which is speed relative to the ground at the moment of first touchdown. though a special mention will go to whoever will manage to make a lander that can actually save weight by lithobraking (i.e. you show that the heavy landing gear was lighter than the fuel needed for a normal rocket braking in the same conditions)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) you can use your rockets as much as you want before touching the ground, you can even use the alt-f12 menu to get into the desired orbit. but after you touch the ground, use of any form of propulsion is forb idden\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) the vehicle will likely bounce a few times. surviving the first touchdown is not enough; the vehicle must eventually reach a full stop. in fact, in my experience, surviving the subsequent bumps is much harder than surviving the first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) the vehicle must not sustain any damage. Exception: damage that can be fixed by an engineer with a few repair kits is ok. damage that can be fixed with eva construction is not ok. POSSIBLE EXCEPTION: if enough people take part in this challenge and there is a request for it, I will add a category for \u0022survived with damage\u0022, where it is allowed to lose some pieces along the way as long as the vehicle keeps working (to be determined on a case-by-case basis)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) planets with atmospheres are forbidden. the purpose of the challenge is to lithobrake, air would be an unfair help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) to better document speed relative to the ground, it is suggested to record a video of your landing. be sure to document everything until you come to a full stop; as i mentioned, it is easy enough to survive the first impact, much harder to survive the subsequent ones, because you have no control over your trajectory\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand that\u0027s it. i tried to land on minmus from orbit, it took a bit of trial and error but it could be achieved. Then i went for the next bigger body, Bop. that was much harder, in part because of the topography. But I eventually made it, after hitting the ground at 187.1 m/s. Next step would be trying on Ike, but I doubt it\u0027s possible. I could try on Minmus from a higher orbit, but for now I\u0027m satisfied.
