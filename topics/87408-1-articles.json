If you desire to make a spaceplane, as in something that can get to orbit, then in general you\u0027ll need 2 of either the old ram intakes or the new shock cone intakes per turbojet or RAPIER. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the other inline intakes, don\u0027t even bother putting them on a spaceplane. They should be paired with the basic jet engine on things that fly fairly low and slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there are the old radial and new structural intakes, which are functionally about the same. Ignore any stats about quantity of IntakeAir. What matters for these intakes is their intake area in comparison to the intake area of the ram and shock cone intakes. The radial and structural intakes are roughly similar and both have about 1/4 the area of the ram and shock cone intakes, so you need 4 of them to take the place of 1 of the latter. IOW, 1 turbojet or RAPIER needs either 2 ram/shock intakes OR 1 ram/shock \u002B 4 radial/structural OR 8 radial/structural to keep running long enough to be of use to a spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that when installing intakes and engines, it\u0027s a good idea to do it WITHOUT symmetry. Install the intakes that will be used by 1 engine, then install that engine, then the next batch of intakes, then the next engine, etc. This helps make all the engines flameout simultaneously so your plane won\u0027t go into a flat spin from 1 flaming out before the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m curious as to why you\u0027re putting both turbojets and RAPIERs on the same plane.

I haven\u0027t touched the throttle on my spaceplanes since the automatic system came out, except maybe to throttle back some to start with so as not to exceed terminal velocity at low altitude. But otherwise, I leave it full on the whole way up, even with multi-engine planes that for some unknown reason continue to have asymmetrical flameout despite my best efforts in the SPH. On the 1st flight, I let them go until flameout. If that\u0027s symmetrcail, then on subsequent flights I just continue to fly to flameout at full throttle. If it\u0027s asymmetrical and I can\u0027t solve this by tinkering with the part placement, then I note the altitude that happens at. This is almost always a bit over 37km for planes with 2x ram/shock intakes per engine. So then on subsequent flights, I hit the action group that switches from jets to rockets at 36km, still without touching the throttle. That way, the rockets kick in at full throttle immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have occasionally noted instances of asymmetrical thrust prior to flameout. However, when this happens, it usually starts about 25-26km, way below flameout height. This is a sure sign the part order of engines and intakes is buggered and I\u0027ve always found that I can solve this problem by reattaching all the intakes and engines in the correct order (like I thought I\u0027d done the 1st time). But even though I can cure the asymmetrical thrust, this doesn\u0027t always prevent asymmetrical flameout, even though you\u0027d think both were caused by the same issue. So that\u0027s a mystery to me. Still, I\u0027ve got a simple workaround for that.

The less wing you have, the more the spaceplane is like a rocket so the more thrust it needs just to keep itself heading up. OTOH, the more wing it has, the less thrust it needs because even a little thrust, if allowed to act for a long enough time, will eventually get it fast enough while the wings do the work of keeping the thing in the air. And it gets to use this thrust more efficiently for increasing speed because the bigger the wing, the less angle of attack it needs to maintain and gain altitude, so the thrust is almost all applied in the desired direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually build my spaceplanes, especially the bigger ones, to have a lot of wing. Thus, they don\u0027t need much thrust (and they also have nice, easy landing speeds of 50m/s or less).

Actually, they have a bit more than that when they come online because by then about 1/2 the jet fuel is gone, but they\u0027re still around 0.4, way less than 1.0. Despite this, because the jets eventually (in about 15-18 minutes) get it to about 2200m/s at 36km, it can easily reach a 200km orbit with 1/2 its rocket fuel remaining for maneuvering and de-orbit even without docking, and upon reentry still has 1/2 its jet fuel for crossing continents and oceans to reach the runway if you badly misjudge your descent path. Plus, it can kill up to 18 Kerbals at once \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I consider the RAPIER an engine of last resort, for use only when available space precludes using separate engines.

Sure, the RAPIER has a lot more thrust in rocket mode than a 909, but if the jets have done their job properly and gotten you nearly to orbital velocity already, then you only need a tiny bit of thrust to get the rest of the way up. The RAPIER\u0027s extra thrust is total overkill useful only for pushing the mass of the fuel it needs to get that thrust, and that mass makes the whole spaceplane more of a pain to build and fly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T03:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPersonal preference I guess.

On the 1st flight, I let them go until flameout. If that\u0027s symmetrcail, then on subsequent flights I just continue to fly to flameout at full throttle.

This is almost always a bit over 37km for planes with 2x ram/shock intakes per engine.

And it gets to use this thrust more efficiently for increasing speed because the bigger the wing, the less angle of attack it needs to maintain and gain altitude, so the thrust is almost all applied in the desired direction.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESnipped for brevity. I just wanted to say your plane there is a fraction of the size of my largest plane. At the time, you didn\u0027t know what he was building. More wing surface won\u0027t help on a big enough plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T16:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022brainlordmesomorph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022brainlordmesomorph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s an odd vehicle.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhat, yes. OK, I can see what you\u0027d have both RAPIERs and turbos on the same ship now. You do have a space issue and need lots of thrust for a vertical launch. I was just asking because for conventional planes, it\u0027s usually not the best option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI haven\u0027t had luck with this approach so far, though I haven\u0027t used traditional nacelles but more along the lines of the side fuselages as in Wanderfound\u0027s example. I\u0027ll have to try being more careful in its assembly (those side pods get placed and removed so often as the design is refined).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, any time you take something off even just to slide it forwards or backwards a bit to tweak the CoM/CoL, you screw up the magic part order. So once I have the airframe built and balanced, I have to remember next to take all the engines and intakes off and put the back on again in the correct order. Often this requires temporarily enabling part clipping because by then the rest of the airframe often interferes with putting the intakes and engines back on, even though they weren\u0027t put on with clipping to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESnipped for brevity.

Of course you can make runway-crushing monsters with the enormous B9 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it seems to me that it\u0027s often the case that most of the size and weight of spaceplanes is unnecessary for the payload you\u0027re trying to lift. And the cause of this seems to be that many folks, probably due to habit formed from building rockets beforehand, greatly overestimate the amount of thrust a spaceplane really needs. Sure, if you\u0027re trying to deliver full orange tanks to your fuel station, then you\u0027ll need a pretty huge spaceplane. But most things spaceplanes carry are low-density things like probes, crew cabins/station modules, etc. They might take up a fair amount of volume but don\u0027t weigh a lot. Because these might require a fairly large airframe to enclose them, though, folks assume it will need a lot of engine, and thus a lot of fuel, and then this snowballs. When they try to launch, they don\u0027t quite make it, so then they add more thrust and more fuel, etc., and pretty soon the runway is collapsing under the plane\u0027s weight. And because the plane is so heavy with all the fuel and big engines, you can\u0027t really put enough wing on it to get enough lift that way. The net result is they end up building a plane-shaped rocket that would go straight up just fine but they insist on trying to fly it horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you realize thrust isn\u0027t all that important for a spaceplane, you can eliminate the majority of its weight by using fewer, smaller engines and a lot less fuel. Then for any given size of wing, you have a much smaller wing loading so the wing does you more good, meaning you need even less thrust. And thus you avoid building runway-crushers entirely, unless you have a legitimate need for them such as lifting full orange tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
