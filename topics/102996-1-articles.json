It takes a bit of effort, and some rockets that are not as efficient as they could be, but I try to make sure that spent rocket stages and debris in general always falls back down to the ground. Sometimes, however, it is just not reasonable to do so. So, how do we remove debris from orbit? Well, we need to build a dedicated debris removal space ship. (Which may or may not have been inspired in some part by Planetes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing no mods of any kind, I quickly discovered how difficult is is to balance thrust on a non-symmetrical craft. Even with action groups for activating and deactivating trim thrusters, there were problems from the very start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-14_launchfailure.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ds-14_launchfailure.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally managed to get my first attempt into orbit, after many aborted launch attempts. But once there, I found that it was still a challenge to properly balance the thrust. I might get the thrust balanced, but within seconds of burning, the balance would shift against me again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-14_orbit.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ds-14_orbit.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution, of course, was obvious. If the space craft wasn\u0027t going to work properly, it was an excellent opportunity to test the emergency abort system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-14_abort.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ds-14_abort.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may have generated some extra debris to clean up in the process, but the emergency de-orbiting system worked like a charm at least. I\u0027m pleased to report that the escape pod saved the lives of the daring kerbonauts. All I had to do is make sure the boosters were pointed retrograde and it had more than enough delta-v to intersect my orbit with the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-14_deorbiting.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ds-14_deorbiting.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to go back to the drawing board and stop worrying so much about making a cool looking ship, and worry about making a functional ship instead. Sure, it will mean a smaller budget of cool-points for the program, but having a ship that doesn\u0027t crash and burn on a regular basis is a must.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-15_orbit.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ds-15_orbit.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new ship worked like a charm though. Here\u0027s a picture of the first successful capture of orbital debris in the history of my own space program. You can see that everyone on-board is super excited about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-15_capture.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ds-15_capture.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETanzor Kerman goes EIVA (Extra-Inter-Vehicular-Activity) through a pressure hatch in the cargo bay to inspect the piece of debris and ensure that it is, in fact, debris.
