It will still be not realistic, but somehow preserves transfer windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere it is. Suppose we have two players, Alice indulges in tomfoolery on the Mun with trying to make hanging base on the Mun arc and launches dozens of crafts with components of it, with lots of docking operations in low munar orbit,\u00A0and really don\u0027t want to wrapping anytime of it, and Bob is going to Laythe. So Bob puts the vehicle of his dream in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and creates and moves nodes. Now Bob has a very complex path, with gravity assists, aerobraking at Jool et cetera et cetera. And then Bob pushes two buttons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u0022Set Target as the trajectory Reference\u0022 (exactly what it says on the tin).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Multiplayer-Warp to the next Node\u00A0according to the Reference\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere goes the tricky part. If you go by that trajectory with Insane Magical Speeds,\u00A0more often than not any intermediate maneuver will be in the middle of nowhere, and sometimes inside of other body. So here we need to incorporate partially the DMP approach: untill the vessel in question is not in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the Target (or Bob hits \u0022Abort Multiplayer-Warp maneuver\u0022), it goes in own sub-universe, with bodies in future places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen maneuver is finished or aborted, vessel\u0027s position is adjusted in Real World relative to the Target\u0027s position. It\u0027s still the magic way, but you can handwave that as \u0022it really was launched long ago\u0022. If any life support mod is iinstalled in this multiplayer session, they can deduce the appropriate amount of consumables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis solution is both tricky and can open gates to lot of time paradoxes (like the ship gets supplies form orbital \u00A0resupply station and then goes to distant destination that places the misson\u00A0long into the past - way before resupply station was even launched), but, really, who cares? We preserved large-scale multiplayer AND orbital mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt still the problem if Bob aborts the maneuver at such place that after adjustment the vessel will ram into other Alice\u0027s one, but it requires the sheer luck (or lack of luck, to be more precise).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope at least someone understand me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"53miner53","CreatedById":172955,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-11T19:54:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had an idea at one point that was posted in another thread.

Any maneuver nodes would be assumed to have been executed as well for craft positioning. If a maneuver node is missed or passed with 25% or more of delta v remaining and no player controlling it,\u00A0then the craft that missed the node would be repositioned and the other craft would be assumed to have gone to that spot and not interacted with the other craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: a lot similar to what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/118683-nothingspecial/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022118683\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/118683-nothingspecial/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@nothingSpecial\u003C/a\u003E posted above me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-11T19:56:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2017 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by 53miner53\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheEpicSquared","CreatedById":158667,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-12T13:27:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow,\u00A0solving this multiplayer issue seems like it\u0027s harder than unifying relativity and quantum mechanics \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-12T13:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223054307\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159396\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221494595659\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158667\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheEpicSquared\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n28 minutes ago, TheEpicSquared said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow,\u00A0solving this multiplayer issue seems like it\u0027s harder than unifying relativity and quantum mechanics \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNah.\u00A0 It\u0027s really easy to solve it.\u00A0 In fact, it\u0027s so easy that everyone has their own idea about how to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheKorbinjer","CreatedById":172204,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-12T14:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love the idea of multiplayer, the fact that people can come together to build things just fascinates me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCo-op can be a thing along with multiplayer, but what if when a player where to time-warp, it would control the entire game\u0027s time, and everyone in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch a thing would require communication (like Discord/ TS3/Skype) to notify that player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, you can have something like when you where to timewarp, a notification box would come up, that would make you \u003Cstrong\u003Eselect whether or not you want to timewarp\u003C/strong\u003E with that person.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone needs to try this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI would, but i have no idea how to make mods =/\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadow Wolf56","CreatedById":172797,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-13T00:11:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalling all mod dev!!!
