Sorry, it\\\u0027s text, I have to ask - you have in fact scrolled down to the axes section, right? Those throttles are axes, you\\\u0027d want to assign one of them to the throttle axis. It\\\u0027s impossible in general to assign axes to button inputs in modern games.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyeye Blaze","CreatedById":10099,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-24T02:31:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be what i need to do....lol thanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei guess thats what this subforum is for huh?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hypocee","CreatedById":8609,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-24T04:23:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClose enough.
