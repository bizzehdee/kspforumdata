At present, most people use either the stock Clamp-o-trons or Fusty\u0027s CBMs, both of which are technically compatible with the station parts pack, but I felt that certain improvements could be made:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The stock Clamp-o-trons is most commonly used due to ease and their androgynity (i.e. no confusing drogue \u0026amp; chute or male \u0026amp; female distinctions), but does not match the FusTek aesthetic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Fusty\u0027s CBMs are (mostly) visually compatible with the modules, but strangely uses red trim (rather than the yellow found on the modules themselves). Another issue is androgynity - his CBMs come in both Active and Passive formats, as inspired by the real ISS\u0027s CBMs, but contrary to the actual usage of pairing one Active port to one Passive port, the in-game parts are actually androgynous as well, making any visual distinction redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Both docking systems physically and visually obstruct the hatches on the modules. Whilst usually a non-issue, I figured it would be neat if Kerbals could still EVA out of hatches and right through docking ports in emergencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Another popular request was for the docking ports to have lights built into them, to help with illumination and docking alignment. This otherwise would require attaching additional standalone lights around docking nodes, thereby increasing station part count and lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s what I have in mind for my tentatively-dubbed \u003Cstrong\u003EImproved Androgynous Common Berthing Mechanisms (IACBMs)\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Essentially a ring with a square hole to allow the module\u0027s existing hatches to be used\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 1.25 and 2.5m sizes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Androgynous\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Matches the FusTek aesthetic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Built-in toggleable lights\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Usable with a hypothetical FusTek truss system\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T06:00:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 06:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Read have Read","CreatedById":60863,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T18:32:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the Kerbonauts slept with their head towards the window and feet towards the aisle, how far would their compartment protrude into the aisle? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume that the floor and celing of the habitation module will be more bins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The IACBM sounds like a good idea.
