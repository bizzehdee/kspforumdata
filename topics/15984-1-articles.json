Designed and engineered by one of Kerbal\u0027s most illustrious Fortune 500 companies, SpaceTech; who are best known for their catchy motto \u0027Where no mun has gone before!\u0022. This craft is capable of attaining any orbit (and landing), including an advanced highly elliptical stable transfer orbit of the sun and the kerbal homeworld. The craft has a simple but elegant 3 stage rocket setup, and a very stable lift off (with advanced S.A.S.) and also maintains 100% structural integrity even when the engines are pushed to their limits (i.e. no wobbly bits!). It is relatively easy to maneuver and stabilize in space due to its RCS thruster placement and adequate supply of RCS thruster fuel. The first stage will give you approx. 230,000 to 450,000\u002B (K) height before burning out and needing to be jettisoned (depending on how you burn it). Its capabilities are primarily limited to the pilots performance.
