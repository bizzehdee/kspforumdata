It\u0027s really the difference between Russian and US tech. What engineers call, \u0022the best is the enemy of the good,\u0022 or the old (false) tale of the expensive orbital pen versus plain ol\u0027 pencil joke. The bottom line is that ultimately the Russians have done more in space (OK, at least since 1972, but that\u0027s 40\u002B years), and done it more cheaply and safely. And the Soyuz is STILL kicking around, nearly 50 years after its first flight, while the shuttle has come and gone. So they can only take three people up. They still ended up with seven space stations (vs. the US one) and about three times as many launches. In terms of quality, the shuttle is arguably better -- in terms of sheer quantity (and more importantly, reliability), the Soyuz wins hands down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd reliability is good if you\u0027re flying in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-12T14:23:09Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2014 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by JenBurdoo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JayJayChallenges","CreatedById":100583,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T14:07:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Godot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Godot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne would guess that the running costs for a space shuttle mission would be lower than that for the Soyuz,\u003Cp\u003Econsidering the fact that (aside from the external tank) all parts have a chance to be reused in further missions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(after checkup and potentially necessary repairs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast to the Soyuz, where no part of the spaceship can be reused\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I agree ... an astronomy cicle where noone knows anything about Soyuz is rather strange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope the knowledge of your fellow members with regards to stars and constellations is greater than their knowledge about spacecraft \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, my friends and me are more interested in space flight then stars and stuff.
