In stock KSP this would functionally be no different than a Hitchhiker module sitting on the surface.\n\nDo you just want a Hitchhiker module with a new texture, or do you want something that you have to deploy and then wait 3 months?\n\nIf you want off-world construction, see [EPL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545). For base building, see [MKS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588) (which can use/extend EPL and [Karbonite](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89401)). With those you could send a drilling platform that mines Ore and then produces a base."},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T09:02:19Z","Content":"Hi\n\nI think it would be better to go forward like this:\n\n- new cubical hitchhiker module with new texture and pronoe to spacce radiation.\n\n- Scoop uo some moon dust and build building blocks with it (really worked on by nasa)\n\n- Put the blocks with KIS or KAS arnound your module to shield from radiotion or any other cold or whatever to have the need to make the blocks :-)\n\nalso this could be broke up into parts for the 3d printer building machinefor multiple launches :-)\n\njust my 2 cents :-)"}]}
