Personally I bought that one because of its higher clock per core compared to the 8350 (for gaming) but if you do a lot of media editing and conversions, or any true multithreaded task the 8350 should blow it out of the water. Of course there are higher clocked 8 core (AMD\u0027s fancy way of saying quad core with hyperthreading if we\u0027re being honest) Piledriver chips but IMO they don\u0027t provide the extra bang to justify the price increase, unless they\u0027ve gone down. And yes they are AM3\u002B processors. Also keep in mind FX series processors are unlocked out of the box for easy over clocking provided you have a system capable of it, something you may want to consider. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, if you do decide to go bigger and badder the 9370 should fall within your stated budget and give an increase over both the others in all CPU intensive tasks, multithreaded or not. (Assuming the processor is the bottleneck for the given task, although I\u0027d imagine the graphics card would be in that setup for gaming even with the 4350). If you\u0027re going to go for the 9370 you may want something closer to a GTX 770 if I\u0027m remembering my numbers correctly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I would say please consider building your computer yourself unless you\u0027re just really not comfortable with it, you will save money especially if you\u0027re going to start upgrading it as soon as you unpack it, and you have control over part quality. Do some research of course but IMO if you can change the processor and graphics card, you can build the whole thing. Only confusing part is hooking up the hardware buttons and lights, and that should be documented.

I would unplug and replug pretty much everything (any cards, SATA connectors, and especially clean and reseat the RAM because that\u0027s usually the culprit for behavior like that in my experience). Also it wouldn\u0027t hurt to check for any wires that may have been pinched and if there are any, perform the wiggle test... Hook a volt meter to it if applicable and wiggle to make sure the wire isn\u0027t broken in that spot.

For the most part I will probably use it no differently than I used my Android tablets, but what about that one time when you\u0027re out and need to do something only a \u0022computer\u0022 can do? I think that\u0027s what makes these stand out. I\u0027ll be able to do what I need to do without opening the app store and praying that someone wrote one that can do what I need or want. FTP programs, light graphics / sound / video editing, small games, making a bootable flash drive, etc. It could never replace a desktop or even a laptop, but it will make a darn good effort to get you by in a pinch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I am in love with Windows 8/8.1 on the desktop. Despite all the bad comments, I think it is the best OS Microsoft even made and arguably the best OS of all. I think the main problem is that people wanted to treat it as Windows 7 and then it is rather disappointing. As soon as you accept some things are working differently and you need to get used to those, everyhting is fine. People do not like change and Microsoft is a bit awkward when it comes to pitching new ideas to people to and that is where it all went wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really think it is a shame 8.1 is a step back from 8. I understand the next version is going to step even further back with the old start menu. I do understand Microsoft had to do something, but I feel it is sad that a good OS gets clipped because people cannot get used to a couple of new things. I would also hate to see the OS go the cloud route, as Microsoft just released a memo saying that they are moving that way. I really want full control over whether I do things local or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not a fan of Metro on the desktop myself but it\u0027s perfect for touch. I think the OS itself is a step in the right direction, not including the cloud integration they\u0027re trying to push. I really liked the way the OS ran. It just felt quicker and less bloated, have better memory management, and I liked the new task manager and file copy dialog. I\u0027ve said it before, I think there should be an option on your first boot to run \u0022classic\u0022 (Windows 7 theme) mode or \u0022regular\u0022 8.x mode, for people who don\u0027t adjust to the new flavor well or just like the old look for a particular application, rather than dumb down the whole system. I haven\u0027t looked into the differences between 8 and 8.1 so I can\u0027t comment on that one yet, but I really hope they don\u0027t go the Chromebook route or anything crazy like that in the future. I\u0027d have to disown Microsoft for that one... My computer must be fully functional offline. Sure cloud is nice for budget machines like the DV8P because it\u0027s cheaper for the manufacturers and therefore us to put less memory in them, but cloud can\u0027t replace a good old card slot and it\u0027s slow as molasses for anything that would actually warrant storing remotely (for me at least). Maybe I\u0027m just paranoid but I don\u0027t like the idea of broadcasting the contents of my computer to the internet for some intrepid hacker to stumble upon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I just read an overview of the 8.1 and its update, and from what I read I think it\u0027s a pretty good idea. It seems to allow the best of both worlds and keep the oldschool folks happier while not leaving out the new bits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave you checked out some other packages?
