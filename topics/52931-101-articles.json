Have ALL THE screenshots!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI performed two tests, and here are the results:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a test with a very simple, standard rocket, all using stock beginner parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/ozt6o/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/ozt6o/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach screenshot corresponds to the state after the space bar was pressed (minus the launchpad and landing shots, for some reason imgur didn\u0027t let me edit titles to make it more clear).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that there is no \u0027phantom stage\u0027 anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe chute should\u0027ve opened on the 3rd image (2nd space bar). But instead it opens on the 4th (3rd space bar, even though there were only 2 stages).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second test is with a very slightly more complex rocket, all using stock beginner parts, simple design for an atmospheric lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame format as the above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/082d0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/082d0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(imgur let me edit the title/description of this second upload, so no explanation needed here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I did this test is because this problem becomes particularly annoying when the chute isn\u0027t the last stage, as you can see. Thankfully, I had the throttle down to 0% at the end, but if I didn\u0027t, things would go very wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALSO, make note of the \u0027phantom stage\u0027 2 in the second test, after 2nd spacebar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in one test, I do get the phantom stage you mention, and in the other, I don\u0027t. Not sure what conclusion can be drawn from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in both cases, as you can see, I need to stage twice for the parachute to go on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor both tests, no other interaction was done with the rocket besides turning on SAS, controlling the throttle, steering the rocket to west, and pressing the spacebar to stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-20T00:00:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2014 12:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Zeenobit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bobprime","CreatedById":115505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T02:43:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I have been having the exact same problem as @Zeenobit.
