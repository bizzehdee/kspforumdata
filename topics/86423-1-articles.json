I spent a few minutes looking into it and have discovered that if you are having the same problem, all you need to do is go to Kerbal Space Program \u0026gt; GameData \u0026gt; Squad \u0026gt; Parts \u0026gt; Utility and rename commsdish16 to longAntenna. (the pre-.25 name of the part file) I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E if you are expirencing any problems with stockalike parts not loading, if you rename the part the mod\u0027s part is based off of back to its pre-.25 name, it will fix you\u0027re problem. This will probably break with updates, but its a temporary fix to avoid your ships being deleted until the mod itself updates to fix this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-08T01:57:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2014 01:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Paperback Writer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T02:54:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENooooo, this is a \u003Cstrong\u003Every bad idea\u003C/strong\u003E.
