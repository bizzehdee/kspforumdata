I\u0027ve been trying to figure out how to give suggestions to the mod community. I don\u0027t have many and I started this thread only thinking about one in particular. But if there isn\u0027t any other place, id like this to be a place where players can give their ideas, some may be extravagant, some small and practical. but I\u0027ve always wondered how all these mods get created without some central brainstorming type area. I could plead to ksp devs themselves, but this seems more promising.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I\u0027m in the wrong place, please kindly point me in the right direction and ill repost there, or a mod can just move this..to there, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways lets get it started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestion: (Asparagus style?)
