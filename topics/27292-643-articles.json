The lifter initially made it to orbit with over 100 LF remaining, so I added a FL-T400, Terrier and decoupler to the end, so it can fulfill a couple of satellite contracts (a ~3000km over Kerbin one, and a Mun equatorial one). The boosters are attached to drop-tanks, which are used as spacers, and attached to the inline cockpit, which is a reasonable reshuffle of their locations, I think. Also, now that I\u0027ve scraped together the science for a proper retractable landing gear for planes, there\u0027s no longer a need for a spacer between the shuttle and the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/szZhAU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022szZhAU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/UnGKx7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UnGKx7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELifter ran out while circularising, so I decoupled the shuttles with their engines firing.

Also, proof that solar panels work through the closed doors of a service bay.
