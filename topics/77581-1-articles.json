This had gained some momentum last year into this year, but I haven\u0027t heard of any recent developments, so it may have fallen off again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have mild asthma and I wear glasses, but I\u0027m healthy enough for a Third-Class medical certificate for Private pilot. I believe Commercial License requires a Second-Class medical and Airline Transport Pilot requires a First-Class (I forget what an Instructor rating requires). Unfortunately I have a family history of diabetes, so if I do contract diabetes later in life, that would disqualify me on my next attempt to renew my medical certificate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a \u0022medical Catch-22\u0022 with the US FAA in that a Glider license (I have that as well) and a Sport Pilot license do not require a medical certificate, only the acknowledgement that you have no reason to believe that you have any medical condition that would prohibit your ability to fly.\u0022 If you have a medical certificate already and contract a medical condition, you will be denied a new certificate when you try and renew your medical certificate. This would also prevent you from obtaining or using an existing Glider or Sport Pilot rating as the FAA would now have a record of a \u0022known medical condition that would prohibit you from flying.\u0022 However, if you let your medical certificate lapse (expire) and do not attempt to renew after you contract a medical condition that would prohibit you from flying, the FAA would not have a record and you could fly gliders or sport planes without a medical certificate. Of course you would be violating the part about \u0022known medical condition\u0022 should you get yourself into trouble. It is a technique that I have heard about from time to time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOften times, older private pilots will get a regular physical exam before the FAA medical exam to find out if they have any conditions that would deny them a new medical certificate. That way they can avoid being denied while retaining the technical ability to fly other aircraft (even if they should not).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
