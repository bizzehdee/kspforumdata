Not sure how the lighting on the clouds is handled but I thought perhaps it could be manually \u0022biased\u0022 to make it match the terminator, rbray would know better about this.\n\nFor the ambient lighting color I thought about this a while back but never tried it, I guess that now I\u0027m attempting to add planetshine and playing with lights I could also give it a try, the color may have to be set manually and if you\u0027re really higher up in the atmosphere it may look weird if it only evaluates the camera\u0027s distance to the sunset and not the distance of every individual point. Another solution could be to create a shader that evaluates the light color as filtered through the atmosphere for every point in view and apply that color to the terrain, using the same exinction mechanism used for the sun color, but applying it for every point in the terrain instead of sunlight received by the camera. This would give correct results and color everywhere and automatically depending on the atmosphere properties. The cost for the far camera would be quite small, It would however need to be applied to the near camera also which may necessitate rendering an additional depth buffer, so there\u0027s a lot to explore here ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nEdited: Btw I\u0027m trying to fix the ocean disappearing when rotating the camera or being in orbit now, if I can do that I\u0027ll get rid of the ocean faked in postprocessing (which causes z-fighting), and then I could probably get away with rendering a huge depth buffer for the whole scene at once and not just the far camera.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-15T16:50:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2016 04:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"pingopete","CreatedById":74168,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T16:50:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I was thinking about this but thought it would be problematic to find out where the terminator starts with the scatterer atmosphere.
