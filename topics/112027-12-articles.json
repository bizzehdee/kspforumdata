That is, in my mind, setting emissivity \u0026gt;1 isn\u0027t meant to imply that the radiator violates the laws of physics, but instead that it has some sophisticated engineering (e.g., a refrigeration circuit that pumps heat to specific heat dissipation elements of the radiator, which become much hotter than the panel as a whole) that allows it to operate in a manner slightly more complicated than the physics that KSP chooses to simulate, therefore requiring abstraction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe thing to keep in mind here is that doing this wouldn\u0027t have to be done to make the Near Future radiators work with the stock modules. They would work perfectly fine with no changes other than perhaps price and mass, and they\u0027d in fact be minimally better per area offered because they \u003Cem\u003Ealready\u003C/em\u003E have the highest possible (realistic) emissiveConstant, higher than what the stock radiators offer. But they would not truly offer anything new besides fancy emissives. (Which are, admittedly, one of my favorite things.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, I\u0027m confident that the intended \u0022matching sets\u0022 of conformal radiators (e.g., four GR-1s for an MX-1 reactor) will no longer be sufficient to cool their corresponding reactors, unless we drastically change the reactor heat properties (by giving them super high nominal \u0026amp; critical temps and/or much lower heat output). If Nertea chooses to retire the assumption that a reactor\u0027s matching conformal radiators should provide sufficient cooling, so be it. But, personally, I\u0027d like to see this reactor/radiator relationship protected, even if it requires some slightly silly config values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s precisely that which irks me. Build a part that does something novel and useful, and it requires fudging physics? Okay, may be acceptable. I eventually went with advocating fudging the physics on the DS01 Charon MPDT because it turned out that the size-0-to-size-0 bulkhead connection arbitrarily limits thermal conductivity to a huge degree. But build a part that is redundant, then fudge physics in order to justify its existence? That just feels contrived... Now of course, Nertea\u0027s parts came first and the new stock radiators merely sniped their reason to exist, so nobody can blame anyone for seeking new and novel ways to keep them relevant. I just think that fudging physics should be a last resort, not a weapon of choice.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs described above, I am not proposing this \u0022fudge\u0022 simply to justify the radiators\u0027 existence.

I have some vague ideas, but they\u0027re all pointless to discuss as long as I don\u0027t properly understand how NF reactors will run with stock radiators and proper skin stats. Once there is a test build available, this will certainly be the focus of my testing activities.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair enough. I understand that this discussion is largely speculative until we have a test build. That said, I think the question of whether or not it is justified to fudge (or, as I\u0027d like to think of it, \u0022abstract\u0022) the physics of Nertea\u0027s radiators is likely to be of key importance.
