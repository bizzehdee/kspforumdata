Instead of using you clean steam install for modding and playing the game, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecopy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the whole \u0027\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal Space Program\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027 folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Then find some where on your hard-drive you can use to paste the copied folder and play the game from e.g I have an External Hard-drive, which I use to back-up things as well as install games too, so in my case the game is run from \u0027\u003Cstrong\u003E(E:) - Games - Kerbal Space Program\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you can mod your game with however you like (note- the games folder is also where I have CKAN placed, If you don\u0027t know what CKAN is then you should look it up it makes Modding A LOT easier.), and also this means you can just leave the version of KSP you installed through steam as your go to clean copy in case you mess up and need to restart from scratch. As all you then need to just do is delete the folder of KSP you using then just copy and paste from the clean version of KSP in your steam folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that last or any of it has made sense, if not, or you just have a question(s) please just ask and I will do my best to answer them and help.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVitavoro\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-06T03:52:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2016 03:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vitavoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
