All other bodies are completely ignored. Therefore, you can think of a sphere of influence as if it was a single body floating on it\u0027s own, so **gravity acts as a conservative force** for the spacecraft with respect to the body.

You will orbit Mun in a perfect ellipse or hyperbola (depending on your velocity). If you enter Mun\u0027s SOI you are (by definition) going downward at a certain velocity at the exact distance from Mun that its SOI extends. If you trace that ellipse or Hyperbola to the other side where you\u0027re back at the height of Mun\u0027s SOI, you are going UP at that exact same velocity. And you escape Mun\u0027s SOI.\n\nThat this occasionally doesn\u0027t happen isn\u0027t due to my math being wrong. It\u0027s due to the granularity of the simulation on very rare occasions mucking up perfection."},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T06:45:00Z","Content":"That\u0027s an error. \n\nI have learned long ago, never ever ever EVER trust the prediction system, just plan your nodes one step at a time and manual burn while keeping a close watch."},{"CreatedByName":"Mythos","CreatedById":137308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T10:40:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E never ever ever EVER trust the prediction system, just plan your nodes one step at a time\n\nI do use multiple maneuver nodes planned ahead, IF it looks reasonable.
