I think it\u0027s just relevant to say it\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003Egrosso modo\u003C/em\u003E technique, it\u0027s more of an approximation I took on a guess and that turns out to actually work. I\u0027ll just repost my reply earlier to show you what I mean:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright here it goes.

Here, stage 4, 3 and 2 are used to get in orbit. So let\u0027s start with stage 4, who has 1476 of delta V in atmosphere and 1724 in vacuum. Thus, it has this 1000m/s to himself. So, if we take away, 1000m/s from the fourth stage atmospheric delta V, theres 476m/s left. 476/1476=0.32, meaning that 32% of the fuel will be left in the stage when it passes the \u0022atmospheric limit\u0022. So, there will be 32% left of the vacuum delta V, so 0.32*1742=562m/s. So, for our first stage, wel\u0027ll get 1000m/s atmospheric \u002B 562 vacuum, meaning we get a total of 1562m/s from our first stage. Then the other stages are considered vacuum, so 1562\u002B1863\u002B1197 = 4595m/s of delta V in total for our launch stage. To prove this out, I launched it with MechJeb to an altitude of 80k to have the most precise results possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B6CYffC.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B6CYffC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B6CYffC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we can see that the total delta V expanded to get into orbit is 4530m/s and there\u0027s roughly 125m/s left in the launch stage, so the total delta V of the rocket was actually 4655m/s, which is only 60m/s from the predicted 4595m/s. So yeah that\u0027s how I calculate my stuff. If you have multiple stages to get the first 1000m/s, just calculate the first as atmospheric and you do the same math as I did above to approximate the delta V of the one who goes through the limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe results will vary a bit depending on your TWR and such but it should usually be pretty darn accurate.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, at least you guys know where this comes from.
