For example, here is my stock Saturn V replica (link in my signature):\n\n[![kNdo2s7h.png](http://i.imgur.com/kNdo2s7h.png)](http://imgur.com/kNdo2s7)\n\nZekes has also made some cool renders of his full-size stock Space Shuttle. This utility opens up a lot of cool possibilities for presenting KSP craft, so I wanted to create this thread to allow people to show off their KSP Blender renders.\n\nMore details on how to do this here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111483-KSPBlender-Blender-addon-for-importing-craft-files](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111483-KSPBlender-Blender-addon-for-importing-craft-files)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T15:00:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GusTurbo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T15:00:25Z","Content":"Oh!
