But so far, I\u0027ve only used them as a local transportation system around KSC and in the immediate area for crew recovery. Are the lift/flight dynamics/etc the same on Duna as they are on Kerbin? Obviously the gravity would be different, but is there any other difference?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-10T20:27:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2014 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tstehler1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quasarrgames","CreatedById":91692,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T02:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell on duna of course the atmosphere is 10 times thinner, so you need a LOT of wings to make it work, but other than that the aerodynamic physics work the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T02:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do believe the magic wing ratio is unachievable on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T02:34:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe atmospheric model is the same on all bodies, it\u0027s just the surface pressure and gravity that differ.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T12:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022quasarrgames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022quasarrgames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell on duna of course the atmosphere is 10 times thinner, so you need a LOT of wings to make it work, but other than that the aerodynamic physics work the same.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts actually only 5 times thinner... or rather, 1/5th as thick.... at the lowest points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts scale height is also less, so it gets thinner faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T18:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget though that the only other place jets work is Laythe, so you\u0027ll have to use rockets elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T22:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re really interested in flying on Duna, check out this challenge thread to review what others have done there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50619-Flying-Duna-AGAIN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50619-Flying-Duna-AGAIN\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd maybe even enter the challenge if you feel up to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, though, flying on Duna requires the lightest possible airframe to do the job with absolutely the most wing area you can cram on it, plus about 2-3x as much control surfaces as you\u0027d use on Kerbin. Also, it needs an engine that doesn\u0027t require oxygen, which basically limits you to A) ions, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E, electric props/rotors from Firespitter, c) the Kethane engine, and D) thermal turbojets from Interstellar. You can, of course, use rockets instead but in that case there\u0027s no point in having a wing. Spaceplanes aren\u0027t really a thing on Duna. Instead, you have a choice of a dedicated airplane or a dedicated rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf the above propulsion systems, ion and electric limit your to about 6000m maximum altitude and about 100m/s. The thermal turbojets let you go much higher and faster but by that point you\u0027re more of a rocket than an airplane so why have a wing? The Kethane jet DOES work on Duna but its very finicky. Unlike regular jets which are limited by IntakeAir, the Kethane jet is limited by KintakeAir which doesn\u0027t go away with higher altitude. Instead, it goes away with higher speed. The Kethane jet likes to fly full power at low speed (it was designed for Eve) so on Duna where there\u0027s very little drag, it tends to get too fast and flame out. It thus works best for boost-glide flights because once it flames out, you probably won\u0027t get it started again until you stop after landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually entering Dua\u0027s atmosphere from space and flying around there aren\u0027t that difficult. The 2 primary difficulties are 1) landing and 2) getting off from Kerbin. As to landing, about 80% of Duna\u0027s surface is rolling dune fields at about 2500-3500m elevation. The rest is mountains and a few depressions. It\u0027s relatively easy to land in the depressions because the air is thicker and the ground is fairly flat. But if you\u0027re stuck only landing in depressions, why bother sending a plane? So what you need to do is be able to land out in the dune fields, which are like 16,000m equivalent on Kerbin. To do this, you have to be able to fly VERY slowly so you can stop before the small flat spot between sand dunes ends tragically \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. Because the air is thin, airbrakes don\u0027t work very well and the low gravity limits wheel braking, so your best bet is some sort of retro thrust or VTOL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving solved these problems, you now have a featherweight plane with a huge wing, which will be utterly incapable of vertical launch atop a rocket on Kerbin. You might thus have to build a HUGE SSTO spaceplane ascent stage on the back and fly it up horizontally, or use some sort of cage lifter, or give up and use Orbital Construction instead of flying it to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, flying on Duna IMHO is one of the least-appreciated challenges in KSP. Certainly it\u0027s more of chore than landing on Tylo. I wish more folks would do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
