The sound stuttering is a bug in KSP itself. It happens any time the game runs slowly. I\u0027m guessing that ASE slows your game down just enough for this to happen.

One of them is, as mentioned before, the issue with the condensation effects dropping my FPS down to 1-2 (many craft stay around Mach 1 for a while too, meaning a lot of lag).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here\u0027s the bigger problem. I don\u0027t know if other people had this before or not, but when I changed the condensation and the distortion both to 0 (the distortion effect seemed to make all of my sounds really distorted all the time), nothing changed. I still have condensation and distortion. So then I uninstalled the mod (completely removed the AtmosphericSoundEnhancement folder) and it STILL has condensation effects and distortion. I\u0027m looking at maybe having to reinstall the whole game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother, less important, issue is that I noticed the shockwave cone when I moved my camera around in one of my spaceplanes once, but I haven\u0027t been seeing it with any of my rockets after going above Mach 1. I haven\u0027t tried it again recently with a spaceplane, so I\u0027m not sure if other mods may be affecting it, or if my version is broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: It seems to have been related to the HotRockets mod.
