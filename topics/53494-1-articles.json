But, in the case that it did, you\u0027d probably want to boost your vehicle up into a highly elliptical orbit and make the retrograde burn at apoapsis where you\u0027re moving the slowest, and then re-circularize when you come back down. Reversing your orbit in LKO will take a huge amount of fuel, more than 4 km/s worth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T04:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBurning \u0022northward\u0022 or \u002Bnormal will change your inclination. The best place to do this is at the ascending or descending node, whichever is farthest away from the target or orbited body. The thing about it is, \u0022northward\u0022 or \u002Bnormal will change as your inclination changes, so it can be difficult to tell exactly where to point your rocket without mechjeb, but it is doable in the stock game. You have to watch how the apoapsis and/or the periapsis change, or rather don\u0027t change if pointed \u002Bnormal, as well as how the retrograde and prograde markers change. \u002BNormal is exactly in between the prograde and retrograde markers on the horizon line (I think). There is a mod that enhances the navball that might help with this, if mechjeb is not your thing. : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50524-0-22-Enhanced-Navball-1-2?highlight=enhanced\u002Bnavball\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50524-0-22-Enhanced-Navball-1-2?highlight=enhanced\u002Bnavball\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T04:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo your target is retrograde and you are prograde, or vice-versa?
