Sadly, I think the whole Kerbal History concept is kinda dead by this point due to too many people having radically different ideas about the tone of the overall thing and what level of silliness should apply. On the one end we\u0027ve got the alternate history buffs who keep making stories about land being conquered and traded between the Krepublics, KSSRs, etc. and on the other hand we have people saying the universe gets destroyed every five years by giant space ponies. In the end it\u0027s just a confusing mess :\\\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
