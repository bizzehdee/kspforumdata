I\u0027m aware that you don\u0027t\u00A0ever strictly need a refueling base but they are fun to set up (though not always to use) and I feel that with massive colony-style ships assembled in orbit they do make some sense rather than launching full tanks all the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever I\u0027m not sure that there\u0027s any real value to them for exit burns given that I have my interplanetary craft fully fueled in either \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E (fuel from launches)\u00A0or orbit of a moon (fuel from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E), obviously the Oberth effect can be used from a fueling station but given the 800-900m/s burn required to lower periapsis (plus plane change if using Minmus) to Xkm would the Oberth effect still be worth it compared to just starting in a circular orbit at Xkm with full tanks?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that the answer is \u0027No\u0027 for the closer planets like Duna - for which the ideal solution would probably be to burn directly from the fuel station. but what about the further planets like Jool?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still have options for using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E within Kerbin obviously but I don\u0027t want to go to the trouble of creating a fuel outpost on Minmus (for example) if it isn\u0027t actually going to be beneficial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-10T11:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used to do a lot of refueling at Minmus.

Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E was referring to, is the drop down from Minmus. At that point, your orbit is highly elliptical rather than circular. In that case, it\u0027s all about energy. When you accelerate at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E, you\u0027re getting more benefit than you would at a 300km circular orbit. It\u0027s going to be a short burn to the outer planets. And to me, Minmus is the most effective place to mine and refuel because of the low gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you say the timing is tough, you\u0027re exactly right. You need Minmus to be between Kerbin and the sun (or just before actually, because of the time it takes to drop down), and it pretty much never is. You have a choice to go early or late. I prefer to go late. Jool is such an easy target, you can\u0027t miss. At the speed you\u0027re moving and distance you\u0027re travelling, very slight adjustments have a large impact. Moving the maneuver node itself, even a few minutes one way or another, has an even larger impact. It\u0027s something you have to play around with to test the possibilities. It works just about as well for Eeloo. Again, it\u0027s a long distance, and a decent target, so small adjustments make a big difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t recommend it for Dres, though.
