The first self replicating molecule surrounded itself with a phospholipid bilayer. Was that unnatural or (dare I say it ) supernatural? What about the first single celled organisms that formed colonies. Was that unnatural? Many animals use tools including animals you would think are kind of stupid, like small birds.
