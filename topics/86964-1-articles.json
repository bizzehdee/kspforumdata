And one of the things I think would be really fun, would be scenarios... For instance an Armageddon(movie) type scenario would be a lot of fun... Huge asteroid headed towards Kerbin. You have to deal with it whatever way you think you can... Maybe go up and strap some GIANT boosters to it and push it off course from Kerbin. Or (if we could get nuclear weapons parts) just like the movie go up drill it and plant a nuke in it and blow it in half lol, in which case poor Jebediah has to stay behind and activiate the nuke manually lol. Another neat Scenario would be having to deal with a massive solar flare.. Maybe have to build a giant satellite to either absorb the flare with solar panels or reflect it with mirrors. Maybe Planet X would be a fun one, Alien invasion (if they happen to change their mind on aliens).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso something I think would be cool.. having a reason to go other planets. Maybe go discover advanced but ancient technologies left by an ancient (now extinct) civilization and discover new materials etc..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the devs dont do any of these then a modder definitely should imo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways what do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-11T17:53:39Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2014 05:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by diomedea\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eremoved forbidden topic, WNTS.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T22:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethere are scenarios... next to resume save and tutorials and there are a couple ARM missions.
