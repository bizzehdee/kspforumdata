Purchase and use of in-game items or currency through a Software Store are subject to the Software Store\u0027s governing documents, including but not limited to, the Terms of Service and User Agreement. This online service has been sublicensed to you by the Software Store. Licensor may offer discounts or promotions on the purchase of VC, and such discounts and promotions may be modified or discontinued by Licensor at any time without notice to you. Upon completing an authorized purchase of VC from an Application Store, the amount of purchased VC will be credited to your User Account. The Licensor shall establish a maximum amount you may spend to purchase VC per transaction and/or per day, which may vary depending on the associated Software. Licensor, in its sole discretion, may impose additional limits on the amount of VC you may purchase or use, how you may use VC, and the maximum balance of VC that may be credited to your User Account. You are solely responsible for all VC purchases made through your User Account regardless of whether or not authorized by you.\u003Cbr style=\u0022padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nBALANCE CALCULATION: You can access and view your available VC and VG in your User Account when logged into your User Account. Licensor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make all calculations regarding the available VC and VG in your User Account. Licensor further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the amount of and manner in which VC is credited and debited from your User Account in connection with your purchase of VG or for other purposes. While Licensor strives to make all such calculations on a consistent and reasonable basis, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Licensor\u0027s determination of the available VC and VG in your User Account is final, unless you can provide documentation to Licensor that such calculation was or is intentionally incorrect.\u003Cbr style=\u0022padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nUSING VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL GOODS: All purchased in-game Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods may be consumed or lost by players in the course of gameplay according to the game\u0027s rules applicable to currency and goods, which may vary depending on the associated Software. VC and VG may only be used within the Software, and Licensor, in its sole discretion, may limit use of VC and/or VG to a single game. The authorized uses and purposes of VC and VG may change at any time. Your available VC and/or VG as shown in your User Account will be reduced each time you use VC and/or VG within the Software. The use of any VC and/or VG constitutes a demand against and withdrawal from your available VC and/or VG in your User Account. You must have sufficient available VC and/or VG in your User Account in order to complete a transaction within the Software. VC and/or VG in your User Account may be reduced without notice upon the occurrence of certain events related to your use of the Software: For example, you may lose VC or VG upon the loss of a game or the death of your character.
