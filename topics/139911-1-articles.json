Now, when I am playing, I saw that at the branch with the Colozination, there are no new parts. Same thing goes with \u0022Advanced Solar Technology\u0022, \u0022Advanced Photovoltic Materials, \u0022Enhanced Survivability\u0022, \u0022Simple Command Modules\u0022, \u0022Colozination (told you already)\u0022, \u0022Advanced Colozination\u0022, Hydroponics, Advanced Gridded Thrusters, Experimental Gridded Thrusters, Colossal Rockery, Gigantic Rockery, Experimental Actuators, Exotic Alloys, Specialized Flight Systems, Experimental Aircraft Engine, Advanced Aerospace Engineering, Spceialized Command Modules, Ressource Exploitation, Scientific Outposts, Mechatronics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I deinstalled the whole game, removed manually completely KSP (backuped all my mods and saves). I started a new stock-game, Tech Tree completely normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) I started a new game, just with Comm Tech Tree installed, there is the above described problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) I start a new game with all mods, same problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am starting to ask myself, if that I maybe can unlock them because the Comm Tech Tree says so, but all parts of my mods will be unlocked by the other \u0022levels\u0022, cause I don\u0027t have really the feeling that something misses, or am I wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout Tac Life Support: I can not activate it - I do have all the parts, but at my older save before the 1.1 Update (I didn\u0027t play for a long time\u0022), I could activate TAC when I looked at my whole Space Center because there was a extra toolbar button. Now, I have only \u0022Show Megajoule Manager\u0022 and \u0022Toggle VAB Thermal Helper\u0022. Did I install it wrong? I delete every modfile before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast but not least, when I am in space, MechJeb is on the right side as it was before. But know, the normal toolbar from the stock game and the extra toolbar buttons like Kerbal Alarm clock and so on are not anymore on the top of my screen! They are now on the right side, unfortunately, on the same position as MechJeb, which is kind of annoying. Can I fix that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T00:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for CTT,\u00A0the empty nodes contain parts in mods that you don\u0027t have.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for TACLS, it\u0027s no longer supported by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57742-taraniselsu/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257742\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57742-taraniselsu/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@TaranisElsu\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139016-112-tac-life-support-dev-thread/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere is the 1.1 version. \u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the Mechjeb icon, you might be able to move the Mechjeb icon.
