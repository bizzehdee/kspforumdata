NACA as it existed was mostly an aeronautical research organization, whose primary accomplishment was their involvement with the X-1. As the Space Race began NACA also coordinated most of the efforts different organizations (from private industry to government programs) were making towards space.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce Sputnik was launched, everybody freaked and as such most space efforts going on in the US at the time were merged under a new civil space program, called NASA.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was in all the papers: [url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Advisory_Committee_for_Aeronautics#Transformation_into_NASA[/url]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T21:02:56Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Pawelk198604\u0027]I wonder why NASA was established, do not get me wrong, thanks to NASA man landed on the moon.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wonder why this institution at all changed its name had to count the total time the existence of two venerable institutions that NASA has already hundredth anniversary.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wonder if it was just a rebranding ;)[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was because space was now involved, methinks.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T22:54:43Z","Content":"\nNACA was specifically an organization for air travel.
