You have to remember that KSP models physics for each and every part on the ship, to be able to keep up with structural stress, collisions, etc. You almost have to think about it like this.. Your not launching one ship. Your launching 360 little ships all ducttaped together. Design optimization is crucial when dealing with large ships to try and get the job done with the fewest parts possible. It sounds like you were borderline to begin with, but when you added the other mods, the extra CPU time needed to run the code in the added plugins pushed you over the edge and the simulation started falling apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe faster the processor you have, (and possibly video card, not sure if the game uses physx and offloads some workload to the GPU or not for nvidia gpu\u0027s) the larger and more complicated ships you can get away with building before running into problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CkGordon","CreatedById":51332,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-14T16:34:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d recommend that when you get to slideshow mode on your design, you don\u0027t say \u0022oh, my computers having trouble running this, lets add more crap for it to process!\u0022.

To my experience, including other games with similar dynamics, adding more constraints only makes things worse. They all pull and tear on each other and will eventually work against each other. I remember playing a physics based bridge building game called Pontifex, in which you add together every link individually. Just like any curious person eventually would, one time I decided to test the limits and put together hundreds of parts together into a very dense cluster. In the simulation, the thing actually imploded, and then the game crashed. I have experienced similar behaviours using struts in KSP, although not as brutal. Also, the weight adds up to a lot. Less is more. Play it smart, not by brute force. Triangle shapes are most efficient in terms of material used versus strength and reliability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ameseree","CreatedById":44534,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-14T17:28:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewith my experiences with the zoxygene mod is that the drills cause a lot of lag.
