Upon fixing the issue, I was still able to recover the kerbal(though no misison for it at that point) and then went to terminate its tracking, only to find that I can\u0027t get rid of it, and it appears to have been transformed into an unknown object/asteroid..thing(?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone know of a way I can get rid of this?
