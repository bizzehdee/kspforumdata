I noticed the quicker scene changes, much welcome..but still, while doing so, the music stutters (alot) which just gives it a meh \u0022feeling\u0022 - could you put the music in it\u0027s own independent thread to stop that (as it doesn\u0027t have to be threadsafe I think..)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T15:55:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d normally process into saying KSP isn\u0027t multithreaded so it\u0027s not possible, but I\u0027m having some small hesitation because I know the game itself is multithreaded. It would be possible to put music in it\u0027s own thread for the game, but I don\u0027t know if that would have much of an impact since all threads are being treated as one in the processor. I don\u0027t have the knowledge to pull that out, maybe someone else could clarify this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
