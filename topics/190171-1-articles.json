I think more information is needed on the part and config. Initially it sounds you are not giving each part a unique name, but it could be missing a texture in the folder\u00A0and not loading the part, or missing a closing bracket. For instance are you using \u002BPART[mk1-3pod], or @PART[mk1-3pod] to modify it. Or are you just making a copy of the file and editing it. Do you have ModuleManager installed? If you could post the configs or more information it would help. And as SpannerMonkey mention the drag cubes are all automatically generated in the\u00A0PartDatabase.cfg located where the\u00A0KSP_x64.exe executable is located.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"\uC544\uBB34\uC0DD\uAC01","CreatedById":206320,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-20T03:31:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhey spanner monkey! im korean ksp player.i cant access SM armory download page.What happed to SM armory?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
