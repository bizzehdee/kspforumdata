That, and I wouldn\u0027t know where to begin with configuring the thing for the inevitible aerobreaking/re-entry while deployed that someone is going to do.\n\nThe docking nosecone is something being worked on. A low crew cap hab module isn\u0027t something the stock game really supports without a life-support or kerbal psychology framework to tie it into. As for the cannae drive, no; The envisioned scope of the mk2/mk3 expansion mods doesn\u0027t include non-Newtonian SpaceMagic engines. That, and KSP doesn\u0027t like engines that run on only ElectricCharge. Without a custom plugin, engines require something with mass to throw out the nozzle, be it LiquidFuel, Xenon, Snacks, whatever.\n\n@CptRichardson; Not really?\n\n![ICcwmZ7.png](http://i.imgur.com/ICcwmZ7.png)\n\nIt\u0027s no worse a fit than the mk1 inline cockpit on mk1 stuff, and mk3 craft aren\u0027t the sort of things built to break air-speed records anyway.\n\nHowever,\n\n![egGS1tO.png](http://i.imgur.com/egGS1tO.png)\n\nThe issue I have with a conventional mk3 inline design is all that empty space; it just feels sort of wrong, somehow. I suppose I could stick a pair of windows and give it 4 crew capacity like the other cockpits. Option B is scrapping windows entirely and going with RPM as a hard requirement and making some sort of StarTrek/Dr Who style enclosed central command bridge."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T22:27:13Z","Content":"Agreed, if you want a big centrifuge, wait till porkjet releases his new pack.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-30T13:41:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2015 01:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by davidy12**"},{"CreatedByName":"Siphonophore","CreatedById":149811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T22:32:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E @AJTheMighty: an inflatable centrifuge wouldn\u0027t really work - it would require that nothing be radially attached to it, or the inflating module would clip through the radially attached parts; on a mk3 spaceplane that means players would have to make either huge vessels or design the wings around it.

That way, it\u0027d seem more realistic, and with a compatibility config for KeepFit, this would be an excellent concept, seeing as this is more reminiscent of the Discovery One\u0027s centrifuge.\n\nYes, definitely go with giving it a pair of windows and no bulge on top. It seems a lot more cooler and you can make more streamlined Skylon-esque SSTOs with that. \n\nAs for the Mk3 centrifuge, here are some suggestions for it. I think it should bulge in the center where the rotating part is situated, enabling it to easily house six kerbals, and there could be an arrow on the top and bottom to make it more Kerbal. As for the IVA, I\u0027ll leave that up to you.

The radial parts work on mk3, pretty much identically to the chines and fuselage extensions, except intended for dorsal/ventral placement.\n\nEdit: Doing some mocking up in KSP, the fuselage extensions work almost as well in a dorsal/ventral config.

It just seemed to be a good way to get the effect of an inline cockpit without the internal space issue, though if your fuselage extensions do the job just as well then one extra part might not be so bad.\n\nI really feel bad when I mention a new idea here given the scale of your mods so I\u0027ve been trying to resist the urge to post them though a few like the one we\u0027ve been discussing slip through if they seem to really something to your mod.\n\nWith that in mind could I possibly make another suggestion?\n\nI\u0027ve been looking through some of the other SXT photos and I noticed the ke-111 cockpit, if you don\u0027t know the part I\u0027m referring to its basically a glass nose/cockpit such as you might find on a B-17, B-29 or there German counter parts \n\nI thought something like this would fit in well with the alternative uses for the mk3 parts (such as the deep space ship you posted a few pages back) though as it\u0027s for the 1.25/mk1 scale (I think) you\u0027d have to make something a bit bigger. I would recommend making it in either in 2.5m or 3.75m (leaning more to 3.75m) size so it could fit on the rocket parts as well as the mk3 parts with the use of an adapter. \n\nI know your cyclops cockpit *does* covers some of this but it doesn\u0027t seem to have as much lateral visibility as you would get from this type of cockpit, I will admit that I haven\u0027t used the ke-111 cockpit itself but I have used your mk2 \u0022rover\u0022 cockpit quite a bit and have thoroughly enjoyed the the wider field of view it offers."},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T21:25:28Z","Content":"@Star-Eagle; No worries; a fuselage extension radial cockpit is a logical and sensible thing to include.
