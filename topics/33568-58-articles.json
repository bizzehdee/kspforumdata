The one below (based on a simple Kerbin-Mun-Kerbin flight), made with 4 crafts (network nodes) beyond the current spacecraft and KSC, required about 450s to be output on my machine (that is not precisely slow, quad-core i7 @3.4GHz, 64bit).

Anyway, the different graphs are quite telling. Few things however I would like to suggest:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) the first graph is only about existence or not of a valid path (boolean answer). In itself is difficult to read (vertical bars show transitions, but nothing tells the state between those). This graph is not really needed however while the state is readable from the third graph (number of hops).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) the second graph (Total Path Distance) has the bottom at a negative distance (something that always makes me wander about fractal dimensions in hyperspace)... makes easy to read when the distance is zero, but actually zero distance is lack of a valid path. Indeed to me, the 4th graph (Largest Hop Distance) has that right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) the third graph (Number of Hops) shows -1 for when no valid path exists. To me, negative hops is even more subtle than negative distance. I would consider the graph to start at 0 (just let the negative part go outside the chart). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I would like to see, is some color-coding on the charts showing what nodes are active with a path. However, I\u0027m out of ideas now. A rough thing could be to make a chart with all the possible nodes on the y axis, and showing colored horizontal lines in time when those nodes take part with any hop. But, I\u0027d also like to have the actual hops shown (kind of vertical lines connecting the two nodes in each active hop).

My suggestion is to change the number of state log entries per coast event to something around 100 when you perform the analysis, and then reset to whatever higher number you were using before.

Anyway, the different graphs are quite telling. Few things however I would like to suggest:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) the first graph is only about existence or not of a valid path (boolean answer). In itself is difficult to read (vertical bars show transitions, but nothing tells the state between those). This graph is not really needed however while the state is readable from the third graph (number of hops).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) the second graph (Total Path Distance) has the bottom at a negative distance (something that always makes me wander about fractal dimensions in hyperspace)... makes easy to read when the distance is zero, but actually zero distance is lack of a valid path. Indeed to me, the 4th graph (Largest Hop Distance) has that right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) the third graph (Number of Hops) shows -1 for when no valid path exists. To me, negative hops is even more subtle than negative distance. I would consider the graph to start at 0 (just let the negative part go outside the chart). \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I\u0027ve eliminated this graph because I agree it\u0027s not necessary.

It shows pretty well on the fourth chart, in the time interval 1.9 - 3.1*10^4 s. That is the time when SoI is switched from Kerbin to Mun in my MAT file. Distance shows to be computed from Mun, instead of being about the longest hop (longest hop should always be about the distance Kerbin-Mun, as the crafts orbiting them remain in proximity of the respective body).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECSV works great. Other data could turn useful to play with RT, but isn\u0027t really that simple to handle. I\u0027ll talk a bit below of something about RT, but have not clear currently what could be made in the CSV to help players there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve till now focussed on link distance, which is a very well defined limit in RT. But certainly one problem is how to ensure time-above-horizon with communication satellites. The easy and most used answer is to use a stationary orbit (1:1 period with the orbited body), but highly elliptic orbits are also used (like 2:1 Molniya orbit) (thence the time-above-horizon). Or, quite easily, use a constellation of satellites on a same orbit. I have sometimes dealt with computing the angle to the horizon (at KSC) for specific orbiting crafts, as a value to be met for establishing links.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA more serious problem players face is with programming the use of dish antennae with each craft: dishes point at other crafts or at planets, and have a limited visibility cone. If too close, the cone would be too thin to cover a whole planet, or the orbits around a planet followed by other crafts to be linked with. So, if beyond the maximum distance is a limit for the hop, being too close would make for only intermittent coverage (unless the dish can be kept pointed at all times at just one craft, instead of using its cone to cover the area around a planet). The bane of RT players is generally with probes that can\u0027t be controlled once without a path towards a control station (like KSC), so antennae on them cannot be redirected to reestablish a link towards another node if the one they were pointed at \u0022disappeared\u0022 (eclipsed, destroyed, out of EC).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, each craft can have multiple antennae, each one generally programmed to cover one specific link. Clearly crafts built to act as communication relays have to keep those dish antennae correctly oriented at all times. Now, each antenna has different maximum range and cone, so an improvement would be to model all those antennae. But this may prove excessive, adding a check about the cone coverage of each antenna would probably take too long to compute to be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, I may have to think more about what could turn useful in the CSV.
