Using only stock parts I got a Mk2 sized SSTO into orbit and can do so regularly now. Taking that to the Mk3 I got into orbit on the first try with tons of fuel to spare. I\u0027ve found that full throttle, point the nose 20 degrees above the horizon and let that sucker fly is the most efficient way to get into orbit. You *will* almost blow some parts once you\u0027re at ~Mach 3 below 10km, but you should just make it. I ride Rapiers in Airbreathing till the velocity levels out, then kick over to closed cycle mode. Works with a Mk2 passenger and Mk2 cargo setup, as well as a Mk3 passenger setup.
