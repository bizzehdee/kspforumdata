Civics was a recap of American History in 7th grade. We had a test, or a quiz I should say, it was easy I guess. ELA was boring, I am tried of reading Ernest Gaines\u0027 A Lesson Before Dying. It is a boring book, that is supposed to reflect the attitude of whites in the 1940\u0027s. In the book, they\u00A0 basically claim that we are really racist. PE is easy, as always right now, I just get to sit on the forums, and hang with yall. Band is exciting, because I have to learn like 20 new songs for our football games. I had been taken off the football band roster twice, and I am hoping to go next weeks game, but who knows. Physical Science was easy, as always. IBCA/ Business is a pain, as we have to type a 3 page essay on some applications of various programs in the business world. I hate geometry right now. Like really hate it. I hate algebra, and I have to use algebra in geometry. I barely passed alegbra last year. My extracurricular activity for tuesday was XC practice.

To start it off, my Civics teacher gave us an assignment on [snip]. In ELA, my teacher decided to pull a curveball on us, as stated in the last chapter/blog, we are reading\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EA Lesson Before Dying,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eand teach decides to make us turn in our reading log early. Well, me being me, I procrastinate a lot, so it wasn\u0027t done, I figured I\u0027d get it done toward the end. So I got a bad grade on it because of that. In our PE, Coach B just let us sit around, because our [snip] has put schools in Phase 2 with no upgrade to Phase 3 in site, despite all of the parish and most of the state being in Phase 3. In band we are learning a few songs, My House by Fo Rida, Gonna Fly Now by Bill Conti, Cold Hearted by Paula Abdul,\u00A0and Haterz by\u00A0Keith Frank. All of these are for our football game shows. Practice went well, no major problems were needed to be fixed.\u00A0 Then, I ran up to physical science. Physical science is my favorite class, in part because its fun and the teacher is cool, in part because the girl I have a crush on is in that class. I know, Mikenike is a softie sometimes, whaaaaat?? Anyways, he made us review atomic chart stuff. Super easy. Lunch has to be taken in 5th period for some reason right now, for some requirement of some sort. Well lunch is always interesting, Tuesday I found out that 2 people in the class were crimminals with records. One\u0027s seminormal. The other is a socio and psychopath who spent 5 months in mental hospitals out of the last year and a half. Well munch wasn\u0027t too bad, chicken burger with tomatos, and my BodyArmor to drink. IBCA/Business is next,where we continue our assignment from Tuesday. It goes by quick because we aren\u0027t really allowed to talk in that class. After that is Geometry, we are doing proofs and such, so it went by semiquick. Afterschool was busy, I get out at 1:35, and I went straight for band practice, where we broke up into sectionals and worked on our music. Then we came back together in order to hear what 1/2 the band sounded like. We sounded pretty good. And some of the drumline cadences were phenominal. Well, that ended at 4:00, and I had to go across town to get to my Cross Country meet. I got there long before I had to run, so I watched the girls\u00A0meet. Unfortunately, our second best runner fell and was out for the rest of the race.\u00A0 Our race was excitin, it started to ran like 3/4s a mile in, and didn\u0027t stop. I unfortunately hurt my foot, twisting it in the run, yet I still got a 23:38 for the 3 mile run. I got my favorite resturant for dinner. I got gumbo, and a shimp poboy. And well thats the end of my day.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to follow or comment on my posts, part of my reasons of doing this is to get feedback on my writing style.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-25T16:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoving this thread!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223871570\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197623\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221603456633\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022189349\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Arcitect\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/23/2020 at 7:37 AM, The_Arcitect said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am in high school, and I am taking the JROTC way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m in MCJROTC, what branch is yours through?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Sorry for odd wording\u002Btyping, my fingers are frozen)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-25T16:58:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2020 04:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Lewie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Arcitect","CreatedById":189349,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-25T19:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223872575\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197623\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221603644742\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022203745\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lewie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Lewie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoving this thread!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m in MCJROTC, what branch is yours through?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Sorry for odd wording\u002Btyping, my fingers are frozen)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArmy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-27T11:46:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223872575\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197623\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221603644742\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022203745\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lewie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/25/2020 at 11:52 AM, Lewie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoving this thread!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad to hear.

I want to say I am sorry for my off time, as I have been busy. All this weekend I ran around doing stuff. Alrighty, lets begin. I love Friday, its just a good day. I woke up, took my retainer out, got in the shower, got out, shaved, and got dressed. I then grabbed my trumpet case, and my bag, and headed out the door with my dad. We got to school about 6:45ish. I walked to my first period, after dropping my trumpet off at the \u0022pound\u0022, our band locker room, named for its many cages. I would typically hang out in the band room or in one of the common areas until 1st period, however because of [snip]\u00A0 I can\u0027t. So I checked in with my teach, Mrs. L, and opened my chromebook, and hopped on the forums, as per usual. At 7, we got started. To be completely honest, I toned her out and chilled on the forums. Well a short while later, and I was up to my second hour. We went over some things, and presented our group assignments. Easy to do, for me atleast. After that, it was a short trip over to P.E. or as we call it right now, Useless 101. It went by quick, just me giving some basic answers to my friends. In band, we didn\u0027t actually play. We helped set up a tent, one of those big ones, like the ones you see businesses have. Half of us, or the other half, helped count shirts from last year. The remainder of the time we sat around and got to know each other. Despite it being 8 weeks in, I don\u0027t know half of my classmates names. In physical science, we didn\u0027t have much, a small test, which of course, I aced. Next was lunch, typically luch on Friday is fish, because of someone\u0027s religion, I don\u0027t know why, but it is. And it\u0027s kind of obvious that someone finally complained, because we had grilled cheese that day. I didn\u0027t eat the grilled cheese,\u00A0instead I had an apple, and some fries. I moved on to IBCA where we had a test on what finger what key. I can\u0027t remember the keyboard like that, so I did pretty bad. Next was geometry, which I also had a test in. This was a vocab test that was kind of easy, and I hope I passed it, cause I have a C in geometry. After school, I went to tennis, one of the many sports I play. Tennis was a breeze, mostly because me and the coach love to talk, and partly because I love tennis. Tennis on Friday, is a relaxed time, because I have had cross country runs for the majority of the week. We have regionals on Thursday, and I don\u0027t have school today, as my school district uses the schools for polling places all day. So Thursday\u0027s edition will be a little short. And today we will unfortunately not have an edition.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-03T16:12:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223876514\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197623\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221604414599\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022196142\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mikenike\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Mikenike said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntypically luch on Friday is fish, because of someone\u0027s religion, I don\u0027t know why, but it is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019d be Catholicism.
