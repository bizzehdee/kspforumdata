In my first ship, I just used a big honkin\u0027 array of fuel tanks with a cluster of 5 LV-Ns. This one will be a bit bigger, and I want to keep a good balance of total dV against power, mostly for the sake of convenience. Those long burns get annoying XD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have a sneaking suspicion that my original idea to throw more fuel and engines at it might not necessarily equate to more dV as the mass increased proportionally. Is there a tipping point in which it would be better to use engines with lower Isp, but higher thrust and lower mass? Or is Isp the dominant stat despite added mass and it\u0027s effective enough to cluster a ton of nukes together?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-22T03:14:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2014 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RSwordsman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T00:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou would probably get move DV from adding more LV-Ns just because of their Isp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use this equation: Ve*ln((9x\u002BDry mass of ship w/o fuel tanks)/(x\u002BDry mass of ship w/o fuel tanks)) to find at what point one engine or engines provide more DV.

This is where the engine values go in. You graph the 2 equations, one for the LV-N (Exhaust velocity 7848) and another for your second ship, with a different engine. I used a TI-84, but you also can use excel. The purpose of the formula is, given 2 identical ships, with the only difference being the engines used, when do they produce the same amount of DV (Y value) and how much fuel has to be burned ((9)X value in tons)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also used that website, but I only used it for singe calculations for the DV of one stage. Feel free to send me the numbers on your ship if you want me to double-check.

Probably what you want to do is to design the strongest thing you can so that the ship can withstand physics warp.
