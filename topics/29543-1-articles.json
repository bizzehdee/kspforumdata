I\u0027ve noticed structural wings are far lighter than the structural plates for armor, and I would like to utilize them to have a lighter, yet slightly weaker armor onboard my new escort carrier. Unfortunately, when I try to place one on another\u0027s edge, it is off center, leaving either an ugly gap or an even more ugly, they end up with only their corners touching, leaving a... I suppose... Cliff, for lack of better words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have halted construction of my escort until I can find a way around this problem.
