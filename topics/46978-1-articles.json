Is this a dumb question because there is something I missed in the readme or a radio button somewhere. Did my daughter accidentally hit something while we were building stuff. Anyhow, I installed Fustek then was trying to land a Mun mission. Completely over-sot KSP-1 by a quarter of a rotation, so I tried again with a test mission. Same thing, no drag in atmosphere, no flame effects even at 2500 m/s @ 35K m. Anyone else experience this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T12:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe gotta see a video of this.. seriously..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow close to KSC can you put a periapsis?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T16:54:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had this happen before. I found if you go straight from the Mun to Kerbin in one shot, and enter the atmo you will get no drag and even float around like you are in zero G. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe quick fix I found was to do at least 1 complete orbit of Kerbin around 150km - 70km altitude. Then do a proper re-entry like any other de-orbit operation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBob","CreatedById":82205,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T11:54:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWatch, when I open it today it won\u0027t do it.
