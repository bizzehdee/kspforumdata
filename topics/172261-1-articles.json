I\u0027ve never heard of anything like it, but haven\u0027t played career yet in the latest release.

It was the escape atmosphere contract, one of the 4 contracts available at the beginning of a career game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ran the launch the next day, the science glitch wasn\u0027t there but it still wouldn\u0027t complete the contract but I managed to make orbit\u00A0and complete that contract, but afterwards I noticed I wasn\u0027t gaining money, nor was it being used when I upgraded the Launchpad. So my funds are stuck at $109,000 regardless of income or expenses. I haven\u0027t tried buying anything over $109,000 so that could be a barrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
