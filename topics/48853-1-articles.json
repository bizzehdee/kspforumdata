With the Birth of a rudimentary Career mode in .22, I have decided to start a Mission status report for anyone who wants to can read, and maybe find some source of entertainment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProject: SKY is the top secret space program of my Career, of which I am in charge of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets start with some Code names and rocket launch stages that are planned for the beginning of the program:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESilicon - X series. X stands for Experimental, which in my eyes is the most primitive form of a rocket is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtlas - P series. P stands for Prototype, which is the early Heavy lifter series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkytalon - AV or Atmospheric Vehicle, A small jet powered Aircraft designed to land anywhere except water. Current design can land without input after cutting throttle at 20,000, it coasts into a landing at 51.3 m/s, minimum speed before stall is 32 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=================================================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanned Lifter series:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoseidon - HL A 2.5 meter *Heavy lifter capable of lifting 60 tons into LKO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETempest - SL The *Standard lifter designed to take small payloads into HKO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGale - CL or the *Commercial Lifter designed to carry small satellite payloads into Geosynch Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanned Transfer Stages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENova - CT or *Cluster Transfer, Designed to be launched into LKO/HKO by the Tempest Launch stage and rendezvous with extra-planetary bound ships and push it into a capture. starts with Clamp SR. and adapter plate pushes it into a tri-cluster nerva.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlare - ST or *Satellite Transfer, designed to be launched by Gale series. It is a nerva attached to a 1.25\u0026gt;.625 complete with additional reaction wheels, and enough fuel to push a 5-16 ton payload to eeloo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanned A/V/R Series:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAegis - AR or *Atmospheric Rover. This will be used to explore the continents of Kerbin and sample multiple \u0022biomes\u0022, then return home for a maintenance care package before it is put on display in the Vehicle museum for any successful designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBulwark - HVR or *Heavy Vacuum Rover designed to explore and act as a mobile Headquarters on celestial bodies like Mun, Minmus, and any other atmosphere-less body for that matter. Will carry 6-10 Kerbals, Have ports to refuel any orbital missions that may or may not get built on those bodies, and be a pain in the rear to land safely \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKite - JVR or *Jump Vaccum Rover, designed to be ultra light, and obtain altitude by means of RCS. Its purpose will be to explore where the larger Bulwark cannot by hopping over obstacles, Transferring crews between stationary bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParma - EAR or *Extra-terrestrial Atmospheric Rover A rover designed to explore and operate on Duna and Eve. Possible to use on Laythe, but not practical. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanned AV Series:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkytalon - LAV, or *Low Altitude Vehicle, Designed to be a small Jet to explore Kerbin and be launched into every other atmospheric body except Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHawkeye - HAV, or *High Altitude Vehicle, Designed to be a Large multi-engine jet capable of Rapidly flying payloads to any point on kerbin to deliver supplies and personnel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFalconwing - AAV, Or *Acrobatic Aerial Vehicle, Designed to be a blast to fly and be extremely nimble and responsive. Speed is sacrificed for the ability to do near-zero point loops and retain control. Going to be a tough feat of engineering that doesn\u0027t do anything but be fun to fly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E========================================================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat cover\u0027s Project: Sky\u0027s vehicle list. Any other vehicles or stages that are added will *eventually* be updated here. Screenshots will come as I create these pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will be all stock parts for now, but I may shift over to AIES for their BEAUTIFUL science instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zaeo","CreatedById":52597,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T03:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst Successful mun Flyby in Silicon X-2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/7ksQB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
