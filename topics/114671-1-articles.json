The three important values are combustion chamber volume, nozzle throat area (at the top of the bell), and nozzle exit area. The ratio of chamber volume to throat area is fixed, and depends on what fuel mixture you are using - increasing thrust means scaling up the chamber volume and throat proportionally. The ratio of throat area to exit area determines the efficiency at a chosen ambient pressure - usually between 1 atm (sea level), and 0 atm (vac). The shape (curve) of the bell is pretty much always the same, and it is made that way to balance out mach shock waves in the propellant flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say tweakable options should be fuel (determines alot of stuff, including throat area for a given chamber volume), thrust (makes chamber bigger), and expansion ratio (makes the bell bigger). Also combustion and cooling cycles would be super awesome, there should at the very least be pressure fed vs. gas generator turbopump fed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chrozayis","CreatedById":146976,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T14:55:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have thought about doing this, unfortunately my experience is with Java not C# or whatever KSP mods are written in, it would be a huge project and I think you you might need an external editor to generate models if you wanted the engine to be in one piece, however somebody could also make tweakable stackable combustion chambers, pumps and bells, that might actually work pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hanhan658","CreatedById":157273,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T13:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter i read this topic a few\u00A0days ago i am working on \u0027\u0027Procedural LF Engines\u0027\u0027 mod that is surface attachable, it doesnt require nodes.
