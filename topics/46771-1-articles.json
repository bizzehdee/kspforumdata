The game stops simulating physics for them and they get to \u0022in orbit\u0022 state where they start following their orbital trajectory - which is basically free fall. Then if the game finds them below surface of the planet, only then they get destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA piece of junk left alone can pass the planet well within its atmosphere without being affected by air resistance and I guess that with a bit of effort you can get a probe circling in ~30 km height above Kerbin forever unless you switch to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you drop the probe while accelerating upwards, you could be able to switch to the probe, watch it land, then switch back to the plane still safe in the air and guide it back to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: okay, I am wrong.
