Anyway, when 0.24 came out this was shared: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86406-Stock-Parts-Costs-and-Balance-Spreadsheet-for-0-24\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86406-Stock-Parts-Costs-and-Balance-Spreadsheet-for-0-24\u003C/a\u003E and at the time I thought, \u0022gosh, I guess we all make these spreadsheets but surprisingly haven\u0027t made a tool to create them?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll was well and good until 0.25 came out and once again I\u0027m looking for a comparison of parts, both to old KSP versions, of mods, etc. In addition the folder/file/name of all the parts was changed (thankfully!) making it much more difficult to do a straight folder to folder compare and see any changes between 0.24 and 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint is, anyone have a tool to generate these and save everyone making these sheets all some time? :-) Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-01T12:21:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2014 12:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Black-Talon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Black-Talon","CreatedById":57463,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T10:12:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk - I made one in C# - it\u0027s barely usable at the moment. For me personally, the homemade tool and some manual work in Excel will put me further ahead at this task than I\u0027ve ever been.

I\u0027m not talking about testers; I\u0027m looking for someone willing to look at my hacked together code and giving advice on how to organize it and constructively build upon it. EVERYTHING is currently wrong with it but I\u0027m so rusty having someone with more experience giving me direction would help tremendously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ubyx5zlqmhsy8yt/KSP_Parts.csv?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ubyx5zlqmhsy8yt/KSP_Parts.csv?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe extremely kludgy output as it is raw from the code - many improvements can/need to be made!
