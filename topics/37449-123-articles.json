The issue you are seeing is caused by multiple independent systems interacting*, with no way to determine which runs first. So the converter could end up running first, and trying to recycle a \u0022days worth\u0022 of CO2 exhaled by the Kerbals except the calculation for the Kerbals has not run yet! So there is no CO2 yet to be recycled. Then the Kerbal calculations run, and they breath in the Oxygen and exhale the CO2. Then the converter runs again, but it already calculated for a days-worth so it just calculates for the remaining time minus the days-worth (again limited to MaxDeltaTime).** You should never see anything get more than MaxDeltaTime seconds out of sync.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can try changing the MaxDeltaTime in the configuration file and see how that effects everything.
