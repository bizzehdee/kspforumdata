This would be super useful for picking landing spots. I understand that ScanSAT is a mod that exists but this is something that should have been included in the stock game, along with resource scanning. It\u0027s impossible to know the highest points on Eve without looking up the info online or using a mod, and we all know how important it is to find a high plateau on Eve, and it could also be used to find a flat area to land on a lumpy planetoid like Gilly or Bop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EasyAce","CreatedById":62958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T08:39:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not use ScanSat? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is one of those \u0022must have\u0022 mods that I also think should be implemented in stock... but I am sure Squad have noticed which mods that are more than average popular.
