As you know, I pretty much use those things (with antimatter reactors) on almost every craft I build - something has definitely changed in their behavior since the last patch. It seems to only affect things when running in Atmospheric mode - if I kick it over to hydrazine everything is fine. However in atmospheric mode:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. They seem to have their overall thrust cut by 50% or more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. They seem to have a lot more throttle lag than they used to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The same thrust that will produce a stable hover at 2000m altitude will not hold altitude at all within a couple hundred meters of the ground (this puzzles me. Was coming in for a vertical landing in a VTOL spaceplane that worked great before this patch - had to add 2 more VTOL engines to even get it off the ground now, and when I\u0027m near the ground the thrust from each engine fluctuates fairly noticably for no apparent reason - yes I had TCA turned OFF at the time, although the behavior happens regardless of TCA\u0027s state). Anyway, 2/3 throttle seemed to be holding fairly steady in atmosphere for level flight.. got over the island runway, reduced throttle for about a -5 m/s descent.. descent rate started increasing as I got closer to the ground.. increased throttle all the way to 100% but the descent rate kept increasing until I hit the ground at 30 m/s - I really really am puzzled by what might even possibly be going on here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Diazo\u0027s vertical velocity control mod (which has not updated in a while, and which worked fine for controlling vertical speed before the latest KSPIE patch) can now only do so in closed cycle mode.
