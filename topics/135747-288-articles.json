Lifetime risk is a measure of how likely you are to get something in your lifetime. So, if a hypothetical Mars expedition member is 30 years old, and their cancer risk increases by 2%, it means that they\u0027re slightly more likely to get cancer over the rest of their lifetime. They may get killed in a car accident first. Or they may live to 85, and then get cancer. Or they might get it sooner. It\u0027s lifetime risk of getting cancer (or some other health issues), not risk of death. Many people who get diagnosed with cancer live healthy lives, and many don\u0027t. Risk of dying from\u00A0any type of cancer is already 22.62% for males and 19.13% for females. But what about just developing cancer, not dying from it? Roughly double the death values. (of course these are average risks of the US population, risk on an individual basis could be very different) This means that it\u0027s already worse than Omaha Beach just by being alive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-24T02:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222819907\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477246120\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022135480\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gkirmathal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, Gkirmathal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/91005-northstar1989/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002291005\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/91005-northstar1989/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Northstar1989\u003C/a\u003E Although off topic, a while back you were talking about a separate Mars LMO lander system.
