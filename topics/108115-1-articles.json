But I\u0027m slowly noticing 1.0 behaves just as bad in regards to the constant ever increasing memory footprint. Despite using DDS, compared to my 0.90 wich used DDS as well.\n\nEven scene switches, although GC is far more effective in 1.0! What is loaded back for what ever scene is still more than was was cleaned.\n\nEspecially it is noticeble for me while in the editor (VAB/SPH), just designing craft without launches, raises my starting 2.6Gb to 3.0Gb\u002B within 15 minutes. One test launch and 3.1/3.2Gb is soon after hit.\n\nIn stock 1.0, in my honest observations, it was also noticeable but far less due to the lesser5 content.\n\nAnyone else having these same issues (deja vu)?\n\nEdit: Logs show nothing out of the ordinairy while in VAB.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T21:52:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gkirmathal**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T21:55:12Z","Content":"I\u0027m also seeing these issues as well, while things are better from 0.90, there are still some small memory leaks somewhere, even had an OOM crash yesterday.\n\nIn fact, I swear that the terrain memory leak is still there, smaller, yes, but still there.\n\nI really wish there was a way to break down the memory usage bits and see what exactly is leaking because I HOPED that the memory leaks would be gone with 1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:32:46Z","Content":"I need to do more testing but I think the terrain scatter leak might be back.
