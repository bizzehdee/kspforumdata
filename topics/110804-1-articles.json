I had a number of native northern NJ species in it ([sunfish](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Bluespotted_Sunfish.jpeg), [perch](http://www.fishinjersey.com/images/features/icefishing_feature_04.jpg), [crappie](http://www.onthewater.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/crappie-through-the-ice.jpg), and a few other things, complete with indigenous water plants. My cat got most of them. Didn\u0027t eat them, just liked to catch them and then drop them on the floor and watch them flop around. Nothing like coming home from work and finding a dried up desiccated fish on the floor. I eventually turned the tank into a terrarium, and kept a [5-lined Skink](http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/Reptiles/Five-lined%20Skink/AR0165_1l.jpg) for a few years before giving him up to a friend of mine."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T19:58:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How big is the tank?\n\nTen gallons.
