So n-1 was designed so all of the 3 main stages would be their \u0022own\u0022 LV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third stage with the mini 4th stage would be the N-3 rocket capable of 2.5 tonnes to leo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd, 3rd and 4th stage would be the N-2 capable of 25 tonnes to leo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the complete N-1 with 95 tonnes to leo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I want to focus on the small N-3, I personally believe this could have been a very good LV. It would have stood at 25 meters (not counting fairings) with 5 engines in total (1s:4, 2s:1) I believe it could have been very cheap, there are also lots of 2.5- payloads these days.
