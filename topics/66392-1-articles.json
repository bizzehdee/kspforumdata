Basically, I want to build some vessels that require (very) accurately set angles between parts (e.g. radially attached girders at 31.72 degrees from horizontal) and the only way I can currently see of doing this is editing the craft file directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the core editor needs this but it should be very simple to allow a plugin to set the angle that the WASDQE keys rotate the selected part by. Two simple properties on EditorLogic that set the increments for coarse and fine rotations should be very easy to add to the core editor code and would make it possible for plugins such as Editor extensions to easily allow part rotations to be accurately controlled without needing a different set of controls (editable fields, up/down buttons etc). Having a hot-key that cycles the fine rotation through 5, 1, 0.1 and 0.01 degrees (and a display of the current rotation angles) would make it very easy to set up accurate angles between parts solely using hot-keys (so it wouldn\u0027t need you to click on controls while a part is selected).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T14:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be nice to have in core editor too.

Basically, for roll (q and e) and yaw (a and d) the shifted keys and the unshifted keys go the same direction but for the pitch control (w and s) they go in opposite directions. E.g. if you hit shift-a 18 times and then hit d the part goes back to where it started but hitting shift-w 18 times and then hitting s results in the part being 180 degrees from the original orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should be another trivial fix though it would be nice if the rotation increments could also be made adjustable as described in the first post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T10:23:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81390-0-23-5-Part-Angle-Display-View-and-set-accurate-angles-for-parts-in-editor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elatest version of my plugin\u003C/a\u003E overrides the behaviour of the standard part rotation keys when Alt is held down to apply the angle increment entered in the dialog for the particular axis.
