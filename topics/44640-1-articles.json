You should notice too, that required delta-v varies tens of percents between launch windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are not any more special with these celestial bodies. Especially Moho needs quite large amount on delta-v, but you can do it with LV-N. Just put enough fuel with you. Roundtrip to low Moho\u0027s orbit and back takes about 7500-9000 m/s depending on exact geometry. If a calculator gives bad values, you can check couple of next launch windows and delay launch a month or two, because Moho\u0027s orbital period is short. Landing and ascending needs additional 2500-3000 m/s from low orbit. You must be very careful in orbit planning and maneuvers. If you make small mistakes everything can look good until you notice in Moho\u0027s SOI, that your relative velocity to planet is 5000 m/s instead of planned 2000-3000 m/s. Check the orbit few times during course (immediately after leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, on about halfway, 5 days before encounter and immediately before and after Moho\u0027s SOI change) and make corrections early. Eeloo is easier than Moho. Transitions need less delta-v and planet has lower gravity which helps orbital maneuvers and landings.

Escape velocity from SOI\u0027s surface should be about 290 m/s but the game neglects it.

Error of just couple of meters per second are too bad with Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that was just a theoretical level. Other problem was how to realize that precise delta-v. Values are ideal infinitely short impulses and practically you burn finite time and move tens of thousands of kilometers in varying gravitational potential during that time. I could fix it by making 42 m/s correction immediately after leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI. It would be interesting task for Mechjeb\u0027s devs to program a function that makes burns which lead to exact same orbits than ideal values. Do not try to make trans Moho injection from too low altitude. I used 250 km and it gave quite large error. You lose very easily every m/s which Oberth effect saves.

The conceptually easiest way to manage this is to time your Jool intercept so that Jool is located at either the ascending or descending node (with respect to Eeloo) when you reach it. You can then use a gravity assist to put yourself into an orbit co-planar with Eeloo for free. (For added bonus points, you can use an aerogravity assist, but this is much more difficult.) You probably won\u0027t manage an Eeloo intercept directly after the Jool encounter, so I recommend putting your apoapsis out to slightly beyond Eeloo\u0027s orbit, and then using a deep-space maneuver at apoapsis to generate your intercept (total cost for this maneuver should be only a couple of hundred delta-v). Because the Jool assist will have substantially raised your periapsis, you encounter velocity at Eeloo with be much lower than it would be on a normal Hohmann transfer, saving you substantial delta-v for your orbital insertion. I\u0027ve managed a landing on Eeloo with a total delta-v cost on the order of ~3.2km/s using this technique (2km/s for the Jool transfer, ~200m/s for the deep space maneuver, and around ~1km/s for the insertion and landing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho is a lot harder, but you can use a series of Eve/Moho encounters and deep space maneuvers to walk yourself down the gravity well. The goal is not to generate a cheap intercept, but to generate a cheap insertion (since this is where most of your delta-v will be spent). I don\u0027t have an exact estimate here, since I haven\u0027t flown what I\u0027d consider to be an efficient mission yet; multiple encounters take a lot of patience and planning.
