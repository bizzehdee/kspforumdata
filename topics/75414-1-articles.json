This has the potential to be one of the most awkward and upsetting parts of development, for both the devteam and the players, because of one simple truth: we are used to the systems that don\u0027t work right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Let\u0027s take the biggest one, the elephant in the room, aerodynamics. The current aerodynamics model in KSP is decidedly off in how it works. There are mountains of problems with it, and completely un-physical side-effects are possible as a result. Fixing this placeholder engine has always been on the list of priorities, but here\u0027s the thing: fixing it has the very real potential to make most players of KSP very, very angry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Realistic drag modeling will cause many of the most popular rocket structures to be completely infeasible. The lack of stock fairings will severely limit how craft can be designed, and the addition of them will serve to cause even more problems as players have to learn not only how to deal with a new aerodynamics model, but also how to design their craft in an entirely new context. Just look at the results of pretty much anyone getting into the Ferram Aerospace Research mod without knowledge of how aerodynamics actually work to get an idea of just what we have to look forward to. Now picture that on a scale of every single user being switched over to using FAR, like it or not. It\u0027s not pretty, is it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E How on Kerbin are we going to deal with a change of this scale, then? The only real solution is a gradual implementation, making the aerodynamics model slightly better with each new release for several versions until old and new players alike are comfortable with having to deal with aerodynamic design principles. New indicators will have to be added. We\u0027ll probably have to have a \u0022wind tunnel simulator\u0022 option at some point. A lot has to change in small steps for this feature to reach a point where it is both acceptably realistic and accepted by the player base as a whole. It can be done, but going straight from the current model to FAR-level aerodynamics modeling in one version is the worst possible way to go about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There are other system upgrades and changes that are going to cause upsets if not done gradually as well, of course.
