I changed it to 1000 and did a mission and got no big reward; the Science building is too expensive for my tree so I was looking for ways to solve my problem (also with my tree). I am looking into mission(s) editing to make a mission to solve it for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When adding a mod (that I have previously set places for items to go into in the nodes) they add nicely; the stock item gave it to me \u0027owned\u0027 even tho it was in an advanced item not researched; this could be a bug? I moved it to an earlier node. It was the stackdecouplermini tt-2v or sumthn the little red and white one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA modded part I moved up...gads wait it wasnt a modded part...the stackdecoupler I had to pay 1200 for to researched if I remember right; when researched the amount wasnt deducted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Science multiplier was changed once and it worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZeta\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T18:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason it is working...I am working on Contract Config and may have did something to the modifier; still working but I think the funds multiplier is ok !
