The one thing I hate so much is that there isn\u0027t really a centralized place to get what you need short of trial and error. I have decided to put the time in to prune the Orphaned or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E parts missing from the RP-1 tech tree and adding them. So far I have been using Janitors Closet to prune any part not labelled \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E (unless its parts like cargo bays or structural). I have about 100 mods installed and have a nice list of parts I will find a proper and accurate place for in the tech tree. So far I have added around 100 parts to the tech tree., What would be great though would be to get a community collab going to do the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Price the parts out in a proper way. Finding pricing has been a hard thing for me so far and I am just kind of guessing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Find duplicate parts and figure out which part is the most accurate, stable, or has the best model. For example, I have 8 AJ-10\u0027s from the mix of mods I have. Would be nice to figure out which is the best so we can catalogue the best parts to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Create \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches or use the Configuration App to create a fork for the devs to add. There are a ton of mods and I can\u0027t do them all myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will also export my Janitors Closet prune list so once we get going we can add a list of which are the best mods to install and then use the export list to prune all non-compatible parts out to help speed up the loading time and de-clutter. If anyone is interested in helping or contributing let me know!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KIMCHI","CreatedById":198856,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-17T15:59:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first major mod I am looking at is Bluedog_DB.
