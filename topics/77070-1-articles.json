I think it could add a nicer atmosphere to the planet/moon. and maybe on Kerbin there can be music for day and music for night. I would also like clouds. I don\u0027t really know what else to say about it, clouds would just be nice. Maybe a city called Kerbin City like in that mod would be pretty cool. Except I don\u0027t want a name like Kerbin City, I would like something more creative (no offense to anybody). I mean, there aren\u0027t any cities on Earth called Human City, so maybe the city could have a nice name that would be normal to find. Lastly, I would like for mining to be an option. Maybe there could be a building in KSC for building things from materials you get from other planets, and you could get more parts. That\u0027s really all for my suggestions. Unless you want to read my next one which is never going to be added or liked, which would be have one planet have a boss on it that you can fight and it\u0027s all tense and if you win the fight you get a fuel tank that never runs out or a capsule that never breaks or a thruster that thrusts really fast or something.

Clouds isn\u0027t on the dev\u0027s plan sheet \u0027at least for now\u0027 but mods like environmental visual enhancements and better atmospheres add awesome clouds and auroras to atmospheric planets. Yeah, theres a mod for Kerbin City but i think it also allows you \u0027if you know how to program\u0027 to add your own stuff and in different places on Kerbin (a similar mod). To many player\u0027s dismay, mining was scrapped back in .19 cause the resource tree was too complex (and i understand that). But mods like Kethane and KSP interstellar allow for in situ resource gathering. But recovering parts from missions for money will be added in the next update! Also, I\u0027m not sure if theres going to be a boss on one planet since the debs said no weapons and no aliens...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T19:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E[shamelesspromotion]\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85408-About-KSP-s-music\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85408-About-KSP-s-music\u003C/a\u003E[/shamelesspromotion]\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
