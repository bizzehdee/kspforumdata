The current mods for life support each have a different approach. There are single resource abstracted solutions and multi resource solutions. The consequences are varied as well, ranging from killing kerbals to insignificant effects in sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhatever system is used there would be only one concern for mission planning, how many kerbal*days would one ton of life support provide? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI estimate for humans 1 ton would support about 100 man*days. Later technology that regenerates waste would support more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow many kerbal*days do you think one ton of life support should provide?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T10:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s said that the average human will consume 5kg of Life Support (~0.5kg O2, ~1kg Food and ~3.5kg Water) per day to stay healthy, and another 3-4kg of water per day to keep clean. If you skip showers, you can work it out to just under 2 tons of LS per person, per year. With the water for general cleanliness and all the rest, it\u0027s about 3 tons; not THAT much really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in the mindset that Kerbals, being smaller, would use less per day, maybe 3kg, so would only need about 1 ton per earth year. Though I like and use TAC Life Support, I think if evet a stock Life Support was added, it would make sense as just one resource, consumed equally.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T12:39:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the interest of gameplay, it should be really cheap and easy to support non-permanent crafts inside Kerbin\u0027s SOI.
