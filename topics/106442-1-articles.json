The camera is in a low position that only lets you see four buildings.\n\n2. You cannot use the right mouse button to control the camera.\n\n3. If you right click the \u0022Research and Development\u0022 building it does not show a details window.\n\n4. If you left click the \u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022 or the \u0022Space Plane Hangar\u0022 you will enter the building, but then you can\u0027t get out because the \u0022Exit\u0022 button is not clickable. The Esc key does not do anything. You have to close the program using Alt-F4 or the Windows \u0022X\u0022 button.\n\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\n\n- Start the program.\n\n- Select \u0022Start Game\u0022.\n\n- Select \u0022Training\u0022.\n\n- Select \u0022Construction Basics\u0022.\n\n- Click \u0022Start\u0022.\n\n- Click \u0022Next\u0022 then click the command module.\n\n- Click \u0022Next\u0022 twice, then attach the fuel tank to the command module.\n\n- Click \u0022Next\u0022 once, then attach the engine to the fuel tank.\n\n- Keep clicking \u0022Next\u0022 and finally \u0022Done\u0022 to close the window.\n\n- Click the \u0022Launch\u0022 button. Note: The problems do not happen if you click the \u0022Exit\u0022 button instead of \u0022Launch\u0022.\n\n- You are returned to the \u0022Start Game\u0022 menu (ie. the menu items are: Resume Saved, Start New, Training, Scenarios, Back).\n\n- Select \u0022Start New\u0022.\n\n- Use the default options (career mode, normal difficulty) and click \u0022Start!\u0022.\n\n- Click \u0022Thanks, I\u0027ve got it\u0022 to close the \u0022Welcome to the Space Center\u0022 window.\n\nFixes/Workarounds:\n\n1. Do not click the \u0022Launch\u0022 button at the end of the training mission.\n\n2. Close and restart the program before starting a new game after finishing a training mission."}]}
