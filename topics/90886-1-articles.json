One for small probes using ion engines and another for bigger ships using LV-N\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, they are harder, but chemical work perfectly fine for interplanetary. Using chemical rockets, I sent unmanned missions to Eeloo and Jool on chemical rockets (I got LV-N late in my Career/Science mode) and manned missions to Duna and Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll my heaving booster to lift anything of any real size from KSC to orbit are chemical rockets (nothing else has the thrust). I\u0027m just getting my first space plane working to lift small stuff up to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
