The truly impressive part was that she convinced Bob to join the flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a lot of creative projects all over the place at any given time and it is admittedly difficult at times to complete one project because another project beckons. All the same, if I can I\u0027d really rather create a video a month, and if possible, put in enough time so it looks fairly decent. For this video, I created a simple rocket using Squad parts (stock \u002B Making History) and tested it repeatedly to fine-tune an optimum launch angle of 4\u00B0 East. This would assure a 300-kilometer altitude and a splashdown just North of the Runway Islands. I then turned on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, set up either the stock camera, Camera Tools, or KerbCam in turn, started recording, and pressed spacebar. Aside from occasional adjustments to the cameras and staging once, I sat back and recorded. Again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again. Dozens of gigabytes of video footage recorded over roughly six hours went into this five and a half minute video. And then I had to get fancy with the editing. Still, I think this is one of my finer efforts to date, and I sincerely hope you enjoyed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/c5jaU-g-Vn4?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRocket parts are stock or from Making History, with a few tweaks from Textures Unlimited for visuals:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/167450-142-textures-unlimited-pbr-shader-texture-and-model-api/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/167450-142-textures-unlimited-pbr-shader-texture-and-model-api/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther mod details available upon request.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMusic: Stormfront Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\u003Cbr\u003E\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
