I would meet some requirements set out by the original but the design will probably be different. I know there are some series that do this but most of them only focus on the NASA missions and not the equally important soviet missions or the V2 rocket. I am looking for some ideas on what flights and their requirements. I will not be doing some like first communications satellite because it is too similar with only what ksp has or the first animal in space because Ksp can\u0027t model fruit flies.
