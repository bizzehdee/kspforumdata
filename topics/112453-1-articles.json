Even using the Shift- modifier doesn\u0027t give you enough accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsequently the poor positioning means it makes docking a LOT harder than it needs to be. I can do it, yes... BUT, when translating you don\u0027t want your ass swinging all over the place causing you to become off axis for a solid dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor cylinder shaped vehicles it\u0027s simple because you can place pods in pairs to offset and balance but with a lifting body if you try placing in pairs the balance will be WAY off. You need to be able to fine tune the placement but the accuracy of placing is too damned finicky. Imagine trying to place RCS on Thunderbird 2 for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a lot of my time is spent swearing at the game when all it needs is a precision mode for placing parts. I\u0027m hoping there is a way to do it that I haven\u0027t figured out yet. Anyone got any pointers? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy the RCS isn\u0027t auto-balancing to counter the poor positioning problems inherent in KSP is beyond me... If you want to translate up it should know not to rotate you. If your ship is out of balance it should reduce power to the ones that are pushing you out of alignmenent. If the ship is TOO out of alignment it shouldn\u0027t even fire the RCS at all, giving you an idea that you need to redesign.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T13:03:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 01:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NeoMorph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T11:31:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-1-0-2-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-7-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERCS build aid\u003C/a\u003E is your friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rotation tools are great for positioning RCS thrusters if you turn off angle snap. and the single directional thrusters are a help for non cylindrical bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T11:53:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, sorry but I don\u0027t understand. By \u0022Lifting boddies\u0022, do you refer to MK2 space plane parts ? So I undertand you have a hard time placing your RCS parts on your space plane ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I understood correctly, on my space plane I use only 2 RCS blocks right over the CoM. One on top and one at the bottom of the plane. Then I use 4 \u0022place it anywhere\u0022 inline RCS. 2 on the top and 2 on the bottom at the same distance from the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy CoM doesn\u0027t move a lot from full to empty so I don\u0027t drift a lot while docking.

I was trying to use the RCS Build tool (which I use a lot) on the Mk4 space plane parts. I found I was fine on up/down/left and right but when you add anything that gives you forward and back it totally messes up the torque on everything else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been balancing normal rockets for a LONG time now and can do it pretty much in my sleep but when you get something like the MK4 it totally falls down and shows the problems with the placement alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking about it, what would be really useful is placing rcs (or even any engine) at a specific angle that you type in... then any pod you place will fire in that direction allowing you to more easily balance the placement. You see the problem comes from when the engine connects to the model surface... it can twist the angle to something weird which makes it REALLY hard to get the balance right. The only way you can get around that is to use SAS to keep correcting the poor balance which isn\u0027t exactly good design. Add in possible phantom forces and docking gets to be crazy hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and Warzouz... on small to medium ships, drifting isn\u0027t much of a problem. On medium to large ships it\u0027s a right pain in the ass.... make the craft large and asymetric and you get problems that need more precise placements... oh and if you don\u0027t know what a lifting body then you really need to bone up on space tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_body\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_body\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: Basically the problem I\u0027m having is balancing RCS on large asymetric shapes even using RCS Build Tool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.s.

I have been using them for a long time.). But that Part Angle Display is something that will probably help a LOT. Trying to keep up with what angle the part has changed too when you move it a millimetre and suddenly it is pointing in some weird direction that has now messed up your balance is what was really messing my ship up. Lifting bodies look really nice but all the curved angles really make balancing a chore. Hell, I can balance a LEM faster than a lifting body heh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: YES!!!!! That Part Angle Display is just perfect for what I wanted. To be honest I\u0027m baffled that it\u0027s not part of the main game. Being able to use fine movement down to 0.01 degrees it means you can really fine tune your setup.
