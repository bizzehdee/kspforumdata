Generally you build it up from a very basic level of functionality and have intervals throughout the project where you decide to inject other ideas/features into it so that it can be \u0027better\u0027 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you may start with Code A. Then Implement Code B. Then C... Testing is constant as it should be - to identify issues as they are created. Well at some point by time you are adding Code C to the project something bad happens with Code A. This forces a partial re-write of A and C and then you need to check that Code A B and C are all working together... using this as a basis for thought, Skillful is A, B, C, D, E, F, G. with an option for H and I. LOL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes adding a feature at this stage seems to be so easy! Then when you go to play-test it, another part of the code stops working. Not only on the code front but then I have to work on models, textures (where I spend the least effort!) and finally balance. On top of that there is PR (talking and showing things to you fine people) and prepping documentation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems PR like videos and forum activity should be last on the list, but I\u0027ll tell you, it\u0027s not. In order for me to work a few hours up to 6 hours a day on this I need a somewhat steady stream of motivation. There is only so much someone can motivate themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said... Skillful formed from an idea to compliment the R2 Boat Parts release (the first carrier), that quickly went from a somewhat easy idea, to a much more complicated set of challenges (at least for me). This thing changes how you play the game in more than a few ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne example is how fires can break out on a part that has taken damage. I did a little test yesterday, launched a rocket into orbit(5 tries! lol I don\u0027t get into space much) - the goal being to test those rocket pods in space... (they work by the way)... My first attempt to get into orbit, the engines overheated.... In vanilla the engine would have just exploded. With Skillful the engine caught fire before the terminal temperature limit was reached... in the end I had one engine out of 4 explode... the other 3 were destroyed but fixable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn another example I was talking with Snjo on support for his parts. After that conversation I decided to go ahead and whip up a new bit of code to allow other mods to \u0027tap in\u0027 to Skillful if they are using custom modules. So Snjo\u0027s wing code can now intercept signals from Skillful which lets it know if the part is shiny new, or to what degree of damage it has, or if it\u0027s totally damaged. Modders can take that value and assign it to their own code to change how the rest of their code would interpret that damage. So in short, they have full control over the damage effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you know all modded parts that use stock modules for engines, control surfaces, cockpits, etc. will be affected by Skillful and experience variable performance loss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all for now... my hands need to rest and I need a coffee \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-05T19:53:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2014 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by InfiniteDice\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Flitter","CreatedById":33550,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T19:59:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuestion: will objects flying into something at high speeds cause damage to parts with Skillful, or is it just specialized bullets?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfiniteDice","CreatedById":57451,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T20:20:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Flitter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Flitter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuestion: will objects flying into something at high speeds cause damage to parts with Skillful, or is it just specialized bullets?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe armoured parts that come with Skillful have stout non-weapon impact resistance. For obvious reasons, a tank can smash right through cars, motorhomes, even most buildings all day long, while only getting some superficial damage. You\u0027d need to toss a stock object at a very high velocity to destroy it. Is it possible? Sure. Would it be an efficient way to take out a carrier? No. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven without Skillful the probability of destroying a part is based on the velocity in the collision, the impact resistance and the mass of each part. I\u0027ve crashed many aircraft into the carrier before... the carrier shrugs it off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkillful was made for this very reason, a big heavy gas tank is not going to do much to a tank, or a battleship. Sure it might cook the crew out over time, but structurally, the tank would still be there. Vanilla KSP is all or nothing (except the wheels) Skillful reverses this and only removes a \u0027destroyed\u0027 part based on what has hit it. A 127mm tank round vs an aircraft fuselage... say bye bye to the fuselage. A 7.62mm to the fuselage? You could shoot at it all day and the structure would still be there. I remember in the army out on the range, the target vehicles must have been nailed by .50 cals, 7.62, 5.56 for years... they had lots of holes in them, but they were still there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways good question! I seek to find a good balance for all of it, I\u0027m sure some people will find it much better!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock parts for the most part will stay as they are in terms of impact resistance. Armoured parts from Skillful could be rammed to death, but are much stronger in this regard than stock KSP parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hammer Tech","CreatedById":97099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T22:04:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil this point I was only interested in this mod as a cool idea (I don\u0027t see much point in weapons for KSP)- Now I understand that there\u0027ll be proper damage it\u0027s worth getting just for that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong I\u0027m not badmouthing your mod; regardless of whether or not I would use it it\u0027s still a genius idea that looks to be extremely well implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, as I say, I might well get this when it\u0027s out just for the sweet sweet damage...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DragonShadow","CreatedById":103304,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T00:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zuni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zuni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe a good option is something like flares.
