But lately i started to try to time launches, and compared to my previous rendezvouses, even a guess of correct time makes it much much easier and quicker (and effective). I think you don\u0027t have to be too precise, you can adjust the orbit even with very small deltavs. And you can decide how much deltav you can allow. (The lower deltav, the more time you need to wait)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T09:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh come on, I was just joking. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnglish is not my native language, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMrAnonymous, exact time can\u0027t be calculated because you\u0027re flying the vessel, introducing abberations in the flight plan which result in orbital deviations.

If it is higher in orbit, then you should wait for it to be further past KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine a target in a 100km orbit. If it is straight overhead when you launch, you will be only slightly behind it when you reach an 80km orbit because of the curved trajectory of the launch. Since you are lower, your relative speed will be slightly faster and you will slowly catch up until it is time to burn and match APs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow imagine something in geostationary orbit on the other side of Kerbin. That target stays 180 degrees on the other side of Kerbin from KSC. When you launch from KSC, you will end up slightly past your ideal burn time to match your apoapsis (because you are slighly downrange from KSC).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a rough start, but from there you can get some experience and do some trial and error like others have suggested. I\u0027m sure someone created a mod or online app for that, but I don\u0027t know of any myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: incline orbits are another challenge in themselves. I\u0027m sure there is a host of techniques for that, but your biggest concern is launching when KSC is nearing the inclined orbit.
