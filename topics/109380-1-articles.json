This is my first time posting, and I\u0027m excited to share a really cool mission my friend and I have been working on. We asked ourselves, \u0022what\u0027s the biggest challenge we can tackle in KSP?\u0022 and decided that a single mission that visited all the bodies in the Jool system was it. We did tons of planning and are just starting to actually put stuff in orbit.\n\nWe\u0027re going to have to play it in beta, though, since 1.0 changes so much, it would throw off all our dV calculations ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif).\n\nRight now we\u0027re hoping to video most of it, but we\u0027ll have to see how long we can sustain that. Let me know what you think!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXOcsLGDFEY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T19:36:57Z","Content":"Hi and welcome to the KSP forum.
