Once I have the objectives, I design the payloads necessary to complete each one. Usually each objective is accomplished by a separate payload although, for instance, a single SCANsat will do for both Ike and Duna if you do it right. Sometimes I set out to accomplish all objectives in 1 big expedition, sometimes I figure on building up to the final goal over several expeditions. The real design work is in the payloads, but in most cases they only take 10-30 minutes each. Then I just put whatever rockets under the payloads are necessary to get them off the ground off to wherever they\u0027re going, and launch them all.
