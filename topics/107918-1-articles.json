Especially if the clues are subtle, and not practically handed to you in game-That is, the game doesn\u0027t prompt you to investigate, and solving clues it might take some comparing photos, and writing in a notepad.\n\nThe thing I didn\u0027t like about Nova\u0027s original concept, is that seeking out the relics, and/or whatever made them could have become the focus of the game. Games about seeking out aliens/precursor civilisations can be great fun, Extrasolar even has a science/discovery system kerbal could learn a few things from, but Kerbal should be about space exploration.\n\nPlus, finding a lot of obvious structures out there can sort of spoil the feel of being the first to reach those places.\n\nThough, it would be cool as an extra thing. What would be even cooler, would be if there was some element that varied each time, so the clues wouldn\u0027t lead to the same place each time. Prevent anyone who talks about how it works from completely spoiling it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T05:59:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 05:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tw1**"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T09:30:06Z","Content":"Yes, yes, yes...

How about some more crashed ships round about? A Blake\u0027s 7 Liberator half-buried in the ground on Eve. A Babylon 5 Shadow Ship that\u0027s been half-excavated out of the ground on Duna. Think of that derelict Star Destroyer on the Star Wars trailer -- how awesome would it be to find something like that? You could even have something floating in the sea on Eve maybe. ..I\u0027m just throwing ideas about. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI don\u0027t necessarily want the make the solar system feel like it\u0027s populated, but maybe that there were ancient beings that have visited here in the distant past. A few Easter Island, Teotihuacan Pyramid, Nazca Lines (even flattened-hilltops with Nazca \u0027runways\u0027), scattered around the solar system to give the player a bit of an eerie moment. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ..I would love to see one or two giant statues of creatures that are obviously not Kerbal in nature. \n\nI don\u0027t think they should be placed randomly. They can be static, like the current ones. Will make it so much easier to incorporate them into the landscape properly. And players more interested in the finding than the hunting can just go to kerbal maps dot com to see where to look. (Even if you know the general vicinity, some of them are a bit of work to land nearby and find.) \n\nI love joethebeast\u0027s idea of a derelict satellite or two about the place. And, while we\u0027re at it, a few small Kerbal settlements on Kerbin.

Apropos of that, I think that some of those exploration contracts should actually lead you to them! That and maybe there should be some kind of new scanner part that alerts you to the presence of anomalous surface features if you fly over them. The devs could really add a whole lot of depth to the game play experience by implementing more stuff along those lines. And of couse EVA reports at the Easter egg sites should give you science!"}]}
