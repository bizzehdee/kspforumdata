This thread is for people to talk about and share those ideas with other people to see what they think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee.g. Me and one of my friends came up with an idea for an open world building game where players have to gather scrap materials to create weapons, vehicles and buildings from with a construction system vaguely similar to KSP. As you gather allies you compete against other factions for the limited resources available and try to eventually conquer the world. Most of the game would be in either 1st or 3rd person rather than being a strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat have you guys come up with over the years? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brethern","CreatedById":15602,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T18:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see a game based off the battle room from ender\u0027s game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO it\u0027s a cool concept and would make for a fun FTP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
