I created an unmanned drop module that would fly down from lower orbit and drop a rover on the surface via winch and a connector port (attached to the rover) and the drop module will never have to land...to do this I actually attach the winch end piece to the rover in lower orbit. The rover would still be attached to the launch rocket while the drop module is maneuvering to grab it. I EVA a kerbal to attache the winch to the rover\u0027s connector port. Then, every damn time, I decouple the coupler that attaches the rover to the rocket, the game crashes...just freezes and quits.

I work in hospitality, I get asked the same damn question over and over every night. Just relax a bit, man.
