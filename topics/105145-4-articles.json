I had intended to do 2 stage recovery, with the LV-N stage being for circularization, and the space plane being suborbital.\n\nAnd since the payload isn\u0027t allowed to have any decoupler or anything, the orbit insertion stage has to decouple from it, and cant have a heat shield on the front... so I split the orbital insertion stage in two, and the part at the front has the heat shield.\n\nThe idea would be to undock the payload, then rejoin the two 2.5 sections.\n\nBut it just SSTOs anyway... there\u0027s so much LF left in the rapier\u002B wing stage, I can just take everytin to orbit on the LV-Ns after cutting the rapiers.\n\nI didn\u0027t need to throttle back the LV-Ns... 1.02 really made them viable again...
