It would be nice if we could have submarines with special engine and pod types. I know currently there isn\u0027t much in the sea so you could add some coral or easter eggs under the water. The sub engines would basically be propellers under water. The submarine parts will have a setting for buoyancy level determining if it should sink or float overall. The submarine has a set of parts for it you get engines, fueltanks, and pods, with parts to weigh your craft down. You wouldn\u0027t get too much science under water but you would get some and when going eva with a kerbal, while swimming ctrl and shift should make you go up or down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this to work the water will need alot of changes like :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter underwater effects,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bottom view of the sea like when your in a pool and see the waves upsidedown,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLess light the farther down you go,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater Pressure,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompressed ores at the bottom,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3D underwater light models,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater not being like concrete mainly softer for impacts,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA part that is only in the code that removes all water in your ship testing for all around where it can spread and where water can get in(like an air bubble to not have the inside of you place filled with water or water come through walls),\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCoral(always rendered no matter what settings unless its farther than 3\u00A0km\u00A0or more than a setting for max amount being 20-unlimited(mainly 100,000)\u00A0and it would be very tall being able to hide ships in it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thiagobs","CreatedById":76021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-16T02:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat sound like a nice set of features for mods...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a lot of work for an aspect that isn\u0027t the game focus...
