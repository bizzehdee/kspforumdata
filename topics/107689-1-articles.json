Just ran a quick test: of the two 1x6 panels, the one with casing radiated twice as much heat. The Gigantor, 12-15 times as much as the cased 1x6 (better when hot, that is, it works best when you need it the most). The 275kg swept wing was better still, like twenty of the small panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy weight, the wing wins. It seems that the wing is much better at picking up the heat; running hotter, it can then radiate more. Still, sustained operation will require like 1000kg worth of wing for every engine.
