I could reinstall it to display the error log if you like, as long as one gets created by this oddity. After being on this newer version of TAC i doubt i\u0027ll be moving back to ECLSS, they seem to have added better power use tracking (sadly still not @ KSC or tracking station screens though), and it has food/water \u0026amp; waste/waste water to go with O2/CO2. Combined with the faster updates/more active thread it has i think its the way to go with the future holding lots of stock KSP updates. ECLSS is a decent LS mod, dont get me wrong i really enjoyed using it. I\u0027m sure it will be a good mod when its has time to go through more testing and gets food/water resources.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-06T03:50:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2014 03:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
