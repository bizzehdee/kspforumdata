This technique works from altitudes of 75~100km. (Someone made a very handy chart that is more fleshed out than my method, I can\u0027t find it to link.) At that point I let \u0027chutes and atmosphere do their work. Also I\u0027ll fire what expendable fuel I may have to fine tune the approach - albeit before the \u0027chutes deploy.
