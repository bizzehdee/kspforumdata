Are there any sort of things you see that makes you go... \u0022*Oh, crud! Not **THIS** again?\u0022*\n\u003E \n\nIn my opinion, the most challenging aspect of being a moderator is the ability to keep one\u0027s cool if a problem reoccurs. Managing emotions in the face of adversity is an important skill to have for anyone, let alone moderators, and sometimes if a problem repeats itself time and time again its harder to give fair judgement and take appropriate action.\n\nThat\u0027s why, of course, it\u0027s advantageous to have many different moderators that can confer and collaborate. I never knew the group of people on the moderation staff were as cool of people as they were until I myself was accepted into the ranks- one of the best things that\u0027s happened in my time on the internet ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T21:57:28Z","Content":"It seems that the default profile pictre has changed from the ~~shaved Bart~~ Kerbal silhouette to a person silhouette.
