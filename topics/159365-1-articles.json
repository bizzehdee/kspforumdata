When I am around a couple hundred km up I can fire another engine on a light stage without it spinning out, and then recovering is basically impossible, even with assistance from something like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I try \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I have not been able to find a layout that can arrest the spinning, even with the engine off, it seems to slow it down slightly, and then stop slowing things down entirely. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E layout, or something else, but I\u0027ve tried several layouts. I would love some advice on this.

All avionics does is allows you to control the vehicle. It doesn\u0027t provide any control authority on its own. To actually control things, you need actuating fins, engine gimballing, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, or dedicated reaction wheels (which are too slow, heavy, and power hungry for use on most vessels).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, you want it as far from the center of mass as possible. You get more torque per unit thrust that way. It\u0027s also important to make sure your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is balanced; the last thing you want is for rotating your ship to induce unwanted translation. Beyond that, make sure the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel you\u0027re using is appropriate to the task at hand. Cold gas thrusters won\u0027t get you very far. For later things, Cavea B is nice; a good combination of density and specific impulse. For early things, HTP or Hydrazine are okay. And, of course, don\u0027t forget to set the thruster fuel in the engine config menu. It\u0027s an awful feeling to fly a mission all the way into orbit, just to realize that you forgot to set your thrusters to the right fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grimm Spector","CreatedById":148772,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-18T06:01:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell given that my initial option for fuel is only N2 at the beginning that\u0027s a problem.
