Now that I\u0027ve installed RSS, I want to keep making reusable vehicles, but with all the constraints that would apply to a real one. However, I\u0027ve been having some difficult figuring out the most efficient method of bringing the spent stages down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I have so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParachute splashdown: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- high-mass ratio stage still must perform burn at landing to survive impact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B Parachutes save 300 m/s maximum, weigh approx. 1 t for 20 t stage (at 20 m/s descent). Equivalent fuel would weigh approx. 2 t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- High maintenance costs due to salt water exposure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- added complexity, risk of parachute failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*\u002B only feasible method for SRBs, which are also more durable, less susceptible to water damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoostback, parachute landing: not feasible - unsteerable parachutes do not offer sufficient precision for safe touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropulsive splashdown: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B low dV requirements as only landing, possible small braking burn used. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- High maintenance costs due to salt water exposure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoostback, propulsive landing: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- very high dV requirements, likely over 2 km/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B Allows for very fast turnaround, no transport costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In practice, turnaround time from transport will be minimal compared to time from inspection, maintenance, and payload integration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*- dV requirements prohibitive for central core of multi-core variants (possibly variants with many SRBs as well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*\u002B dV requirements lower for outer cores of multi-core variants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParafoil to splashdown: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B low dV requirements. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B Parafoils provide cross-range capability with no fuel use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding occurs horizontally, with low vertical speed but high horizontal speed.

It seems like parachutes are pretty much out, and the central core of something like a Falcon Heavy would have to land downrange, but I\u0027m unsure whether parafoils would be worth the dV savings and possible cross-range capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor that matter, would a three-stage vehicle be viable? (first stage pops up, lands at launch site, second stage lands far enough down range to cross an ocean, third stage reaches orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T10:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you sure all options are viable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith RSS, the distances and dV you are dealing with are larger.
