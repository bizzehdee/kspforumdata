I found the game through KurtJMac when he started playing it in 0.13.2. I liked it, but not quite enough to buy it; especially since I myself am too young to have a credit card and my parents never bothered getting one. In 0.17, however, my desire to play grew and I downloaded the demo. After playing for a couple weeks I worked up the courage to ask my dad if I could get this game as an early Christmas present (this was during KerbalKon, Nov 30 2012). To my surprise, he said he\u0027d been deciding whether or not he should get one for a while now and since this game was \u0026lt; $20 he was okay with it. Sadly, the credit card took a whole month to arrive (especially because of the busy holiday season) and on December 31st I finally got to play it in 0.18.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Flying! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TooManyErrors","CreatedById":57113,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T21:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI bought KSP in 0.16.
