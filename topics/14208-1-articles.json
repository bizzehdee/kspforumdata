Metal fuel lines and fittings, which failed in unpredictable ways, were used as this was the best technology available. Both fuel and oxidizer were toxic and required extreme care when loading in the aircraft, yet there were occasions when Komets exploded on the tarmac from the propellants\\\u0027 hypergolic nature. The corrosive nature of the liquids, especially for the T-Stoff oxidizer, required special protective gear for the pilots.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroPelican","CreatedById":28509,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T09:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to have caught the K syndrome, Nova won\\\u0027t be happy...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T14:11:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s a normal German word, not a kerbification of comet (oh, new word invented!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"the_bT","CreatedById":3876,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T19:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGermans had the K syndrome before it was cool 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sleepybean2","CreatedById":26932,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T19:28:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to make a 262.
