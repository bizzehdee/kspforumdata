That is, taking three \u0022propellants\u0022, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and some type of intake atmosphere (like Firespitter does (or used to do) for electric propellers) to generate thrust, allowing it to operate in planets with atmosphere that aren\u0027t Kerbin and Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, I suppose you could theoretically do it already by taking an electric engine, fuel tanks and a whole load of fuel cells to generate electricity, even with only Stock parts now with Breaking Ground, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution (specially with how much of a bloody effort it feels to me to actually try to control a propeller plane (and let\u0027s not even talk about helicopters) created through the new stock rotors) than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for what seems a current question that seems to pop out in every past thread about it I found when doing a search: How is it different from a rocket engine? It\u0027s not creating thrust by expelling it\u0027s reactional mass, instead being essentially a normal internal combustion engine that is carrying it\u0027s own oxidizer to create torque for the engines, so as to push the (oxygen-less) air around it, generating thrust that way. And while it certainly is going to lose quite a bit of efficiency (considering the standard rates of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E to Oxidizer in KSP, a bit over half of it), it\u0027s still \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E more efficient than to generate thrust solely by pushing internally carried reaction mass out. I mean, half of the worst jet engines is still better than even the best of non-ion rocket engines, at approximately 3200/2 or 1600 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E for the Rapier equivalent, compared to 800 for a stock nuclear engine (in a vacuum). And about 6000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E for a Goliath Equivalent (good luck hauling a plane using \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E to far planets though :P )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know there\u0027s the Exploudium Breathing Engine mod, but that\u0027s not quite what I was hoping for, even if it gets a bit close. That just \u0022inverts\u0022 the relation of what\u0027s being carried, oxidizer instead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E, and makes it breath Eve\u0027s atmosphere, which it assumes to be some form of combustible compound. Is not a bad approach, mind you, but not what I was looking for either. So, is there anything else like I was hoping for?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-01T00:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a couple of atomic jet engines available\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Incarnation of Chaos","CreatedById":197414,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-01T08:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntbh i think you would need some sort of \u0022Pre-burner\u0022 before the intake of the jet engine; you can\u0027t just dump fuel and oxidizer into the intake and expect something to happen. You need flow to start the compression stages which then can become self-sustaining at a certain RPM; this is why on any airfield you\u0027re gonna see APU\u0027s they use to get them started (Sometimes these are intergrated into the planes themselves). So a modified Jet Engine that takes OX and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E would actually have what amounts to a very inefficient rocket placed in front of the intake; that would use a little bit of the fuel to create a stream of partially burned Fuel/Oxidizer and spin the turbines up.

The J58 didn\u0027t have a hard cutoff; it just became more and more of a ramjet up until the flow thru the turbines resembled a ducted fan instead of a turbojet. A thrust curve could be written for that i suppose; i\u0027m just not familar enough with it\u0027s engine code to suggest how.
