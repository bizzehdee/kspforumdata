You want to steer this thing very gently and few degrees at a time. Basically, if you don\u0027t have fins the only way to steer your rocket is the engine gimbal which is usually not enough. You can enhance your steering authority by adding RCSs, reaction wheels or aerodynamic control surfaces (fins). What happens is as you start steering your rocket it has too much momentum to immediately change its heading so it continues flying upwards but this time the aerodynamic pressure on the top of your rocket forces it downward which results in increasing the \u0027angle of attack\u0027 which in turn exposes more area to the airflow.
