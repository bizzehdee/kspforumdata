The Fire Hawk was something I designed only after finishing the Prowler and realizing I needed a way of transporting it. That was quite a face-palm moment. At the same time I realized it didn\u0027t make sense to do all that work for a single purpose. There\u0027s a lot of things I want to do with the Fire Hawk but I didn\u0027t want to sit on a completed Prowler while I developed those features. The Fire Hawk, as a result, was a very rushed design. The good news is there is lots of potential and I look forward to exploring it. My first order of business is to design my own lander legs. The stock ones are way too long for the purpose and the way I attach them is poorly designed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wasmic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wasmic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI fully understand that.

However, in light of the problems with the panels I will switch over to RTG until I can figure out the problem with the panels.\u003Cp\u003EThe bouncing problem is likely caused by a collider mesh interacting with the terrain that confuses the physics engine. It\u0027s not intentional. I only noticed the behavior after the buggy got airborne off of a jump or similar terrain feature and never just sitting, more or less, still.

I\u0027ve never done an animation like this before and my intent is to make a neat looking flat-folding leg system.

Where the Prowler is designed for simple transport the, as yet unnamed, chassis will be for science gathering and will offer a variety of ways to incorporate scientific tools. I have an idea how I want it to look and function but I need to play with the new science mechanic in KSP to make sure it will be relevant.
