Not having access to the stock parts (and not having immediate access to the stock textures without considerable fuss) makes stock-alike modding (Which there isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Enearly \u003C/em\u003Eenough of) quite a bit more difficult. It\u0027d be great to be able to take the hatches(for example) from the stock meshes and put them on other things or tweak the shape of pods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the better part of KSP is not it\u0027s models, I really don\u0027t understand what the reason for this decision is. If there is a reason I\u0027d love to hear it, but this is also a complaint of sorts--I think the policy is rather silly and I\u0027d really like to see it changed so the community can do more to expand the pool of stock-alike parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T21:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen making a docking port meant to be styled as stock, I ran into this issue. The solution: Someone in the KSP community has created a .mu importer for Blender. Squad doesn\u0027t complain about that. If you really need to get at stock geometry, it\u0027s not that hard. That\u0027s how I did the docking port on my extendo-port. I took a stock one, modified the geometry (cut stuff off) so it would fit with what I had and slapped it on there. perfect stock matching docking port without having to recreate the intricacies of the part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T23:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh?
