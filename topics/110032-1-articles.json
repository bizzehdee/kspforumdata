Superconductors are stable when floating, meaning that every (not too big) disturbance will be counteracted; but if you ignore everything (mostly inductive effects and friction) then it would keep swinging back and forth. In reality, it stops moving after some seconds. One can by the way float things at room temperature using diamagnetism; it even works with permanent magnets when using sufficiently diagmagnetic materials (pyrolithic graphite, bismuth).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other side, there is a mathematical theorem (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnshaw%27s_theorem\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnshaw%27s_theorem\u003C/a\u003E) that forbids stable and non-moving configurations of objects influenced by gravity and/or \u0022usual\u0022 magnetism; the relevant part is that you only allow repulsion via dipoles, i.e. charges and magnetic poles, but not that some weird materials are repelled by both poles. You can cheat the system by e.g. using rotating objects as they are not counted as non-moving. Or you realise that electromagnetism allows for diamagnetism or even superconductors, rendering the assumption on the forces moot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus (because the assumptions are almost true in most settings) that theorem still says that what you say is correct more often than not: most stable configurations need to move.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
