Every time I build a rocket, if I forget to assign somebody else to the crew (on a one man pod), he\u0027s always the one to step up. Bless him! But lately the effort has been taking too much of a toll on his work. The union is trying to give him a break but he never takes one. It\u0027s gotten to the point where they have to cancel the launch and send him off for a water break so they can sneak someone else into the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest randomizing the crew out of all available astronauts, rather than always defaulting to Jeb (then Bill, then Bob, then whoever comes after that).

However, your way I think would be more realistic, but then might be a bit too predictable. Not that I\u0027d mind as it accomplishes the same goal of getting every kerbal in the air as many times as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MSD","CreatedById":59320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T01:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry, just parking him isnt a solution at all.
