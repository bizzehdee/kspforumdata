I walked in the metaphorical door expecting a huge set of huge wings similar to those available in 0.90, and found a meager three or four. They don\u0027t snap together, they don\u0027t blend together, they cannot be put end-to-end...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how should they be fixed? What new pieces need to be added to the MK3 series of spaceplane wings?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest some structural segments, similar to the rectangular small wings. The MK3 \u0022Main Wing\u0022 can stay, but it only seems to serve the purpose of the rear of a wing or the only wing on the craft. And considering its size and ungainly shape, it simply is not fit for the latter of the two options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding gear are missing a few touches as well. Their lack of steering is unfortunate. I would be fine with the big four-wheel model not having steering, but IMO the medium one should have at least a few degrees of freedom. The medium and large landing gear are also missing rolling animations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:35:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was expecting the SP\u002B set scaled up.
