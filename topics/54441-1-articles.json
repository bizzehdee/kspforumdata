I did a brief search but couldn\u0027t really find any specific example of my idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been on board with KSP since .20 I believe. I learned more about rocket science and orbit \u0026amp; all in the first two weeks of this game than I had my entire life up to that point. In other words I absolutely love this game, and if there will ever be a problem in my marriage it will likely be this game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways to the suggestion, considering myself a novice/apprentice/\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eproficient\u003C/span\u003E/distinguished player, what I really have absolutely no idea how to approach is the best chance to transfer from Kerbin orbit to an other planet. Some transfers are doable with some extra time toying with the maneuver tool (the adjacent orbit planets), but more than one planet away from kerbin, and I have extreme difficulty (i.e. ICAN\u0027TDOIT) finding the appropriate time/opportunity to transfer my orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I propose is some SOME kind of system of notifying the player that her/his Jool/Moho/etc window-of-opportunity is coming up soon, or ending soon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw another suggestion with the idea of some kind of flight/trajectory *planning* (not autopilot) GUI, and thought that if something like that were implemented that a simple orbit transfer reminder of some sort couldn\u0027t be that big of a deal to include.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T00:00:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome, fellow kerbonaut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I don\u0027t know about a single tool to give you transfer windows in KSP, I believe you could be interested in the following two:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Launch Window Planner (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E), a tool that calculates such windows in a browser, external to the game. As you may see using that tool, there are a number of parameters about your desired transfer to set. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal Alarm Clock (KAC) (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kerbal-alarm-clock-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kerbal-alarm-clock-2/\u003C/a\u003E), a tool that allows you to set a reminder for almost any action ingame (and realworld time as well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if I plan a mission somwhere, first check the Window Planner and find the time of the launch, then set an alarm with KAC. Duration of flight and required Delta-V from the planner are also very useful, so you can build/use a ship with the required performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Nowak","CreatedById":67890,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T15:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDitto on the Kerbal Alarm Clock love.
