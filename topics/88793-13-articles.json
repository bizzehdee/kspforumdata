After performing extensive technical design evaluation and a number of sensitivityanalyses of the LO2 turbopump, it became apparent to the IRT that the HBA and thrust bearingdesigns have several intricacies and sensitivities that make it difficult to reliably manage bearingloads. As a result, this area of the turbopump is vulnerable to oxygen fire and failures. The AJ26engines were not subjected to a thorough delta-qualification program to demonstrate theiroperational capability and margin for use on Antares. Performing a thorough delta-qualificationprogram for Antares would likely have revealed these issues. Furthermore, the Acceptance TestProgram (ATP) established for the AJ26 engines was not sufficient to test and screen the enginesfor these design sensitivities and potential workmanship issues that could exacerbate thosesensitivities.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:verdana;\u0022\u003ETRC-2: \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:verdana;\u0022\u003EForeign Object Debris (FOD) introduction to the E15 LO2 turbopump\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:verdana;\u0022\u003E.

Forensicinvestigation performed by Orbital ATK and NASA discovered the presence of a defect on theturbine housing bearing bore that was not consistent with baseline design requirements3. Theinvestigation determined that the defect was introduced during machining of the bearing borehousing and was therefore present prior to the engine ATP and Antares launch for Orb-3.Forensic investigation of Engine E17, which failed during ATP in May 2014, discovered thepresence of a similar non-conforming defect in the housing bearing bore. A limited number ofother engine turbine housings (i.e., Engine E16 and the 1998 test engine) previously andsuccessfully subjected to extended ground tests and ATP, as well as an untested spare turbinehousing, were inspected. Neither E16 nor the spare housing showed any evidence of a similarmanufacturing defect. However, the 1998 test engine that had been subjected to extensive groundtesting exhibited a similar defect to that observed in Engines E15 and E17, but it was not possibleto conclude whether the defect was introduced during manufacturing or was the result of wearfrom extended operation of the engine. Sufficient information is not available without furtherengine inspections and tests to conclude that the presence of this manufacturing defect wouldalways result in failure of the engine during operation.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T23:44:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Erecovered impeller \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, they were able to recover something out of this fireball?
