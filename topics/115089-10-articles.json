As the second game I\u0027ve ever started, this was quite a journey. The limitations forced me to make do with less, truly fly by the seat of my pants, and take low tech further than I ever thought possible!

I see someone did a Duna fly-by and I am floored. How the heck do you even pull that off without so much as a closest approach indicator / SOI prediction?\n\nAs it is my little adventure may have been fairly ordinary but it worked and I am myself quite pleased with the results.\n\nPerhaps I went into a bit too much detail, but here\u0027s the account.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Mun encounters are fairly easy even if I did need a little finessing once I hit the SOI, Minmus was more of a challenge but I think I\u0027ve developed a reasonable feel for the angles and only missed the encounter once, having to go around a few times to make contact. The thing I really noticed though was ho much I take the manoeuvre nodes for granted when returning a probe to Kerbin.
