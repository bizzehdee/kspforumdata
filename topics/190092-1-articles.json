It\u0027s actually quite decent for the cost (free as the name might imply), however, I returned to SolidWorks (which is, of course not intended to be free), but is a beast and just works for everything I threw at it.

In contrast SketchUp (also free) is something I can\u0027t wrap my head around and find unusable.
