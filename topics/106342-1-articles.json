One of the few games which can bring setting, gameplay and presentation into a perfect balance. The latter might be a bit lacking at times, but the former ones really play to the strenghts of a videogame. There are few other games that reach that level of harmony between it\u0027s concepts, where exchanging any part would inherently damage the product.
