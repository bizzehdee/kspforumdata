Times have changed. Now with the new heat system, and thrust reduction related to ambient pressure... the LV-N feels a bit anemic to me. But, instead of nerfing heat production to make it a tad better, why not increase the amount of thrust in a vacuum? Say upping it to 100? Personally I think it would be more interesting to have the heat level be a bit excessive in addition to having high thrust to drive home the fact that you are having to manage a nuclear reactor and preventing it from going critical. And... if it were to go critical, it would be rather interesting to have an engine capable of destroying an entire spacecraft if it blows up as a result of overheating ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T05:13:58Z","Content":"Because Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engines don\u0027t work that way."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T06:46:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Because Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engines don\u0027t work that way.\n\nI suggest that the LV-N has a \u0027start reactor\u0027 with a giant spool up time and lots of heat, and a \u0027Activate engine\u0027 which needs to have the reactor on, but cools it."},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T12:53:32Z","Content":"Agreed that Nerv needs slight buffing, but 100 could be overdoing it.

It used to be the solution for almost every interplanetary problem, now it\u0027s only best some of the time and requires some thought about heat management. For that matter, thrust isn\u0027t hugely relevant once in orbit, you can get away with very low TWRs if you are careful. Increasing its thrust might make it crowd out some of the lander engines, too."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T13:14:24Z","Content":"What about increasing ISP instead?

Not sure how much more it could be buffed without making it too strong."},{"CreatedByName":"Justicier","CreatedById":89671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:42:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Because Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engines don\u0027t work that way.\n\nAware of this, and they don\u0027t have a very low thrust output in a vacuum either for the sake of not wanting to offend the tender sensibilities of conventional rocket motors ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) Concessions for the sake of gameplay have already been made for it, I was merely trying to work within the current modus operandi to de-nerficate the Nerv ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) In addition, I was unaware that NTR\u0027s were impossible to overheat, I haven\u0027t seen much in the way of articles dealing with their heat management. I do know they have to run very hot to get the best efficiency, and are capable of generating far higher temperatures than the materials used for the housing are capable of withstanding. With that knowledge I thought an NTR \u0022going critical\u0022 would be a possibility.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I suggest that the LV-N has a \u0027start reactor\u0027 with a giant spool up time and lots of heat, and a \u0027Activate engine\u0027 which needs to have the reactor on, but cools it.\n\nI love this idea! This system would encourage the user to activate the engine at the peak temperature in order to get the best ISP the NTR is capable of. It may be wise to integrate a temperature readout in the right click menu for the engine, and perhaps a \u0022current estimated ISP\u0022 to show the user what efficiency the engine would have at its current temperature level. This would require more planning ahead of maneuver nodes and it gives the method of operation for the Nerv a very different flavor than any other rocket in the game. I\u0027m all for more planning and management to get the most out of it as opposed to the simplistic operation of LFO\u0027s.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T18:57:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 06:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Justicier**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:46:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I suggest that the LV-N has a \u0027start reactor\u0027 with a giant spool up time and lots of heat, and a \u0027Activate engine\u0027 which needs to have the reactor on, but cools it.\n\n[My first post on the forum actually discussed this, but it seems it was ignored.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121844-Rethinking-the-Nuke-for-real-this-time?p=1951570\u0026viewfull=1#post1951570)"},{"CreatedByName":"Justicier","CreatedById":89671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T19:13:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [My first post on the forum actually discussed this, but it seems it was ignored.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121844-Rethinking-the-Nuke-for-real-this-time?p=1951570\u0026viewfull=1#post1951570)\n\nWish I had seen that thread earlier, whatever the source I still think it\u0027s an excellent idea.
