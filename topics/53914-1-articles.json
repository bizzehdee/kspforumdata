How do people deal with this, and stop your beautiful shuttle cartwheeling into a fireball? Is it simple a matter of rolling the craft onto its back and choosing the right pitch angle so the off-centre torque from the engine is cancelled out by the tendency of the craft to topple under gravity? In that case, I have a whole new-found respect for anyone who was able to pilot that thing!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-25T12:38:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2013 12:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by peadar1987\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camelotking524","CreatedById":58776,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T18:40:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Image-of-space_shuttle-launch.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Image-of-space_shuttle-launch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see in this pic, the main engines on the orbiter are angeled through the center of mass.
