In fact, that\u2019s not even what intelligence means.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA very interesting response I found regarding the question of whether \u201Chuman level intelligence could evolve again\u201D is that human level intelligence isn\u2019t really a thing. Intelligence is merely a reflection of a species\u2019 natural behavior. What suits humans does not necessarily suit another species. So expecting rodents to have to evolve to build fires to \u201Chave human level intelligence\u201D is dumb, because that doesn\u2019t correspond to how rodents behave- many burrow underground and thus don\u2019t need fire to keep warm. The concept of fire denoting intelligence is forcing human behavior on species that don\u2019t do what we do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther more, \u201Cintelligence\u201D is relative. From the point of view of a shark, which has had tens of millions of more years to evolve than us, humans are rather unintelligent- look at how many people drown each year! And they do this while deliberately entering the water while sharks only beach by accident. So a species can be intelligent without appearing similar to humanity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then we come to the concept of space travel. What\u2019s up with that? There is no tangible need to fly to space. Perhaps humanity would be more intelligent investing what it has into space in its problems on Earth over the decades since the 1920s. It could be argued that space travel is an expansion of our habitat, but for what? Fish don\u2019t dream of putting on \u201CTerrestrial Vehicular Activity Suits\u201D and expanding on land, after all, they thrive in their limited environments. The concept of expanding into a habitat where can not even survive is\u2026 interesting, but does not seem to be well thought out*. It\u2019s basically building a habitat on a lifeless rock or in the sky\u2026 but with no air. Remember, \u201Cintelligence\u201D is a reflection of a species\u2019 natural behavior. Land species are known to expand their range whenever possible, but expanding into somewhere they can\u2019t actually survive seems like a rather inefficient use of time and resources**. But anyhow, my point in this paragraph is that space travel does not \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E to be the hallmark of an \u201Cintelligent\u201D species. It reflects human behavior in that we try to expand our range wherever possible (perhaps most famously over the Bering Strait land bridge into the Americas), but considering other species it may not make sense to them to expand their range into the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to that one might say \u201Cbut the Earth will be destroyed eventually\u201D, to that I say\u2026 so? The universe will be destroyed eventually but that doesn\u2019t make the existence of humanity tragic, and neither would the destruction of the Earth make the existence of any other species tragic, even if it was \u201Cintelligent\u201D***.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gist of all of this is that a species can be \u201Cintelligent\u201D, even by human standards, but not necessarily behave as we do, so expecting space travel to occur- or having it as a requirement for \u201Cintelligence\u201D- is wrong. But assuming space travel is worthwhile for every \u201Cintelligent\u201D species for some reason\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to wonder, can any species actually be fit for something like space travel? Primates happen to be built for the complex physical requirements (like\u2026 opposable thumbs) needed for construction of things like space ships. And operating their controls. If humans had the physiology of rodents or crows (or whatever your favorite for post-humanity intelligence), I invite you to ponder- could we still manufacture spacecraft and then operate them? Remember, \u201Cintelligence\u201D is a reflection of a species\u2019 natural behavior. Our opposable thumbs first appeared because \u003Cem\u003Ewe actually needed them to survive\u003C/em\u003E, and then got to the point where we can send text messages with them by chance. But will a crow or rodent need their own \u201Copposable thumb\u201D equivalent after humanity is gone?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, Earth\u2019s oxygen content will need to get high again to start any species down the road to human level intelligence, in order for their brain to get bigger and more complex. Most climate modeling is focused on the next 100-maybe 500ish years, but what about millions? I genuinely do not know if this may happen again, but for the purposes of my story I decided the stars would likely not align again for humans, just as they have not (at least yet) for insects****.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn an offhand note, I would say this means the possibilities of extraterrestrial intelligence are high- they just don\u2019t do space travel or nasty things like pumping greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. The problem is, the SETI people, who may not have much experience with things like evolutionary biology, are expecting \u003Cem\u003Ehumanity: alien edition\u003C/em\u003E every single time.\u00A0It\u2019s often recognized that aliens would likely look nothing like us, in response to questions about the possibilities of little green men, and thus I find it odd we (humanity/pop culture/SETI) simultaneously expect them to \u003Cem\u003Eact\u003C/em\u003E like us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Space colonization is the product of philosophers and otherwise non-scientifically-influenced scientists, during a time when imperialism was regarded as a proper thing, among other terrible backwards things. I can\u2019t help but think that these weren\u2019t serious proposals for space habitation, but instead were basically taking ideas about colonization on Earth and pasting them onto space. The idea has been built upon since then by people picking it up as a product of their heroes and inspirations, but without examining the context in which it was created. If one explores somewhere, they tend to then colonize it, but I assume this was looking at the Moon, Mars, and so on and going \u201Csolid planetary body = we can survive there\u201D rather than actually thinking the feasibility through. After all, we explore the sea all the time and I have yet to see widespread proposals for undersea colonization. The immense faith some place in the inevitably of space colonization also feels a bit like the irresponsible use of \u201Cbut people thought *X innovator* couldn\u2019t do it in their time\u201D at times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n**It could be argued that the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life is an instance where \u201Cgoing to live somewhere you can\u2019t live\u201D has happened, but this was not on a scale comprehensible to humans. That was a \u201CI dip my toe in the water unconsciously sometimes and ten million years later I have webbed feet\u201D type deal, not \u201Cself sustaining Mars colony in 100 years!!11!!! LETS GO BRO1\u201D thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***There are some who cast humanity potentially remaining on Earth as dumb: a societal level mental regression. But if we don\u2019t consider people who accept death as \u201Cmentally regressive\u201D (requiring people to kick and scream in agony at the end of their life to be \u201Cnormal\u201D) I don\u2019t see why accepting extinction is \u201Cmentally regressive\u201D. This seems more like a cultural trait passed down from manifest destiny rather than a sensible consideration of what scientifically constitutes \u201Cintelligence\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n****By insects I mean things like meganisoptera, not the tiny, rather lowly (in the food chain) things of today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-20T12:55:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224165853\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209396\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221660988536\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf saving non-human life is pointless because they go extinct when Earth becomes uninhabitable, does that not make saving human life pointless because they go extinct when the universe ends (in the best case scenario you describe where they spread through space)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFair point.
