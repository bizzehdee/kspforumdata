As we speak, I am loading the 16 promised VSC-Ms up for a jump to Isotunneling velocity, and they should arrive within the hour. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E These are some pretty impressive shields. One immediate flaw I realize that wasn\u0027t listed was that they don\u0027t regenerate. May I suggest a recursive electro-dynamic search algorithm? This way, any usable energy signatures that are compatible with it\u0027s own are integrated, and added to it\u0027s own integrity. One such material that can do meshes like this is Verteron based omni-spectral barriers. If you\u0027d like, I could deliver this one, but it would have to be by hand [unstable in pre-erected state].\n\u003E \n\u003E When you receive them, I have ordered them to comply with your commands [as long as such commands conflict with their ethnics]. They will go to work immediately. I guess you\u0027d call it a smart bomb.\n\u003E \n\u003E ga energy.\n\nShipment received.
