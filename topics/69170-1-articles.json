Couple of things - maybe this\u0027d be better in the Add-On Development section? And why not chuck in a link to this thread in the Spaceport info box so people can find out more? Also, it\u0027s probably not a good idea to link directly to MJ #209 (honestly speaking, I wouldn\u0027t even link to Jenkins, but rather the forum thread) as it\u0027ll quickly be surpassed by newer versions (and indeed, already has been. I think we\u0027re up to #218?). If MechJeb is absolutely necessary to the craft (why? Honestly curious), then maybe talk to sarbian if it\u0027d be ok to bundle it or something. But why is MJ needed in the first place? EDIT: Looks like it\u0027s just the AR202 box on the top. If you remove that, save the craft, then use that, everyone will be able to use it as it\u0027s just stock parts and this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I downloaded this to check it out and immediately noticed the folder structure looks like (I think) what the old system used. Standard practice would be to have two folders in the zip - one Gamedata and one Ships. In the GameData, have a folder called Kerbal Electronics or Rofl47 or whatever, something that makes the folder yours. Then in that, I\u0027d have the Parts and Flags folder you have. In the Ships folder, I\u0027d put another one called VAB and then in that, your craft (might want to think about renaming too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E). The way you have it set up makes it difficult if people want to look at/find/uninstall your parts after they\u0027ve installed it. When people install this mod, it\u0027ll just be a simple case of merging the two GameData folders (the one in the KSP install and the one from the mod) so you\u0027ll want to be able to let people do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETalking of the parts, I noticed they\u0027re basically stock parts with different parameters. Not sure what the stance is on redistributing Squads textures is, might be useful to know. Anyway, the RTG could be considered by some to be little excessive (1000 output rate and it weighs the same as the stock RTG which outputs 0.75?), the oxidiser tank is good idea (which is why KSPX includes one) but again, it uses the stock large radial tank texture. And the fuel line.. is just a fuel line. Not sure where you\u0027re going with that one but the idea of a reversed fuel line sounds intriguing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t think I\u0027m hating or whatever, I think it\u0027s great you had the initiative to make this pack and had the guts to upload it and everything, it\u0027s certainly not something I could do, so congratulations on your first mod and here\u0027s to a great future for Kerbal Electronics!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, and *Incorporated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDITE THE SECONDE: To put an image into your post, put the link between [IMG] and tags.
