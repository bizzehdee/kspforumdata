Translatron helps you fly steadily, hover above the ground, and kill your horizontal speed. That plus some skills, and lots of reaction wheels (else MechJeb will screw it up) and you can do it. I have done it in my Mun base some months ago.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dust","CreatedById":96482,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T09:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible, but aiming to land within a 1 meter target is pretty difficult, as opposed to, y\u0027know, landing anywhere on the side of a giant rock. If you think about it, it\u0027s pretty much exactly like trying to dock to the top of an accelerating craft - the lower the gravity of the body the lower the acceleration and vector you\u0027re constantly having to match. I\u0027ve done it once: on Minmus to rescue a capsule that\u0027d run out of fuel, but it took a few restores to get a successful operation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T12:20:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, if you\u0027re very careful, and the craft you\u0027re landing on is very very well designed to deal with sudden additions of weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractice has let me land things on the Mun virtually pinpoint. With enough spare fuel, I could probably stack them atop each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, they would then most likely fall over due to imbalance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be easy as pie on Minimus, where gravity is so low you barely need any fuel to move around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T04:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39867-Constellation-Inspired-Mission-to-Duna-%28aka-how-to-over-complicate-things%29?highlight=constellation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis guy \u003C/a\u003Edoes it.

Consider this, The translatron can control your vertical speed pretty accuratly. You can use Mechjeb to hold your ship parallel to a docking port axis. You can translate with RCS while in staging mode using IJKLHN. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be possible to mount a docking port on the bottom of your lander and use radial mounted engines. Then have the translatron hold a hover just above the height needed to dock, use Smartass to hold you Par - to the docking port on top of the base. (in the target menu) Then use the JJLHN keys with RCS on to move over the port on the station. Once you\u0027re above the port you set the translatron to descend at about -.2 (in case you didn\u0027t know, you can input a new number into the translatron and it won\u0027t take effect till you click execute. This makes for a quick way to change hover/descent rates.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might even be able to just use the RCS to push down onto the docking port against the translatron.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
