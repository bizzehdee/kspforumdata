Must say I never considered the purple tint to come from specific spectral lines, seems a valid alternative. Indeed a reason why I had already considered I2 was its colour. You correctly mentioned it requires some concentration, I believe a few meters of almost pure gaseous I2 are more than enough to give that shade, and even if the remaining atmosphere was colourless, it would diffuse the same colour. Can\u0027t however tell what paints purple the ground, iodine would have a strong role making solid compounds but none I found has the right colour: therefore Eve would appear clearly purple where I2 pools (just over the seas probably made of liquid Iodine), but in different colour above the I2 layer. True that good data is scarce, some of the atoms you suggested are certainly good candidates themselves, have to find compounds still showing the correct colour and credible to make Eve\u0027s soil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed the multi-layered atmosphere is currently my best bet, it should add some complication to the model but nothing too hard (just one more layer with very specific characteristics, but also clearly separate from both light gas above and liquid/soil below. What is still missing about Eve, in terms of weather model, is the \u0022regulator\u0022 stabilizing its atmosphere (above the bottom layer), but isn\u0027t definitely clear if any should exist.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T00:25:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVanadium trichloride and Potassium permanganate(although it contain oxygen which maybe a problem or a solution to the question of presence of O2 in the atmo depends on how you look at it) maybe 2 other options to the color of the soil(although really it\u0027s a fainter purple and might just be a combination of the purple I2 crystals and a white material that could be a part of the atmosphere that crystallized as well as a kind of salt[most salts contain oxygen molecules too so it\u0027s be really hard to avoid that pesky element]) now for the color of the atmosphere those 2 might pose a problem because O2 will not be a part of the atmosphere and Cl2 is greenish yellow and not colorless like we\u0027d like to. now if we want to make it colorless we might want to go with N2 and some noble gases for the lower parts of the atmosphere and He2 and H2 as emissive gases at the higher parts of it for a more vibrant purple effect(also collaborating with planet modders to have the right looks might be a nice idea to throw around for a more holistic looks and feel and make it more visibly closer to the actual composition of the atmospheres and also some special science reports like surface samples and such) but the upper layers can be completly seperate from any calculations for the atmosphere outside maybe some pressure and mass gradient but that\u0027s your area of expertise .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso Argon which is noble and should be a nice candidate as it\u0027s colourless while inactive but when electricity or radiation comes through it, it emits purple light-quite a candidate for purple lightning and it\u0027s molar mass is about 44-45 which is also quite nice. all quite cool and might be the element we are looking for (and making eve a bit eccentric just for coolness)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-16T00:52:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2015 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EladDv\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T01:14:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll excellent suggestions.

I know its efficient, but if I have the same weather at KSC at noon as another player at KSC 3 years in the game future at night, that\u0027s kind of odd in my mind. I don\u0027t know how the model works, but if its taking anything like ocean layouts and where the sun is hitting the planet into account, then unless the player\u0027s kerbin is in sync you will have things like monsoons over the desert and other such oddities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus there\u0027s no telling how nasty the up and downstream connections are going to end up being at scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a situation like this. My thought would be that if the model is so complex that it\u0027s killing the PC just to run it, then it\u0027s time to start cutting fat and simplifying. Not optimizing, but actually going in and stripping down the model. Really, what are the benefits when considering that the average environment is one player viewpoint at a time? How small are the weather \u0027cells\u0027? Do we need that kind of resolution to be enjoyable? Do we NEED to have hyper-realistic accuracy in the weather simulation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see the comment back to cell size in discussion.

Like, slider settings for cell size and number so they can \u0027simplify\u0027 the model to reduce processing load, or if they\u0027ve got beastly systems, get their hyper-real on. And perhaps an option to just freerun a weather model that doesn\u0027t care what the client model looks like. Along with things like time resolution (how often the model updates).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this manner, you get the advantage of being able to use a master client for those who want to sync to a big weather processor. And you get something that clients can run alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will frontload a lot of additional work into adjusting the model to be modified easily, a GUI to manipulate the program, and properly building network capability.

Because I\u0027m storing not just live weather and the buffered(to be updated copy of the live map) but also several live maps which span every minute up to 7 days, which is ALOT OF MEMORY, even for a standalone application. Not to mention I must run the model quite fast to go faster than 1 second/s. I also need a way to predict where things will be in terms of orientation of the planets, the sun angle and position, things like that, and that needs to run live alongside the 1:1 model.

I have stumbled across a quite pleasant idea for solving a few problems with the way the system is set up. KWS simulations will be run client-side(optionally*) and will be individual to the user, and if attached to a DMP network, they can sync up weather states and times. Players could theoretically fast forward, slow down time, have their own progression and such, but they also have the option of syncing to other players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this also allows is CPU-forgiveness, which releases the strain of the simulation from the CPU by acting like a server-client operation. Where you are time-locked with another player, and you grab data from them instead of simulating it yourself. With a DMP like situation there will also be a server admin, ops, and other sorts of admin stuff which have access to server side functions and methods and ways of changing how the server is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem left to figure out would be how to go about time-warp efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~SilverFox8124\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mysteriosmind","CreatedById":128626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T18:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Silverfox, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs your weather system a simulation that will always give you the same result if you feed it the same data?

It would still need some testing to see if it makes sense (nobody would want to let his computer running for 1 month to generate a 100 GB weather pattern before starting a game), but it could be a solution to having a realistic simulation without making the game unplayable under the load of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silverfox8124","CreatedById":125032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T18:42:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@mysteriosmind, Yes, the system should give you the same results given the same situations, it\u0027s simulatory instead of predictive.
