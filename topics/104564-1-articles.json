Seeing as I put a lot of hours into KSP and it\u0027s not favourite topic of the dinner table or friend circle, it makes sense to engage with others who have interests that match mine!!\n\nReason for my question : When 0.90 came out I started again in career/megagrind/face-to-the-cheese-grater mode, and while it\u0027s not my favourite thing in the world, that is a whole \u0027nother topic.\n\nImportant mods I have : Remote Tech, Deadly Reentry, KW, B9, FAR, and lots of other goodies but these are the ones that count in my question. \n\nSO I BUILT A SPACE STATION. I really wanted a shuttle to service it! I\u0027ve probably spent 10 hours reading guides/reworking my stupid space plane and I just can\u0027t seem to make one that doesn\u0027t suck at an unacceptable level! I have read a lot of guides, I know how to read all the FAR numbers in the analysis screen, I just want some tips on what I have and how to make it WORK! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThe main body is pretty unchangable, it needs extra crew cabin, docking port, cargo bay, anything else can be changed... I want it to be as efficient as possible and stable enough to allow for a moderately easy ascent and descent.\n\nI do not have RAPIER yet or AEROSPIKE, the tech you see is the most current I have...

Now, all that said, Stock planes don\u0027t work in FAR and vice versa because FAR makes those CoL markers be placed in different places. However the principle is still the same, CoM slightly ahead of CoL.\n\nKey things that are different are drag related. For example, nose cones are needed to prevent too much forward drag, your air intakes need to be AT or BEHIND the center of mass, or they have the potential to pull the front end of the craft around with their drag. Your plane there looks pretty good, though without the CoM/CoL markers I can\u0027t tell for sure.\n\n**Minor instability**: I need to see CoM and CoL to troubleshoot this\n\n**Very heavy (slow ascent to 24,000m)**: Nothing wrong with weight as long as you have the lift and the thrust to accomodate. Slow ascent usually means your missing one or the other, or both. You do have a lot of wing there so I\u0027m guessing thrust. I will say you have a lot more fuel than I would use on a Mk2 plane, it shouldn\u0027t take that much to just get to orbit. Get rid of the dedicated LF tanks. The tiny amount of fuel your jets use isn\u0027t worth hauling that weight. I also suggest choosing your planes purpose. Either passenger or cargo, not both. You can always build another plane.\n\n**difficult to achieve orbit with rocket engine**: This could actually be a problem with your intakes. The way the game works for the next week (1.0 will change this), if you place your engines and intakes in symmetry one engine gets all the initial air and if there is spillover the other engine gets that. Once the spillover is gone, one engine flames out but the other still has plenty. To fix this place Intake -\u003E Engine -\u003E Intake -\u003E Engine without symmetry or use the Intake Build Aid mod to correct it so each engine has intakes dedicated to it. In your case, place 2 intakes, one of each kind and one engine, then do the other side. Once you have done this you will find you can get further higher before turning to the rocket.\n\nAlso, that engine isn\u0027t the greatest of high atmosphere engines (I think, LVT-45?, hard to see). The Aerospike is a wonderful choice, RAPIERS, for smaller planes (not yours) the LV-909 works well. Sometimes the Poodle works good too.\n\n**AOA\u0027s most efficient L/D rating is only 8.5\\***: This is also affected by thrust and/or lift.\n\nand all wing parts have been tweaked to 0.5 Strength/Mass: In most cases that should be fine as long as you don\u0027t plan on hard turns, which an SSTO doesn\u0027t really need to do.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T02:05:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T01:58:33Z","Content":"Check out the first few posts of the ***Kerbodyne*** thread for building and piloting guides, and the Youtube channel for demonstrations. Both linked below.\n\nThe ***Kerbodyne*** thread also includes a hundred\u002B example designs. Most RAPIER based designs will also work (less efficiently, but they\u0027ll work) if you swap out the RAPIERs for a combination of Turbojets and LV-T45s. You\u0027ll see with a few of the later three-engine airframes on the thread that they\u0027ve been done in three versions: RAPIER/Turbo/RAPIER, RAPIER/Nuke/RAPIER, and Turbo/LV-T45/Turbo.\n\nI can\u0027t actually see the image accompanying your post, so I can\u0027t give more specific advice. But if you can post screenshots of the ship from above and the side in the SPH, with CoM/dCoM/CoL markers on, we can have a shot. FAR analysis screens at 25,000m/Mach 4 and 500m/Mach 0.5 would also help.\n\nEdit to add: can see the pic now...\n\nThe basics look okay. You have more wing than you need, so you could shave a fair bit of weight by trimming that down. I\u0027m not sure what engines you\u0027re running due to the non-stock appearance; is it two Turbos plus an LV-T45? Anything lower thrust than that is going to struggle.\n\nWhat do you have the control surface settings at? You want the canards to be set to influence pitch only, with a low maximum deflection, and the trailing edge wing surfaces to be set as elevators near the centreline, elevons near the wingtip, with a moderate maximum deflection. Rudders set to yaw only, low deflection.\n\nYou might get better results if you swap the two pairs of wingtip extensions for a single pair angled at a 45 degree dihedral. Pulling the vertical stabiliser as far back as possible on the fuselage should also be helpful. If that vertical stabiliser is an all-moving control surface, you have massively more rudder authority than you need. Yaw is the axis that needs the least control influence (followed by roll, then pitch).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T03:25:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 03:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T02:57:56Z","Content":"A demonstration build with similar layout and capabilities:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

When using RCS build aid it informs me that the main engine is applying torque to the COM for whatever reason, I assume it\u0027s because the plane isn\u0027t perfectly symmetrical and there is greater weight on one side than another.. I tried using the new smaller cargo bay (just for holding batteries, RCS, essential to flight things, and moving different weight around to try to offset the torque number but it\u0027s still very hard to fly straight..\n\nAnyways, thanks again for all the help, I really appreciate it and I\u0027m thankful again in advance!\n\nOops, I forgot dCOM, and i\u0027m aware the front gear on 1A is too far back xD Will fix now...\n\nI am linking the ALBUM instead of posting the pictures in the post as it is often screwy.\n\n[http://imgur.com/gallery/2RwZt](http://imgur.com/gallery/2RwZt)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T22:49:23Z","Content":"If you\u0027re only switching over at Mach 3.3 (~990m/s) then you\u0027re missing out on another few-to-five hundred m/s of horizontal speed you could be getting, that\u0027s probably part of it.

The CoM is likely a tiny bit above the CoT, resulting in pitch-up torque. You can zero this out (almost, anyway) by just angling the rocket motor a tiny bit.\n\nHowever, from your description it sounds like you might be getting yaw wobbles as well.\n\nThe yaw stuff is aerodynamically caused, rather than being an offset thrust issue. As you ascend above 30,000m, the air becomes thinner. As the air thins, the tailfin has less to push against, reducing its power to stabilise the ship.\n\nWith sufficient aerodynamic polishing you can eliminate those wobbles, but for now: vectored thrust, torque, piloting. A Vernor or a couple of linear RCS ports either side of the nose provides a lot of stability, and if you keep them toggled off except when needed they don\u0027t use that much fuel. Adding more torque can also help, as can ascending with a flatter profile so as to be moving at a faster speed at a lower altitude (using speed to compensate for thin air; the strength of the tailfin\u0027s stabilisation effect is all about how many air molecules hit it over a given span of time).\n\nI\u0027d recommend having a look at my build videos.

The purpose of this is to reduce the sensitivity of the SAS so that it doesn\u0027t overreact, forcing the plane into continuous pitch wobbles (as it tends to do when left untuned)."}]}
