I set up my action groups as followed : 1 = Toggle engines, 2 = Switch engine mode and toggle air-intake. Once on the runway I hit 1 to active the engine which fires up in Airbreathing mode. If i hit 2 the engines get switched, the airintake closes and if the engine was still running the Closed circle mode fires up. After that I am unable to shut down or restart the engines with action group 1. I have to activate 2 (going to airbreathing again) to potentialy shutting them down or if I want to restart them I have to toggle them in Airbreathing mode and switch mode again. In short : once I switch the mode I cant shut down/restart the engines properly. By rightclicking on an engine I can still start it manualy even though the action group does not work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo specify, I am using this ship unmodified for a long time and the problem just suddenly appeared. I tried altering the action groups from toggle to one for activating and one for deactivating the engines, i tried using staging, drone controle, deinstalled all non essential mods for that plane, made a fresh game install but the \u0022bug\u0022 persist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you need any futher informations let me know, but if anyone could help me that would be awesome as I am using that ship for basically everything...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest regards, Aventh\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
