It simulates many launches (512 to be exact) to calculate the best pitch over angle and speed (and a few other things). I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything out there that does this at the moment. It\u0027s fairly quick, a run of 512 launches over 10 minutes of game time takes around 3 seconds on a typical desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve not tried it for a stock game but it should work in theory.
