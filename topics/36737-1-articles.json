I will post pictures (whenever my internet feels like taking a run) along with the craft file, it does have only one mod, but it can be removed and still fly the exact same! The container as I call it will hold a small rover the are both unmanned and will fly to 20km and at 600 or so M/s before the engines cut-out and you loose total control I could add RCS which would fix it, although not the engines, unless I added some to make it an SSTO, however as of now it is a SSTLO(ish). So I will (hopefully) soon post the pictures of the craft, and the container. I have different varients of it one of which is a NSHS (no stage hyper sonic) where the ailerons do the speed although you have to do some weird spin to get a fast speed. Well until my internet stops being derp I cannot post pictures or the craft file, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
