Not for a single tank, nor for a stack of radial tanks. They may\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Elook\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0like they\u0027re both attached, but only the one that you click on to place the tank will actually attach.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re having stability issues, the answer is to put one radial decoupler towards the top, attach the side tank, then put one or two struts at the bottom. They will disappear when you stage the decoupler.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe sure to place the struts from the side tanks to the center. This is because after the struts let go when you stage, their mass and drag are still applied to their parent part (which is the one you place first when doing the strut).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loren Pechtel","CreatedById":157006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-05T23:25:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpanding upon FullMetalMachinist\u0027s answer:\u00A0 Except for struts and fuel lines Kerbal rockets are pure trees.\u00A0 Branches can never cross no matter what the rocket looks like.\u00A0\u00A0 You get only one decoupler to knock off that stage.\u00A0 If that\u0027s not enough to get it clear you need separatrons (note: you have to rotate them, the supplied rocket points down) or there are some mod parts that include separation motors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen staging in space I have never had problems with a single decoupler that is placed close enough to the center of inertia (not the center of mass!\u00A0 You need to consider how far away from the decoupler the mass is, although I have always done this by testing rather than with a pencil \u0026amp; paper) of the stage.\u00A0 In atmosphere things don\u0027t behave so well, bigger stages need separation motors.\u00A0 If you\u0027re playing with separation motors you probably want to download SmartStage.\u00A0 Separatrons are a royal pain to properly configure on an asparagus-staged rocket, SmartStage generally can figure it all out for you, but doublecheck as I\u0027ve seen it confused at times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ibanix","CreatedById":147140,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-05T23:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use separatrons, but they feel like a hack.

Notice that they tend to fall end over end a bit? thats because of the separation motors kicking the SRBs away from the shuttle stack after SRB shut down. If you watch some launch videos where launches take place on clear days and the lighting is right, you can see separation motors firing to increase distance from the expended stages and the rocket as it climbs away.
