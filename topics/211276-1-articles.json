More RAM is good up to a point, however you only need a lot of RAM if you\u2019re using a lot of mods and KSP has a habit of eating up all the memory it can find regardless (~95% RAM use with 16GB and after upgrading to 32GB it\u2019s still ~95%) and in my experience 32GB is sufficient unless you\u2019re planning on using 200\u002B mods, which is a bad idea anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy experience running KSP without a GPU after mine broke is that the game will still run quite happily without one unless you look at the ground, at which point the frame rate tanks badly, so just having \u003Ci\u003Eany \u003C/i\u003EGPU is better than nothing but getting a really good one isn\u2019t critical- for KSP at least, other games may vary considerably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u2019t just take my word for it though, I\u2019m not a computer hardware expert by any means and the most technical thing I\u2019ve ever done to my PC was remove that broken GPU and put the replacement in (hooray for 3 year warranties!) so you may want other opinions on the matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-03T21:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83995-psykikk/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002283995\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83995-psykikk/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Psykikk\u003C/a\u003E What resolution is your monitor?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that your 1080 card can run KSP 1 at 1080p resolution with very good frame rates or 1440p with occasional lag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScroll down this article \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html\u003C/a\u003E for a chart of average FPS for just about every graphic card made back to the Nvidia 700 series.
