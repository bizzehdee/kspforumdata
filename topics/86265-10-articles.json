However I got completely fooled by an odd glitch in KER (which I was using for the first time ever) and stupidly didn\u0027t question the dV report that it was giving me regarding how much oomph I had left in my return vessel. So instead of doing an aerobrake to lower its orbit, and instead of taking the rendezvous with the successfully returned lander as one vector (rather than what I did, which was to match planes, then rendezvous), I burned fuel like a madman thinking that I had enough to cruise half of the system on the way home, and then ran out of fuel on the return burn with 300 or so dV left. Only then did I go back and check the picture logs and realize what was going on. I actually HAD hit F5 early enough that I could have salvaged things (which is very out of character for me, I generally don\u0027t use them at all, but this whole trip made me nervous so I F5\u0027d a few times)... But I did this in sandbox, which I share with my son, and he was testing a nifty SSTO design and ultimately used F5/9 at the wrong time, leaving the latest save at the point where I had to do the last burn to Kerbin with a 300 dV deficit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to point out that I could easily have arranged the images in this post to gloss over this error, but I didn\u0027t. Instead I throw myself on the mercy of the court, and the challenge adjudicator (hey, Laie, bud, want to go for a fancy dinner?) because I want the fancy purple ribbon darnit, think I\u0027ve earned it, but can\u0027t bring myself to claim it outright. I could have done the \u0022Get Out and Push\u0022 routine as well I suppose, but in the name of \u0022been there, done that\u0022 I decided to turn on infinite fuel for the burn to take me from solar orbit (near Eve) to the Kerbin intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that out of the way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have never used the Nasa parts for anything much. Nor have I ever tried to launch a 3000T ship. I didn\u0027t really want to do either of these things, but once I had settled on the basic lander design I found that it was lagging enough that I didn\u0027t want to endure the pain of trying to dock with it, so I completely changed my plans and decided to build one giant launcher to get the lander, return ship, and drive section up to orbit. This mission was supposed to be a test flight, but it kept succeeding so we just headed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe worst part of the mission occurred when I got to Eve. I wanted to aerobrake very carefully, and 5 or 6 passes through the atmosphere at 70-something km left me in a good spot. I had detached the return ship after the first braking, all was good there. I wanted to try for one more gentle aerobrake to circularize as much as possible, but I misjudged and wound up scrubbing off too much orbital speed and was essentially committed to the landing. I used the remains of the drive section to accelerate the deorbit and miss the purple depths of the ocean. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll else went perfectly. As expected, many many landing legs were broken during the touchdown, but they were not needed for anything else. The teleport system worked perfectly and the ascent also went flawlessly, despite my poor piloting which had me ascending at something like 2X terminal velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, a note on the \u0022teleport system\u0022 - we did have a version of this craft that had a pile of parts added to it (negligible weight) that allowed the intrepid Kerbonaught to clamber all the way to the surface. But at this point, lag was really getting to be an issue, so I installed the teleport pods and wiped off the 80\u002B parts that constituted the ladder assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI humbly beg for the purple ribbon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-11T01:54:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2014 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by James_Eh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gm537","CreatedById":66746,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T05:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Laie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@bitslizer: your earlier stages will still keep running for about three minutes.
