I decided it\u0027s time to get away from Kerbin and take a trip to deep space and Duna is where I decided to go for a quick craft build so I can determine what it may take to reach Eeloo in this new Version 1.0.5. In this build I only had a couple of mistakes, in the past it would have been more I\u0027m sure. Here is what took place, the first stage went great, then rolling to a 45 Degree I did the famous somersault and recovered fairly quickly. After releasing the next stage I noticed the craft had a bad wobble and I immediately killed the thrust, the craft settled down and I was able to continue with my trajectory heading for Duna. At this point I noticed I hadn\u0027t set up the\u00A0asparagus fuel style to maximize my fuel usage. Now I am coming down on Duna\u0027s surface to attempt a landing and of course I have a good habit now to use that ole F5 and the savior F9 key and sure enough I came in to hard and smashed into the surface. After a second or third try I did manage to land but I was struggling because I didn\u0027t bother setting any action groups until after this test flight. As I was falling to the surface I was frantically doing fuel transfers and shutting down the engines to get the best out of my fuel consumption. I am now fixing the Weak Point in the craft and the fuel lines while Bob is drilling for Ore on Duna. After I finish fueling on Duna I will then see how far I will be able to travel, Ike, Dres or Eeloo? not sure at this point. Also check out how little fuel I had left after landing, I barely made it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Rt8HH/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-28T04:37:18Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2016 04:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by castille7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-31T12:48:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice improvements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMe, I just randomly build something and hope it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castille7","CreatedById":101668,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-31T17:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was hoping\u00A0it would make it to Duna but didn\u0027t know what to expect, often I wouldn\u0027t have enough fuel to orbit Duna.
