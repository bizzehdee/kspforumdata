Unfortunately, building computers in Minecraft would actually be easier as you can have clocks here. In KSP, it\u0027s not *really* computing, it\u0027s a cheaty alternative to computing. It does work exceptionally well, however. Don\u0027t expect Pong, ever, unless part conditions can trigger action groups. Then I could make a clock, and, with a few 6-core Xeon Processors, a full-fledged 2-bit computer. The bottleneck I have is that things can\u0027t trigger things. If I push 1, It can\u0027t trigger action group 2. I have a lot of workarounds for this. Put simply, give me an Idea and I\u0027ll tell you if it can be done. Expect a fully functional hanger with a password lock soon. It would be a simple one, though, and it may not be doable easily, I\u0027m actually depending on a system I haven\u0027t designed nor tested in-game yet, so, like the Russian rocket for their Moonshot, it is debatable if it would work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RawChicken","CreatedById":57199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T22:36:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome..have no clue of how to do this but wanna see!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T12:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a quick update: I actually LOST my .craft file for the computer, but I did start work rebuilding it today.
