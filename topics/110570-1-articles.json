If your spacecraft doesn\u0027t have docking ports you are not going to be able to refuel it. Assuming Jeb can EVA, an empty capsule controlled by a probe can rescue him. Jeb can collect all of the science on your spacecraft by flying to the instruments in EVA, right-clicking on them, and selecting \u0022collect data\u0022 (or something like that). Also, if you have not rendezvoused in space yet you should check out some tutorials on it, it can be very anti-intuitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley is a great resource.

So you can do this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Build a rescue craft that has enough fuel to make orbital rendezvous with your stranded one. The rescue craft needs to have a crew module with an empty slot that Jeb can ride in. The easy way to do this is just to have a Mk1 command pod, and put a probe core (like an Okto) on it, so that you can launch it unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003Cem\u003EIMPORTANT\u003C/em\u003E, before you launch, make sure there\u0027s an empty seat for Jeb. By default, the game will pick an available kerbal and put them in, so you just need to empty them out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rendezvous with your stranded craft (i.e. end up right next to it, at zero relative velocity). This is an important skill in KSP, not sure if you\u0027ve done it before. If you haven\u0027t, here\u0027s a good opportunity to learn. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E \u0022How do I rendezvous\u0022 is a whole other topic, though, so for now I\u0027ll just assume you know how to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Send Jeb on EVA and collect all science from your stranded ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You may have science that\u0027s still sitting in the instruments. Move Jeb next to an instrument, click on it, then click the button to \u0022take data.\u0022 Repeat for every instrument that has science in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You may have science that\u0027s sitting in the command module of the stranded craft (e.g. surface samples, whatever). Have Jeb take the science out of there, too, by the same method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Now all your yummy science is being carried by Jeb. Use his EVA thrusters to move across to the rescue craft, and board it. Now the science is on the rescue craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Bring the rescue craft home\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.

So I\u0027m just going to assume you don\u0027t have docking ports. Here is what I\u0027d suggest to you as a beginner: Build a rocket with a space craft with room for 2 kerbals, make sure it can get into a circular 1, 400, 000m orbit and enough to adjust the AP to at least 2, 000, 000m, and then back to 1, 400, 000, and enough to return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1: Launch your craft into space (1, 400, 000 m AP and PH)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: Target the craft jeb is in.

Collect the science data you have. And store if in the command pod, and get jeb back in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 5: Once the two vessels are In range of each other, EVA jeb and collect the science data, then aim for the rescue ship and shoot for it (you\u0027ll need to slow down though once you get close to it). Now would be a good time to quick save (f5) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 6: Once Jeb has reached the rescue ship, store the science data and get jeb on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 7: Return to Kerbin and recover the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can add pictures of what I\u0027m talking about if you didn\u0027t understand.
