If your spacecraft doesn\u0027t have docking ports you are not going to be able to refuel it. Assuming Jeb can EVA, an empty capsule controlled by a probe can rescue him. Jeb can collect all of the science on your spacecraft by flying to the instruments in EVA, right-clicking on them, and selecting \u0022collect data\u0022 (or something like that). Also, if you have not rendezvoused in space yet you should check out some tutorials on it, it can be very anti-intuitive.\n\nScott Manley is a great resource. Below is a good video on rendezvous, it\u0027s an oldy but a goody.\n\n[https://youtu.be/AHkY3FusJIQ](https://youtu.be/AHkY3FusJIQ)"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T02:09:21Z","Content":"If you can send Jeb on EVA (upgrade the Astronaut Complex to level 2), then you can get out and push. Really.\n\nWait until your vessel reaches apoapsis, aim it in the retrograde direction (so you know which way to push), then EVA Jeb and have him push the vessel with his EVA pack. Make sure you\u0027re pushing straight and not causing the vessel to tumble. Don\u0027t use up all his EVA fuel; save some to get back in the vessel so he can refuel. Repeat until your vessel\u0027s periapsis is low enough (~40 kilometres) to aerobrake effectively.\n\nOr you can turn on \u0022Infinite Fuel\u0022 in the debug menu (Alt\u002BF12) and pretend you did the pushing.\n\nRendezvous (so you can transfer Jeb and all his science to a new craft) is probably beyond your skill level at this point."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPropelledGiraffe","CreatedById":143863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T02:14:44Z","Content":"The only way to refuel your vessel in flight is by docking with a tanker. This is only an option if Jeb\u0027s craft has a docking port or if you have the Klaw (\u0022Advanced Grabbing Unit\u0022) available. \n\nNevertheless, you can still get your science back home without refueling, if you have unlocked the first upgrade of the Astronaut Komplex. This allows you to perform EVA. \n\nSend a craft with an empty seat up and perform an orbital rendez-vous maneuver, when you are close enough goe on EVA with Jeb. You can use the jetpack to fly to all your scientific instruments and right-click to grab the stored data and then get into the rescue ship and get everyone home."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T02:21:39Z","Content":"There are two ways to refuel a craft in stock KSP:\n\n- If it has a docking port, you can dock to it and transfer fuel.\n\n- If you have a craft with a claw on it, you can grab hold with the claw and transfer fuel as if you were docked.\n\nHowever, if neither of these is available to you, you do have another option: You don\u0027t need to recover the *craft*, just Jeb and the science. So you can do this:\n\n1. Build a rescue craft that has enough fuel to make orbital rendezvous with your stranded one. The rescue craft needs to have a crew module with an empty slot that Jeb can ride in. The easy way to do this is just to have a Mk1 command pod, and put a probe core (like an Okto) on it, so that you can launch it unmanned.\n\n2. *IMPORTANT*, before you launch, make sure there\u0027s an empty seat for Jeb. By default, the game will pick an available kerbal and put them in, so you just need to empty them out.\n\n3. Rendezvous with your stranded craft (i.e. end up right next to it, at zero relative velocity). This is an important skill in KSP, not sure if you\u0027ve done it before. If you haven\u0027t, here\u0027s a good opportunity to learn. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) \u0022How do I rendezvous\u0022 is a whole other topic, though, so for now I\u0027ll just assume you know how to do this.\n\n4. Send Jeb on EVA and collect all science from your stranded ship.\n\n- You may have science that\u0027s still sitting in the instruments. Move Jeb next to an instrument, click on it, then click the button to \u0022take data.\u0022 Repeat for every instrument that has science in it.\n\n- You may have science that\u0027s sitting in the command module of the stranded craft (e.g. surface samples, whatever). Have Jeb take the science out of there, too, by the same method.\n\n5. Now all your yummy science is being carried by Jeb. Use his EVA thrusters to move across to the rescue craft, and board it. Now the science is on the rescue craft.\n\n6. Bring the rescue craft home\n\n7. Yay science!"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluelogic32","CreatedById":112174,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T03:23:28Z","Content":"I have no Idea what parts you\u0027ve unlocked because I don\u0027t play career mode. So I\u0027m just going to assume you don\u0027t have docking ports. Here is what I\u0027d suggest to you as a beginner: Build a rocket with a space craft with room for 2 kerbals, make sure it can get into a circular 1, 400, 000m orbit and enough to adjust the AP to at least 2, 000, 000m, and then back to 1, 400, 000, and enough to return to Kerbin.\n\nStep 1: Launch your craft into space (1, 400, 000 m AP and PH)\n\nStep 2: Target the craft jeb is in. Doing this you will be able to see the two vessels closest approach. \n\nStep 3: (Now would be a good time to quick save (F5)) Play with the maneuver nodes until you get an encounter with nothing larger then 5km distance.\n\nStep 4: Switch over to Jeb and do a EVA. Collect the science data you have. And store if in the command pod, and get jeb back in there.\n\nStep 5: Once the two vessels are In range of each other, EVA jeb and collect the science data, then aim for the rescue ship and shoot for it (you\u0027ll need to slow down though once you get close to it). Now would be a good time to quick save (f5) \n\nStep 6: Once Jeb has reached the rescue ship, store the science data and get jeb on board.\n\nStep 7: Return to Kerbin and recover the craft.\n\nI can add pictures of what I\u0027m talking about if you didn\u0027t understand. Just let me know."}]}
