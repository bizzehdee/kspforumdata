I don\u0027t actually think that\u0027s really a problem on default. Some players prefer to knock those out quickly.\u00A0The problem, he correctly points out, is with the difficulty settings. Hard mode does not make the game harder, it makes it drag. One solution might be to constrain maximum size and weight based on the difficulty settings. If you shifted the limiting factor to size and weight you could even ease up the constraints on early funds and science payouts. That way, if you were very good, you could get yourself to the Mun and back on minimal tonnage and still progress without grind, but your primary focus would be efficiency, rather than repetitive missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on that, I think we could make a few suggestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1) Scrap limited part count at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and instead:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Constrict maximum size and weight base in the difficulty settings\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you did those things, you could shift larger tanks like the T-200 and T-800\u00A0up because you wouldn\u0027t be relying on the gimmick of part count as your limiting factor. This would, however, probably mean you would not also want to move the the size 0 parts up as they would make it much easier to skate under the overall size and weight limits.
