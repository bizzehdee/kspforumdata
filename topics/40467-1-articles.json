That way we players won\u0027t have to fiddle around with stacking various different length fuel tanks. It would also reduce part count significantly. You\u0027d also get rid of incredibly wobbly rockets. You could also make them tweakable, having a system where you right-click the part in the VAB/SPH and can select from a list of options. For example, a 1.25 meter tank could have options for type of fuel, then it would bring up the maximum capacity and you could determine how much of that you want to fill. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Single command execution. I had an idea recently to create a multi-planet orbiter that would release 2 satellites in different polar orbits at each stop, but I found executing it insanely complex due to the limitations of staging commands. I was thinking that you could have it so that parts with a probe module would be able to execute a single command upon decoupling as long as they had adequate resources. Something like a single maneuver node for each part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: EVA tethers. I know that sort of idea is blasphemy for a Kerbal, but the possibility of a tether (which you can then cut) would make it a lot harder to accidentally send your Kerbal on a reentry trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: IVA joystick. It would be great to have an in-cockpit joystick that could either correspond to an external joystick or be manipulated through the mouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: More scientific equipment functionality. Knowing heat is kind of pointless at the moment, considering I\u0027ve had Jeb ride what\u0027s essentially a chair with a parachute through a Eve reentry. I\u0027d love to be able to have instruments that give you terrain info, snap photos (making probes far more interesting), get resource information for bodies, and whatever else others can dream up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: The ability to secure items to surface. I don\u0027t want to worry about a Munbase flying away because of a collision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7: When asteroids are added, make them movable. Obviously it will have to be a major feat to move them, but being able to move some orbital bodies around has a lot of potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8: Duct tape. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9: Paint. Who doesn\u0027t want to be able to change the colors of their ships and planes? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10: Testing facility. As amazingly fun as it is to test out a new spaceplane by seeing whether or not it would crash, I\u0027d love to be able to put it through a wind tunnel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11: Motorized part movement. It\u0027s somewhat possible with mods at the moment, but it\u0027s a bit difficult to create variable swept wing aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12: More symmetry modes and ability to switch between VAB/SPH symmetry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13: Part embedding and intersection. Mounting landing gear on a fuselage and having them fold up into the body through an \u0027embed\u0027 option. Adding a \u0027cut into\u0027 or \u0027intersect\u0027 mode is added along with symmetry so that you intersect, removing clipping problems without debug. You\u0027d even get some great failures from people who accidentally intersected an engine poorly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14: For career: promotions. Generating public interest in projects could add a nice dimension and impetus for people to try new and insane things. Obviously, being KSP, there has to be some sort of bonus directly related to how dangerous a mission is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15: Flag/logo creator. It\u0027s pretty easy to do outside the game itself, but it would be nice to have it in-game, maybe even with the ability to see how it looks on a flag, spacesuit, rocket/plane, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16: More in-game clocks. The ability to add a custom clocks/timers/stopwatches would be really useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E17: Compiled stat tracking. Just having a place where you can see the stats from all of the flights you\u0027ve run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E18: Gyro-isolated parts. Imagine being able to rotate your ship for starboard docking, but keep your command pod facing towards the craft you\u0027re docking with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E19: Sort of related to 18, axles, movement sockets, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20: Not sure if it\u0027s been suggested elsewhere but: Extreme weather. I\u0027d love there to be occasional hurricanes and massive thunderstorms. I\u0027d love to see a planetary dust storm on Duna. Hell, throw in solar flares too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E21: Olympus Mons. Tallest mountain in our solar system should have some representation on Duna. More famous geography having mirrors in the game would create some great locations to visit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E22: Fires/heat failures. Have some overheated parts simply catch fire or simply fail/shutdown. You could throw in extinguishers or require fuel/oxy cutoffs to deal with fires. It would also be fun to see fires around crashes once vegetation is added to Kerbin properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E23: Hamster ball for Kerbals. Kind of self-explanatory, just something I\u0027d find amusing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24: Landscaping. Not just basic stuff like beautifying your KSC with statues, shrubberies, etc but actual terrain shaping, possibly even on other bodies. No terraforming, just simple \u0027flatten out this bit of Mun to act as a landing pad\u0027 or \u0027make this part of Eve flatter to create a runway\u0027 or even \u0027turn this hilly area into a giant launch ramp for Jeb\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E25: Assisted launch. Like on an aircraft carrier. Maybe even make an electrically powered rail system for space stations to give small boosts to refueled ships/escape pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E26: Probably been suggested to death, impact deformation. We want to make craters of our own, we want to see a plane actually stick into the dirt. Though I\u0027m thoroughly amused by bouncing debris, I\u0027d love to see it have an effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-03T09:04:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2013 09:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by madnessinmysoul\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eaddition\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T14:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout 7:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/G01NoaTM46o?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T14:13:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chaos_forge\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chaos_forge\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAbout 7:\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/G01NoaTM46o?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was talking about little asteroids, Gilly is a huge monster compared to them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T18:42:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIVA joystick reminds me of the cockpit joystick in MWO.
