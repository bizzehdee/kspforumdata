I can see radius, height and weight mattering but why the number of parts? Could you launch a mun rocket from the barn launchpad? No probably not. But a small rocket with 50 parts is still a small rocket. I have overbuilt rockets where I have had to take lights and science parts like thermometers and antennae off because I exceeded the part amount. I mean, really? That one light is going to over-strain the launch pad? When I can take two lights off and add another full fuel tank?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion would be to have certain parts not count towards the part count. Small things like batteries, lights, solar panels, small science parts (like goo or thermometers), antennas .etc. I think total weight should matter a lot more than something as arbitrary as \u0022part count\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T07:16:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the barn didn\u0027t make it into the 1.0 release. However, I agree with the need for more tier upgrades (or even intermediate ones that don\u0027t change the models) to increment the steps a bit more. I find that I need to upgrade the launch pad almost immediately, then the VAB not long after.
