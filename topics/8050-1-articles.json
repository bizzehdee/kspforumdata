The ByteSpaceStation is a quick and minimal solution to docking 4-8 small ships using lander parts. Unfortunately, as of now, I have not docked anything on the station because I do not have the time and patience in my hands yet. It operates at an altitude of ~200,000 m to ~500,000 m. I did not monitor correctly the takeoff angles and altitudes, but this is my first attempt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, have some images: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/EUj8V#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/EUj8V#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft launch was done with MechJeb although it didn\\\u0027t help much, because the ship kept turning left and right to calibrate, and it wasted all of my precious RCS fuel. I don\\\u0027t remember which thruster it used, but it was a very efficient one, which got me very high with little fuel consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put so many strut connectors that the rocket actually worked. It simply did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought that by this time, someone would have replied on my magnetic couplers thread, but no one did. Here\\\u0027s the link: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8598.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8598.0\u003C/a\u003E - And then by the time someone suggests me a link to documentation or someone actually makes it, I would have to do the space station all over again, including the structuring and the orbit. ???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, the station is pretty bad, but a good job for a beginner to make a simple docking station. As of now, the only way to dock is to really get close to the space station (which is a 1/10000 chance), use the RCS to get really, really close, then use some large landing gears/docking clamps to hook onto the station. Again, this is very hard to do. If someone actually does it, I would appreciate it.
