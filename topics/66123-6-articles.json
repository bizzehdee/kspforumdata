I can\u0027t find the post, but the transition to Unity5 would be an extremely long, complex, and hard process, which is not even guaranteed to work correctly.

Furthermore, the earlier versions of Unity 4 had quite a few bugs of their own which we had to work around (or hang tight) until fixes came along. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is, moving to Unity 5 is very unlikely to be a straightforward transition, and by no means I expect KSP to be stable or even playable (let alone improved) after simply upgrading the project over. I would be very happy to be wrong in that one, I must add, but historically, every time we upgraded to a new major version of unity, we came across new issues we had to contend with, so please don\u0027t get overexcited about Unity 5 just yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis late in a project, most games tend to freeze engine versions when they find something stable that fits their needs. Regression issues is in fact the main reason why Unity stuck with PhysX 2.8 until now. If breaking mods and saves is an issue for us, imagine their case, where instead of mods and saves, they risk breaking hundreds of commercial projects. We have it easy by comparison really... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, we don\u0027t plan to freeze engines, but I just wanted to clarify that moving to Unity 5 may not be as simple and so immediately beneficial as it may seem.

The jump to Unity 5 will not be an easy path. And that is assuming that after 1.0 Unity 5 is in a stable condition to make it possible.
