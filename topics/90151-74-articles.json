My game config used 2.3GB of memory (with 8K textures) and 27 part rocket on launchpad. When I chose RevertFlight/SpaceCenter, temporary memory allocation went up through the ceiling and game crahed with 3.2GB mem usage (possibly tried to allocate even more). So the scenery change needed more than 1.3GB... Er....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsed 4K textures instead. Memory usage dropped to 1.8GB instead and scenery change only used ~100-200MB temporarily, so everything ran fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I switched back to 8K textures, but set \u0022onDemandLoadOnMissing\u0022 in RSSKopernicus.cfg to false (as you suggested). Go the same memory usage of 2.3GB again, but scenery change only needed 100-200MB temporarily like with 4K textures. So it runs now fine, too... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo: Thank you again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay I humbly propose to have \u0022onDemandLoadOnMissing\u0022 set to false as default in RSSKopernicus.cfg, so people may not run into uneeded memory problems?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T14:18:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Carraux\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cronus425","CreatedById":12767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T15:57:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell in addition to my issues with maneuver holds, deadly reentry seems to be misbehaving.
