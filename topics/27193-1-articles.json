I had to modify the file so it opens in the VAB (that\u0027s the only modification) so I could take advantage of the VAB symmetry.

Keep throttling down to keep it just below 2g acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) stage 3: gets rid of the jet engines and drop tanks. Try not to hit them. Go 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 normal. Throttle up if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) stage 4: at 50km gets rid of plane parts which are now useless. Activate RCS, though don\u0027t leave it on.

Practice until you\u0027re happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12) pick a spot, eat up your fuel going back and forth between retros and main engines, remember to pitch up once you\u0027ve killed your lateral velocity and are falling straight down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13) at 500m or so above the surface pitch down to 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 normal and stage 6: jettison the bottom rigging. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14) stage 7: jettison everything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15) stage 8: make rover go.
