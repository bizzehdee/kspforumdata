To add to the test\u0027s realism, they pumped the capsule full of oxygen at sea level. This led to a fire spreading within the capsule, killing Gus Grissom (Mercury and Gemini veteran), Ed White (first American to EVA), and Robert Chaffee. The astronauts who would have become the first astronauts to fly during Apollo, until this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fire was caused by a wire that had become frayed underneath Grissom\u0027s seat from the panel door being opened and closed over time as it was used. When a current ran through it, it arched to nearby Velcro which the investigations revealed to have too much of as when Velcro is pressurized by oxygen, it becomes flammable. Along with the pure oxygen atmosphere, it become a fireball. The crew attempted to follow procedures, with White climbing over Grissom\u0027s seat to try and open the hatch, but seeing as the hatch opened inwards and was sealed by pressure, it become impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite the length of this, it took 15 seconds from first mentioning of the fire \u0022We\u0027ve got a fire...\u0022, to the hull breaching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe greatest irony in all of this being; in Grissom\u0027s first spaceflight aboard Liberty Belle 7 during Mercury, his capsule\u0027s hatch blew after splashdown and forced him to bail out of his capsule earlier than intended and due to open valves in his suit, caused him to take on water and nearly drown while he waited for recovery. As such an investigation team found that capsules with explosive hatches were unsafe and decided to remove them. If the crew had a hatch with explosive bolts, they likely would\u0027ve escaped; Grissom would\u0027ve become one of the first astronauts to land on the moon and they\u0027d lived a long lifetime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet without their sacrifice, we may have discovered the very flaws that led to it in an even worse fashion.
