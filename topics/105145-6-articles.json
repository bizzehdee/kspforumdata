There are plenty of challenges involving jet planes, but I don\u0027t think the idea that a lot of people would enjoy playing with aircraft in a sandbox that is ideal for playing around with them is odd, strange, unusual, etc. What other game can you do this in? I have X-Plane 10. But X-Plane 10 is a steeper learning curve, and lots of hard work to make nice aircraft. KSP makes aircraft creation from concept to finished product more fun and streamlined for a lot of people.
