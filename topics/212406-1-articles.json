I have some good and some bad experiences in my first session of KSP2. I\u0027ll get the bad experiences out of the way first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBAD EXPERIENCES\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe new UI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will get used to it, but it rubbed me the wrong way just enough to make me want KSP1\u0027s control scheme back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EColours\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love the fact that I can colour my rockets. What I don\u0027t like is that apparently the colour black is unobtainable on rockets. My chosen colour scheme is black and a brightish green. On the campaign set up screen, the colour appears black. Go into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, my rockets are dark green and bright green. Go to change the colour, can\u0027t make it any darker. Change to blue, to see if that\u0027s darker. No, it\u0027s just dark blue now. Change to red - red appears darker than blue or green but the \u0027black\u0027 is still with a red tinge. I don\u0027t want a tinge. I wanted black. If I wanted a tinge of colour, I\u0027d have made the colour more colourful than simple black. I can\u0027t drag the little colour circle any lower, nor can I tweak the opacity any higher/lower. I don\u0027t want a dark and bright green rocket, I wanted a black and bright green rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDelta V\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nColours aside, I expected there to be some differences in designs for rockets between KSP1 and KSP2 - 1. because the parts are different and 2. the values of engines have been tweaked, so I expected things to be different. I use a lot of \u0027Delta/Falcon-9\u0027 style influence in designing my rockets. That\u0027s probably not going to change in KSP2. However, what has changed is the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E read outs...

Decided to re-develop the orbiter I used for Bill into a Munar lander. Jeb\u0027s turn to shine. Lands on the Mun. I get him out and go for a quick jaunt on the Mun before decided to return to Kerbin. Enable the jetpack, fly up to the pod - the \u0022Press F to Grab, press B to Board\u0022 options appear. Press F. Nothing happens. Press F again. Nothing happens. Press F repeatedly. Alternate F and B. Swear under my breath whilst pressing F and B. Nothing. Figure it might be because a part has somehow clipped the exit perhaps. Switch to Bill back in orbit of Kerbin - his orbiter has no attachments anywhere near what could be considered the exit of the pod. Get him out. jetpack around the ship for a few seconds, go to get back in. Options appear on screen. F. F... FFFFFFF... (Swearing) FBFBFBFBFBFBFBF... (Swearing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaven\u0027t tried the other pods yet, maybe I\u0027ll do that next time I play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFuel feeding BETWEEN tanks as opposed to INTO tanks when using Fuel Lines\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClassic \u0027Delta/Falcon 9\u0027 style 3-body rocket with an upper stage intended to be an orbiter. The outer tanks have the small, non-gimballing engine (LVT-30), the central has the gimballing LVT-45. Fuel line from the outer tanks to the inner. This works as I expected it to, or at least seemed to, as the staging seemed to go as planned (at least on the occasion I used it - we\u0027ll see if it works again when I try it next time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMade a beefier rocket of a similar configuration that uses a modified version of the orbiter as a Mun lander, added a medium orbit/TMI stage and used large tanks for the core/central body then mediums for the outers - outers are intended to feed the central tank and be jettisoned when empty. Has over 11,000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (more than enough for a Mun landing and return). Launch. Everything going well - sluggish on take off due to a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E only slightly above 1.0 but we started to gain speed and altitude quickly. Keeping an eye on the staging information, notice that the tanks are draining equally. Not only that but it seems that, although the stage\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is dropping, the tanks Methalox seems to be stuck in a loop: main tank is dropping from 50 units of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (I thought this was going to be CH4 now?), down to about 45 or so then jumping back up to 50. Weird, but I let it ride. Notice my Apo is over 100km (my intended orbit) - I still have my side boosters and the core attached, and they all still have fuel - so I kill all 3 engines, with the stage information stating I still have fuel (around 1/3). I stage the boosters - my core stage has no fuel. Stage again. The orbital/TMI stage has fuel (as expected) so I use that to circularise and burn for the Mun without further issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(EDIT) Fuel feeding BETWEEN stages\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t get this to happen consistently, but for some reason on occasion the rocket seems to consume fuel from the stage above it. Number of intended Mun landers have either been stranded on landing, or unable to even made a TMI from Kerbin orbit due to the stage below the lander/TMI stage taking its fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EJeb \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Missing in action\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Missing in action\u0022\u003EMIA\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E when I go to switch back to him from Bill after seeing if Bill could return to the pod from EVA.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the whole \u0027being unable to get back in my pod after doing an EVA\u0027 thing with Bill, I position him in such a way that he won\u0027t float away (too far) from his orbiter and switch back to Jeb. Or I would have if he were still available. The Mun lander is still there - uncrewed, I might add - but Jeb is no longer selectable on the Mun. I didn\u0027t \u0027Return to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027 or recover him - or destroy him by accident, he\u0027s just gone.

Or should I say, sub-surface. As soon as it loads, I notice I have a negative (and falling) altitude, the camera is, I initially think, clipped through the Mun\u0027s terrain however I very quickly realise it\u0027s the craft that\u0027s clipped and is now falling through the Mun. While this is a \u0027sandbox\u0027 and losing a craft in such a manner has no real consequences other than lost time and opportunity, and this is EA, this is the point at which I stop playing KSP2 to write this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(EDIT) Re-entry effects\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know, and can understand, that the re-entry effects were disabled\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efor the demo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0however why/how are these not in the base game at launch when they\u0027ve been in KSP1 for almost a decade at this point and this game was delayed for several years in order to deliver a better product!? Yes, this is EA. Completely, totally understand.\u00A0 But energy usage is non-existent, re-entry/thermal effects/heat is non-existent. These aren\u0027t \u0022nice to have\u0022 features, these are CORE features of a space/rocket simulation. Especially for the sequel of an already-established space/rocket simulation game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOverall Impression after my own hands-on\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, I\u0027m a little disappointed. I don\u0027t mind the whole \u0027some features are missing\u0027 - there\u0027s still plenty for me to do right now. I\u0027m not overly concerned about there being no science to do, as I understand that it probably needs a bit of a rework to cater for colonies and whatever else you have planned. But what I do care about is that what *IS* in this game *AND* KSP1 currently, I expect the *SEQUEL* to do as well, if not better than the original - straight off the bat. KSP1 currently does a few things better - mechanics wise. It calculates \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E per stage, for example. I can also assess how my craft will work in a vacuum in KSP1, something I cannot yet do in KSP2. The manoeuvre nodes seem to work better and I can see Apo/Peri information better in KSP1 when making nodes than I can in KSP2. Staging and fuel seems to work better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a sequel, this currently feels like a step backwards from the original. Kraken and wobbly rockets I can live with. Or at least adapt to. Craft falling through terrain, after 3 years of extra development time, is not something anyone should expect - even in EA. Kerbals going missing without context as to why. Things that worked (as intended) in KSP1 don\u0027t seem to work as well or at all in KSP2. I know it\u0027s going to get better, and I look forward to the future developments, but if craft and Kerbals are\u00A0 disappearing and breaking or falling through terrain for no reason - why am I wasting my time? I want to play KSP2 to explore and progress (granted I can\u0027t progress like I want to - i.e. a career mode, but it is coming eventually), not have to keep going over the same old stuff because last 10 times I\u0027ve landed on the Mun to explore, my ship fell through the ground and my Kerbal disappeared. I call that wasting my time, and time is a precious commodity for me to balance between my love of space/games/PC, my family and my partner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGOOD EXPERIENCES\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGraphics, sound, lighting, music, immersion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no denying KSP2 is beautiful and is only going to get better.\u00A0 Graphically, I\u0027m lucky I have an RTX 3080.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sounds, in flight, in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or just in general, are amazingly pleasant to my ears.

Watching the sun\u0027s rays dance over my orbiting spacecraft as the sun \u0027rises\u0027 from behind Kerbin. Approaching the Mun, or going behind it and being encased in darkness. Loving it so far. Very pretty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMusic. Normally, I turn this off. But I might leave it on, at least until I\u0027ve gone to each planet and moon at least once.
