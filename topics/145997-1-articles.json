It matters.\u00A0\u00A0 If it\u0027s a steam game have you re validated the files?\u00A0 The first couple of times i installed the game through steam\u00A0 there were parts missing and it took a couple of validations to get it all working correctly.\u00A0 Do you have the game installed in a folder that is used by the operating system?\u00A0 I\u0027d expect not but having an install in one of the protected folder will prevent the game from working as external processes into that folder will be blocked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have a log of an event in which the internals do not appear?\u00A0 This could tell me pretty much instantly what is going on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you had no mods installed there should only be the Squad folder in the Gamedata folder, certainly no internals folders.\u00A0 So from where and why did you delete them? The fact that they don\u0027t display is not a reason to remove them, and removing them will cause an error to be logged\u00A0 every time you viewed a craft. There is no valid reason except perhaps building a development build for fast loading in which it\u0027s not required to have all the parts, but unless you\u0027re seriously into developing mods the normal average Joe/Jane would never need to do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have difficulty understanding how errors that appeared when you installed 1.1 still occurred in exactly the same way after 1.1.2 and 1.1.3. this leads me to believe that there is either something very wrong with how you have installed the game, or for some reason you\u0027ve not got permission to access that file. Have you tried a new installation in a different location or drive?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet a copy of your log, zip it up and make it available for download, so that i or someone else can look\u00A0 through it properly, the answer lies there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-17T15:21:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2016 03:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
