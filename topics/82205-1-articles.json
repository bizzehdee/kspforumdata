If the nozzles were fixed, then you could combine everything into a single object and apply a single KSP shader. if you have nozzle on one side, and a teletubbie on the other side, and they are moved by different animations, then you\u0027d have 3 mesh objects, with 1, 2, or 3 KSP shaders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiliconPyro","CreatedById":19734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T15:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, got it.
