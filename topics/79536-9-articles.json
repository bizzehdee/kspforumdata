Many of the bodies included in Planet Factory by default resemble Nova\u0027s description of GP2, which was slated to have rings as well as a moon on a relatively high inclination orbit called Potatus that spun fast enough to warp it into an oblate spheroid, much like Inacessible from PF\u0027s stock planets. Furthermore, Eeloo was slated to be one of GP2\u0027s moons, along with a ringed moon called Fonso with a dense atmosphere (twice that of Kerbin\u0027s ASL pressure) and large mountains, much like Skelton from PF-CE.\u003Cp\u003EYou could keep the name \u0022Sentar\u0022 since GP2, unlike its proposed moons was never named, and 3 of its 4 moons are present in the stock game/planet factory, which would only require you to create assets for one new body (A tiny asteroid called Daphy orbiting within the rings of GP2), though I\u0027d recommend reducing the absurdly high surface gravities of Inacessible (Potatus) for its size if you were planning to recreate Nova\u0027s idea of GP2.
