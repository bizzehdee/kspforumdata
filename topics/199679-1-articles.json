It was unique cause it had stuff i didnt see in any other planet pack, like a planet\u00A0 with a moon, and that moon has a moon, and that moon also has a moon, which is very cool, and a star, i think it was a pulsar, that rotated once every second. i dont really need it for any new KSP game i plan on starting since, as i said, its probably very obsolete. But i still wish i could just remember its name or find out what it was called, or where it was originally posted. If any of y\u0027all could help me out with this, that would be fantastic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-18T10:22:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKottabos Games has showcased many KSP mods on youtube over the years, including planet packs, maybe you can find it there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
