Drag is trumped by gravity, the sooner you can get accelerating horizontally the better. I\u0027ve made some rockets for my payload fraction challenge that just barely make orbit, and only if they go fast enough in atmo to see the reentry effects. If I make a steeper ascent that avoids the effects it runs out of fuel. (This is for reasonably aerodynamic designs, it might change if the rocket is severely draggy.)\n\nAs someone once put succintly, if a bit simplistically: Vertical speed is eventually lost to gravity, but horizontal speed is yours to keep forever.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T17:27:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**\n  \nClosing parentheses matter."},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T17:23:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I see the moderator tag...

Even this puny thing with a TWR of 2.7 never manages to get past terminal velocity, and the really big rockets have terminal velocities around 800 m/s right off the pad.

That will break down your losses to gravity, drag, and cosine (steering), and tell you the total delta V expended.
