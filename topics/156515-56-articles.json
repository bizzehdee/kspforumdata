And the fairing isn\u0027t just for bigger loads; the Atlas V 501 (5-meter fairing, no SRBs) has been launched a total of seven times. It does like like the 4-meter fairing has never been launched with more than three SRBs, though, so maybe that\u0027s where the aero loads get dicey for Centaur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the comparison is really something. Centaur has a dry mass of 2,316 kg, which less the 190-kg RL10C-1 comes to 2,126 kg. That, for an external cylindrical volume of 77.15 cubic meters and a total prop load of 20.83 tonnes. Pixel counting is always rough, of course, but based on a 5-meter outer diameter for the Neutron second stage I\u0027m estimating an external cylindrical volume of 119 cubic meters. Even if the more rotund design means lower volumetric utilization -- let\u0027s say around 105 cubic meters -- that\u0027s 36% more propellant volume than Centaur and 3.02 times more propellant mass given the higher bulk density of methalox over hydrolox. Looking at 63 tonnes of propellant for a 300-400 kg tank is just utterly shocking...that\u0027s, like, a propellant mass fraction a little over 99%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying to sanity check this.\u00A0Assuming typical T/W ratio on the order of 150 for the 890 kN vacuum version, I would expect the weight of a single vacuum-optimized Archimedes engine to be around 600 kg, which still leaves us with a 98.4% stage propellant fraction. They advertise 13 tonnes to LEO and 1.5 tonnes to either Mars or Venus. You need about 3.9 km/s to get a transfer orbit to Venus out of LEO which is lower than typical transfer orbit requirements for Mars so let\u0027s go with that. B\u003Cspan\u003Eack-calculating with the expected 365 seconds of specific impulse gives us 6.1 km/s of \u0394v\u00A0on the ascent stage with a 13-tonne payload, meaning that the first stage has very little work to do other than getting out of the atmosphere. Back-calculating for a 1.5-tonne payload gives us 11.6 km/s of\u00A0\u0394v, which is 5.5 km/s of extra: higher than needed for the Venus transfer, but not entirely out of the ballpark. And we\u0027re working with dicey numbers here anyway because we don\u0027t really know what a Mars or Venus transfer looks like, or whether that\u0027s even reusable.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AckSed","CreatedById":224249,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-16T19:13:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA key part of the light weight of the 2nd stage tank is, I think, Rosie. Back in 2019, this carbon-fibre-laying and drilling robot reduced the production time of the carbon composite components for the whole Electron from 400 hours down to 12 hours. The razor-edged mass requirements of Electron mean that it has to be consistent enough to make those, and I think I saw it laying curved pieces in the first Neutron presentation so... All in all, seems like a fast way to prototype and iterate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother part of it is the hung stage, with the payload cone transmitting the thrust of the payload into the body of the first stage, leaving the tank and engine free to dangle. So it only has to take the strain of the mass of propellant and the compressive load of whatever a vacuum Archimedes can supply. And they\u0027ve carefully designed it so that the mounting point for the tank to hang is a ring around the sides, not the neck, spreading the load. It\u0027s ingenious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-14T20:30:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed41906418\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/RocketLab/status/1735387076936528004\u0022 style=\u0022height:283px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-14T23:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022150\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iLwTLqaCnQ8?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Rocket Lab \u0027The Moon God Awakens\u0027 Launch\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-15T03:42:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLive, T=0 is the top of the hour\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AckSed","CreatedById":224249,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-15T04:18:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood launch, though the camera on the second stage wasn\u0027t enjoying it.
