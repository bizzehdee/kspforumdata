Keep it up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly (and I don\u0027t know if this is the right sub-forum for it), I wanted to propose a joint project in the vein of the IYSS. As we all know, KSP has been quickly gaining popularity recently, partially due to the efforts of our wicked Media Team. Those guys put out quality solo videos all the time, but personally I quite enjoy watching the projects they work on together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve seen what they can do, so let us show them what craziness \u003Cstrong\u003Ewe\u003C/strong\u003E can come up with! I\u0027d like to get a few of the smaller KSP YouTubers together (say...anyone with 1000 subs or less?) to work on our own version of the IYSS, though perhaps that might seem a bit unoriginal. So instead we could attempt a surface base or station around another planet, maybe build a large ship in Kerbin orbit and send that somewhere...there\u0027s many possibilities and all ideas are welcome! The purpose of this collaboration would not only be to show off the game, but also to expose the smaller channels and maybe strike up some friendly competition with the Media Team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know what you think.

A max limit on parts per module, this is perhaps the most important with so many people involved. The limit will be 40 parts for the ground base and 60 parts on the station. We need to keep the parts count as low as possible, since we all know how bad the lag can get, especially for those with not so beefy PCs. There is a leeway of 5 parts, in case of an emergency and you absolutely need to add a few extra pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1b. You are allowed to build however many modules you want, as long as you stick within the part limit. So it should allow for more freedom of creativity and will ensure that the builds will have more interesting components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2a. No docking dead-end modules. If you take up a docking port, there should be at least one additional docking port on your module of the same size. Station-to-station ports should be Senior-sized. Should be pretty obvious why this rule is in place, we don\u0027t want to block off the expansion. In the same vein, try to attach your modules to a port that makes sense. We\u0027ll probably have to rearrange some modules around anyways, but as long as there\u0027s plenty of docking ports available it won\u0027t be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2a. The same applies for the ground base, always make sure to leave a port open. It\u0027s not much of a base if all the modules are just scattered around (rovers may be exempt).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Debris - don\u0027t leave it behind! More specifically, when you launch your module, have a way of deorbiting any debris. Still, it\u0027s not a problem if you\u0027re unable to deorbit, as long as you ensure that you terminate its flight before posting the save file. We wouldn\u0027t want a random piece of rocket to crash into our awesome builds, after all. Keep those orbits clear!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Mods - they are sort of allowed, just not on the final module. It\u0027s no problem if you use mods for the launch, as long as whatever you leave behind on the station is built solely from stock parts. This also ties in to the rule above about debris, since we don\u0027t want modded parts floating around in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The builds and the order of uploading - please stick with what\u0027s been assigned. I don\u0027t want to be a jerk about it, but we\u0027ve got so many people involved in the project that we absolutely need everyone to follow this rule. The order might change depending on the situation, but the builds we\u0027re currently working on should be our focus. The project will eventually have stations and ground bases all over the system, so let\u0027s take it one step at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. The recording - your video should be of good audio and visual quality, though that\u0027s a given. Let\u0027s put a time requirement on it, too, say between 10-30 mins. Most importantly, please talk a bit about the project and your module\u0027s intended purpose. Cinematic videos and such are totally cool as well, just make sure to leave a little tidbit at the end with the previously mentioned info.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Please post your submission in the other thread. I don\u0027t mind if it gets posted here as well, I just want to make sure that the other thread gets the attention it needs. Since it\u0027s in the Live from Mission Control sub-forum, it only makes sense that the actual videos get posted there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other info that people are interested in they\u0027d like me to leave here? I think I\u0027ve covered the basics, but I\u0027ll gladly add more if needed, lots of discussion throughout the thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-01T07:28:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2014 07:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nauthy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eupdating info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T02:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to do it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCdJxri7j0e4u8oG2FbNbWw/about\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCdJxri7j0e4u8oG2FbNbWw/about\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E39 subs, 12k views.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFav vid:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/azVp7OUhsm8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AustralianFries","CreatedById":57660,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T04:02:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm all in.

I think that brings us up to 6 members now, which should be enough for us to get started. So first thing to decide on is exactly what to build. We\u0027ve had some awesome ideas so far and as much as I\u0027d like to do all of \u0027em, sadly we can\u0027t...yet! I\u0027ll list what we have so far, in order of difficulty, and we can go from there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- space station in orbit around Kerbin or one of its moons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ground base on the Mun or Minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- interplanetary ship built in Kerbin\u0027s orbit...this would have two steps, one where we build the ship and another where we\u0027d take it on a mission. I think there\u0027s some potential here for really interesting videos, especially if we give everyone a chance to fly the finished product on their choice of a mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- surface base on another planet with an orbital facility for travel between the two. Duna would probably be the best bet. I\u0027m a huge fan of this, since it means we can have a lot more modules/parts, as we\u0027d be essentially working on two projects at once. Thanks Spyritdragon for the cool idea, wish you could join us!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- public colonization program, where each person would build their own surface base or add to an existing one, with the end goal of covering the entire solar system. This is a great idea too! And similar to the previous one, it would allow for larger modules and more parts, as well as giving people lots of freedom over what to build. Thanks to Holo for this awesome suggestion!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other ideas are welcome! My vote goes for one of the last two, since they\u0027ll both allow us to work with more parts and thus we can build some pretty wacky things. Which option from the list do you guys prefer? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say we wait maybe another day or two before we begin construction, to see if anyone else wants to join in or if there\u0027s other ideas. We can then figure out the build order, parts count, and whatever other little things still need to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m so excited to see the end result, it looks like we have a decent group of peoples already \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T05:35:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdea: Multiple \u0022Teams\u0022 (Only Works with numbers divisible by 2).
