By 2011 (ten years ago\u00A0today-ish) my brother had \u003Cem\u003Ehis \u003C/em\u003Eprototype mostly underway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, after a brief play with this\u00A0first take on implementing his version of our idea, I convinced him that the casual \u0022how-high-can-you-go-before-explosion\u0022 challenge would be more fun if instead of having only 2D physics, it should allow full 3D flight, and even getting into orbit\u00A0should one manage it. It already had 3D graphics, so why not?\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I made mine, I was limited to 2D by the Flash platform. He was using Unity, so really making it work as if it\u00A0\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0were\u00A0\u003C/i\u003E2D\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewas not just unneccessary, but also far more trouble than just allowing it to go as these things do in three dimensions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe had kinda thought of this himself, yet had all but ruled it out, concerned about how difficult it would be to properly control the ship while looking at it from the outside. Plus, all that stuff about axial tilts and orbital planes\u00A0made things a bit too complex for comfort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this, I suggested that he add a feature which has since become known as the \u0022Nav-Ball\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also put forward that the whole process would be far more approachable (compared to Orbiter, our shared source of spaceflight understanding) if the launch center was located at the exact equator of a miniature planet, with zero axial tilt to the ecliptic. Very much simplifying the concept of how orbits naturally work without having to cut back on physics by artificial means to that end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd why not, if someone manages to actually fly up into orbit, let them get on with it. If the point is to go as far as possible before inevitable disaster, then why not let it go as far as possibly succeeding with a mission?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, what resulted from that bit of advice I gave should be quite self-evident to anyone who\u0027s found his way into these forums.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003E--------- moreover ----------\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003ESadly, I never got any official credit for that (IMHO) critical bit of advisory.\u00A0 Or even any acknowledgement for having come up with Kerbals in the first place, back when they were little tin-foil men strapped to cardboard model rockets of most inadvisable repute.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003EPerhaps KSP2 could remedy this by featuring the \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Based on characters created by:\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 entry on its credits roll.
