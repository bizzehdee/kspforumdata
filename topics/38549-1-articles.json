Scott (in the video above) could have done a 2 hour orbit instead, but that would require more delta-V for each satellite, and the periapsis of a 2-hour orbit would probably be inside the atmosphere. The formula is like this, where P is the rotational period of the planet and n is the number of satellites: P(n-1)/n. So for Kerbin\u0027s 6 hour rotation and Scott\u0027s three satellites, you get four hours for the parking orbit. Four sats would give you 4:30, five gives 4:48, six gives five hours even and so on. For two sats, I\u0027d say set up like you were doing four and then skip an orbit, if you try to make a three-hour orbit you\u0027ll probably crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, now I think about it, if you set up for twice as many satellites and just skip launching every other orbit, you can save even more fuel on the probes. Say you launched for a 5.5 hour orbit, which would give you 12 launch windows, but then launched a probe on every other orbit. That makes six probes, but each one has less dV requirement. It just takes more waiting. Also, if you can\u0027t get the period of the parking orbit perfect on the first try, don\u0027t launch the probes until you get it perfect, all the rest of the timing is dependent on your orbit at the time of the first launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cy-one","CreatedById":74874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T02:43:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you both, that helped a lot! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t been able to come up with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUhh, and that was your first post! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Congratulations\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T03:46:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WhiteWeasel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WhiteWeasel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E10 Char limit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could just \u003Cem\u003Esay\u003C/em\u003E something instead of going \u002210 char limit\u0022.
