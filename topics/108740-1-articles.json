When the pedal is completely released, the throttle drops to (near) 0%, as expected. When the pedal is completely depressed, the throttle rises to 100%, also as expected. However, the deadzone appears to be applied in the middle of the range, instead of at the ends. When applying continuous force, the throttle rises until it reaches the deadzone limit, then it jumps to and stays at 50% thrust. Continuing to apply force, it stays at 50% until you reach the upper bound of the deadzone, and then continues rising to 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
