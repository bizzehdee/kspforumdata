So you know that the main thrust (haha) of the challenge isn\u0027t something that\u0027s too hard for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) They are building incrementally upon established skills. It allows them to refine a skill that they already know; and further adds a new layer of complexity - making sure that they can do it deliberately at a target chosen in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) It is a skill that is required for future missions: i.e. rescue missions, building surface bases, completing survey contracts, etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) It forces a person to learn how to read the navball to maneuver towards a target, and really understand what effect on your trajectory each of those directional inputs has (even in reverse.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) It takes practice. While you might get somewhere in the ballpark the first time, there\u0027s always room for improvement.
