Everytime i get close, i dont have enogh fuel to slow down enough i think. Ending up in a orbit around the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort overview of what i need to know. What direction do i need to come from? Towards the direction of the mun\u0027s orbit? Or the back folowing the mun\u0027s orbit. Wil the mun gravity pull me towards it? Is there any trick to get close without having to use so much fuel? I usualy end up running out, before i can actualy think about doing a landing. I tried adding more fuel tanks, but it gets to heavy, and i end up the same way either way. My basic rocket is as follows. Comandpod, decupler, advanced sas, 3liquid fuel, engine, decupler, 4 fueltanks, engine. Around the botom stage i added 6 long solid fuelboosters to get it off the ground. I know there is no way to land this rocket on the mun. But i want to learn how to get in the right path before i add the parts i need to make it land. Lets just call it a test mission:) And please, i do not know many technical terms yet, so to prevent a whole bunch of questions from me to figure out what every word meen, please keep it as simple as posible:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T11:16:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) When you intercept the Mun\u0027s SOI, the first thing to do is to raise or lower your Pe so that you orbit at something between 50 to 80km. You can orbit the Mun prograde or retrograde, it doesn\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When you reach your Pe, burn retrograde to circularize your orbit around the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) When you are ready land, burn retrograde to deorbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Between 15-20000m, start burning to shed off your speed. You should have enough thrust and fuel to do this of course. You can make a good lander with only one fuel tank and the small engine. If your lander is too heavy, then you won\u0027t have enough thrust to lose your velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) As you are descending, watch your retrograde marker on the navball.

It has the opposite effect of burning prograde, obviously, so rather than accelerate, you\u0027ll slow down. On the navigation ball in the bottom centre of the screen, there is a yellow marker. That\u0027s your forward direction - prograde - and there is also one on the opposite side of the ball as you rotate, which shows your retrograde vector. That one has a cross through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENibb refers to adjusting your Pe - that\u0027s marked on the map, so you\u0027ll have seen it already. It\u0027s your closest point in an orbit to the body you\u0027re in orbit of. It\u0027s short for \u0027periapsis\u0027, and the opposite is \u0027apoapsis\u0027, Ap in game, and the furthest point of your orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you burn to intercept the Mun, you\u0027ll see the orbital projection change in the map view. There will now be a new \u0027Pe\u0027 marker - referring to your approach to the Mun - and this you can alter from as far away as low Kerbin orbit. Basically you\u0027ll want to adjust it (by speeding up or slowing down using pro and retrograde burns) as soon as possible, so try to do it as soon as the map screen shows the encounter. It\u0027s more fuel efficient that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T13:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe essentials are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Extend your orbit at the correct time so your intercept the mun when you get to the apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When your orbit has intercepted the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence (i.e. gold line turns blue) shed your excess energy by burning retrograde until your orbit line intersects the Mun. If your first burn was well timed there may not be any burn here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 may or may not put you in orbit around the Mun (it depends on the original course), if it does the continuing to burn retrograde will put the PE inside the Mun so you\u0027re on a collision course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You\u0027re now falling towards the Mun. When to start to slow down depends on your thrust to weight ratio and how fast you\u0027re travelling and could be anything from 200km to 20km. It\u0027s better to start early on lower thrust as it\u0027s easy to reduce thrust but impossible to increase it higher than maximum. Your rocket sounds fairly powerful so I\u0027d try somewhere around 80km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave a few hundred kilometres out so you can try a couple of times as it\u0027s easy to misjudge stuff here. Be aware that the altimeter is also useless under ~5km as it only reflects mean surface level not your height above ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you run out of fuel doing this then you basically need to build a rocket with more range (either bigger or more efficient).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T14:20:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it looks like you need to learn how to orbit first.
