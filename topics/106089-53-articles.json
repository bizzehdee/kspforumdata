Using the patch from Kerbal Atomics that adds fuel switching to the NERV as a template and combining that with the existing patches for Cryo Engines to run on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/Ox and the NFLV methalox patch, I\u0027ve made the following patch that \\*should\\* make the Stromboli engine switchable between the two fuels:\n\nSpoiler\n\n@PART[cryoengine-stromboli-1]:FOR[CryoTanksMethalox]:AFTER[CryoEngines]  \n\n{  \n\n    MODULE  \n\n    {  \n\n        name = MultiModeEngine  \n\n        primaryEngineID = LH2  \n\n        secondaryEngineID = LCH4  \n\n        primaryEngineModeDisplayName = Hydrolox  \n\n        secondaryEngineModeDisplayName = Methalox  \n\n    }  \n\n     @MODULE[ModuleAlternator]  \n\n      {  \n\n            preferMultiMode = true  \n\n      }  \n\n    @MODULE[ModuleEngines\\*]  \n\n    {  \n\n        @name = ModuleEnginesFX  \n\n        engineID = LH2  \n\n    }  \n\n    $MODULE[ModuleEnginesFX]:HAS[#engineID[LH2]]  \n\n    {  \n\n        @engineID = LCH4  \n\n        @PROPELLANT[LqdHydrogen]  \n\n        {  \n\n            @name = LqdMethane  \n\n            @ratio = 3  \n\n        }  \n\n        !atmosphereCurve {}  \n\n        atmosphereCurve  \n\n        {  \n\n            key = 0 330  \n\n            key = 1 285  \n\n            key = 4 220  \n\n        }  \n\n    }  \n\n}\n\nIt looks like it worked in the part description as both modes are listed correctly with the right stats, but when I actually try to use the Stromboli the toggle button doesn\u0027t do anything- it always says it\u0027s on \u0022Primary\u0022 mode and doesn\u0027t seem to have any delta-V with hydrolox in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Strangely enough, it seems to be trying to burn both hydrogen and methane at the same time and actually does produce thrust from both modes independently in flight- shutting the engine down stops the methalox part with the sound effects and plume, but not the hydrolox part. Also strange is that the methalox engine burned liquid methane:oxidizer at a ratio of 30:1 rather than 3:1 as expected.\n\nIs there something obvious that I\u0027m doing wrong? Forcing them all to use methalox was easy enough to do but the mode switching is proving to be a real pain, any advice would be appreciated. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-04T16:31:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2020 04:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie**\n  \nIn flight testing"}]}
