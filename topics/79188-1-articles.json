I do have a decent amount of experience with CAD from using Autodesk inventor at school so I really don\u0027t want anything stupid simple. I defiantly want to get something that lets me make a 2d sketch from lines (Not just circles and squares...), has a decent number of tools, and a measurement system for the 2d sketches. A massive plus would be to have the ability to make an assembly and to export files to formats that can be opened by other CAD software (STEP, DWG, etc). It would also be nice to be able to make .STL files!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T17:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are a student in college or high school, you can get any of autodesk\u0027s software for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
