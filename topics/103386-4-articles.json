Or, are you speaking to the believability that these bumps are physical details rather than added through the use of normal maps. So as to avoid any possible confusion about the render above, there is nothing in the diffuse map that would indicate the presence of the bumps and ridges. Also, they do not fall on any seams in the texture. As I said, I may be completely misunderstanding you on these points. I just wanted to make sure that I fully understand what you mean.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
