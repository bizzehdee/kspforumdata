I don\u0027t think there is a \u0022StoredCO2\u0022 in these cases. CO2 was cleaned out of the air using Lithium Hydroxide canisters which would get saturated with CO2 and would then be replaced with fresh canisters. So the CO2 scrubber used in RO (at least at this stage) only converts CO2 and LithiumHydroxide into Waste Water and Waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the \u0022O2 Generator\u0022 the Gemini and Apollo capsules in RO have LqdOxygen tanks.

All three have the same basic issue: they\u0027ll use or create some of the resources but not others while not focused on the craft. Everything works perfectly (from what I\u0027ve seen so far, anyway) while you\u0027re focused on a craft. It\u0027s only when you switch to another craft or back to KSC, then advance time, that the converter seems to have an issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should point out, I\u0027m not losing Kerbals due to this issue. So far (even after a 21 earth day trip) my O2 has never dropped below about 20 minutes for the full crew, and my CO2 has never filled up to lethal capacity. So it\u0027s possible the buffer you\u0027re recommending is keeping my kerbals functioning (12hrs O2 and CO2 is 2 kerbal says worth). Doesn\u0027t change the fact that the \u0022TacGenericConverter\u0022 isn\u0027t properly managing it\u0027s input/output resources when not focused on a craft. If there\u0027s nothing that can be done to resolve that, no biggie. I was just hoping that some other system might help resolve the issue. For instance, as I understand it, RO/RP-0 handles fuel boil off when not focused on a craft by taking the fuel when you focus back on the craft. I.E., if you return to KSC and advance time for 24hrs then switch back to the craft, the boil off system chews up 24 hours worth of boil off while the craft is loading. I don\u0027t know exactly how that is accomplished and I may not be understanding the process exactly (I didn\u0027t write it after all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) but figured if that system basically works, it might be worth looking at for the TacGenericConverter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T19:47:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrisl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrisl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a contract that wants me to put the Gemini capsule (or equivalent) into orbit for 10 days.
