Everything was rosy and I racked up a 600 part base, then things started getting screwy. As part of the Umbra Space Industries modpack, I installed MKS. After that, seemingly at random and usually after I dock a new part, the base slowly start shaking from the end where the part was docked (few secs after \u0022Physics Easing\u0022), which gets more violent, parts get thrown around, explosions, you get the picture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTotally did not know why this happened, but im an ardent saver, so always had multilple saves to reload. Usually, if I time warp for a few seconds or redock the same part after taking it off, the shaking dies down, but it\u0027s really annoying when it does happen. Then, when I started working on EPL, I\u00A0removed MKS because I really didn\u0027t like the long resource chains, but the shaking stopped! There were a few hiccups, mostly due to incorrectly aligned docking ports or misplaced landing struts, but nothing as extravagant as my base exploding itself into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAttached pictures of my base when going into fits, flip through em really fast and you\u0027ll aproximately get what happens:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther ipsEmbeddedOther_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=http://imgur.com/gallery/YfrWE\u0022 style=\u0022height:453px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts on why this happens (maybe because\u00A0I have no dedicated graphics haha).
