I added lots of features into my FAR build for my own convenience. and guess it\u0027s time to release it to public. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**\\*\\* It\u0027s just a replacement pack based on FAR 0.14.6, you should get the original FAR installed, and replace .dll files with the ones provided in my package. \\*\\***\n\nFeatures:\n\nSome more autopilot helpers:\n\nPitch-Alpha-Controller, a PID controller that tries to control aircraft\u0027s AoA based on pilot\u0027s pitch input.\n\nPAC has a built-in 1G auto-trimmer based on DCA\u0027s stdAoA and stdVelocity setting (which consider these two as the parameters of take-off AoA and take-off speed), which is suitable for aircrafts that has zero Cl at zero alpha.\n\nPAC will change to Gee-command mode when at high dynamic pressure, limiting G to around -2 ~ 12G.\n\nRoll-Yaw-Converter, an Aileron-Rudder-Interconnect implementation, with purpose to minimize sideslip angle during roll and to achieve \u0022roll-around-velocity-vector\u0022.\n\nYaw damper changed to Yaw PD controller, which will also try to keep zero sideslip angle instead of just damping yaw rate.\n\nBrake Rudder % option for control surfaces, useful for fly-wing aircrafts (best used with Yaw PD Controller and Roll-Yaw-Converter).\n\nLocal AoA (AoA change due to nearby wings\u0027 interaction is also displayed in brackets) information display for all wing parts, especially useful to check the local AoA of control surfaces.\n\nTweaks:\n\nDCA now uses Sqrt(scale) so that aircraft will have a bit more control authority at high dynamic pressure. (it used to be too conservative before)\n\nWing interaction of MaxAoA is greatly changed. You no longer can get an aircraft that has a stall angle at ~60 deg, even with leading-edge-flaps. These LEFs can still delay the stall for perhaps several degrees but that\u0027s about it.\n\nWing\u0027s AC shift due to stall is adjusted a bit. it will still shift afterwards to somewhere around 50% of MAC at 90 deg of AOA.\n\nDrag at medium AoA tweaked a bit to make it feel better. (used to be too high I think)\n\nDownload link: [https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/626/FAR%20Modified%20%28Replacement%20Package%29](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/626/FAR%20Modified%20%28Replacement%20Package%29)\n\nLicense still follows FAR\u0027s GNU GPL v3.\n\nSource code at my github: [http://github.com/HoneyFox/Ferram-Aerospace-Research](https://github.com/HoneyFox/Ferram-Aerospace-Research)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T12:58:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 12:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HoneyFox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T23:35:06Z","Content":"I keep losing this thread so I am commenting to say I like the changes and so I dont lose it again"},{"CreatedByName":"Ramon91","CreatedById":110639,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T11:45:08Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been waiting for something like this looong time.
