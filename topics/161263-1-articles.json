So ill start by saying i love the game even the broken console version \u00A0when it wants to work but im afraid even after the update there are gonna be some gameplay issues \u0022compared to pc\u0022. While i know that blitworks has their hands full and also\u00A0that mods are just not an option for console maybe you could add a piece of a mod all im suggesting is external fuel lines so you can have a permanent refueler on a planetary body without having to bring one every time you go there or having to try to dock with it. Its doubtfull this will happen but here is my optimistic suggestion. thank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-29T15:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the big reason we haven\u0027t seen any interest on these type of parts from Squad is they tend to be flaky.\u00A0 It\u0027s OK for a mod, but people will expect better from the game if it is stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happens is when you connect two craft with a fuel line in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, it\u0027s just like a docking port.\u00A0 The two craft become one.\u00A0 This is fine when close together but even a small distance apart can cause issues.\u00A0 The center of mass shifts when the two craft are connected.\u00A0 When those two craft sit on a surface at slightly different elevations, bad things happen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou load the craft while entering physics range and the game tries to put them at an elevation equal to the location of the center of mass.
