The game starts loading, and\u00A0 a popup, well, pops up, and says \u0027This version of Mechjeb is incompatible with your version of KSP\u0027, so Im like, \u0022Oh, that must be a glitch\u0022. And then, as soon as the game finishes loading, it crashed. This keeps happening, and it won\u0027t stop unless I uninstall MechJeb. Can someone help me with this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Confused Scientist","CreatedById":179591,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-21T16:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy best guess is that MechJeb is already updated for KSP 1.3 or 1.3.1 and that is what you have installed by accident.
