I wanted to recover the whole shuttle and its crew with a big cargo plane and not just clicking (Recover).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy Cargo Plane arrived and somehow the wings ripped off on landing so now i had 7 Kerbals stuck on the Island. I thought to myself \u0022challenge accepted\u0022 and i built a VTOL to recover those poor Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe VTOL was a great plane built with MK2 Parts. I succesfully landed the VTOL at the abandoned island and got all my Kerbals into it. And on Takeoff the engines went crazy and a wing ripped of because i hit the\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTower. But atleast all of my kerbals (which were 9 now) survived the VTOL crash. And i had to send another Plane to recover them. But as you might have guessed that plane didnt make it either because on landing the front\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwheel ripped of and the whole plane crashed into the ground killing 2 more kerbals. So i had 2 dead kerbals and 9 living kerbals still stuck on the island. I sent a ship made with stock parts over to the island and finally i rescued all of my kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut i wanted to clear of all the downed planes so i sent a Helicopter crew which had explosives (KIS) to blow up all the debris. So i blew everything up but as soon as i wanted to take off the Space Kraken ate my whole savegame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will never land on that island ever again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers guys\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
