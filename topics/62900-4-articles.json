For parts that are in the inventory it\u0027s \u0022totalTime\u002B=p.partInfo.cost/100;\u0022 and for parts that have been used before but aren\u0027t in the inventory it is \u0022totalTime \u002B= p.partInfo.cost / (KCT_GameStates.PartTracker[name] \u002B 1);\u0022. So as you can see, using the part inventory and using the same parts in many different builds reduces the overall build time (the tracker increments by one for each part for each separate build it is in. 1000 boosters in one rocket only counts as one use in the tracker). This also is my implementation on your (and several other peoples) requests for sub-assembly support. If you use the same launcher many times, and if you recover it, it becomes almost negligible in total time added to the build and the whole time is based on the payload. If you want to save up on sub-assemblies, just throw some in the build list with some random (cheap) root part and scrap them when they\u0027re finished. Now you\u0027ve got a bunch of cheap launchers saved up! I may be able to add sub assemblies separately, but at the moment this doesn\u0027t actually read any ship files except for the temporary file it makes to do launches and so I\u0027d have to rework some stuff. It\u0027d also likely be another GUI, or part of the build list GUI. GUIs are not my friends...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I have any real control over the ghost ships. I wish you could load a ship from a ConfigNode without having to actually load the model in game, but KSP doesn\u0027t actually allow that or I at least haven\u0027t found it. I could conceivably write my own method given a lot of time and would probably end up destroying a few people\u0027s saves... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Maybe later down the road I\u0027ll try that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you have an alarm set to go off? I\u0027ve tried to get KAC to remain fully functional with this, so I don\u0027t expect it was the cause, but it\u0027s possible that something altered the warp and this then gave full control to them. In order to maintain KAC support and not blow past alarms like they\u0027re nothing, if something changes the warp (including the player) when using the Warp to Complete this releases full control to them and won\u0027t try reducing the warp. EXCEPT that it should still set the warp to 1x when there\u0027s 10 seconds left (though at high warps this is not always possible. If your max warp speed is higher than standard it will very likely miss this 10 second window, and even the maximum warp in stock will probably miss it. It\u0027s there so that if there\u0027s a KAC alarm less than a minute or so after then it won\u0027t keep warping through (and by that time KAC will have reduced the warp rate)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf others can confirm issues with Warp to Complete then I will pursue this further, otherwise it seems like it may be a mod incompatibility, which if you can narrow it down to one definite mod then I\u0027ll try to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, sorry if I sound like I\u0027m shooting you down.
