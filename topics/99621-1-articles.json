My rockets all perform an uncommanded roll (ccw when viewed from below) as though the roll command (default key \u0022Q\u0022) is jammed. I uninstalled the game, reinstalled it, and the problem went away for a while, but then came back. I tried unplugging the joystick, but that doesn\u0027t seem to help. This isn\u0027t related to the construction of the rockets, as it happens to all of my previously working designs. It will also make the capsule spin at maximum speed until electrical power is exhausted. Running down the battery seems to be the only thing that can save Jeb from a bad landing with this bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else faced this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T04:18:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt could be that you accidentally hit Alt\u002BQ, which sets the trim that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry clearing the trim with Alt\u002BX.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Triarius","CreatedById":137963,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T04:23:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo joy, still spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T06:05:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you post up screenshots of one or more of the designs?

I don\u0027t think it is related to aerodynamics because the control surfaces deflect on their own, and the reaction wheels draw electricity to spin the capsule at about 600 rpm after separation. I should also mention that I have never updated FAR... I\u0027ve only had the game about a month. If anything, I\u0027d guess it has to do with mechjeb. I tried removing the mechjeb folder but the game won\u0027t work at all without it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcapmare","CreatedById":137087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T21:04:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having the same issue with rolling. I tried a number of things, from unplugging the joystick to changing part configuration to avoid any kind of clipping that could cause it. I still found no solution. As the OP mentioned, reverting back to the original game settings works for a while, then out of nowhere it starts the spinning again. There is either a bug in KSP or one of the mods. I\u0027m definitely curious about the solution to this because this has been driving me nuts for the past 4-5 days now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T21:39:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOdds are it\u0027s a mod, so you\u0027ll need to provide more information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart by reading the [thread=92229]How to Get Support[/thread] sticky.

I removed FAR and the rocket stopped spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design of my rocket is simple. It\u0027s a 2-stage rocket done with KW Rocketry parts, a 4-unit tank in the first stage and a 2-unit tank in the second stage. The command cube sits at the top in a fairing base and two cone fairing halves are covering it. There was also a RemoteTech antenna (offset into the tank) and MechJeb2 remote (offset into the tank). But I verified and these two are not the problem. I can\u0027t give you the craft file as I would have to attach my modified parts as well (I\u0027m not using stock/mod parts, I\u0027ve created my own parts based on KW).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I tried is launching without the fairings (only the cube on the base) and that seemed to not spin my rocket. So I\u0027m thinking the problem is with FAR and fairings. With FAR and without fairings, there is no problem; and without FAR and with fairings, there is no problem. I\u0027m looking into this right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: After some preliminary tests, it seems that FAR relies on the part title to determine if it is a fairing or not, and my part title was not using their convention. After adding my part title to it, the spinning seemed to have stopped. I will continue to test this and if the problem persists I\u0027ll post my findings. I don\u0027t want to hijack the OPs issue -- the problem could be caused by something else in their case. However, OP, if through trial an error by eliminating parts, you determine which part is giving you aero issues, take a look in FAR\u0027s Part Classification tab. That might fix your issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-16T22:27:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mcapmare\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
