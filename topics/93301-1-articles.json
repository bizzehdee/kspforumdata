It\u0027s one of the more peculiar things about the fuel system. Decouplers actually do have crossfeed capability. However, they have special logic that if they are connected directly to a fuel tank, they don\u0027t feed. You\u0027ll likely have to right-click and disable fuel flow until you\u0027ve established it in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I know.
