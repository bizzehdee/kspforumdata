I used a grabber attached to the end of an extended cylinder\u00A0piston on the back of the central core so that I could pull it instead of pulling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo matter how slowly I apply thrust the rock starts rotating\u00A0badly. Not just a wobble but a definite roll. I did target the center of mass so that is pretty straight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to get a picture in from i.imgur but it is not working for me tonight so I will have to describe it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust so you know I use only stock parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCentral Core is Rockomax Jumbo-64 fuel tank topped with an\u00A0Advanced reaction Wheel (Large) and a Mk1-3 command pod. There are also a bunch of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E trusters, monopropellant tanks, Solar Cells, Ore Storage containers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the back side is a 3PT Telescoping Hydraulic Cylinder that extends with an Advanced Grabber unit. The extension is needed to get the grabber beyond the\u00A0outrigger tanks. During launch the extension is retracted so it will fit on the booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are four outrigger tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo outriggers are\u00A0 Two FL-TX1800s and a FL-TX900 with a Thud mounted on the front side as far forward as possible pointing straight back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other two are also\u00A0Two FL-TX1800s and a FL-TX900 with a Thud mounted on the front side as far forward as possible pointing straight back but they also have Convert-O-Tron 250 with an attached Drill-O-Matic Excavation Miner mated with a large radiator on hte back end.\u00A0 The resource drill and converter is to refuel once I am on the asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I am ready to start pulling I reset the engines to 20% max thrust. When I start the burn the rock starts rolling badly. It is not wobbling but rolling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs\u00A0far as I can tell I have the Center of Mass pretty well centered. Even if I use the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system it will not hold keep the rock stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not\u00A0know if I need to add one or more Reaction wheels. Even turning the rock is very slow and sluggish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso one other point. I used this tug to grab a Class A rock and after that mission the\u00A03PT Telescoping Hydraulic Cylinder is bent. It is mounted flat on the rear end of the\u00A0tank but the shaft has a distinct curve. It is bad enough that when I extend the piston and control from the\u00A0grabber it lines me up off center of\u00A0the center of the rock. I had to do the last few meters of the capture by eye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould the bent piston be causing the issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Thuds are a far forward as possible but do I need to extend them further from the central core to get a wider thrust base? If so - how do I do that. On\u00A0the end of struts extending sideways?\u00A0In\u00A0that case how to I set them up so I can get the tug into orbit and then extend them into position? BTW - I also use the Thuds to get the last bit of DetaV to get into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there something else I could be missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBruce\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-24T06:13:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2020 06:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jbdenney\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espeeliong\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-24T07:02:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E ?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I understand your craft, the Thuds are pointing opposite their usual direction, relative to the control point.\u00A0 If a tiny amount of roll starts, then the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E would gimbal the Thuds in a direction that makes it worse.
