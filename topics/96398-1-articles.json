Any suggestions? I would like one that I can use with both PC and PS3/PS4 but will settle with just PC if I need to. Wireless would also be nice, but after the problems with my G930, I am not enthusiastic about another wireless one that will keep disconnecting. Price isn\u0027t an issue as long as it is below around $130. It needs to be able to play sound through the headset, and have a mic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T15:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am on the same quest as you, although I would favor a USB connected headset for my PC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while we are at it, is there a way to tell Windows to enable/disable the headset/speakers via hotkeys?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
