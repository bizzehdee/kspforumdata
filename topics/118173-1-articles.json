This is even with solar panels and battery sources on the craft.\n\nMy mod list is extensive, but I have Warp Unlocked (I think thats what it\u0027s called), Near Future Solar and TAC Life Support installed; I think they\u0027re the only ones which directly affect electricity/resource consumption.\n\nAny ideas?"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T17:50:20Z","Content":"The work around I think (I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ve all have learned the hard way) is to have an extra battery pack on board which is disabled/disconnected, especially for these occasions.\n\nWhen you come out of warp.. you \u0027connect\u0027 the backup battery and spend a few hours recharging your systems."},{"CreatedByName":"Diddly Feelerino","CreatedById":116824,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T20:32:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The work around I think (I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ve all have learned the hard way) is to have an extra battery pack on board which is disabled/disconnected, especially for these occasions.\n\u003E When you come out of warp.. you \u0027connect\u0027 the backup battery and spend a few hours recharging your systems.\n\nThanks for the reply.\n\nSo what do you mean by disconnected?
