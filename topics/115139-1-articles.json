The best thing to do here is stiffen the wobbly joint with struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difficulty in steering that you encounter about halfway through your first stage is due to the craft becoming aerodynamically unstable as the center of mass moves backwards as the fuel is consumed. At some point you have more drag in front of the center of mass than behind, and when that point is reached any small deviation from prograde results in net forces that push you further from prograde. Larger fins at the rear would help. More control authority (e.g. a reaction wheel near the center of the rocket) would not prevent the problem, but would help you fight it. The key in this stage of the flight is to keep the rocket aligned with the direction of travel, only deviating by a few degrees to make your turn slowly. Once you are out of the thickest part of the atmosphere this will become less of an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou encounter the same problem, much more obviously and immediately, in the second stage. That stage is aerodynamically unstable from the start. Small fins placed at the bottom of that stage would help.

First of all, you won\u0027t save much: going to Minmus only takes around 150 m/s more dV than going to the Mun, so that\u0027s all you can save in the absolute best-case scenario. That\u0027s a tiny amount, compared with the overall dV of the mission.

Not much savings to be had there. Any course to Minmus involving a Munar flyby costs me at least 1 km/s. It only takes 950 m/s for direct intercept.

So if Minmus is *roughly* within the transfer window, you can make some savings on the capture - but again, the capture itself is rather cheap, and the dV difference between Mun and Minmus orbits is pretty much minimal (compared to getting from LKO to Mun orbit).
