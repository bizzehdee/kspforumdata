The SAS is trying to correct the flight path using the tail fins but the tail of the rocket is pointing in a different direction to the SAS unit so the control inputs are actually exacerbating the wobble rather than damping it out. Turning off the SAS and flying it manually in the lower atmosphere will stop the SAS induced oscillation and struts will reduce the flexibility at the neck."},{"CreatedByName":"mdkendall","CreatedById":114550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T23:19:09Z","Content":"The SAS-induced wobbling is because your control point (a probe core inside the fairing I guess) is on one side of a wobbly joint and your control authority (engine gimbal and fins) are on the other. The best thing to do here is stiffen the wobbly joint with struts.\n\nThe difficulty in steering that you encounter about halfway through your first stage is due to the craft becoming aerodynamically unstable as the center of mass moves backwards as the fuel is consumed. At some point you have more drag in front of the center of mass than behind, and when that point is reached any small deviation from prograde results in net forces that push you further from prograde. Larger fins at the rear would help. More control authority (e.g. a reaction wheel near the center of the rocket) would not prevent the problem, but would help you fight it. The key in this stage of the flight is to keep the rocket aligned with the direction of travel, only deviating by a few degrees to make your turn slowly. Once you are out of the thickest part of the atmosphere this will become less of an issue.\n\nYou encounter the same problem, much more obviously and immediately, in the second stage. That stage is aerodynamically unstable from the start. Small fins placed at the bottom of that stage would help. But be careful, in that position they will make stability of the first stage worse so make sure the ones at the bottom of the first stage are bigger."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T03:17:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I want land on Minmus and bring some data, i read somewhere here on forum, that i can send mission via Mun using only fraction of fuel, by making low periapsis near Mun than use it gravity to fly Minmus.\n\nCertainly it\u0027s possible to use a Mun gravity assist to go to Minmus, but you really don\u0027t need to. First of all, you won\u0027t save much: going to Minmus only takes around 150 m/s more dV than going to the Mun, so that\u0027s all you can save in the absolute best-case scenario. That\u0027s a tiny amount, compared with the overall dV of the mission. And in order to set up such an ideal scenario, you\u0027ll have to do it when the Mun and Minmus are lined up just right, and you\u0027ll have to hit just exactly the right trajectory.\n\nSo basically, doing the slingshot maneuver around the Mun would be giving you a tiny savings in dV (even in the best case), in exchange for making the overall mission considerably more difficult and higher-risk. So if you\u0027re doing it for the *challenge*, then by all means go ahead! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) However, if what you\u0027re trying to accomplish is \u0022I want to get to Minmus as simply and easily as possible\u0022, I\u0027d suggest skipping the slingshot maneuver and just launch directly to Minmus.\n\nAs far as your wobbles are concerned, \n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) replace the active fins with passive fins. Limit the engine gimbal a bit.\n\n\u002B1 to Marvin\u0027s suggestion. If you\u0027re new to KSP, you should know that you can control the amount of engine gimbal at design time in the VAB. Right-click on the engine, then set the gimbal limit to something less than 100%. (For example, try somewhere between 30-50%).\n\nAlso, per other posters\u0027 suggestion, do something to stiffen the neck of the rocket, e.g. with some struts."},{"CreatedByName":"match","CreatedById":91708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T05:29:06Z","Content":"I would bet that what you read about doing a flyby of Mun on your way to Minmus was for an experience mission\\* in career mode.

I was about 50 dV short to a contract orbit and was able to make it up using Mun.
