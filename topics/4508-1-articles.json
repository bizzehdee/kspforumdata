Then I think in terms of what each stage should do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage (aka the \u0027lift stage\u0027) has to be big and powerful, because the more power and thrust that I have initially, the more equipment and fuel can be in the other stages, and I\\\u0027ll have more versatility with the rest of the design. SRBs can often be used here to great effect to help overcome the large amount of inertia and to save fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second stage (or the \u0027orbital insertion stage\u0027) has to strike a balance between power and efficiency. After the first stage throws a large amount of equipment into the upper atmosphere, this stage helps to add a large amount of orbital velocity to the craft and give it the final push out of the atmosphere that it needs to achieve orbit. It has to have enough power to give it the necessary velocity to achieve orbit, but at the same time it has to have the efficiency and the fuel capacity to burn long enough to get the job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third stage (aka the \u0027orbit stage\u0027 or the \u0027mission stage\u0027) mainly has to be fuel efficient and to have a good fuel capacity, without as much concern given to power as the other two stages. This stage is used for any correctional maneuvers that are going to be made to the orbit/trajectory, any more velocity that is going to be added, and any de-orbit maneuvers that will take place. Power is not as big of a concern, but efficiency and capacity is, because if this stage runs out of fuel while you are still in orbit, it is highly likely that you are not going to make it back to the surface of Kearth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is my rocket design philosophy. That is what goes through my head while designing and building a rocket, and so far it has been a rather reliable set of ideas to stick by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what is your rocket design philosophy? How do you build a new rocket? What goes through your head during the design process?

For example, say engine A and engine B will both provide 1000m/s delta V with the given fuel, but engine A takes 30 seconds while engine B takes 60. All other factors the same, engine B will be more stable, and thus I waste less delta-V to correction burns.
