I braked as much as i could, but i ran out of fuel and small as my craft was, my RCS system couldn\u0027t overcome gravity, so i had to make Bob bail out of the capsule. Only i hit F once outside in my panick rather than space, making him climb back in. He managed to get back out, but before he could thrust away the ship hit the ground and blew up, sending Bob on a long suborbital trajectory in the same state i was talking about above - he had \u0027hit the surface\u0027 so untill he pushed himself back up he couldn\u0027t use his jetpack. So he was left helpless in the sub-orbit. I rushed Jeb out of orbit around Kerbin ASAP and sent him on a rescue mission. Only with the added weight of the second capsule (didn\u0027t have access to anything bigger than a 1-man capsule), even with added fuel, i didn\u0027t manage to get into position to save him, and he crashed into the Mun in a puff of smoke :-(.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second time, i ran out of fuel too, but this time i was already in a (rather high) Kerbin orbit, so Lembur used his monopropellant tank to get back home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aqua667","CreatedById":66078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T13:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI landed on the dark side of the Mun.
