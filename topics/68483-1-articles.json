So if you are slightly above, below, rotated, or to the side of a ladder, grabbing on causes the kerbal to get a bit of extra force. I notice this a lot when I\u0027m free floating EVA and can\u0027t get my kerbal to pitch up toward the hatch.

The last time I saw this, it was with a ship that was landed on a slope, and no matter what it would always vibrate slightly. I think the constant shifting of the ladder\u0027s position may have been what caused the kerbal to slowly inch up the ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T04:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want to have less vertical motion over the ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find that this happens if the kerbal is ascending or descending rapidly relative to the ladder.
