A core \u002B 6 boosters would be a 4 stages to orbit rocket. (As the remaining stages are \u0027full\u0027 when the empty pairs are dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key advantage of the design, is to limit \u0027dead weight\u0027 as all stage engines burn all the time. This is particularly effective in KSP, because the engines and fuel tank dry weight are so heavy in regard to their thrust (so you want to shed this dead weight as you go)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in real life, there is several problems with this : rocket engine nozzles of different lengths (like Merlin and merlin vacuum - same engine, different nozzles) are designed to have their peak ISP at different air pressures. (In KSP, all engines have their peak ISP in vacuum, which is not the case in real life)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you keep your core stage all the way to space, the core needs to have engines tuned for these altitudes.
