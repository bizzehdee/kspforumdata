Perhaps the discussion would have meaning other than just reaching an agreement, it might have a outcome on the game itself if squad wishes it. So i say why the hell not? do it! Just remember there are always going to be someone that dont agree. So perhaps a majority rules type discussion/agreement would be in order. Perhaps polls on individual items.

Sure, you have to filter out a lot of the emotive language, good and bad, but eventually you get a good list of focus areas that should allow the art team to concentrate their work on to improve their output. Personally, I send out work daily for review and a lot comes back deconstructed with comments... usually negative (because that\u0027s what people tend to be more outspoken about) and you have to take it on the chin and say, \u0022you know, you\u0027re probably right\u0022 and change your work, workflow, design idea etc. It\u0027s how you adapt your work to move forward and better yourself that ultimately matters, not how many good comments like, \u0022nice work\u0022 you can garner from a community of online strangers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith ALL of this in mind, it\u0027s good to hear from Nestor that feedback is being read... and hopefully accounted for on some level.

This made it easy to see what each part is on the rocket/vehicle/contraption and is very helpful for prototyping and was very helpful way back when I was a new player as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, this visual distinction also made all the craft look like they had been cobbled together from a bunch of random parts. Sometimes this is funny, but it\u0027s also incredibly annoying when trying to build replicas or realistic-looking craft. The new art direction does address this, but it almost goes too far into the clean look where it\u0027s difficult to tell parts apart at a glance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy feedback on the art direction is to find a middle ground. Make each part family have its own unique flair from the common design language, but keep it subtle enough that any part can be paired with any other part without it looking awkward and out of place. The boosters on the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E are a bad example of this since both parts look too similar. Find a common theme for all SRBs (a specific texture and model design language) and use things like varying stripes (color/position) and other tweaks to identify the individual parts from each other so that they are unique enough to tell at a glance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure a lot of this is just common sense for design, and to a large degree I see this happening already, especially with the fuel tanks, but right now they\u0027re a bit too similar without enough visual distinction (especially in the thumbnails). Like dvader said, a different background would be very helpful, but I would also propose to have a bit more visual differentiation between the different tank families.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-10T20:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223448608\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178124\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221536578887\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105132\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022klgraham1013\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, klgraham1013 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the hundreds of artists at, say, Ubisoft aren\u0027t following a set of guide lines for Assassin\u0027s Creed?\u00A0 There just all coming in the style \u003Cem\u003Ethey \u003C/em\u003Ewant to do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuidelines and copycatting are two different things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you had played Assassin\u0027s Creed since the first one, you would had noticed differences on the characters design.
