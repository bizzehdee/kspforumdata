I built a test craft consisting of a pod, RCS tank and 4 RCS thrusters. Pressing W showed visible RCS thrust (the jet of white particles) and consumed a notable amount of monopropellent. Pressing Q also showed visible thrust and consumed propellent as well (as measured on the resource pane at the upper right). However if I added weight to the craft (19 orange tanks) the W key still produced visible thrust and consumed notable RCS, but the Q key now produced an almost invisible amount of thrust and the monopropellent consumption was almost too small to measure. On a longer craft (where I first encounterd it) pressing Q or E produced no visible thrust and no measurable monopropellent usage - my guess it was producing some thrust but it was less then 0.01 monopropellent being spent per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain I\u0027m not sure if this is intended behavoir because of the balancing of the craft or not. If you stick a lot of thrusters on the heavy end of the ship you get visible thrust from them but not from the thrusters at the top. That would lead me to believe that the game is trying compensate for the center of mass by firing the thrusters near the bottom more then the ones at the top. Yet even with enough thrusters on both ends pressing Q or E doesn\u0027t properly roll the ship - you get pitch and yaw movement as well. This leads me to believe there may be a bug in how the game is calculating the correct thruster balance to use for rolling - the thrusters on the heavy end are firing too much and the ones on the light end too little.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
