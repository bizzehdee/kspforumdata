So if you alter your settings during play, that Duna base you\u0027ve been leaving without EC through the night might kill your kerbals instantly.\u00A0I\u0027ve basically allowed for just one day of grace period, 2 hours of EVA, 10 times the amount of EC needed for life support PER KERBAL. As my career goes on, I\u0027ll even consider reducing the percentage of Mulch created to really punish myself \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, use the AmpYear power management mod. It will be crucial if you use the above settings and a great mod in itself. Also, unlike USI-LS which cuts the EC at high time warp, AmpYear\u0027s Manager (if enabled) still drains your batteries enough to make EC cheating impossible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow stop thinking about Supplies as just water/food. Consider them a combination of powdered food, water, heating coils, coolant for the air con, filters, oxygen. Also consider that the pods have invisible systems for delivering water, mixing it with the powder to create food, running your breathing, in one word Life Support, balanced to \u0022run out\u0022 all at once and not individually (as in TAC-LS). It makes sense since nobody would fill up a craft with food for 3 years but water for just 2 days, oxygen for 3 hours and enough CO2 filters to last till Judgement Day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of these systems use electricity. Because of a stock bug, EC is not consumed at very high Time Compression (so use AmpYear to drain your craft of EC). Supplies are consumed as long as you have EC at any TC (including 10000x). But if you run out of EC, all the delivery systems for LS stop so Supplies are no longer consumed. You immediately enter the grace period and, with my settings,\u00A0your kerbals will die after\u00A01 day. Here, AmpYear can save your ass, for a while. You can use the remaining reserve power to transfer 1% EC at a time, to reset the grace period timer or reorient your craft. Reserve power drains as well so you can\u0027t do it for long.\u00A0Consider it as an Apollo 13 method of nursing your craft home or to the light of dawn. And get the capacitors from Near Future Electric to help you as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-16T14:13:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2016 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by karamazovnew\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T13:57:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/63072-karamazovnew/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002263072\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/63072-karamazovnew/\u0022 id=\u0022ips_uid_4472_6\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@karamazovnew\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0- I hardly consider the default settings \u0027cheating\u0027... they are reasonable defaults based on the vision for this mod, so I\u0027d appreciate them not being referred to as such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the grace period is pretty clearly shown as that very first option in the upper left (in seconds).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly - stock EC scaling is not a bug, it\u0027s a design choice to handle intermediary storage of EC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Domfluff","CreatedById":64903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T14:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of the vision of the mod - I\u0027m currently seriously digging into UKS/USI Life support since the addition of Hab/Home times, and finding it suitably difficult to plan a Duna mission without the advanced parts (Zubrin\u0027s\u00A0\u0022Battlestar Galactica\u0022).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn DasValdez\u0027s stream, you produced a KERB module, which was a 1.25m part that expanded to roughly the size of the Hitchhiker storage module (so, 2.5m).
