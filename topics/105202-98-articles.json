I just deliberately ran myself out of Ec. Nothing happened, apart from supplies no longer draining. None of the Kerbals onboard - a mix of orange suits and regulars - went grouchy, as they are supposed to (all available options are set to grouchy right now). They all went EVA and did stuff just fine. I was able to cruise the entire nighttime portion of a 90 km Kerbin orbit without power, while still keeping control of my vessel and even conserved supplies while at it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It appears that either, there is indeed a grace period for power outage, or power outage has no consequences at all.\n\u003E \n\n[@Streetwind](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/) and not only, it does work, but unfortunately there is no indication of the \u0022grace period\u0022 timer. Yes, the supplies timer goes negative, but that\u0027s not the same thing. \n\nFirst of all, the default settings \u0022break\u0022 some of the effects. Pump up the difficulty to see them better. Here are my settings.\n\n![ZsqLETR.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/ZsqLETR.jpg?1)\n\nBe warned tho... settings and timers are stored PER SAVE. So if you alter your settings during play, that Duna base you\u0027ve been leaving without EC through the night might kill your kerbals instantly. I\u0027ve basically allowed for just one day of grace period, 2 hours of EVA, 10 times the amount of EC needed for life support PER KERBAL. As my career goes on, I\u0027ll even consider reducing the percentage of Mulch created to really punish myself ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nSecond, use the AmpYear power management mod. It will be crucial if you use the above settings and a great mod in itself. Also, unlike USI-LS which cuts the EC at high time warp, AmpYear\u0027s Manager (if enabled) still drains your batteries enough to make EC cheating impossible. \n\nNow stop thinking about Supplies as just water/food. Consider them a combination of powdered food, water, heating coils, coolant for the air con, filters, oxygen. Also consider that the pods have invisible systems for delivering water, mixing it with the powder to create food, running your breathing, in one word Life Support, balanced to \u0022run out\u0022 all at once and not individually (as in TAC-LS). It makes sense since nobody would fill up a craft with food for 3 years but water for just 2 days, oxygen for 3 hours and enough CO2 filters to last till Judgement Day.\n\nAll of these systems use electricity. Because of a stock bug, EC is not consumed at very high Time Compression (so use AmpYear to drain your craft of EC). Supplies are consumed as long as you have EC at any TC (including 10000x). But if you run out of EC, all the delivery systems for LS stop so Supplies are no longer consumed. You immediately enter the grace period and, with my settings, your kerbals will die after 1 day. Here, AmpYear can save your ass, for a while. You can use the remaining reserve power to transfer 1% EC at a time, to reset the grace period timer or reorient your craft. Reserve power drains as well so you can\u0027t do it for long. Consider it as an Apollo 13 method of nursing your craft home or to the light of dawn. And get the capacitors from Near Future Electric to help you as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-16T14:13:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2016 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by karamazovnew**"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T13:57:54Z","Content":"[@karamazovnew](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/63072-karamazovnew/) - I hardly consider the default settings \u0027cheating\u0027... they are reasonable defaults based on the vision for this mod, so I\u0027d appreciate them not being referred to as such.\n\nAnd the grace period is pretty clearly shown as that very first option in the upper left (in seconds).\n\nLastly - stock EC scaling is not a bug, it\u0027s a design choice to handle intermediary storage of EC."},{"CreatedByName":"Domfluff","CreatedById":64903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T14:04:14Z","Content":"Speaking of the vision of the mod - I\u0027m currently seriously digging into UKS/USI Life support since the addition of Hab/Home times, and finding it suitably difficult to plan a Duna mission without the advanced parts (Zubrin\u0027s \u0022Battlestar Galactica\u0022).  \n\nOn DasValdez\u0027s stream, you produced a KERB module, which was a 1.25m part that expanded to roughly the size of the Hitchhiker storage module (so, 2.5m). I\u0027m going to assume that the game effect would be similar to that of a Hitchhiker module, in that it\u0027s one of the most efficient ways to add Hab time to the craft.  \n\nAre there plans for integrating the KERB into USI:Life Support?

I can\u0027t imagine how I could\u0027ve played early Hard career with my current settings. \n\nBut you\u0027re wrong on the second one. Yes you can set the grace period, but in flight there is no indication that you\u0027ve entered it because you ran out of EC, how much time has passed since then, or, better, how long you have until your kerbals suffer from it. \n\nHere, my kerbals are seconds from dying, after EC ran out \u00222 days ago\u0022:\n\n![WV1ATvU.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/WV1ATvU.jpg?1)\n\nMy suggestion is to add a bit of code to the Sup timer. If you run out of EC but have supplies, the timer turns BLUE and starts to count down from your currently set Supply Time.
