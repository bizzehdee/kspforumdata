My best so far was been 2 out of three. The claws were attached to 3 docking ports which i was planning to use an anchor for a base structure. However i seem to have the same problem there.\n\nAre there any mods where docking ports and claws don\u0027t stop trying to attach after the entities are merged? Something that would enable make a ring of docking ports without relying on perfect coordination and luck."}]}
