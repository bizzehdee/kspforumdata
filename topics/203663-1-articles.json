Imagine a planet where cloud cover is such that you can\u0027t use solar panels. At least you could build a wind turbine, which is a challenge in itself to maintain and control.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso ... sail a ship to conserve energy on Laythe.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving the ability to make wind turbines and sailing ships would be awesome! It would be fairly easy to model a global prevailing wind pattern that includes equatorial doldrums, low-latitude trade winds, and mid-latitude westerlies.\u00A0 To make it more interesting, within a given physics bubble the speed and direction of these could perhaps change fairly slowly and within certain constraints that depend on the location.\u00A0 In such a scheme the equatorial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E launch site would also naturally have very little or no wind, although for rocket launches and the typical wind speeds that I would envisage, I don\u0027t think they\u0027d represent much of a problem anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-12T18:22:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2021 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-12T21:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor anyone who hasn\u0027t seen in, there was a preview of clouds (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/201418-show-and-tell-clouds/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E) for KSP 2 (a serious preview, not just the April fool\u0027s joke).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also like the idea of wind to enable windmills, sailboats, and to make airplane and parachute landings more interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP does not have any random events (for the most part) and that seems to fit KSP being a game that rewards planning.\u00A0 So maybe should be predictable, such as winds that come up in the afternoon, but are calm every night and every morning.\u00A0 Then if weather does affect a launch to rendezvous with an orbiting station, it could make an interesting choice between flying through the weather, or waiting and then doing the required orbital maneuvers to meet the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarlier discussions of weather in KSP 2 (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/188798-weather-and-weather-effects-discussion/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/201935-weather-in-ksp-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/196060-weather-seasons-and-side-effects/page/2/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/199087-weather/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
