But lately Mechjeb behaves strange. The ascent guidance works ok untill cirkularization. Mechjeb controlls the wessel all the way up, then warps to apoapsis, and then does nothing. Same goes for all the space features, like randevouse autopilot, maneuver node autopilot, Smart ass. If i plan maneuver trough mech jeb and hit create and execute, it sets the node, but thats all. if i point the ship to right directon manually mechjeb will fire main engine, but allways owershoots, and i have to constantly correct its course manualy because mechjeb refuses to steer the blasted thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame goes for Smartass.
