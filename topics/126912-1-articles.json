If you have infinite time ahead of your launch you can send your tank via ion-drive and solar, even using an photon-impulse drive (CFG mod a light) to get the tank into orbit at the destination. It only needs solar panels, a small drive, do a little oberth affect around some planets, a reaction wheel. If you have it use a mech-jeb unit, and whatever antennas are needed.
