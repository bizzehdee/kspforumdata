At this point TOTALLY stoked about using my high end simming gear in KSP finally, especially with TrackIR\n\nLoad into game... All my graphics setting have been dumped... ...? I return to the menu and correct. I ensure ALL my settings are saved. \n\nLoad into game again, fly for a bit, crash into ground. That was fun! Revert to launch and.... Crash to desktop... ...?\n\nRELOAD game. All graphics and inputs dumped. . . ...\n\nFix...\n\nReload into game. All Joystick and throttle inputs unresponsive despite being bound. Again, .... I navigate to the game menu from in the sim and check inputs, but of course I cannot access them. When I click on Settings the graphics resolution flips its $%# and goes to a weird windowed version with a jacked up resolution that doesn\u0027t let me even reach the menu to exit. \n\nReboot PC, restart game, rebind EVERYTHING. Go fly again and crash... \n\nRevert to launch. Everything works! Land and revert to launch again, crash to F$@#%$# desktop. \n\nReload sim and EVERYTHING IS FORGOTTEN AGAIN. \n\nBASH HEAD ONTO DESK \n\nThis is disappointing and EXTREMELY frustrating.\n\n\\*UPDATE-\n\nNow the game randomly freezing when I click to put input into the \u0022Yaw\u0022 command, and not I cannot click ANY binding on any menu. What a hot mess this game is. . .\n\n\\*UPDATE 2\\* The game fails to remember ANYTHING I have configured (yes I am hitting apply AND accept) and is dumping all my settings each time I restart it and even reboot PC. IT STILL will not let me bind the \u0022Yaw\u0022 axis even after a reboot and fresh start. We are very quickly approaching the point of uninstalling here, I am pissed.\n\nIt my joysticks (at least for ONE of the glitches). If I plug them in and bind them, the darn game forgets ALL settings (graphics and all) next time I restart. If I unhook all joysticks, it at least remembers the graphics settings. TOTALLY unacceptable for a game built around flying, and that has supposedly including joystick support for ages. \n\nUninstalling until I KNOW this is fixed. What a joke man. These types of issues have zero place in a full release. . .\n\nNOTE- The above is from me venting in General Discussion, I have uninstalled the game and have no intention of playing without joysticks in a game that should absolutely 100% support joysticks properly..."},{"CreatedByName":"Asharad","CreatedById":107448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T02:43:09Z","Content":"**Which information should your support request have?**\n\n- **KSP version** including Windows, Mac, or Linux, 32 or 64-bit, and if it\u0027s Steam\n- A detailed list of **system specifications**\n- Are you running a **clean installation**, or have you updated and some of your persistence or craft files might be older versions, **if so which version(s)**"},{"CreatedByName":"JG_Wentworth","CreatedById":90801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T04:06:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Which information should your support request have?**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - **KSP version** including Windows, Mac, or Linux, 32 or 64-bit, and if it\u0027s Steam\n\u003E - A detailed list of **system specifications**\n\u003E - Are you running a **clean installation**, or have you updated and some of your persistence or craft files might be older versions, **if so which version(s)**\n\nI\u0027ve uninstalled this broken game, so I won\u0027t be bothering to get all that info.

The reality is without further info this thread will just sink to the bottom :-/\n\nI know it was mentioned in the general chat thread, but without further specs, nothing will be done about this problem. Especially since it could very well be **your** problem. A developer can\u0027t look at a wall of text with no specifics and suddenly have clarity on the issue at hand, and stubbornly uninstalling the game and crossing your arms until the issue is \u0027resolved\u0027 is an excellent way to have you and your issue simply disappear. Yes the game has issues and yes it doesn\u0027t meet certain expectations of quality but all the ways to handle it this particular way seems most inefficient.\n\n*inb4squadshill/fanboy/cheerleader/etc*"},{"CreatedByName":"Asharad","CreatedById":107448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T10:45:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve uninstalled this broken game, so I won\u0027t be bothering to get all that info.

Every game that I\u0027ve played has a support forum for people like you to post their problems, in detail, in order to get the problems fixed. \nTl;dr - If you want this fixed, you need to calm down and offer up some information.
