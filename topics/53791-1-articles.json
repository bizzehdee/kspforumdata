Still, though, one of the things that would have made one of the first impressions of the game a bit nicer would have been the ability to activate the SAS via clicking on the \u0027SAS\u0027 light off of the NavBall (RCS would be nice for them too). I know, we all know better - being that I imagine anyone reading this has been playing for a while - but I do know it would make life easier for a minute or two for people who are new to the program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Just a thought,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECannonFodder_833\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Steve)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nWwkPtm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nWwkPtm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T16:45:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T16:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, good idea.
