I don\u0027t have it down to a science, and I probably never will. It\u0027s not as exciting to me if everything is calculated. The fun with this game is that it has the semi-realistic physics mixed with the cartoonish characters and a layer of unlimited Redo\u0027s!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t wait to meet some of you and see what new and exciting features lay ahead!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ryan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boosterspice","CreatedById":58629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T15:04:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings Ryan!

I\u0027ve always been more of a vanilla gamer, wanting to play games in only their purest forms, no matter how buggy or unromantic, but I might try a few here.
