Without new features the players ksp2 already has will continue to dwindle, and these metrics are important for both being able to track bugs and also potentially take two support. But without bug fixing they can\u0027t maintain a playerbase for long. Its a tight rope to walk, though personally I dont think we should get science before heating, I dont think we need a perfectly solid and mostly bug free game before science, but I do think we should at least have the foundations of one before science.
