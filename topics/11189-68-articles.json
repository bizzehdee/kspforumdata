One is a contender for lightest SSTO space plane. The album below has many pics of interest and some which document what I write below.\n\nEDIT - These were flown in .90 (Probably obvious by the time you see the docking target ship)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/RUHut)\n\n**MicroJet 1.2.**  Mass on runway ready for takeoff, 2.543 ton. To get the pilot aboard, rather than the hassle of a crewed rover near the runway for every flight, attempt, I used a subassembly of ladders and Mk1 pod coupled to one of the jet\u0027s engines. After climbing the ladders to get aboard, that subassembly was decoupled (mass of decoupled subassembly not included in takeoff mass).\n\n![UFDnP1K.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UFDnP1K.jpg)\n\nIt flew to a 136 km orbit, with 311 ms dV left.\n\n![UePfr5P.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UePfr5P.jpg)\n\nLanded safely at KSC.\n\n![svPT2Ja.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/svPT2Ja.jpg)\n\n**Second Ship: MicroJet RSC-dock.** It is the above modified with RCS and a docking port, and other tweaks. Mass ready for takeoff, 2.662 ton\n\n![Bc1rE2J.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Bc1rE2J.jpg)\n\nAfter circularization burn, 388 ms Dv left. 95 km orbit. \n\nIt docked with a big SSTO spaceplane. The album has many interesting pics of it with that big Space Plane and others.\n\n![gCPedb7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gCPedb7.jpg)\n\n![obqtdnd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/obqtdnd.jpg)\n\nThe MicroJet RCS-Dock had 325 ms of DV left after undocking, 189 ms left after deorbit burn. Landed safely, with 122 ms dV of fuel left (for rocket mode)\n\n**Next, MicroJet Dock 3.**  It is a version of the above ship, modified to carry three 3 Kerbals. Mass at take-off of 3.054 ton. I know, no official category for lightest that carries three. \n\n![N5duV46.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/N5duV46.jpg)\n\nFlew to an 88.6 km orbit, then waited for a rendezvous with the big SSTO space plane in a 75 km orbit. It only had 261 ms of dV left, so the small difference in orbital altitudes helped reduce the amount needed for rendezvous.\n\nIt docked with the big SSTO Space Plane. And yes, on the previous flight, that was a 3-Kerbal MicroJet docked to the front. In game-play the \u0022second flight\u0022 documented above was flown after this one, but I wanted to present them in order of ship creation.\n\n![9qodFdy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9qodFdy.jpg)\n\nMany more pics in the album, including EVA\u0027s. I know the big SSTO Space Plane won\u0027t count for anything until I document it\u0027s flight from start to safe landing, and that the Mun Lander won\u0027t count for anything more than a \u0022payload\u0022 once released since the SSTO only delivers it in LKO. \n\nAfter the spaceparty was over, MicroJet 3 undocked and landed safely back at KSC. I was concerned about not having enough fuel left, but had a lot of RCS left. So I used only the RCS for a retro \u0022burn\u0022 on the other side of the planet, to lower the periapsis enough to cause a slow gradual re-entry (the 75 km orbit for rendezvous also helped a lot). I used MechJeb\u0027s projected landing distance error to help get it close. So, it did not use a drop of rocket fuel to re-enter, only RCS monopropellant. And it landed safely.\n\n**Final ship, new album, Corvette R6 Payload:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/jIKB8)\n\nFor purists who not only want to have their Kerbals inside of a pod/cockpit, and prefer something that looks more \u0022realistic\u0022 and sleek, then here is a sporty 2-seater. Corvette R6, with Payload. It does not climb as fast as the MicroJet, but is not skittish and has plenty of fuel to get to a nice orbit with enough Delta-V left (600 or more, I think one really good jet climb had nearly 700 dV left over) and way plenty monopropellant to rendezvous and dock. \n\nIt handles very nicely, good control response. Sometimes on landing it may be a bit nose-heavy, I transfer remaining fuel to the aft 100 liter tank to move the CG back. The wings provide a lot of area, allowing it to have a pretty decent glide, or requiring less throttle to maintain altitude.\n\nThis one is not a record setter, as it is over 6 tons (6.237). So, it\u0027s shown \u0022for fun\u0022, and to officially do a flight that took off with a payload, released the payload, then recovered the payload and brought it back. It also handles well for docking maneuvers. \n\n![yLHKxCj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yLHKxCj.jpg)\n\nIn addition to the \u0022official\u0022 flight, I did some more. Docked two of them. And a bit more fun. See the album. Below, a pic of all of the SSTO\u0027s above, and a few more. \n\n![KhjDKbl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KhjDKbl.jpg)\n\nAlso, had one of the craziest incidents (bug) right after landing the last \u0022plane\u0022\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.. a big BANG.... but it wasn\u0027t my fault.

So, huge wings, and only 8 engines to propel the Meridian Aerospace HSP-1 Svadilvari into a low Kerbin orbit with 27,2 tonnes of payload. Considering her nearly week long development time, I thought I should enter her for my first ever K-prize entry! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nWent up, dropped payload off into a roughly 75\\*80 km orbit and returned to land at KSC\u0027s runway. Didn\u0027t touch a single drop of my payload\u0027s fuel and oxidiser. \n\nOk, time for some numbers:\n\n8,6 meters high\n\n26,1 meters long\n\n53(!) meters wide\n\n34,9 tonnes dry weight without payload\n\n71,9 tonnes fully fuelled\n\n67,8 tonnes fuelled for this flight, minus payload\n\n95,1 tonnes take-off weight for this flight, with 27,2 tonnes of payload.\n\n99,2 tonnes maximum take-off weight (as far as I\u0027ve tested).\n\n4 turbojets and 4 RAPIERS for about 800 kN of take-off thrust, and 1660 kN max thrust (which is quite modest for a spaceplane this size I believe). And yes, she takes off with a TWR of only 0,84:1 . Max TWR at 1000 m/s is probably somewhere between 1,8:1 and 2:1. An approximate Lift to Weight Ratio of around 0,66:1. \n\nNote, I ran a little low on oxidiser due to me being stingy and thinking I had enough aboard. I therefore ran a little short on my deorbit burn and had to turn around and land from the other side. Other than that, no incidents. The extra 4 tonnes of she could take off with is pretty much all room for oxidiser. \n\nShe\u0027s slow, but she\u0027ll get the job done!\n\nNote, Svadilvari was an absurdly strong giant horse from Norse mythology. He\u0027s Sleipnir\u0027s daddy (Sleipnir being Odin\u0027s horse, and for those unfamiliar, Odin being the chief Deity of Norse Mythology). \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I am afraid your craft and GeorgeG\u0027s triple decker undoubtedly ran into a bug. It has happened before and the precedent is that you get a gatecrasher report link. The option exists that if you complete the mission from a save or rerun it without incident you can have a party guest list link for the successful mission and the gatecrasher link removed, your call.
