The Interstage Decoupler model is different, but I don\u0027t expect this to be on any active ship which isn\u0027t in the process of launching, and therefore not likely to be affected.\n\nThe shroud will not currently appear until you attach something to the bottom of the adapter. Originally the shrouds were part of the multinode unit models themselves, however the ModuleResourceConverter on the AHMS units conflicts with any other module that uses staging commands (engines and fairings). This is a stock conflict that cannot be corrected without using a plugin. To get around it, I had to use this slightly wonky design. Making the shroud appear when attaching the top node of the decoupler to the Multinode part results in the shroud sticking to that part instead of the decoupler. Making them explosively decouple from everything had the unfortunate tendency of ripping engines off with it. Thus, I was left with making them appear on the bottom node. This way when the decoupler is jettisoned, it takes the shroud with it. \n\nThey work the same as the engine shroud/fairings you see on most engines. It\u0027s just a hidden mesh inside the model that only appears when something triggers the proper node."},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T07:59:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The shroud will not currently appear until you attach something to the bottom of the adapter.
