This Kole, he carried a tattoo of a Kraken on the back on his right hand. The Kraken\u0027s body was centered in the middle of his hand, while the tentacles formed a protective shield around the Kraken and a miniature ocean drawn inside the Kraken. This was another indicator of his weary mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, you could have never seen the picture of the Kraken because the hand was moving so fast. Bullets punched through the un-dead agents of evil, knocking parts off them until one by one they crumpled into the dust. The gunslinger observed the bones as they withered away in the sunlight. It could have been his bones that withered if it wasn\u0027t for his guns.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stooped down and eagerly lapped up the water like a dog.

The tower would solve all of their problems, for it was the tower of the Kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was the last of the gunslingers, or so he thought. All he knew was that he went travelling into the eastern mountains, and then after a year of hiking and travelling he returned. He expected to find his wife at his home. He expected to find his father in the throne room. He expected to kiss his kerbling daughter good-night and bear hug his eldest son.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe returned to ruin and despair.\u00A0He wept over the mauled bodies of his family, then he swore revenge on what ever caused it.

He attempted to resist it, but it felt too good to let go of the world for a few hours. Suddenly he jerked himself forward. A root of the tree had snared his leg. He drew his pistols and fired at the root. It shattered, so dry it disappeared\u00A0in a shower of splinters. The tree groaned, then screamed.

On the far side of the lake, a town stood. It looked partially inhabited, most of the buildings being shacks built up next to a large tower. The tower looked ancient, its broken glass windows stretching up into the sky. A sky-toucher they called them. Left over from the technological civilization\u00A0that lived on the Green World.

Their howling grew closer and closer, as if they were circling the village. The Mun was extra-ordinarily dark for such a color. A cold wind swept down from the north, bringing cold sleet in droves. The gunslinger didn\u0027t mind the cold, but the icy rain was very uncomfortable. It was also bad for his guns. He stored them away in his tattered cloak, hoping that they would stay dry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen he saw them. Large red eyes, moving around and around the village. Stalking, looking for prey. Looking for kerbal flesh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKoland eyed them, waiting for one to spring out at him. The Mun\u00A0rose to full height, staring down at the village surrounding the sky-toucher. The wolves stopped their circling. A heart-shattering howl broke the stillness. The north-wind stopped, and the sleet ceased. The ground shook beneath the moon. Then they started bounding towards the village. Koland drew his guns and fired at the one closest to him. This was when he realized that they wolves weren\u0027t normal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese wolves bounded ten feet above the ground, their jaws glistening with overly large canine teeth. Koland fired once more, the bullet barely making any wounds on their impenetrable coats. The one he was firing on turned towards him, and howled a question to the Mun. The Mun gave its assent, and the wolf charged Koland. Koland waited for the last second, the dove out of the way of the charging canine, guns firing at its head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wolf didn\u0027t even wince in pain. It turned around, skidding in the muddy ground. It found its feet and started to charge towards Koland again. A little metal something was on top of the head, facing him. Koland didn\u0027t hesitate to shoot it. The bullets found this mark, and the wolf collapsed. The other 8 wolves took notice and turned from their attack on the village.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go to hell\u0022 muttered Koland as he fired at the oncoming wolves. The metal hats or whatever they were, now were visible. Koland fired his guns, then was rewarded with the click from hammer. He swore to himself, as he reloaded his guns wasting vital seconds. He fired through his ammo, taking down 7 of the 8 wolves as they approached. The last one was almost upon him, as his guns run out of shells for the second time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned to run for the Oasis. He only made it a couple steps before he was kicked onto the ground by the wolf\u0027s rising paw. He was flung onto the ground. He rolled over not a second too soon as the wolf\u0027s massive jaws missed him. He hit one of his guns against he leg of the beast. It didn\u0027t even feel it. The wolf\u0027s jaws were about to snap him up as he leaped up. The jaws swallowed him up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wolf shook his head, trying to swallow the pesky little morsel that was stuck in his throat. Suddenly eight shots fired from the interior of the beast. The wolf groaned as it fell down to Kerbin. Dead. It took Koland working at least 10 minutes before he could cut his way out of the wolf\u0027s throat. The wolf\u0027s saliva gnawed at his body and clothes, and he quickly jumped into the lake after getting out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen he exited the lake, dripping wet, the villagers were all standing around, looking at the dead wolves in fascination.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What are these, Gunslinger?\u0022 asked the same little kerb who brought him there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKoland looked over the carcasses, then he examined the head of the last one he killed. The metal hat which he used the kill them, was still activated on this one. It wasn\u0027t as small as he thought it was, but it wasn\u0027t very large either. Little did he know that he was looking at a receiving dish, attached to a robotic creature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, after wrestling the metal hat off the head of the creature, a little transcription appeared on the side of the head.
