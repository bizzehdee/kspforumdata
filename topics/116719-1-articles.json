While burning the H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO on Pluto would probably cause it to leave the solar system, it would be hundreds of thousands of years before we reached Kepler 452-B. It would probably be better to bring some form of propulsion instead. Ion engines would be nice and efficient, but since you\u0027re suggesting a hare-brained scheme already, I\u0027d go with Project Orion-style nuclear bombs pushed out of the back. That way, any unexploded bombs left at the end of the mission would also put a *little* more kick into the explosion.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 A good knowledge of Kepler 452-B\u0027s population and climate. Does Kepler 452-B actually have any creatures on the surface: it too hot or cold for anything other than extremophilic bacteria? We\u0027d also need to know that there was a species on Kepler 452-B that *really* needed to die. \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 A good knowledge of what happens after large impacts. I understand that Kepler 452-B would lose most of its existing species, whatever they were. But would it ever cool down (or at least, cool down in less than a few million years) from a Charon-sized impact?\n\nIf we had all of these things (and all of this knowledge), I would say go for it! It would give us a very good sense of Pluto\u0027s geology, it would give us humans another world to live on, and best of all, it would mean the end of all of these worthless is-Pluto-a-planet debates.\n\nI\u0027d be willing to give you seven Nobel Peace Prizes, a million bajillion dollars, and a pony for this idea. I\u0027m sure I stashed all of that stuff somewhere... ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T23:46:44Z","Content":"no direct profit ? who will do something like that seriously xDr"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T06:58:51Z","Content":"New plan: Bring every dwarf planet in the solar system as well as all their moons into one spot, and then merge them together into one single planet, and then claim that it\u0027s too big not to be a planet."},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T07:33:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E New plan: Bring every dwarf planet in the solar system as well as all their moons into one spot, and then merge them together into one single planet, and then claim that it\u0027s too big not to be a planet.\n\nthen ram that into the first aliens we see."},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T00:05:09Z","Content":"i m not sure he will be aggree xDr\n\n[![UBkSyMSt.png](http://i.imgur.com/UBkSyMSt.png)](http://imgur.com/UBkSyMS)\n\n(i\u0027m holding this one since a few day seem to fit in here xDr )"}]}
