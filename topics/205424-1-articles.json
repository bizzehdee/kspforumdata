When this is designed and the game comes out, or earlier if possible(maybe for testing purposes. \u0026gt;\u0026gt;), could these features be put into ksp1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheOrbitalMechanic","CreatedById":216179,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-29T17:19:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI doubt it. KSP 2 is a complete remake/rebalance of the game\u0027s engine, which wouldn\u0027t be possible in KSP 1 without remaking the game, which was the point of KSP 2 in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
