I have an integrated Intel GPU (and before you go \u0022oh, that\u0027s your problem there, git a gud card skrub,\u0022 note that I had a perfectly fine framerate with Scatterer in 1.1.3) so I\u0027m concerned about ways the mod may have become more graphically demanding and whether it\u0027s possible to re-optimize back from that.\n\u003E \n\nAbsolutely nothing changed and I\u0027m getting the same performance on my laptop. Disable features one by one until you find the performance hit.\n\nAlso, on integrated you probably shouldn\u0027t use the ocean shaders at all."},{"CreatedByName":"ssd21345","CreatedById":146209,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-08T13:02:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 10/7/2016 at 8:00 PM, cy4n said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E None of the effects show up using the latest prerelease.\n\u003E \n\nDid you get the fixed .dll?    \n\nIt fixed the start-up scatterer  settings gui and disappeared water for me."},{"CreatedByName":"cy4n","CreatedById":185531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-08T13:03:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, ssd21345 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Did you get the fixed .dll?    \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It fixed the start-up scatterer  settings gui and disappeared water for me.\n\u003E \n\nOh, that fixed it, thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Cheesecake","CreatedById":138400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-08T18:08:31Z","Content":"I have the same issue: Newest Build of KSP and newest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E.
