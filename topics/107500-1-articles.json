They\u0027re not overly serious, but they do need considering ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**The Island Runway:**\n\nI\u0027d like to think this one is already known about, but I\u0027m posting it anyway. The whole runway set-up is floating a bit above the island it\u0027s supposed to exist on.\n\n\u003E [![8xGljKy.png](http://i.imgur.com/8xGljKy.png)](http://imgur.com/8xGljKy)\n\nIf some poor sod decides to try and fly under that... I shudder to think of the consequences that would arise. Not to mention it\u0027s ugly. Dangerous and ugly, not a good combo.\n\n**Heat shield fairings:**\n\nI haven\u0027t seen mention of these anywhere, but their sheer hideousness needs looking at. I thought at first it might just have been the Mk1-2 Pod being awkward, but this happens with every heat shield.\n\n\u003E [![oln8oyL.png](http://i.imgur.com/oln8oyL.png)](http://imgur.com/oln8oyL)\n\u003E [![i7LQ5wi.png](http://i.imgur.com/i7LQ5wi.png)](http://imgur.com/i7LQ5wi)\n\nYou can clearly see that the fairings are wider than their supposed diameters, creating that ghastly, jarring un-sleekness. Why couldn\u0027t these be done in the same way as the engine fairings for a much sleeker look? Why, Squad?! WHY?! ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif)\n\n**The RAPIER:**\n\n*Oh no, a controversial one! Grab the fire extinguishers! Get the civilians to the shelters! At least it\u0027s not about the aerodynamics, though... I don\u0027t think the forums could handle another thread about that.*\n\nYou\u0027re going to have to bear with me on this one (![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)), as I\u0027ve decided to talk about the, um... the rather abysmal vacuum ISP of the engine that\u0027s designed to put things into orbit on a single stage. I\u0027ve got little problem with the atmospheric-mode of the engine, that\u0027s fine and dandy, and I\u0027m not massively bothered by the loss of thrust at altitudes of around 20km, but the vacuum ISP is absolutely dreadful for a rocket motor that\u0027s *at the end of the tech tree*. I mean, 305s *maximum??* That seems to be defeating the point of having an engine for the task of putting spaceplanes into orbit, even in the name of balances with regards to the new aerodynamics. I\u0027d have expected one of the most high-tech engines in the game (as mentioned, it\u0027s at the end of the tech tree) to at least be a little more capable in vacuum. The vacuum ISP in 0.90 was around 360s, and that was just about enough, so I think **a value around 330s or 335s for 1.0 instead of 305s would be more appropriate.**\n\nI know, I know, people have made SSTO spaceplanes with RAPIERs in 1.0, but in every instance I\u0027ve seen, they\u0027ve barely had any fuel left for anything once in LKO, and a lot of you will no doubt come along and say \u0027realism, bud; get with it\u0027, and while I agree that\u0027s it probably is realistic (Skylon\u0027s proposed flight profile has the vehicle fire a solid rocket motor in the tail to make the final push into LEO, conserving what little fuel is left for after re-entry), I must say ***nay!*** Squad themselves have stated that KSP is a game first, simulator second, so why would it be beyond reason to expect the RAPIER to perform just a little better than its real-life counterpart? They\u0027ve already done a similar thing with the ion engine, buffing the thrust dramatically compared to reality for gameplay purposes.\n\nYou can\u0027t deny my logic, really. I thought this out too much for you to do that. It\u0027s impossible, so don\u0027t even try ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n-----\n\nThat will be all for now. I\u0027ve got more tests to run concerning my experiment, the results of which I hope to be able to share in a few days at most ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T22:02:30Z","Content":"Yeah, the heat shield aero shells are weird.

I know the Mk1-2 pod is odd, anyway, hence my initial thinking that it must have been that ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nIf it wasn\u0027t an issue, I wouldn\u0027t be bringing it up ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
