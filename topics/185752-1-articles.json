Ie, you cannot pitch/roll/yaw at all?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf so, then either, you have no control signal ( lack of antenna but i suspect this is not the problem, i only tend to need antenna\u0027s\u00A0when I orbit minmus but with the mun launch pad there\u0027s already slightly better signal coverage.) Or lack of power. A manned craft never needs a control signal. Heat and plasma from friction while reentering kerbal might prevent communications too but i never had problems with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can verify wether you have a control signal in the top left corner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you used docking ports and or seperators/decouplers, fuel tends to flow from extremities first. So generally speaking the parts that you\u0027d want to decouple first also get drained first. Some of those parts have fuel crossfeed disabled by default. The docking ports do not if I\u0027m not mistaken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn edge cases it may be possible that the fuel flows in the wrong direction, can be verified by enabling the fuel delivery overlay system ( by opening the settings panel of a fuel tank in the hangar). When using fuel lines it\u0027s worth nothing that those need to be adding in the right direction aswell, they have an arrow indicator that points which way fuel would travel. This should only occur on\u00A0pretty advanced builds though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of the structural platings do allow crossfeed.\u00A0Neither do the metal beams. Some of the struts do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can move fuel manually by holding the left or right trigger(l1/r1 on ps4) while opening the settings for two fuel tanks then you can select from which tank the fuel should come or go to.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do have power, fuel, ability to control... open an engine\u0027s setting and verify if the rocket flamed out. It will tell you what it\u0027s missing if any. If the fuel bars do show fuel but the rocket gets none, then i\u0027m\u00A099% sure the problem lies in your method of construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you build rockets top down or bottom to top? Can make a huge difference as far as i know and it will require you to manually reorganize your stages if you build bottom to top. It\u0027s also somewhat important and related to the root system. Where the first selected part acts as a root part to all other parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried other rockets? Or even the stock crafts and see if any problems exist with them too. That may be the easiest to try out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: you have to hold either l1 of r1 while using dpads to incrementally set throttle. However i kinda suspect you have a power issue. The time it takes to do a revolution around kerbin is long enough to drain some serious juice. Fuel cells need to be activated just like solar panels. Solar panels also may not be obstructed and have to bathe in sunlight in order to work at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding an extra battery and turning off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E when not needed are great ways to prevent these problems early career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-24T09:25:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2019 09:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Cruss\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
