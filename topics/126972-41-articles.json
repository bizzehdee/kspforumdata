Gletrix would circle the bulk of the island they had landed on, verifying the map data\u00A0collected in orbit. On the way back she would head inland to stop at the ground contact their Calcium 7 probe had discovered. The strange probe. If possible she would head down to the lake where the Calcium 7 had been deposited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first landmark she reached was a nice, peaceful-looking bay. She reasoned it might make for a nice place to build a base, with the smooth slopes near the shores and the gentle slopes of the land around it. Perhaps some future crew could make use of it. Maybe even build ships here to sail out into the endless sea. Surely no tsunamis could disturb this tranquil shore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160825_ksp1216_gletrix.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160825_ksp1216_gletrix.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160825_ksp1221_gletrix.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160825_ksp1221_gletrix.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise the flight along the western coastline was remarkably unremarkable, with constant yet inconsistent dunes and bluffs jetting out of the ocean. She cut inland some distance south of the bay, wanting to fly over their mystery probe. No need to fly all the way to the southern tip of the island - nothing to see there except more sands and rocks. Let some future beachgoer leave their footprints there instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe land was beautiful, especially with the noxious air casting it into varying shades of lilac and aquamarine. It was strange to Gletrix how the air could behave so differently here than back on Kerbin. It was essentially the same air, but the presence of just a small amount of sulphur and other poisonous gases twisted it. Made it more attractive yet more deadly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160825_ksp1224_gletrix.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022590\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160825_ksp1224_gletrix.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160825_ksp1227_gletrix.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160825_ksp1227_gletrix.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe came in low over the probe, flying over it several times to get a good view.

How long had it remained there, undisturbed? Laythe was volcanically active, that much they knew. For a small probe such as this to still be upright meant this particular location was relatively safe. Perhaps this island was a good spot for a base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe brought the Aluminium\u0027s systems down, set the brakes, cut the engines, lowered the ladder, and radioed back to the LDAV that she was going on EVA. Macfred advised caution (what else is new?), Agake made her promise to pull any science data the probe might still have. Thomlock asked how his plane was handling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ground was in good shape. These dunes had formed long enough ago that they were starting to settle. The composition felt more like soil than sand, thikcer and heavier than the salt, sand, and ash she had found on the more northern parts of the island. It made walking over to the probe all the easier.

Other paraphernalia suggested it was likely built by the same program, too. Many, many decades previously. The probe\u0027s internal clock suggested it had launched some 42 years and 61 days previous. An ancient artifact, as far as space probes go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe ended up spending several hours with the probe. Agake was trying to run science reports remotely over their tenuous data link, but the probe never responded quite like they wanted. Eventually Macfred authorized her to climb onto the probe to see if she could get into its computer core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat could it hurt?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was really only way to get on top of this thing - climb one of the legs. She checked her footing, checked the ground underneath her chosen leg, then grabbed onto the lowest part of its supports. Just as she put her weight on the leg, the entire thing exploded into a cloud of dust.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore concerning was what happened next. The probe, having sat upright on this dune for 39 or more years, came toppling over towards her.

In the end Agake had her collect several samples of the legs to bring back. None of the rest of the probe was anywhere near as brittle as the legs.

She decided it was best to skip the southern tip of the island and move towards the Calcium probe next. Its final resting place was the lake just to her northeast. Not far away, really, just a few kilometers. She taxied over to the edge of the lake, discovering there was no safe way to get to their Calcium probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161010_ksp0015_gletrix.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022590\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161010_ksp0015_gletrix.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred instructed her to head back to the LDAV.

Thomlock had heard tales of seeing such a thing just after sunset, mostly from old sailors who could barely remember their own name. Was it suppoed to be good luck? An ill omen? Or just the universe\u0027s way of saying \u0022hello\u0022? He couldn\u0027t remember. Stories, all. Yet this flash was real, as were the clouds. The clouds.\u00A0Were the clouds heavier tonight?

This moon was never really dark, at least not where they had landed. Yes, the Sun had gone down, but there was more than enough light to work by thanks to Jool. A yellow glow. A green glow.\u00A0An occasional black dot, shadow cast by one of the many moons. Even the clouds would play with the light, moving in front of the green orb, strange shadows\u00A0playing on the dunes. Wind whispering as it slid over the dim sand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust before sunrise was the only time it was ever truly dark. The sunlight would fall on the lower limb of Jool\u00A0then disappear entirely as they fell into the jolly green giant\u0027s shadow. That was a cold dark, a strange dark. A green ring would shine around their host, casting an eerie light that was neither fitting nor proper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgake and Gletrix were still outside gathering samples when he crawled into the cabin. Nap time. Rest time. He needed rest\u00A0for his flight tomorrow. It was likely to be the longest any of them took while on Laythe, traveling due west and in search of a small probe. Circumnavigating the other large equatorial island.\u00A0And for much of it he would be \u0022in the dark,\u0022 radio-wise. Sure, there would be intermittent contact through their various orbiting satellites, but those would make for very short conversations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe awoke hours later to the sounds of a loud discussion. Agake hadn\u0027t looked up from the microscope since sunset, captivated by the samples of the IPX lander\u0027s legs. Captivated and confused. The lumps of metal had been honeycombed-out by some unknown force. All that was left were very brittle remnants that almost held their shape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix wasn\u0027t helping ease her confusion.

Kids these days, always going on about aliens and gasses and whatnot. He crawled up into the cockpit to find Macfred going over strange readings from their probe orbiting Vall. Apparently there was a structure, or set of structures, somewhere\u00A0in the moon\u0027s southern hemisphere. Macfred was trying to determine if Bob or any of the others at the Edge of Infinity knew anything about it. They suggested aliens. Aliens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlien nonsense.

Even Jeb was getting in on the action, going on about mysterious craft and other unexplainable structures on Kerbin. How he had been zapped up by a weird light and taken into some alien ship.\u00A0Thomlock crawled out to the Aluminium in the pitch black early\u00A0morning just to finish his nap.

The higher he flew to less air there was to hold him back, the further he could fly. The Aluminium\u0027s engines operated better when they were above the troposphere anyway - he had designed the plane for exactly this sort of cruising. From this height the clouds took on a pink, cotton candy look. The ocean was still its soft candy blue. The sky nearly black overhead. He realized he\u0027d skipped breakfast and dug a snack out of the bin. Cotton candy. Figures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix kept him company for the first part of the flight. Their radios worked for a while, not needing line of sight thanks to Laythe\u0027s healthy ionosphere. The further out he went the more noise the radio would pick up though, thanks again to Laythe\u0027s healthy ionosphere. And perhaps a bit to Jool\u0027s. Eventually they hit the limits of their equipment and he was alone. Silence and static. The whispers of the wind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the things he hadn\u0027t anticipated was his speed. Laythe was small enough and turned slowly enough that he could outrun the sunlight. At first he didn\u0027t think this would be much of an issue. Sure, it would be darker when he arrived at the island, but he could land on the beach and enjoy the sunrise one more time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe clouds grew thicker and heavier.

Scary, even. Whispers on the wind, rumbling noises of nothing as heavier air pockets slipped past the aircraft. It was nothing Thomlock hadn\u0027t heard before, but before he had always had someone to talk to. Now the noises were his only friend. At 10 kilometers above the alien waves he really needed something to talk to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe clouds continued to grow heavier and heavier the closer he got to his target. So heavy the he didn\u0027t notice the other island to the south until he drifted over a thinner patch of the clouds. Black landmasses dotted the dark blue ocean, reaching up into the horizons. None of these islands had names. No names that he knew. Even if he named them it was unlikely anyone would remember years from now. Munths from now.

Very weak radio contact, 92km out. The probe. The cloud bank to his North was worrying, but the one in front of him was even moreso. Heavy, orange clouds. Clouds that seemed to glow, and not with the light of the Sun. What was he flying into? The sun was still\u00A0behind him, but was unlikely to be 90km on. He dropped down through the heavy clouds, looking for the shore. Best to land and wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was unnerving, dropping down through a seemingly endless cloudbank to find the ground.

Beneath him spread the shore, rocky and rough. Dunes heaped violently on one another. Nowhere safe to land, best as he could tell. The sun was low on the horizon, the sky itself cast into that familiar range of colors. A heavy haze covered everything, and even at these lower altitudes it was difficult to see. Visibility was next to nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll he could do was push on. Go west, old kerb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe land was blasted and dark, soot and ash mixed in with the sands. Presumably this island was one of the many still active volcanoes, a suspicion somewhat confirmed by the acrid air outside his canopy. He had to climb again, the land rapidly gaining elevation as he progressed westward. The very tip of the ridge was in sunlight, but nothing else. The clouds obscured it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe followed the radar blip and the radio contact to its source, seeing nothing in the pitch black as he flew over. No way he could land here, not even with all the technology in the world. He pulled to the North and headed back for the ridge, hoping to find a spot flat enough to park his plane until sunrise. The ridge itself was the best he could find. He landed,\u00A0drifted\u00A0into the dark, set the brakes, and decided to wait until morning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161017_ksp0266_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022555\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161017_ksp0266_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161017_ksp0298_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022585\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161017_ksp0298_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sky to the north glowed with an unhealthy orange and red hue. He climbed down to collect samples and test the air. Ash settled on his hands as he held them out. Ash made up most of the ground under his feet. The orange glow to the northeast lit the world, casting everything into a flickering glow. Only one word could describe it, this new land he\u0027d discovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHellscape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161017_ksp0312_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161017_ksp0312_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Edge of Infinity circled overhead, granting him a brief radio link back to the LDAV.

The cloud Thomlock had flown through had started as a thin\u00A0gas streak shortly before sunset. Its growth was unexpected.

No doubt they would be able to feel it should it grow to be more.\u00A0A few spots out of their reach had also lit up, as had the aurora at the moon\u0027s poles. For the first time in some many years they were visible during the day instead of just at night.

Even the sides of the hills were on the sides of a hill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe almost missed it. He\u0027d expected to see a craft more like the one Gletrix had found.

Probably some strong gust of wind or a healthy\u00A0storm in the not too distant past had come along, mercifully clearing the solar panels. Granting the probe an extra life. A chance to start up once more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately its clock had reset, and so he had no good idea how old it was. Its electronics were generally in bad shape.
