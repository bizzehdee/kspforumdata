The only problem is with orbital rendezvous. Anytime I set to rendezvous an asteroid or a craft, upon arriving, the other craft shoots away at several thousand m/s. The weird part is that our altitude and velocity match exactly, and our orbit circle aligns perfectly as well. This has happened with an old save and a new career as well. The craft appears for about a second and then disappears flying away. The only thing that sort of works is to match the altitude using \u0027simple\u0027 mode and trying to rendezvous that way.

Previously I was entering large lead times into the orbital rendezvous window to establish triangular orbit around planets for power relay probes. When I did it with the sun, the values required were much greater, 12000 lead time. If you enter too great a value the rendezvous will exceed 360 degrees and continue onto greater sums continuing in the same circular orbit. Somehow this caused the glitch I described. I fixed it by entering a negative lead time value into the window. Now when I establish triangular orbit, I do it through the \u0022visual or complex\u0022 modes by adjusting \u0027lan.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T03:03:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA problem I\u0027ve had using Hyperedit has cropped up with MechJeb build 255 and later is that when I use Hyperedit to take a ship from the pad to orbit, MechJeb\u0027s rendezvous autopilot and maneuver planner cannot correctly control the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027ll do anything except the right thing, most of the time all they do is aim the engine(s) at the body being orbited and barely crack the throttle open. But sometimes it will start to do the maneuver and burn correctly but at the last bit of the burn will cut throttle to idle and aim the thrust downward. Some times it will just go to a full throttle escape trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried putting ships on the pad with and without launch clamps.

If I fly to the destination without using Hyperedit at all, MechJeb works correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if there\u0027s something new that .23.5 does with a normal launch that Hyperedit is missing with just teleporting off the pad, and it\u0027s confusing MechJeb?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s acting like the KSP .23 bug where it (KSP not MechJeb) wasn\u0027t correctly setting control to a part after decoupling or undocking so the player had to manually set control from here for Mechjeb to control the ship. That is NOT what is causing this issue. Manually setting control from here doesn\u0027t change anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow I happened upon this is I have a Kethane mining lander using Infernal Robotics parts. Since IR .16 is going to completely replace all the old parts, and KSP .23.5 already broke old ships with IR (unless some heroic persistent file editing is done *before* flying any ship with old IR parts), I wanted to salvage the 32K Kethane in the lander\u0027s tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunched it to a 20KM Mun orbit then built a recovery tanker and flew it out to the Mun. Had a brain fart and only gave it 16K capacity. Doh! Since I\u0027d already done the salvage flight I gave myself permission to cheat out a modified tanker with 32K Kethane capacity. That\u0027s when the \u0022fun\u0022 began where I tried many different configurations, then tried just doing rendezvous with the lander using all stock parts ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil then, I had not used Hyperedit at all with .23.5 so I don\u0027t know if MechJeb builds prior to 255, compatible with .23.5, exhibit the same issue. Most of my .23.5 action has been with adding parts to ReStock to work with the Kerbodyne and ThunderMax parts, and the even larger ThunderMaximus parts - and fiddling around with SRB rocket gliders. I hadn\u0027t done a thing outside Kerbin orbit in the latest KSP until attempting the Kethane salvage mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe common thing through all the tests is that unless the ship is properly launched before touching it with Hyperedit, MechJeb can\u0027t control it. I\u0027m pointing the finger of probable cause at something changed in KSP .23.5 since HyperEdit hasn\u0027t been changed and if HyperEdit isn\u0027t used to \u0022launch\u0022, MechJeb works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing I can try is launching then cutting throttle while still in atmosphere then using HyperEdit to put the craft in orbit, see if it\u0027s something to do with using it from within atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T07:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo more tests failed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet a lander with deployed legs to gently drop from a launch clamp with engine running, then cut throttle followed by HyperEdit to 20 KM Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame setup but used MechJeb to launch and at about 3 KM disabled ascent guidance then HyperEdit to 20 KM Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t use RCS but with it on the outcome is no different, failure to work right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn each case I set maneuver planner to change orbit inclination to 2 degrees at the equatorial AN.
