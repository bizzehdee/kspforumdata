It\u0027s only when I go back to the Outpost from the tracking station that it explodes there and then in front of me. The landing is on a slight slope, I\u0027m wondering if when the ship is spawned on that site something is over stressed. Maybe I built the lander wrong. I\u0027m thinking maybe Land a mission nearby to rescue the two Kerbonauts. Though how I\u0027ll get close enough is another problem to solve.
