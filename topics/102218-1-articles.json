So it\u0027s in the future. Someone is trying to land on the Moon. They have retro-thrusters, and as they get close to the surface, they deploy these...parachutes. The dust kicked up from the surface get caught in the parachutes and help in the landing. The guy lands, and tucks them back in the lander. So, what do you think?

I didn\u0027t think about that.\n\nWell, let\u0027s think about this. On earth (or other atmospheric bodies), the \u0027chute is dragging against the air. Since Earth (in this example) has a thick enough atmosphere, that means the chute is encountering a lot of resistance on the way down. Because of the nature of air, it\u0027s constantly affecting the chute. No matter how much air is affected by the chute, there will always be more to replace it. In this case, the chute is being dragged through the air.\n\nNow, on a non-atmospheric body (the Moon) there\u0027s essentially nothing for the chute to drag against. Even if there were dust being kicked up from the boosters, it would never have enough energy or consistency to properly push on the chute. In this case, the chute is not being dragged, but instead pushed against (likely in inconsistent bursts).\n\nAnother way to think of it: drag your hand through water, noting the resistance. It\u0027s consistent and (relatively) strong. If you put a finite amount of energy into your hand, it will be stopped rather quickly. Now if you drag your hand through the air, you\u0027ll notice there\u0027s a huge difference. The air is less consistent and easier to push through, and less energy is required to continue the work.\n\nParachuting on Earth is like dragging your hand through the water. Parachuting on the Moon would be like holding your hand steady and blowing on it. Inconsistent, and too weak to really make a difference.\n\nThe amount of dust you\u0027d have to put in the air would be so much that you might as well just stick to boosters. Plus, it\u0027d be insanely hard to make sure that ALL (or the VAST majority) the dust kicked up goes to the chute, and not just off to the side.\n\nAt least, that\u0027s what I\u0027m thinking. I\u0027m no scientist, though, so I could be wrong.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T20:36:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 08:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T20:33:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I can be done... instead of parachute use solar sail-like materials [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail)\n\u003E Of course before your parachute (solar sail) lading you would have to send drone \u002B power plant \u002B energy canon, so this canon would shoot massive charge and slow down your lander.\n\u003E \n\u003E It would be very expensive, but possible ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nIf you have to land the power plant \u002B cannon to the surface using traditional methods, why not just send the lander instead?"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T20:33:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, let\u0027s think about this.
