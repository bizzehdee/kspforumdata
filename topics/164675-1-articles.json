I\u0027ve dabbled in the past with a bit of modding myself. Though working in any kind of code language just isn\u0027t where my skill set honestly lies. But that\u0027s what made me think about offering up my services here. Though my schedule is a bit tight with all the day to day work I do, I would still love to help build something with your help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would really love to get involved in a mod, where I could provide my services as a graphic designer. In addition to working on \u0027flat\u0027 2D designs, I\u0027ve also worked at a 3D modeler and artist- so I do have a bit of knowledge on that end as well. You can check out my website for more information or examples of my work here at, www.christopherlee.work\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn an ideal world, I would love to see some examples of your previous work, what you\u0027re currently working on, or your intention to work on, and see if we could be a good fit to work together.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bottle Rocketeer 500","CreatedById":178766,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-21T23:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102142-spinomonkey/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022102142\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102142-spinomonkey/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@spinomonkey\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003EHello, I am currently working on a mod which adds the SLS/Orion spacecraft in a stockalike way.

I have only been modding for around 2.5 months, you can take a look at my kerbalized spaceX mod on the forums. In my opinion, you will see I\u0027m a fast learner and somewhat gifted 3d artist. In any case, I have been looking for someone to work with that surpasses my current abilities. Essentially, I\u0027m looking for a mentor/partner. More so a mentor. If you feel like this could be right for you, send me a P.M, and we shall discuss it further. As I said, presently I am working on a spaceX inspired mod. So this would need to be something you are interested in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-22T00:40:04Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2017 12:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by harrisjosh2711\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheRagingIrishman","CreatedById":165004,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-22T02:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow nice portfolio \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102142-spinomonkey/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022102142\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102142-spinomonkey/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@spinomonkey\u003C/a\u003E.
