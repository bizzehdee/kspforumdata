OP, to answer your question. Pre 1.0, I played religiously with mods. All the visual mods I tried, tac life support, KW rocketry, deadly re-entry, alcor capsule, and many others. I had so many it was causing problems for my game\u0027s stability even on Linux. I was also using the outer planets mods for a while although they were a bit too far to reach, I then had to use things like futuristic propulsion but the game was simply getting too deep/complicated at one point for me playing as realistic as possible. I used to play with HyperEdit as well, strictly for testing rockets only, I didn\u0027t use it in a cheaty-fashion. I take (and still do) KSP overly-serious, I try to play with realism, life support mods, and do things in a way where a real spaceflight would be carried out. Unfortunately it cuts into my real life and I had to take a step back and quit getting so deep into a video game!\n\nAs of 1.0, I am trying to remain as vanilla as possible (for the reason above and more). I am only using flight engineer and stage recovery, two mods which I feel should be officially endited into KSP. I\u0027ve only gotten to Duna so far manned with career mode on hard.

The second just enables me to manage multiple flights without ever missing an essential moment like a maneuver node. The third gives me a ping when there is new science to be recieved from a flight; I just wish it would be more customizable, e.g. giving me pings even when on a different flight, and giving me pings even when there is no science to be gotten anymore (important for feeding mobile labs at later stages).\n\nWhat I still want to have is a visual mod which makes Kerbin more \u0022atmospheric\u0022; there are many videos/pictures out there where Kerbin has clouds.\n\nAlso, thinking long way if I just add a kind of life support mod. It just seems weird that a Kerbal can survive stuffed in a Mk1 pod all the 230\u002B days to Duna and beyond.

Whether you get mechjeb or cheat crafts into orbit, I want to know how You mod KSP. How would be nice too! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWelcome aboard!\n\nAnyway, most mods fall into 1 of 3 broad categories:\n\n\\* Parts (bigger, different look, and/or niche-filling)\n\n\\* Gameplay features (\u0022realism\u0022 stuff, tech trees, contracts, resources, increased functionality)\n\n\\* Instrumentation (both for building and flying)\n\nAnd then there are a few special things that really don\u0027t fit the above, plus some tweaks I make myself.\n\nPARTS: Due to 32-bit memory limits, much as I\u0027d like to have scads of other parts, I usually just pick 1 main parts mod and limit it pretty much to just bigger (5m) rocket parts. I rotate around between KW Rocketry, NovaPunch, SXT, and Space-Y Heavy Lifters as the mood strikes me (all are quite good) and they become available for the current game version. I also always get Firespitter but pare it down to just the dll (which I exploit with ModuleManager--see below) pontoons (for boats and seaplanes), and a 1.25m 2-seat cockpit and 1.25m 2-seat passenger bay.\n\nGAMEPLAY: I ALWAYS have some way to refuel my ships. Used to be, that was Kethane, then Karbonite. Now I\u0027m using the stock Ore thing so I don\u0027t currently have a mod for this. Likewise, with the 1.x atmospherics, I no longer have FAR or DRE. Still have SCANsat (best planet-scanner on the market) and I always have KAS (which now requires KIS as well). Finally, I always get DMagic Orbital Science because it\u0027s cool and it\u0027s especially useful now that science rewards have been stripped from the stock career. I\u0027ve messed with life support and decided it really adds nothing to the game that I\u0027m interested in messing with, so I prefer to do without that.\n\nINSTRUMENTATION: I find it highly annoying that stock KSP is so devoid of essential build and flight information so I use MJ for that. I also use MJ to automate all the boring, repetitive tasks I\u0027ve done tens of thousands of times already. What I enjoy about the game is designing something for a specific purpose on another planet and then seeing if it actually works, so it\u0027s the destination that matters to me, not the trip there. I usually have dozens of ships in flight so Kerbal Alarm Clock is essential. Trajectories is a huge help for doing aerobraking. TAC Fuel Balancer is a wonderful time-saver. That\u0027s about it.\n\nSPEcIAL STUFF:\n\nProbably the most important thing to get here is the \u0022Stock Bug Fixes\u0022 pack, which does things like make rover wheel brakes function again ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).\n\nThere are also all kinds of mods that provide different sights and sounds but with the memory limitations, I tend to ignore these. Except for Chatterer, which I just can\u0027t live without ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). Also, TAC Self Destruct is so useful and so much fun that I always have it as well. This eliminates spent stages in orbit, removes unnecessary parts around bases, and in the process provides entertaining explosions ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).\n\nPERSONAL TWEAKS: Thanks to ModuleManager, every player can now easily tweak many aspects of the game to suit himself. So I use this to add MJ and the SCANsat data reader as standard equipment to all probes and pods so I don\u0027t have to add the parts for that. That used to be about all I did here, but in 1.x I\u0027ve also used it to minimize the ridiculous, unrealistic overheating of LV-Ns. I\u0027ve also made ladders more heat-resistant because they have to be stuck on the outside to work at all so tend to get burned off during reentry. This really isn\u0027t a lot--you can do all sorts of things with ModuleManager, which is truly the greatest thing since bottled whiskey. I highly recommend you become conversant with it."},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T13:42:59Z","Content":"In .90 my must haves were mechjeb(for the tediousness) and ker for informational purposes, remote tech since I love building satellites, kerbal alarm clock for the obvious, and interstellar for the power and heat management and also for that super efficient engine.

It helps you line up better so you can understand what being lined up actually looks like.\n\nI do not currently use the following utility mods, however I usually do and will grab them when I start doing larger flotillas (something I enjoy doing).\n\n[Kerbal Alarm Clock](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786-1-0-x-Kerbal-Alarm-Clock-v3-3-1-1-%28May-4%29): This gives you alarms to display notifications, pause the game, or drop you out of time warp depending on what you set. Alarms can cue on SoI change, maneuver nodes, Ap, Pe, AN, DN, close approaches, or a pure time stamp you set. Useful for running many interplanetary missions at once.\n\n[Precise Node](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-1-0-2-Precise-Node-1-1-3-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes): Adds precision maneuver node editing I mostly use it for the ability to change conics modes as I need.\n\n**Parts:**\n\n[Near Future Technologies](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-1-02-Near-Future-Technologies-%28NFSolar-NFSpacecraft-NFConstruction-hotfixed%29/) (all of them): This collection of mods adds analogs to real life electric engines such as VASIMRs, magnetoplasma thrusters, pulsed inductive thrusters, etc. It adds humongous solar panels \u0026 nuclear reactors (w/heating system \u0026 radiators) to power them, and mega batteries and capacitors to keep them fed. It adds heavy girder trusses for large construction, some with fuel in them. It adds a bunch of stuff for building reusable spacecraft like Duna landers and trans-orbit shuttles. In case its not obvious, this is one of my go-tos as soon as I decide to not keep my install as close to stock as possible.\n\n[Stockalike Station Parts Expansion](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814-1-02-Stockalike-Station-Parts-Expansion-%2804-05-2015-CTT-and-minor-fixes%29): Another mod by Nertea (totally not a Nertea fanboy I swear\\*), this one adds a bunch of larger habs, thin structural adapters, tubes, docking ports with intergrated monoprop tanks, and a ton of other stuff for building stations that aren\u0027t just automated fuel depots.\n\n[Cryogenic Engines](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117766-1-02-Cryogenic-Engines-high-Isp-chemical-rockets%21-%2803-05-15-fuel-switch-fix%29): Nertea strikes again with this fairly new mod but it\u0027s now my go-to for putting ANYTHING in space. Where stock engines got robbed of Isp in 1.0, these didn\u0027t. The included fuel switch is also helpful for running the Nerv (full jumbo64 of pure LF anybody?).\n\n[Atomic Age](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104855-1-0-Atomic-Age-Nuclear-Rockets/): Like the Nerv? Wish it was bigger, more efficient, or had more punch? Here, have some more nuclear rocket options. This is by the great Porkjet and includes three new nuclear rockets to add some diversity.\n\n[SpaceY Heavy Lift Parts Pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408-1-0-2-SpaceY-Heavy-Lifter-Parts-Pack-v0-13-%282015-05-09%29): Need more heavy lift capacity than what you can get with the cryo engines \u0026 stock (thats about 200 tons without building like Whackjob)? Grab some bigger tanks and bigger engines, oh and grab some freaking huge SRBs while you\u0027re at it.\n\n[Freight Transport Technologies](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91706-1-0-Freight-Transport-Technologies-v0-4-0-2015-04-27/): Need to move a buncha stuff from A to B? Need to run a heavy load of resources from ground to space? This pack, designed for moving large quantities of assorted stuff, has you covered.\n\n**Game-changers:**\n\n[Karbonite](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89401-24-2-Karbonite-Mineable-Burnable-and-Community-Friendly-0-1-1-2014-08-03): I still use this resourcing mod even after 1.0 because this mod a) provides the fueling options I need for all my Near Future stuffs, ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) it favors ground based infrastructure, and c) I\u0027m relatively familiar with it. It adds more options and I prefer it over stock in a lot of cases.\n\n[Modular/Orbital Kolonization System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588): Adds a TON of stuff for building bases and making them do things. NOt even gonna explain this one, too much to explain."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T16:05:10Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111114-A-Complete-Beginner-s-Guide-Induction-To-Construction](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111114-A-Complete-Beginner-s-Guide-Induction-To-Construction)"}]}
