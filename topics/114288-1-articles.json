Struts between the two tanks, and generally everywhere where I feel it\u0027s needed. Sometimes I needed solid boosters too for the initial lift. Now since 1.0.4 hit, solid boosters feels cheating. It happened to me that I added those for more initial thrust, but I found that I could use them as a first stage without even using the main engines (or maybe using them for gimbaling on 10-20% throttle).\n\nAnyways, that setup is far from being cost or fuel efficient. I use it when I\u0027m done designing my payload and I just want it in space ASAP. It\u0027s ok in a normal career - tech tree is far from done, but I have enough cash to not care if my rocket costs 100K or 300k."},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T07:20:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I could not get the thing to stop swaying no matter how much I reinforced it.\n\nIn addition to reinforcement you can also reduce the cause of the swaying: gimbal and/or reaction wheel force."}]}
