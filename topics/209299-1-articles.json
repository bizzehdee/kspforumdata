But there is a problem, Duna looks terrible. Basically, the only way to describe it is that the orange atmosphere fills the crevasses and makes Duna look like it has bright orange stripes running through it. Also, this might be the reason, but I didn\u0027t use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E to install Scatterer, I just extracted the ZIP File.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminal Gremlin","CreatedById":221533,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-11T02:40:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll i can think what duna looks like is a red and orange marble.
