My only concern is that it has never been listed as a planned feature, and I think omitting them would be a huge mistake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really can\u0027t overestimate how much robotic parts changed gameplay in KSP 1. Before robotic parts there were so many little tasks that you knew you should be able to do but all the solutions seemed really forced and janky. Then Breaking Ground came along and we got such a flood of creativity into the game, and little things like deploying rovers became 10x more natural.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just hope the devs consider this a priority for eventual inclusion. I\u0027m not gonna worry about when, it\u0027s just the if that has me concerned. I hope they don\u0027t underestimate what a game-changer it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
