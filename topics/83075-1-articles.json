I have a pretty heavy mod list, but everything was working until I added Action Groups Extended and Bahamuto\u0027s Dynamic Parts. At first the game crashed trying to load the VAB, then I tried again and it seemed to work, but trying to launch I got this bizarre situation showing some of the atmosphere effects from EVE but no Kerbin, no ship, no keys related to ship control doing anything (still had a navball), no escape menu (escape just seemed to pause it) and a map view centred on the sun that refused to move regardless of time passing. No way to do anything except hard kill the game with no crash log.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI removed those two mods, but apparently they\u0027ve written to some file somewhere and this horrible change has been made permanent, so basically I\u0027d like to know what files I might be able to delete or revert to their original state, such at toolbar settings or stuff module manager might have changed and not changed back with a hard quit, that sort of thing. I have so many mods it\u0027d be a real pain to have to re-install all of them in a new, clean KSP install. I\u0027m going to try startign a new save to see if that makes any difference to the inability to launch anything, thinking perhaps it\u0027s the save that\u0027s broken (which luckily doesn\u0027t have a lot in it, since I was just using it to try out new mods and see how stuff works in a sandbox game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFixed: The problem was not the mods but the ship I was using, which was built using an assembly for the first piece.

Would there be any mods that would be good to re-install, possibly writing over anything that was changed? I\u0027d be surprised if Bahamuto\u0027s parts were the problem, but oddly they never showed up in the VAB, either. Once I removed AGExt and the dynamic parts, there were a LOT less things modified by MM at the start screen - 600-odd instead of over 1000. I thought that would do the trick, and that the problem was with AGExt not playing nice with something, but with both those mod folders deleted the game is still completely whack, as above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T19:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest way to install mods is by hand, About all Mod-Installers just lead to problems on how some mods folders are and they would add like more then 1 copy of ModuleManager with diffrant # that\u0027s bad sorry can\u0027t help you more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT- Did you check your log file to see if maybe you can pinpoint it ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlammo!","CreatedById":63139,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T19:18:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI DO install mods by hand.
