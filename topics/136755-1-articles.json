That vessel, after landing on the Moon, has enough resources to rover around different biomes for a few days, then decouple just the top with enough fuel to come back to Earth. Game crashes once after launch, once after landing on the Moon, once on the return home and once after landing back, all of that with textures 1/8. I can\u0027t wait to have all these mods working with KSP 1.1, enough of crappy textures and having to pass out on so many awesome mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
