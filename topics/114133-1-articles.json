I\u0027ve been trying to dock these for about half an hour, and the just don\u0027t want to. My question is, what did I do wrong? Are these ships simply way too big for docking with a regular-size pod (The fuel tanks in the \u0022Gas Station\u0022 are almost full, thats 9 of the biggest tanks there are). Or do I have to get them perfectly aligned in a line? My understanding was that magnets in the docking ports pull these ships together?\n\nOr did I do something else wrong?

Try using node attachment only (hold down alt when plaving the part).\n\nMechJeb\u0027s SmartASS will continue to hold orientation even if you switch to a different craft.\n\nA very easy way to dock is to have MJ on both craft set to Target\u002B, and target each other\u0027s docking ports.

It allows you to place RCS thrusters so you get minimal torque when you try to translate. Looking at your craft on the right, you\u0027ve got a 3-symmetry vehicle with 2 thrusters on your outriggers and what looks like 1 band of thrusters on the center - that\u0027s gotta be a PITA to align.

It IS hard.\n\nFirst, you need to align the plane so that the ports are flush with each other. There\u0027s no chance for them to catch at that angle. Then bring your craft from the front - moving in sideways often doesn\u0027t work. Then, once the magnets start pulling, disable all RCS and SAS and don\u0027t touch anything. The magnets may need a while to align you right.\n\nAlso: Set the port as target, your port as \u0022control from here\u0022. Move a good bit back. Align the angle to be flush, then start moving towards the port slowly, and using H,J,K,U (translation controls) chase the \u0022prograde\u0022 marker in the navball to be squat in the middle of the \u0022target\u0022 marker.

You can tell if it\u0027s on because the control-status indicators at bottom left will change to cyan instead of their usual red.\n\nFine-control mode makes all the rotate/translate controls much more \u0022gentle\u0022, which is useful in and of itself for docking. But even if you have a surgeon\u0027s touch on the controls and scoff at the need for \u0022fine control\u0022, this mode gives an extra bonus when you\u0027re using RCS thrusters to adjust your velocity:\n\nIn the usual default mode, each RCS thruster is either \u0022completely on\u0022 or \u0022completely off\u0022; there\u0027s no in-between. This means that if your RCS thrusters aren\u0027t completely symmetrical around your center of mass, then every time you try to thrust laterally, it\u0027s going to induce some rotation (which your ship will then have to compensate for via SAS). This makes handling clunkier and wastes monopropellant.\n\nHowever, when you turn on \u0022fine control\u0022, your RCS thrusters do something special: they turn on proportional thrust so that you get error-free lateral thrust. This makes for stable, rotation-free lateral thrusting, which gives better control and saves monopropellant.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a long skinny craft, and one ring of 4 thrusters up at the front end, and one ring of 4 thrusters at the back end. Also suppose that your CoM isn\u0027t in the middle, but is actually towards the back of the craft.\n\nIf you try thrusting sideways without fine-control on, then *all* the thrusters (front and back) fire sideways at full power. But since the back end of the craft is heavier than the front end, that means that the ship is going to torque; the RCS thrusters are not just pushing the ship sideways, they\u0027re also trying to rotate it in the direction you\u0027re thrusting. Then SAS kicks in to correct (which will use RCS since it\u0027s turned on, which in turn wastes monopropellant).\n\nOn the other hand, if you thrust sideways **while fine-control is on**, then the RCS control system automatically calculates the needed thrust based on the positioning of your thrusters around your center of mass. In this case, it will fire the front-end RCS ports at a lower power than the back-end ports (since the front end of your ship is lighter). Result: the ship moves perfectly sideways, without any torquing. Better control, and no wasted monopropellant."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T22:19:07Z","Content":"Fine control RCS drives me crazy!

I had the impression that sometimes my craft starts spinning when translating and sometimes it doesn\u0027t, but I couldn\u0027t understand why. This is probably the reason.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind-- even though fine control mode certainly helps, there\u0027s no substitute for having a properly-designed ship that makes at least a half-way reasonable distribution of RCS thrusters around the CoM. If things are too lopsided, fine-control mode may not be able to help you.\n\nThe auto-thrust-adjusting feature can only really help you if you happen to have thrusters on both sides of your CoM (so that it has something to balance). If your thrusters are hopelessly placed, it can\u0027t help. For example: Imagine you have a long, skinny ship, and a ring of RCS thrusters at one end, *and no RCS thrusters at the other end.* Your CoM is way offset from your RCS thruster ring, with no balancing RCS thruster ring on the other side. In that scenario, fine-control\u0027s auto-balance feature is helpless.\n\nMoral of the story: place your RCS thrusters well.\n\nIf you have a reasonably compact shape (i.e. isn\u0027t long and skinny), like a lander, then aim for a single group of 4 thrusters in a ring, which is centered as closely as possible on the craft\u0027s CoM.\n\nIf you have a long, skinny shape, put a ring of RCS thrusters at each end. Ideally with the CoM halfway in between them. If the CoM is significantly off from halfway, then fine-control mode will help you with that, but you can make its job easier by shifting thrusters around to be more symmetrical around CoM."},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T12:18:46Z","Content":"Well, I\u0027m about to be the weirdo that actually knew that Fine Control provides RCS thrust balancing, but is still super happy to read that thread because he finally found out WHICH IS THE GODDAMN FINE CONTROL BUTTON!
