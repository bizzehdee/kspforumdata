As the thrust of a turbojet is around 110 kN at sea level, that usually means having one turbojet per 7-8 tonnes of launch mass.

If you are carrying crew or cargo to LKO, you want a powerful jet stage for a quick ascent. On the other hand, if you are going beyond LKO, jet engines are just dead weight, so you don\u0027t want to use any more of them than necessary. I personally prefer to use specialized lifters and landers at high-gravity planets, and transfer stages to move them around, but that\u0027s up to individual taste.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T07:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kiwiak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kiwiak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, so how much jets per kg for SSTO?\u003Cp\u003EAnd how many intakes - i saw some planes with intakes all over a place, how do such intake spam helps?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpamming the air intakes helps by increasing intake air at high altitudes. Jet engines require fuel and atmospheric oxygen (aka the \u0022intake air\u0022 resource). The intake air produced by the intakes is proportionate to air speed and atmospheric pressure. As your altitude increases, pressure decreases, and you need more intakes and more speed to supply the air to your engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, spamming the air intakes keeps your efficient jets burning longer at altitude, allowing the spaceplane to go faster before needed to switch to the less efficient rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigning SSTO\u0027s is much more of an art than a science because the \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E each pilot flies is different which leads to huge changes in design requirements and preferences.

Also, I think I fly a \u0022typical\u0022 SSTO profile, but I know there are a few things I do differently. So like others have said, you may need to modify these slightly to suit your taste/flying style/ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines: I aim for 1 TurboJet per 12t of craft, I don\u0027t usually go much above this, but in no case above 15t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings: 0.5 to 0.8 lift rating per ton, up to a maximum of 1.0 of lift rating per ton\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntakes: 1 to 3 intakes per TurboJet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid Fuel: 100 to 200 units per TurboJet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest way I\u0027ve figured to use these basic design criteria is to match them all up from left to right, starting from the top and working down the list. (Essentially, the higher the TWR, the less other stuff you need.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-For example, start off guessing that you want a fairly light, single engine craft aiming for around 8 tons. This is on the low side, so you can get away with around 0.5 lift rating/ton, 1 intake, and somewhere around 100 units of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If you build a heavier, 12t version, you\u0027ll want around 0.8 to 1.0 lift rating per ton, 3 intakes, and 200 units of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A 16t space plane would need 2 engines, but has a TWR similar to the first example so it can use similar design criteria.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETruthfully now that I\u0027m more experienced, I get away with less lift rating and less fuel. But I found it\u0027s a good place to start. For stock airplanes, TWR seems to be the easiest measure to gauge the rest of your design around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good practical example of this design criteria is already in your KSP game. Go look at the Aeris 4A. It\u0027s a 17t plane, uses 2 TurboJets, 8.6 points of lift rating (0.5 per ton), 2 ram intakes (with a couple radials), and 150 units of liquid fuel. It turns out the liquid fuel is enough to get into orbit, but runs short if you plan on a powered return. (So it could use a little more.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s just what I use. I could post a giant wall (or more giant-er) explaining how I came to all that if you want to know, but it seems to work well for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T14:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of wings you need is also a a matter of taste and style. I use FAR so I often have to use a realistic amount of lifting surface on the aircraft. But I have made a few that have no wings and they have flown fine, granted at a MUCH higher speed than most of my conventional designs. But Claws formula of .8 lift per ton is a pretty good number to start with.
