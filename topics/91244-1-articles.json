Your \u0022orbital period\u0022 on stock settings should be 6d, you can easily get it to within .1 seconds just put a thrust limiter on your engine. Then once your sats are up there its easy to triangulate them as well... just change your orbital period -\u002B 10 minutes by burning pro or retro.. .and speed up time to position sats, when in position just burn opposite side to get your 6d orbital period again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Outo","CreatedById":117084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T17:06:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing you can do is to set the other satellite as a target and then in the target mode you can burn retro until velocity to the target is 0. that will match the orbital of the target.
