There are three experiments that can only be performed by a kerbal -- surface samples, crew reports, and eva reports. So you can\u0027t do those at all.

You can do those 4 experiments, transmit them, do them again, and collect them into the science container. Then drive to the next biome and repeat.

Doing probed missions opens up another level of the game, since to keep control over a unkerballed craft you need a relay network, or, if you haven\u0027t you need to plan your manouevres very well so that they can be executed when there is a signal (meaning a lign of sight to Kerbin).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSetting up a relay network is well worth the effort I\u0027d say.
