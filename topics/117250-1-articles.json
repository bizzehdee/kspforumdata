Only by tabbing out of the game after every click i can make progress.\n\nEven reinstalling doesnt solve the problem on fullscreen. But the moment i tried KSP on window-mode it worked.\n\nAny suggestions?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T11:48:08Z","Content":"Please do not use -force-opengl, it\u0027s a [**Unity engine feature**](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html) that is not supported by Squad and it\u0027s not known yet if it will work reliably on Windows 10, you could try asking on the [**Unity forums**](http://unity3d.com/) to see if there are any known issues with openGL Unity games on Windows 10.\n\nAs it\u0027s working for you in windowed mode then that\u0027s something, all you can likely do is fake fullscreen using -popupwindow as well."}]}
