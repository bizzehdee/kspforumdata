(There\u0027s no need to combine #2 and #3, but you could)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Consider supplies if you use life support (regenerative technology really extends supply time and decreases mass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Consider sending a second ship (probe controlled) that has very lightweight return vehicles, and leave everything else behind.

It\u0027s helpful to ensure that the ship which takes up the piece to be docked (the tug) can leverage lots of torque for controlling all that dead weight, though adding RCS or SAS to every part you dock can improve the mobility of the finished ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T07:28:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 07:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T07:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022funkcanna\u0022 data-cite=\u0022funkcanna\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi all, \u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve managed to get to most planets but the only one I\u0027ve managed to return from is Duna.

If the entire craft is too big for your launch systems then chances are the transfer vehicle alone is also too much, generally the lander is only a fraction of total mass in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssembling ships from more than 2 parts requires a little thought when it comes to RCS/torque. Each piece needs to be controllable and balanced if it is going to dock itself, other options include making the launcher final stage a tug, or having a dedicated tug for assembly. If you do have each chunk be RCS balanced then you will need to disable a lot of ports and rings once things are docked so that they dont all fight each other and so the completed craft is somewhat balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen making something really big, lets say a jool multi-moon mission;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launch the main lander, its docked to a small RCS powered tug with a range of port sizes.

Often lifesupport, science labs, kerbal seating, maybe the primary fuel can. It launches to rendezvous and cancels relative velocity but is not designed to dock. It just needs to get to within a handful of km and stop relative. The tug undocks, gathers components and installs them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch the drive section. Usually small fuel cans with engines on them, this docks to the main fuel can launched earlier to let the engine get at the fuel. Once the build is finished you can deorbit and crash the assembly tug (or park it somewhere if its got the fuel to get to a station)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage i\u0027ve found to this (especially the module drive sections) is flexibility. You can reuse sections in other ships and with the right design can refit ships on the fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite recently was a Moho mission. I assembled the craft in LKO with mainsail engines for the good TWR, but also docked 2 NERVAs onto lateral ports along the sides. Once I\u0027d arrived at Moho and made all the really TWR sensitive burns I undocked the mainsails and docked the NERVAs (to avoid carrying a tug each engine module had a probe head and RCS). I ultimately left the mainsails orbiting Moho and sent the ship on to Eve with the nukes. The NERVAs got left at Eve for a future mission and the craft borrowed a pair of LV-T30s left there by an earlier Gilly mission for the Kerbin return. Most of the planetary bodies in my game have a mixture of engines in orbit, all capable of docking itself to any compatible craft that arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: finally some designs will fly SSTO from Kerbin, usually if you are of the type that likes TWR on their interplanetary sections. They tend to arrive empty of fuel but you then send them a tanker. This is how I get my Eve Ascent Vehicles into LKO. They are designed with enough dV/TWR to stage their way off Eve, but can also SSTO themselves at Kerbin by just ignoring the asparagus stages.
