It may be because there are polygons in the area that are not flat and therefore you cannot add a face to them. You might try creating triangles out of the polygon.\n\nI have noticed in blender performing certain repeative operations that coordinates that are supposed to be on fixed axis drift ever so slight (the lowest digit of precision). I have had to manually correct these. \n\nIf you don\u0027t mind me latching onto your texture thread I have my own texture problem. when I design my map in blender it looks like the image on the right, but in Unity and the game it looks like that on the left. I previously go some textures starting with a UV sphere (unfortunately the collision mesh was too large and the capsule mesh does not fit the contour) now I am using an Ico Sphere and I get the following.\n\n![4lqFOlR.png](http://i.imgur.com/4lqFOlR.png)\n\nThe appearance is not bad, its quite attractive on the pad but I was going for aerodynamic, not Buckminster fullerene architecture.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T02:36:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 02:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666**\n  \nDup"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T02:45:02Z","Content":"tygoo7, are your mesh normals being calculated correctly?\n\nPB666, in Blender, try **Mesh \u003E Faces \u003E Shade Smooth**"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T04:30:15Z","Content":"What does that mean again?"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T08:05:39Z","Content":"Looks like the normals of one of those petals are reversed.

In the first picture it looked like there was perhaps inverted faces. But now it looks like perhaps something else. \n\nBetter do some troubleshooting\n\nfirst try exporting to fbx then import the fbx back into blender (to see if there are any issues with that)\n\nIf thats producing the same issue as in unity then try to go to your modifier stack and see if there are any issues after applying each one(if you are letting the the fbx exporter apply them for you) for example if you are using the mirror modifier to create the cone but set it to mirror uv\u0027s it will create new uvs for the mirrored parts where you might not want them(but this should be displayed in blender so its probably not that)\n\nspeaking of uvs there might be inverted uvs. \n\nRemember to apply scale/rotation\n\njust some thoughts.
