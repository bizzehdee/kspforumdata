It may be because there are polygons in the area that are not flat and therefore you cannot add a face to them. You might try creating triangles out of the polygon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed in blender performing certain repeative operations that coordinates that are supposed to be on fixed axis drift ever so slight (the lowest digit of precision). I have had to manually correct these. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t mind me latching onto your texture thread I have my own texture problem. when I design my map in blender it looks like the image on the right, but in Unity and the game it looks like that on the left. I previously go some textures starting with a UV sphere (unfortunately the collision mesh was too large and the capsule mesh does not fit the contour) now I am using an Ico Sphere and I get the following.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4lqFOlR.png\u0022 alt=\u00224lqFOlR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe appearance is not bad, its quite attractive on the pad but I was going for aerodynamic, not Buckminster fullerene architecture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T02:36:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 02:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDup\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T02:45:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etygoo7, are your mesh normals being calculated correctly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPB666, in Blender, try \u003Cstrong\u003EMesh \u0026gt; Faces \u0026gt; Shade Smooth\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T04:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat does that mean again?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T08:05:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like the normals of one of those petals are reversed.
