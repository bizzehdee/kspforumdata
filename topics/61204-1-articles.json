It did well in atmo, but overall ISP in space did not seem to be as good as other rocket engine alternatives, despite the raw numbers. At any rate, I was happy with the overall results and will probably continue using it in certain designs, though I don\u0027t think it will replace the classic jet/rocket hybrid in all circumstances. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does offer some new design options, as can be seen here with the radial mount rear RCS port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://im1.shutterfly.com/media/47a4df07b3127ccef5609adf48cc00000030O00AbOWbhs0btWwPbz4Q/cC/f%3D0/ls%3D00605746839620140126202211058.JPG/ps%3D50/r%3D0/rx%3D720/ry%3D480/\u0022 alt=\u0022ry%3D480\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease feel free to let me know what you think.

I submitted a few crafts to Ingima and the Shuttlecraft team some time back, though I don\u0027t think any of them quite made the cut; not that I blame them- aesthetics aren\u0027t my strong suit.
