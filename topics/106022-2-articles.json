Are you using any plugins/mods?\n\nExploding half-way up can happen if you\u0027re launching with an empty cargo bay, the aero forces can break the stack apart if you don\u0027t throttle down or are trying too aggressive a course correction anywhere between 350-500m/s in stock (1.0 or 1.02) aero."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T18:24:00Z","Content":"I was launching a truss for my KSS.

I remember I was using a mod a while back that gave me the same \u0022cannot activate engine while stowed\u0022 message but I don\u0027t remember which one. I suspect some of the may be changing the clipping definitions or something since the SSMEs do have to be recessed into the orbiter quite a bit.\n\nThe booster exploding is new, I\u0027ve never seen that except when I accidentally lower the stack too close to the launch pad, then the base of the boosters will break during the \u0022twang\u0022.\n\nAny chance you can send me a list of mods and I can try re-create when I get a chance?"},{"CreatedByName":"Naito","CreatedById":18126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T02:48:52Z","Content":"Had to test quickly in 1.0.3, seems to fly fine!

As per @sgt\\_flyer\u0027s suggestion, redesigned the fuel flow from the ET to the SSMEs to ensure that SSMEs only get fuel from the ET\n\n\\* Reduced thrust on the boosters to allow for a slightly longer burn time.\n\n\\* Moved SAS module from nosecone to cargo bay so that it can be easily removed if you want to try fly it without using ANY SAS modules. Be warned that rolls in orbit will consume a lot of propellent, but launch should be unaffected.\n\n\\* Still keeps all the various abort options workable, including 2-engine out or gimbal failures!"},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T20:37:34Z","Content":"post to save"},{"CreatedByName":"Naito","CreatedById":18126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T01:56:31Z","Content":"Question: Do you guys actually care about recovering the boosters? 1.0.3/1.0.4 aero makes the current booster design unrecoverable; the chutes burn up!

So officially there are NO SAS UNITS on this shuttle once again!\n\n- REMOVED split rudder airbrake. As nice as it looked, it seemed to cause unwanted instability when deployed. Will have to wait until stock parts update to make this possible I think.\n\n- Adjusted launch clamps so they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re prettier\n\n- tweaked SSME angles for more stability for all supported cargo weights (0 to 36T)\n\n- Added auto-deploy airbrakes to boosters to make them recoverable again in 1.03/1.04 aero. Makes the booster separation slightly less authentic as the fairings separate to release the airbrakes, but boosters are easily recovered. Replace with plain nosecone if you want to make it look closer to the real thing, but your boosters will crash and burn =p such are the tradeoffs with stock parts!"},{"CreatedByName":"Naito","CreatedById":18126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T02:22:19Z","Content":"Holy crap I actually managed to land on the runway lol\n\n![vqdSFEy.png](http://i.imgur.com/vqdSFEy.png)\n\nWas launching my TDRS constellation, trying S-Turns to manage energy on re-entry.
