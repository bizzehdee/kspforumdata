Maybe I should\u0027ve said I was concerning in a reasonable average case which one is better. I don\u0027t find it too easy doing a proper aerocapture (with neither not-capturing nor capturing to surface) without quicksaves, which kind of concerns me, and in average case you may need some more dV to correct post-aerocapture orbit which potentially can cost some more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course maybe I\u0027m just dumb for aerocapture - at least I probably should fix controllability of my ship during aerocapturing (I play with RT), so I can control my airbrakes for the purpose - though I don\u0027t know whether I can really control my apoapsis by doing this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T09:33:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt can be hard getting an exact number for inclination, but it takes little delta-V to miss the target at about the right angle. You can eveball it while you adjust the burn, the exit trajectory shows the orbital plane. Then, when you get in the SOI, you can do a burn to get the correct periapsis, burn at periapsis to get the initial elliptical orbit, and burn at apoapsis to fine-tune the inclination and timing. Because you\u0027re going so slowly at the apoapsis of a highly elliptical orbit you don\u0027t need a lot of delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt depends a little on the aerodynamics model, but you can change the amount of braking by adjusting attitude. Pure prograde with a spaceplane produces less braking than going into the radial SAS setting, and you can do that in very thin air. Eventually the attitude can\u0027t be maintained by the reaction wheels you have. This sort of manouver can certainly shift the location of the periapsis a little.
