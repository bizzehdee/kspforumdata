I sent a copy of the rover to Minmus for trials and contract clearing, and a copy of the ground support vessel to the Mun for testing and clearing out biomes. The Mun ground support rover has cleared the northern canyon and is heading to the polar wastes on its way to the Munolith on the other side. Unfortunately my ground support rover tops at about 15 m/s, so lots of hours ahead to complete the circumnavigation - I included a Mobile Lab and ISRU on the support rover so it at least makes science. For Moho, I plan to leapfrog this ahead of the main rover to scout and refuel, and leave it as a \u0022space station\u0022.\n\nMoho/Minmus Rover\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/RvaahE4.png](http://i.imgur.com/RvaahE4.png)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/LYKirHx.png](http://i.imgur.com/LYKirHx.png)\n\nMoho/Mun Support Rover\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/fwXQ390.png](http://i.imgur.com/fwXQ390.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T15:52:06Z","Content":"I\u0027d be concerned that that Gigantor is going to get knocked off when - not if - you roll it. :-/"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T03:35:17Z","Content":"Question: Hypothetically, if someone had such a gamebreaking experience, and were forced to lose all of their progress, would editing up a slightly different vehicle be allowed?

Right now, I am doing F5/F9 frequently as I learn the limitations of this vehicle. So far, it seems reasonably safe at 15m/s @ 4x warp. While it is taking along an ISRU module, I don\u0027t plan on thrusting unless the way is simply impassible (might have to do that to enter the crater at the north pole). I am thinking the saddle-mounted ore tanks might be useful for CoM shifting on high slopes. It seems like right after disabling the brakes, the first few seconds the wheels don\u0027t behave quite right, and it is easy to rip off the front end. I also forgot a fuelcell on this design, which is a big oversight for night driving. If I get further along and something non-fatally bad happens, I might send a new rover to break the monotony a bit instead of reloading."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T20:08:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Question: Hypothetically, if someone had such a gamebreaking experience, and were forced to lose all of their progress, would editing up a slightly different vehicle be allowed?

Specifically, noted below:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 6. You may use replacement vehicles. If you read of my circumnavigation of Eve, you\u0027ll see why I allow this.

I understand this is a learning process... trust me on that... and I\u0027ll allow some design changes.\n\nThat rule sounds like what you\u0027re asking about.

This right here just about kills any thoughts I have on making something similar for pure ground transit (even non Kerbin). It\u0027s just soooo unwieldy to build a long range rover with this stuff on it.\n\nThe extended leg setup I have on the Cockroach turned out to be fairly sturdy, but only because I was using the small landing gear bays. For a previous ground challenge (drive to the North Pole), I had built a small jeep looking thing capable of surviving a crash at 4x warp and full speed (about 23 m/s). You can see a picture of it in my [Elcano Kerbin mission report](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127377) (or spoiler below). It mostly consists of modular girders and the rover wheels.
