Right now, I am doing F5/F9 frequently as I learn the limitations of this vehicle. So far, it seems reasonably safe at 15m/s @ 4x warp. While it is taking along an ISRU module, I don\u0027t plan on thrusting unless the way is simply impassible (might have to do that to enter the crater at the north pole). I am thinking the saddle-mounted ore tanks might be useful for CoM shifting on high slopes. It seems like right after disabling the brakes, the first few seconds the wheels don\u0027t behave quite right, and it is easy to rip off the front end. I also forgot a fuelcell on this design, which is a big oversight for night driving. If I get further along and something non-fatally bad happens, I might send a new rover to break the monotony a bit instead of reloading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T20:08:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xannari Ferrows\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xannari Ferrows\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuestion: Hypothetically, if someone had such a gamebreaking experience, and were forced to lose all of their progress, would editing up a slightly different vehicle be allowed?
