It would be racked by tidal stress, causing volcanoes, lava rivers, and massive canyons. It would also have high winds due to it skimming the atmosphere of a gas giant. Basically, it would be what Moho failed to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second idea is a short-period comet. Basically an icy rock the size of Gilly or smaller, with a highly elliptical orbit. It would come way close to the sun, closer than Moho, offering opportunities for direct sunspot observation. After that, it would zoom to the farthest reaches of the Kerbol system, at least twice as far as Eeloo. This would offer a stepping-stone to other stars, as a ship could go into orbit or land in the comet and exit as soon as it was far out, effectively giving free delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy third idea is Rare Events. These would basically be special cosmic events that would happen once every 5-10 in-game years. Here are my ideas for a couple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroid Near Miss: An asteroid about half the size of Gilly flies by Kerbin. You can land on the asteroid. It has a randomly-generated periapsis as low as 100 kilometers. Once you have landed a ship on the asteroid, it becomes persistant, and enters a visible solar orbit, in which you can visit it again. If you do not land on it, it disappears when it exits Kerbin\u0027s SOI. If you plant a flag on it, you are given the opportunity to name it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComet/Asteroid Impact: A comet or asteroid enters an impact trajectory with a Solar system object. Think Siding Spring or Shoemaker-Levy. These objects never impact Kerbin, and have a variable size based on the object they are impacting. Thus, an object with the mass of 1/8 Gilly would impact Minmus, but an object the size of Pol would impact Jool. These will cause visible craters and a large debris field, possibly endangering bases. When one impacts a sea such as on Laythe or Eve, it creates a tsunami, endangering any island or coastal bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor when other solar systems are added:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovas: The star explodes, destroying or seriously damaging any planets. Objects that are not destroyed, such as comets at their apoapsis, plutoids, and far-out gas giants, undergo these effects:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDarkness: Lots of it. After the nova is over, all surviving objects are plunged into darkness. Solar panels don\u0027t work at all, unless the object encounters another star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar Panel Overload: The exploding star overloads any deployed solar panels on ships orbiting around it, or any bases on its undestroyed planets. The solar panels turn black and are completely unfixable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrphan Planets: The surviving planets are cast away from the star, at least until they encounter another one. These orphan planets have a 15% chance of being cast toward Kerbol, making Orphan Planet Flyby another Rare Event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeutron Stars: If the star has a large enough mass, it turns into a Neutron Star. These have very, very large densities, and the planets of stars that turn into these are not orphaned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, some stars such as stars with low mass like Kerbol never actually supernova.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"duncan1297","CreatedById":57230,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T23:50:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WhiteWeasel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WhiteWeasel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehmmm, maybe a planet with an extreme inclination? \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi43.tinypic.com/29up0gm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002229up0gm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou could do an aerobrake and save the fuel, assuming it has an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T00:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022duncan1297\u0022 data-cite=\u0022duncan1297\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou could do an aerobrake and save the fuel, assuming it has an atmosphere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor when mining is added and you need to get resources, especially LV-N and RTG nuclear material, I can imagine a tiny, airless, fuel rich planet in a near polar degree inclination as far out as Jool or Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Golden Clock Industries","CreatedById":64435,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T18:30:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBump.

A planet that orbits or rotates retrograde. If it orbits retrograde, it would need an atmosphere to slow down in, and the gees from slowing down would be huge.
