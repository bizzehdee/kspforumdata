I have been playing for about a year and a half now (since version 0.21, just before the original science mode was released), and I have logged more hours than I care to admit! I am using a four and a half year old, off-the-shelf laptop and KSP runs pretty smoothly - very few crashes, a bit of lag with very high part counts but not so much with large numbers of craft on rails throughout the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually play in Sandbox following a historical timeline inspired playthrough based on the Wikipedia Campaign with a few additions of my own and actually just started it over from the beginning. I have a second \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CExploration\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 sandbox where I am trying to land Kerbals on every celestial body and an \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CR\u0026amp;D\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 save where I just design random craft. So far I have only landed (legitimately) on Duna and Eve outside of Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI although I have done unmanned flybys of everything except Eeloo. (And I would\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had it too if it weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t for the Kraken spewing my probe across the system after it left Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI!) All that said, I have really been enjoying the new challenges in the 0.90 career mode and am looking forward to the tweaks coming in the beta. I have not really experimented with mods that much, although just last week I created a new install to tinker with a few so we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to see where that leads!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite part of the game is either building rovers or stations. Probably the hardest thing I have done so far was a side-on docking simultaneously to two docking ports creating a square station. Added to that was the fact that one side had two Hitchiker Modules, the other a Science lab plus a battery (to give it just a little extra length so the two sides were equal). (I apparently take way too many screenshots\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6it took forever to find this!) Right now for some reason, I have a real hankering to land on Ike and Eeloo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6really not sure why I am so interested in those two, especially since I have not landed on any of the Joolian moons yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Iu6aQwt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Iu6aQwt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, nice to meet everyone, and I am looking forward to participating in some interesting discussions here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T22:06:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum, BlkBltChemie. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have trouble finding the pics I need out of the couple of thousands I have taken.
