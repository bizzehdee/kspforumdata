Judging by the trailer, it aims to be a super enhanced KSP with everything the current game lacks. However, I do have one concern - and that is of how the current KSP will be updated alongside KSP2. If KSP2 has a feature, will that feature eventually be added into KSP1? Or will KSP1 just stop being updated? I\u0027m sure many people might not buy KSP2 simply because of cost, but does that mean that they can\u0027t enjoy updates anymore?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess the point I\u0027m trying to make is that if KSP1\u00A0needs a feature, but KSP2 already has that feature, does KSP1 get it as well? \u00A0I\u0027m not an expert in game development so I might be missing something obvious, but it seems as though KSP1 runs the risk of simply evolving into KSP2 or else getting tons of weird, unneeded features that were\u00A0only added because KSP2 doesn\u0027t have them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe im overthinking this, but honestly I\u0027m a bit confused by how two games so similar run alongside each other from the same developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-15T09:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223672309\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188245\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221568512314\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188882\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Duck McFuddle\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Duck McFuddle said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe im overthinking this, but honestly I\u0027m a bit confused by how two games so similar run alongside each other from the same developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 2 is from a different developer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even if they both were from the same developer you wouldn\u0027t expect any backports from the new game because that would devalue the whole idea of making a new game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-15T14:03:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223672309\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188245\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221568512314\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188882\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Duck McFuddle\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Duck McFuddle said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a bit confused by how two games so similar run alongside each other\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same way similar FPS, MOBA, or Battle Royale games can run alongside each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223672309\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188245\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221568512314\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188882\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Duck McFuddle\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Duck McFuddle said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit seems as though KSP1 runs the risk of simply evolving into KSP2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom posts I\u0027ve read from LinuxGuruGamer and others, the core of KSP1 simply could not handle such things.\u00A0 It\u0027s why KSP2 has been built on a new code base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy two cents.\u00A0 KSP1 will have a few more updates while KSP2 is out.\u00A0 Eventually, we\u0027ll get that beautiful final update and KSP1 will finally be finished.\u00A0 Hopefully with all the planets and parts (that need it) fully revamped, with most of the major bugs smashed, and a much needed balance pass to career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
