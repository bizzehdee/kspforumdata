In general, the idea is to blast your plane to \u0026gt;22km and \u0026gt;1.2km/s or so, then close your intakes and turn off the turbojets and engage rockets to bring you up to orbital speed and altitude.

If you put your fuel tanks squarely on the CoM of the plane, they will not cause a CoM shift as they empty. Doing this properly necessitates not stacking any tanks one on top of the other. Put your wings either on or just in front of your CoM and add a stabilizers at the back.

This may not work for you, but here are a couple points that I think would\u0027ve made my life easier in designing a true SSTO from the get-go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.) This shouldn\u0027t need to be said, but if you\u0027ve ever built anything in KSP, use struts liberally. Everything wobbles, and your plane will veer off the runway unexpectedly if things are flopping around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) (And this has been said already) The \u003Cstrong\u003Ebigger\u003C/strong\u003E it is, the \u003Cstrong\u003Emore difficult\u003C/strong\u003E it\u0027ll be to get in to orbit. I\u0027d aim for something like 20tons and wouldn\u0027t exceed 40 if you\u0027re new to the SSTO scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) \u003Cstrong\u003EIntake Air.\u003C/strong\u003E I know it\u0027s been said a few times about 2:1 intakes to engine, but I\u0027ve found that something like 3 or 4:1 works well for me. That means more altitude and more speed before you start in on your precious rocket fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) \u003Cstrong\u003ELift.\u003C/strong\u003E If your 40-ton space plane has just 1 set of the delta wings, you might find it tough to get off the runway. Give it a decent wingspan, and place your center of lift behind your center of mass. Just remember that the farther back that lift is, the harder it\u0027ll be to get the nose up and climb effectively. (I like putting canards far forward to at least coax the nose up off the runway). Also, have your rear landing gears slightly higher up (shorter) than the front. This causes the plane to sit on the ground pointing upwards a bit already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) \u003Cstrong\u003EEfficient rocket engines.\u003C/strong\u003E Your thrust to weight doesn\u0027t have to be much over 1. You\u0027re going to have burned your jet fuel, you\u0027ll be in less-dense air, and gravity will have diminished somewhat. A thrust to weight of 1.5 or 2 just isn\u0027t necessary. As long as you can manage a greater than 1 ratio, go for efficiency over power every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) \u003Cstrong\u003EPrecision.\u003C/strong\u003E This has to do with how you ascend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The faster you\u0027re going in the atmosphere, the more you\u0027ll be paying for it via drag. If your horizontal speed is 400m/s and you\u0027re only 5km off the ground, you\u0027re doing it wrong. You could have used a lot of that energy to climb instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Know how much fuel you have. If you brought 2 Mk1 fuselages, then you have 300 liquid fuel to use on the jet engines. If you\u0027re in orbit and carrying 100 of that around, you did it wrong. You can\u0027t use it via rockets since you won\u0027t have enough oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Push your turbo-jets to the limit. Watch your resource tab and specifically your intake air. You\u0027ll probably want 2 jet engines, and they\u0027ll function until your intake air hits about .10 . The higher you can go before you turn on the rockets, the less fuel you\u0027ll need to get to orbit. If you\u0027re climbing slowly, your plane will start to pull to one side as one of the engines suffocates. If you can catch this as soon as it starts, this is exactly when to kill the jets and fire the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) \u003Cstrong\u003EYour SSTO is not a rocket.\u003C/strong\u003E I can\u0027t stress this enough: It\u0027s a plane. If you\u0027re taking off vertically or not equipping jet engines, or staging a bunch of parts during your ascent, then you\u0027ve built a weird rocket, not a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA standard ascent for me - \u003C/strong\u003ETake off and climb as quickly as you can with only jet power. Once you\u0027re above around 10km or more, start to level out and gather speed. The higher you go, the less the air is going to fight you. Your goal should be to get to 600m/s when you\u0027re at about 18km (this doesn\u0027t have to be exact). Watch your intake air and continue climbing slowly. Ideally you\u0027ll run out of liquid fuel for your jets at the same time you run out of intake air. At this point you want to light the rocket and shutdown the jets (use an action group so you can close all of your intakes as well -\u0026gt; less drag). You\u0027re still a plane. If you start to climb at an angle higher than 60, you\u0027re wasting energy to gravity losses; not to mention you need substantial horizontal speed to orbit anyway. Climb at around 45 degrees, get your Ap above 70km, and circularize accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Using these rules I can put a plane into a circular orbit at 80km with almost 2000 delta-v remaining. That\u0027s more than enough to dock with any station or satellite, assuming similar orbital planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m no expert, I\u0027ve just found something that works for me.

For whatever reason, drag is based off of the mass of the part, and lift is purely a function of angle of attack. Also, drag calculations don\u0027t take into account part positioning or function. For example, if you place a nose cone on a fuel tank, not only does that not reduce drag for the fuel tank, it actually increases drag because the nose cone is generating it\u0027s own drag in addition to the fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot ideal, by any means. That\u0027s where the FAR mod comes in. It completely removes the stock system and replaces it with a more detailed, more realistic aerodynamic system. So things like nose cones, payload fairings, and cargo bays actually help. Drag is no longer a function of mass, and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, some people do consider it more difficult, and in a way, since its deeper than the stock system, I can understand where that belief would come from. However, the stock system isn\u0027t intuitive at all, since it\u0027s not based in actual physical laws that we\u0027re familiar with. FAR is better in that regard since it\u0027s based on a realistic aerodynamic model. If it looks like a plane, it\u0027s likely going to fly like a plane. So you can draw inspiration from actual aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you install it, just make a backup of your parts folder, so you can quickly and easily reverse the install, if you choose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, onto more general tips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, you\u0027re going to want the center of mass (CoM) in front of the center of lift (CoL). This is going to give you a more stable and easier to control aircraft. Also, be mindful of the shifting center of mass as you deplete your fuel during ascent. If your CoM shifts behind your CoL while you\u0027re in atmosphere you will not go to space today. Try to design your aircraft so that using fuel won\u0027t cause a huge shift in CoM. For my SSTO shuttle below, notice how the wings are near the very rear of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as others have mentioned, you\u0027re probably going to want to start small. My first spaceplane was a little one man craft with just a couple of engines and weighed maybe 10 tons. As the size increases, so does the difficulty of designing it. Use small space planes just to teach yourself the basics of spaceplane design and flight. Once you understand that, then you can move up to the big space planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly with trim!! A lot of people don\u0027t know this, but KSP includes a functional trim system, which is a lot more accurate, and convenient than trying to manually fly the craft. You can trim in a direction by holding alt and hitting a directional key. Holding alt and hitting \u0022X\u0022 will reset all trim to default, which you\u0027ll want to do when you get into space, since trim affects all directional systems, from control surfaces, to RCS, to the reaction wheel. Past initial takeoff and minor course corrections, I almost never manually control my shuttle while still in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour ascent profile is going to depend on the specific design of your spaceplane, so that\u0027s going to take a little experimentation. Don\u0027t get discouraged if you fail a few (dozen) times. For my SSTO shuttle below, I climb out at 45 degrees until 10km, at which point I let gravity slowly pull the nose down to a 20 degree angle, which I maintain (with trim!) until just before the jets cut out due to lack of oxygen, usually around 23km at Mach 4. At this point I cutover to the rockets and maintain thrust until my apoapsis is where I want it. 70km if I\u0027m trying to rendezvous with something, or 100km if I\u0027m just releasing a payload. With this profile, I usually still have around 800 delta-V to play with, depending on the weight of my payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you\u0027ve probably already noticed, at high altitudes, jet engines will flame out due to lack of oxygen. The altitude they flame out is a function of air density, air speed, and intake area. More intakes can help you stay on jet propulsion for longer. A number of people like a 3:1 or even 4:1 ratio. Personally, I use a 1:1 or 2:1, but that\u0027s just for aesthetics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don\u0027t overdo it on jet fuel. Jet engines are extremely efficient and sip fuel. Try not to carry more than 100 to 150 units of extra fuel into space for your return to the KSP, otherwise its just wasted mass. For my SSTO shuttle, I use a modified docking clamp that has a huge liquid fuel and oxidizer capacity to transfer excess fuel out of the plane before launch. At launch, I only carry about 250 units of fuel for the jet engines, and that\u0027s for a four jet engine 35 ton spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have multiple jet engines, flameouts can cause a flat spin, since jet engines don\u0027t all flame out at the same time. This can be extremely difficult to correct for once it happens, and so you\u0027re going to have a bad time if you don\u0027t shut down your jets before they start cutting out. Rather than manually trying to toggle the engines by right clicking on them, set up a series of action groups to shut down your jet engines, close your air intakes to reduce drag, and activate your rockets. Then do the inverse with a second action group. That way, with a single keypress you can instantly switch over your propulsion systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wSXbpc3eNAA/UYu5jgY--WI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/RmyhOX0jpRI/w640-h400-no/SSTO.JPG\u0022 alt=\u0022SSTO.JPG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis SSTO space plane has a ~5 ton cargo capacity and is the pride and joy of my space program.
