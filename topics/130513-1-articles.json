I just tried KAS\u002BKIS. It allows me to tweak my station in the orbit like NASA. So I guess give Jeb, Bill and Bob more capability is possible. As for now, I can just control them one by one, quite annoying. what if I can give them orders? \u003Cstrong\u003EAND maybe even multiplayer? \u003C/strong\u003EImagine this: I want to upgrade my station around kerbin, need help. So I send a quest to KSC with my plan. Then a contract is created with deadline for other players. Once accepted, he will replace one of my engineer on board and help me do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T03:44:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMultiplayer is planned, and on the \u0022Do not suggest\u0022 list, and KAS/KIS is something most people have been wanted for a long time.
