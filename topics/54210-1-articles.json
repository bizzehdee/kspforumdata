One that takes pretty pictures for the press, like the EVA cameras NASA uses, would have limited scientific value, unless combined with something else--one of the things that made the Apollo J-missions so valuable geologically is that, right after the dust had settled after landing, they did an EVA where one of the crew poked his head out of the LM\u0027s top hatch and took photographs that did a 360-degree panorama of the landing site to the horizon, and they did likewise at each \u0022station\u0022 along the EVA routes, to allow the geologists to have the all-important context that their samples were being taken from. Likewise, on Gemini EVAs, they did experiments using the EVA cameras with various lens filters to take ultraviolet photographs of various stars and such, to gain data on the unfiltered UV spectra of the stars (couldn\u0027t be done from Earth because of the UV filtering of the ozone layer; couldn\u0027t be done from the cabin because the windows were likewise UV filtered to protect the crew\u0027s eyes). However, that said...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECameras HAVE been key scientific instruments on a number of spacecraft. Indeed, on the Ranger and Lunar Orbiter probes, the camera was pretty much the SOLE scientific instrument. The way to implement that wouldn\u0027t be with an actual in-game camera, though. What I\u0027d do is make it similar to the current science instruments, albeit working by biome. The data collection could be done as \u0022take photo mosaic,\u0022 featuring an animation of the camera frantically scanning the area, and would represent taking a series of photographs that could then be assembled into a mosaic showing the entire area (this is how real space photography is done; the camera\u0027s field of view is quite narrow to get high resolution images), which can then be analyzed for various scientific purposes, including mapping and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to go a bit further with this, you could also have different types of camera that can take photomosaics in different wavelengths of light, allowing collection of different data. These photo mosaics could also then provide PR value and money when the pretty ones are released to the press; there could even be synergy for having cameras take the same mosaic at three different wavelengths, allowing a false-color image to be created for public consumption. (Maybe later on, once you\u0027ve got enough technology to allow this, there could be a single-camera option that can take mosaics at various wavelengths through the use of different filters, and a true-color option, too.) A great deal can be learned from photographs of the same object at different wavelengths, and this could be valuable scientific data as well as financially. (Let\u0027s face it, NASA doesn\u0027t put cameras on its unmanned probes purely for PR purposes; there\u0027s plenty that can be gleaned from good photography.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I could also see value in having an EVA camera that can transmit photos back to Kerbin, both in terms of \u0022gaining surface mechanics data\u0022 (i.e., how deep did the landing pads sink into the dirt? How bad is the dust? etc.), and possibly in repairing damaged parts, since a photo could show the ground team what the damage is and let them figure out how to fix it...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dart980","CreatedById":64926,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T17:15:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53813-0-22-L-Tech-Scientific-Stuff-V1-61\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EL-Tech Scientific Stuff\u003C/a\u003E it has Cameras and other things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T13:05:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.
