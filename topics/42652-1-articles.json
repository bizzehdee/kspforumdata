It would be nice if we could still affect parts when the pause screen is active. Being able to do things like toggle gimbals and alter fuel flow. It would actually be more realistic seeing as in real life computers make changes like that on rockets in microseconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, imagine if you launched a rocket but something goes wrong, maybe you misplaced a fuel line and don\u0027t notice until the rocket starts to veer off course. You could hit pause, turn off fuel flow from an opposing tank, maybe shut off an engine or something in order to try and save the rocket. Then unpause and see how it goes, hitting pause again to make adjustments in a continual effort to save the rocket. I think it would add some challenge to the game as opposed to \u0022oh crap, it\u0027s going sideways, revert to VAB\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
