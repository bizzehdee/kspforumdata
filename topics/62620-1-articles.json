Jets on 1, Nukes on 2, Intakes on 3-5, Panels on 9. The forward RCS tank has been deliberately left empty - the plan is to use the back RCS fuel for docking purposes. After delivering her payload she\u0027s tail heavy, so the fuel in the back RCS tank gets transferred into the front RCS tank and proper balance for flight is restored when she comes into land.

If you add vertical struts in between the wing sandwich (indicated where the green oval is), it will strengthen up your wings a bit. Let me know if that part doesn\u0027t make sense.

Admittedly, I knew already that the design was already about one tank short of having what it needed solely from liquid fuel tanks, but I\u0027m beginning to suspect that I may be doing the ascent wrong as well. I usually go 60 degrees to 10,000 (Auk VIII has about ten degrees AOA in the early flight), then back off to 45 degrees up to 20,000, reducing that by five degree increments to keep the ascent rate less than 100 m/s. Above 20,000, I\u0027m usually at 5 degrees picking up speed, still keeping the ascent rate around 10 m/s. When I\u0027ve got the last set of intakes open, I start throttling back once I get to around 0.07 intake air per engine; I generally avoid flame outs. Rockets get lit when I\u0027m down to one third thrust; I keep the jets running and I still throttle back as needed to prevent flameouts. When I stop accelerating, I kill the jets, open up the throttle, and keep burning until the apoapsis is where I want it.

Then put the last three on a different action group to shut them down. That way, when you are at the point where you would normally kill the TurboJets and just run the nukes, you can just shut down the first four engines and keep running the three (which will also be getting more intake air per engine) to get some extra thrust. It might take some practice to know when to switch. Just don\u0027t forget to shut them down (or throttle modulate some more) to prevent going out of control. Also make sure the three engines you choose to run are all in line (your two outboard and the center).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say that your initial climb of 60 degrees seems a bit steep for the surface TWR the Auk has. Maybe start out more around 45 degrees and let the speed slowly build. I recommend being around 200 m/s at 10km, but you don\u0027t have to race to get to 200m/s either. Believe it or not, the extra speed give you more lift, which leaves you more thrust to accelerate and climb faster. You can try that and see if it gives you any extra fuel. Climb profiles can sometimes be design dependent, so you can just run a few different ascents and see how it goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, I tried running a test with intakes after one of our previous conversations.

I\u0027ve rechecked the original model in the SPH twice using the tweakables to show me where the CoM is going to be compared to the CoL for the ship in its post-delivery configuration, I\u0027ve set the plane up to that configuration, everything shows like it should be good - and yet I loose control of the plane coming in around 18,000 and can\u0027t regain it. The one time I did, the plane developed this weird side-to-side oscillation. Turned SAS off and I was out of control again.

I\u0027m not at my computer now either, but look at where your rudders are in relation to the re-entry CoM. Also, if your plane is too neutrally stable (the lift marker nearly centered in the mass marker), then that will cause difficulties too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes changing the reentry angle helps. Try starting out sort of pancaking in (30-45 AoA) to bleed speed, then flatten back out before you get to 18km.

With a ship that massive, all that inertia can be hard for the SAS to stop.

The end of the flight has gone something like this so far - after docking with the pier, I offload the remaining fuel in the center tank; all the jet tanks are dry, the RCS in the centerline cylinders is offloaded and I go ahead and refill the NERVA fuel tanks to full. After docking, the aft RCS tank has about 670-700 units of Monoprop still in it; this gets shifted to the forward tank and the other RCS tanks are locked down. I cut loose from the pier, do a 100 m/s burn to deorbit with the nukes. All told I have about 325 units of LiquidFuel and 397 units of Oxidizer left at that point. I shift the fuel into the central tank and lock down the NERVA tanks, lock down all the jet fuselages except for the forwardmost pair, fill them to full and set the outboard tank to transfer out (I have TAC, so I leave it like this). Reentry is generally shallow, no more than 10 degrees or so. Intakes are open for drag, I\u0027m facing prograde, keeping it level and the solar panels come in when I hit atmo. Loss of control generally happens around 17,000 meters or so, surface velocity around 800 m/s - it starts as a pull to one side, which I attempt to correct by applying opposite rudder; this usually fails, the plane whips around, and from there it generally plummets out of the sky. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARE_(aviation)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPARE\u003C/a\u003E doesn\u0027t work; I suspect either I\u0027m applying it wrong or that KSP\u0027s aerodynamic model neutralizes that technique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think the rudders still aren\u0027t far enough back and I mentioned replacing the nukes with Aerospikes last night (since the only place I intend to go with this plane is Kerbin orbit); I\u0027d drop 1.5 tonnes from the plane and it should throw the mass further forward unless I\u0027m mistaken.

Before I delve into that, I have to ask.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you say \u0022it flips,\u0022 are you referring to it flipping over in pitch or yaw? (When I think of flip, I think pitch. When I think about it turning in yaw, I think of sliding.) I ask just so I have an understanding of what you\u0027re seeing in flight. (Yaw or pitch departures.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I see three things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The new craft file I downloaded has no vertical tail fins at all. As discussed previously, they are not strictly needed but can help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emore importantly you are being bitten by...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Your CoM is ending up directly above your CoL with the current weight distribution you described (forward RCS and NERVA tanks full) even with the gear removed. This will make it neutrally stable. Which means (with such a large craft), that your limited yaw authority will have a hard time compensating (which might explain the yaw oscillations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, the one that snuck up on you...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) KSP aero has a (one of many) bug. When AoA increases, lift produced by control surfaces increases faster than lift produced by wings. (To the point that control surfaces produce maximum lift at 90 AoA.) You have a lot of canards that are way forward from your CoM. At the config described above, and given my #2 comment, your neutrally stable craft becomes unstable a soon as you put AoA on it (which is pretty much required for flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to the SPH and check this out. Turn on your CoM and CoL markers and set up your fuel config you described. Select your entire craft (shift click wherever) and rotate it with Shift\u002BS (5 degrees, then 10 degrees). Watch the CoL bubble and see where it goes. Bam, out of control...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to answer my own question at the top of this post. I suspect you are going out of control in pitch and seeing yaw oscillations separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of ways to fix this. I can ramble on some more in this post, but you can play with it and see what you prefer. If you want help with fixing it, let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I forgot. I can\u0027t actually see where your CoM is with the gear on because I have edited my landing gear file. I gave the landing gear zero mass because I grew tired of the SPH lying about the CoM. So I\u0027m guessing that given the location of the gear in relation to the CoM, it looks more forward to you. Make sure you remove the gear when you play around with the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-11T21:40:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2014 09:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
