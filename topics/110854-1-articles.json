You have a lot of exposed parts, especially those radial bulgy tanks on the adapter-- that drag is gonna get you. Move all that paraphernalia into a 1.25m service bay (it only masses 0.1t), with an appropriate nosecone in front of it. That makes your ship a nice smooth cylinder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, you have the \u0022Thumper\u0022 SRB driving the thing-- that\u0027s way overpowered (by default) for that tiny middle/upper stage, as stibbons has suggested. At the very least, make sure you\u0027ve put a thrust limiter on that SRB so that it doesn\u0027t slam you past Mach1 right away. If you\u0027re trying to pick a number, I find a TWR of about 1.5 works pretty well. Look at the craft\u0027s total mass on the engineer\u0027s report, multiply by 1.5, multiply by 9.8, then divide by 275 (the thrust of a BACC), that\u0027ll tell you what to set it at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also suggest that your mass ratio between that huge BACC booster and your tiny 1-ton 2nd stage is a pretty big gap. Maybe consider downgrading the SRB from a Thumper to a Hammer, and then upping your 2nd stage from 1 ton of LFO to 2 tons.

Try putting everything inside a service bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There are no batteries or solar panels on your probe. It will run out of power when you don\u0027t fire your engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You need some way to control your craft in space.

If you have unlocked the LV-909, use that one for everything above 30km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- SRBs are great as a cheap lower stage. However, they have no thrust vectoring (gimbal) in KSP. Use fins with actual control surfaces to compensate for that, as those can steer you in atmospheres. Also, set the thrust limiter on the SRB to maybe 20% for your very small payload. The whole thing should not be going faster than 300m/s at 10km.
