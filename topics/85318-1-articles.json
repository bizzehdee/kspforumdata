Finding things becomes awkward and the whole thing is cluttered. Naming conventions will only get you so far because the flights are listed by MET. Anyone who has used RemoteTech 2 and built absurd networks of relays will know what I\u0027m talking about - as will anyone who has multiple flights in progress or likes leaving crashed ships as active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a solution, I would want the ability to assign flights to a group of my choosing.
