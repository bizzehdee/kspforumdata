These 7 brave souls signed up for a long duration mission of an unknown length.

Many missions came and went through that station bringing with them words and supplies from home. Some of their favorite missions included the return of Jebediah, Bill and Bob as they went to and returned from Duna bringing a fun picture for the Stations crew:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/32/blhl.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/scaled/medium/32/blhl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022blhl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother favorite mission for the Stations crew to visit them was a pair of missions to Kerbins Mun and Minmus as well as a team that went to Moho:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/202/u9e2.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/scaled/medium/202/u9e2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u9e2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/853/wlc8.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/scaled/medium/853/wlc8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wlc8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/812/u23x.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/scaled/medium/812/u23x.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u23x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut finally in their tenth year on the station, they watched as the first of 2 new missions to Eeloo was sent on its way.
