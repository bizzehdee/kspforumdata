More importantly, transfer delta-v requirements. I know there are delta-v maps, but i want to know how much delta-v it takes YOU to make a tranfer. If you use a calculator for phase angles, please specify your phase angle also.

However, i will be sorting them from lowest delta-v to highest, especially if phase angles are given, to give newies options. Also, screenshots of the manuevers are welcome and appreciated, but not neccesary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, i will offer the first delta-v needed. I sent a three part mission to Jool, and exactly 1960 m/s got me an encouter with each one, with a ~500 m/s correction burn halfway though.

It\u0027s always advised to overdesign and take a little more, mainly because maneuver nodes assume an instantaneous change in velocity while actual burns take time. Also landing on airless bodies will probably take more, if you do it slowly and safely instead of using suicide burns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T10:18:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had generally good results with metaphor\u0027s delta-V map and adding a 10-15% margin for user error.

So for example when coming from a Kerbin-Jool transfer orbit you have to burn retrograde 320 m/s at Jool periapsis in order to get into an orbit that has its apoapsis at Pol\u0027s orbit (380 m/s for Bop, etc). And from that orbit it takes 770 m/s at Pol to get captured into Pol orbit. Those delta-v\u0027s should be pretty accurate, but that\u0027s not always the best way to do it. For the big moons it\u0027s more efficient to just capture straight into orbit around them without going low near Jool. Gravity assists can significantly change the delta-v as well, and they\u0027re pretty easy to get in the Jool system. Also, this chart doesn\u0027t include the delta-v to go from one moon to another, which is really different (since you wouldn\u0027t go down to a low Jool periapsis before transferring to the other moon).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want delta-v to go from any one place to any other, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalAcademy/comments/1qu5jv/deltav_charts/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis post\u003C/a\u003E is a good resource.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T21:24:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for that insight, metaphor, and the link to the other maps, very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
