This includes Habitats, Greenhouse, Laboratory, a Cupola derivative, Command-Center and others. \n\u003E \n\u003E It is designed to fit with the other stock parts and feel als \u0022Kerbal\u0022 as possible. \n\u003E \n\u003E **Attention:**\n\u003E \n\u003E There was a bug in the first release.

In this version the Greenhouse has opaque windows because the shader for transparent parts can\u0027t be emissive to light the windows. In the future you can choose which version you want.\n\u003E 2. The Greenhouse hat experimental support for the USI Life Support. To work at least one Kerbal has to be in the module. With two Kerbals the Greenhouse works at 100%. You will need to have halve of your Kerbals to work in the Greenhouses to produce enough food.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But enough words, here are some screenshots:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/sCRdv](http://imgur.com/a/sCRdv)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Changelog:**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E v0.1.0\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Initial Release.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E v0.1.1\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hotfix for the wrong filepaths.
