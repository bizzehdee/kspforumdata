An amazing trip full of troubles and more. Mostly fuel systems. The first trip, a crossfeed capable piece turned out not to be. As result, 6 tanks of fuel were not used, and an emergency water landing had to occur in the midst of the cold southern ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i529.photobucket.com/albums/dd332/KwKiller/Kerbal%20Space%20Command/screenshot13.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot13.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon finally returning home, the fuel system was rectified, or so they thought. 15 minutes into the trip at almost 500m/s 14km altitude, the rear line-fed tanks began to be fully drained first. Fuel flow had to be disabled when the plane began to lose control. The Bad weight imbalance quickly caused the plane to lose altitude, at one point dropping to 7km. But the situation was saved just in time as the fuel balance slowly came back. Altitude and velocity soon came back and the ice shelf was passing below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i529.photobucket.com/albums/dd332/KwKiller/Kerbal%20Space%20Command/screenshot14.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot14.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll seemed well, until it became time to re-activate the crossflow of fuel. As the last of the forward tanks burned down, despite the crossflow being re-enabled, the fuel was locked as the line froze up! Even though the tanks had 298L of fuel reading in the tanks, the engines cut out and an emergency powerglide down began. The cabins grew quiet as Jeb pitched the plane forward in a steep dive. Without this dive, a stall would occur, and the plane would not be able to pitch back and cut the vertical speed. With precise timing, Jeb pulled out of the dive at only a couple hundred metres above the ground, and just before collision, the vertical velocity was eliminated, and landing was achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i529.photobucket.com/albums/dd332/KwKiller/Kerbal%20Space%20Command/screenshot17.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot17.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003ELanding was confirmed at 39m 44s.\u003C/span\u003E Tracking station confirmed it was not exactly at the south pole, but with the time loss of having to glide down at a low speed, plus the loss of speed earlier in the flight, another attempt was not conducted.
