Transfer fuel with the KAS system, so no need for docking ports on the fuel tanks. But check if the crew cans have doors before placing them about. Because I didn\u0027t, lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively you can land a launch platform and pick up the stuff directly from that with your crane and build a huge base in no-time (well, it takes time if you\u0027re paranoid about making the crane too low like I am, leading to me having three consecutive failed crane designs, two that fell over and one that got stuck on the platform, lol). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen drag the platform 10 kilometers away, and build another base. With only lone parts that are not connected to docking ports or landing legs you can build way bigger bases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smorfty","CreatedById":59234,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T09:42:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWon\u0027t they still make you lag though?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T12:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI came up with a similar idea where you can have one base section built.

I think the lag is a effect of the parts tree getting too long with large craft / stations / bases , so each physics cycle is harder to calculate than doing small craft / stations / bases as the parts tree is smaller and easier to get through. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a guess though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ronny","CreatedById":71174,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T19:35:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EASnogarD, My guess is that the joints themselves are the processor demanding tasks.

KSP tends to run quicker when several entities are consolidated into one, for instance, if you had a laggy space station, you would increase lag by about 2x if you undocked all the modules. if you hook them to gether with kas, as well as using a crane to move them, lag is less, and lag is also less likely to destroy your base using a crane than landing via skycrane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ronny","CreatedById":71174,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T19:59:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFestivefire, you say space stations lag less if you add joints?
