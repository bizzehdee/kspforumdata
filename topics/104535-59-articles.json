If you only plan to use reworked parts (as I do), then you only need the plugin from the 2.0.6 release and the parts of your choice.\n\nIn that case just latest beta and then Zodius\u0027s parts (they don\u0027t have any overlapping files so there is no particular order). If you do need the legacy parts, then your order is fine, except that the Sequencer is not updated yet for KSP 1.2, I plan to do it tomorrow."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-18T18:42:54Z","Content":"{ KSP Version 1.1.3 and earlier }\n\nProblem: IR parts and parts attached to them drift over time.\n\nHow it happens: Ships, that change \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E a lot, even if I sit through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E chage at 1x time warp and ship is current vessel, IR parts and parts attached to IR parts shift a little.
