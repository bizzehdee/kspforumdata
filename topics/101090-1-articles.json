There are almost no circumstances where just saying \u0022Earth\u0022 would not be correct and unambiguous given context. However, it seems that some phrases sound better with the definitive article, because they are established as common phrases in the english language. Being the one solitary home of humanity for so long (it still is, as of this post) made it special enough that it just feels right to emphasize that it is the one, singular Earth that is being mentioned. The article has become embedded in a number of established phrases, like \u0022the face of the earth\u0022, which is likely also a big reason why \u0022the Earth\u0022 is generally accepted and fairly widespread.\n\nI normally just use whichever sounds best.
