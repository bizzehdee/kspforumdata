That will work better for an aircraft-like vessel such as an X-wing replica which has a defined \u201Ctop\u201D and \u201Cbottom\u201D as you\u2019ll be able to adjust the controls on the top and bottom wings in pairs rather than having them all do the same thing as you\u2019d get with axial symmetry and removing some parts, plus any cosmetic differences between the upper and lower wings would be easier to replicate; you\u2019d also avoid the weirdness of having parts snap to the new symmetry number after removing some parts from symmetry (e.g. putting parts on with 6-fold symmetry then removing 2, if you try to move the remaining parts they\u2019ll automatically snap to 4-fold (90 degree) symmetry instead of holding the 60/120 degree spacing they had before).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
