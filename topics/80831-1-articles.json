I try to get the science instruments first, so that I can maximize the science yield from every mission. The truth is, you can complete the entire tech tree without leaving the Kerbin/Mun/Minmus area. The trick is to be thorough, and how to do so is not exactly obvious when you get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome points that will help you extract all the science: (a lot of this you probably know already)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEach science instrument can have one result (stored data) in it at a time, but you can pull that data out with an EVA, and store it in your command pod. You can only store one sample of each type in any given command pod (no exact duplicates), but you can use the experiment over and over again (except the goo canister and science jr. materials bay, both of which can also be re-used, but only when attached to a science lab). As a result, you\u0027ll want to do EVAs to get your science and put it in the command pod, and use the experiments again, in another location.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can get science from the surface, atmosphere, low orbit, and high orbit at each location. Splashed down on Kerbin is another separate location.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbin, Mun, and Minmus have multiple biomes, which count as separate science locations. Some instruments can use the biomes as separate locations while over them in low orbit, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can take more than one of each experiment with you, and use the extra instruments to hold additional copies of data. That is, let\u0027s say you have two thermometers. Take two readings on the surface, store on in the pod, and leave the other thermometer alone. You\u0027ll get a little more of the science total available in that location.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou get a lot more science for taking the data back to Kerbin for recovery than by transmitting. You can also get samples from the same location more than once, with diminishing returns.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can do an EVA report in each location (landed, space, etc).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can take a soil sample landed in each biome.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can do a crew report in each place as well. This makes the command pod act like an experiment. You can store crew reports from multiple locations by getting out, pulling the data from it (as if it were an experiment), and then getting back in, which moves it to the data storage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to routinely bring back around 500 science from each moon landing, and filled out my tech tree by flying those missions over and over again. But at the time, I forgot about getting low-altitude space data, and didn\u0027t know that you could store more than one crew report by pulling them out of the pod and sticking them back in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you make an effort to land all over the moons with all of the instruments (particularly the seismometer and gravioli detector), you can get ridiculous amounts of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do biome-hopping with the landers (say, visit 3 or 4 biomes with every mission), you can bring back science in the 4 digits each time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, the nuclear engines aren\u0027t required for everything. In fact, Duna and Eve are easy to get to with one-way probes.

What I mean is: the thermometer or the goo get one experiment called \u0022at space high at the Mun\u0022. The gravioly thing gets \u0022at space high at the Mun poles\u0022, \u0022at space high at the Mun Far East Crater\u0022 and so on. OTOH The barometers end up less useful since, initially, they can only be used at Kerbin, where research doesn\u0027t yield too much science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a mod called KSP Science Library which let\u0027s you see what science you are missing and you can get. So, for instance, you go to the Mun in a manned pod with a gravioly thingy. As you warp to your destination, the mod will show you when you can get \u0022EVA space high above Kerbin\u0027s Mountains\u0022 and the same for the Gravioli, so you\u0027ll be able to notice and harvest a lot of science on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also another mission profile you can use - I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s cost efficient in 0.24, but you aren\u0027t going by costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou send a space station to Minmus containing the left over fuel tanks for getting there, a docking port and a Mobile Lab (the big heavy one). You send a lander to Minmus with all the science equipment. You pick all the science in a biome, go to the space station, you store all the science in the Mobile Lab and you use it to reset the Science Jr lab and the goo canisters. Refuel and hop back to a different biome. Since you might have gotten the \u0022at space low over Minmus biome\u0022 while in orbit, you might use your lander to hop through a few biomes before RV, provided you equip it with two or three Science Jr. and Goo canisters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mobile Lab will quickly accumulate several dozen experiments, and can do two things. First, you\u0027ll probably need to send a tanker to refuel it, unless you\u0027re playing with the kethane mod (and in that case, you\u0027re sending the tanker from Minmus instead of Kerbin). Second, while your lander keeps hoping through the biomes, you can send a cheap manned ship to RV with the station (it\u0027s probably faster and more cost effective to send it along with some of the larger ships). You don\u0027t actually need to dock it. Just park it close by, EVA your newly arrived kerbal to the Mobile Lab, take all the experiments, hop back to your small ship and head back to Kerbin with all the experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way, you\u0027ll be retrieving all the science while your lander still keeps jumping all over Minmus biomes. Once you\u0027re done, you can repeat the same at the Mun. You\u0027ll soon max the science tree that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don\u0027t forget that you can reach \u0022Space high above the Sun\u0022 long before you get a transfer window to another planet.
