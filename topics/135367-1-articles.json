Me, an avid kerbal lover, I want to incorporate KSP in any way. I have to propose a problem, give a possible solution for the problem, and execute the project I made. It would be a cool way to integrate KSP into school. I can download mods too if the problem requires it.\u00A0I just would like your guy\u0027s thoughts and ideas for a problem that I could solve.
