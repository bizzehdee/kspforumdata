Conservation increases the confidence interval in both directions in this case, not just in one direction. I mean there are some folks that still hold the C/H tMRCA to 2.5 million years, which could be true to some extent, but if one looks at the common gene thresholds most of the genetics points well above the first tMRCA estimated by Sarich in the 1970s.

But the precedence in the science history of paleontologicals is that confidence limits based on observables are almost never correct and almost never broad enough. This is why time and time again we have branchpoints replaced beyond the confidence limits. Thus the correct answer is if you can establish a conservative anchor point, for example phototrophs existed 2.8 billion years ago, then the problem is in assessing earlier confidence as to when they existed, its not being liberal, its simply stating that with numerous knowns missing, its really hard to say what these are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that this sounds like obfuscating the argument, \u003Cem\u003Ebut the real obfuscator is the discovery process\u003C/em\u003E, unfortunately its looking the gift horse in the mouth, but occassionally looking in the mouth finds a horse with weird teeth. It has proved itself to be problematic time and time again, because almost all entry processes are plagued by logical errors and subjective assumptions.

That is a difference between two estimates of 0.23. The current estimate of the origin of life is between 3.3 and 4.2 that variation is around 0.9, even if we argue phototrophs at 0.5 and it were not to be true, the statistical variance of the first case is still twice as great. All the paper is arguing is that evidence exists that phototrophs evolved sooner. The we threw arsenic into the equation, a red herring. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efundementally this is not about the age, all though ages have a meaning. Its about the process of examination. Sobtwo theories lets set them side by side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheory 1 life evolved on mars first or earth first and was transporter to the other ir life evolved independently. There are three or more possibilities however one is right the others are not, in part or in full. alternative example is arsenic. This an argument concernig playsible alternatives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheory 2 major is the assessment of a relative timeframe in which photo synthesis evolved. In this occupation the ranges if when life and when photosynthesis evolved are changing with new data. In this case the major facts are not in question life arose before phototrophs. In fact chemosynthesis and a variety of energy generation schemes had developed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not obfuscating reality. So the critical issue is not the basics, its in the obsevations, what qualifies as an observation. The problem is that the criteria are completely different because of the founding logic. How come\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets say last year life was estimated to be 3.0 billion years in age, it woukd be sikky to look for older phototrophs, and all the phototroph evidence older than this date would either go unobserved or interpreted to mean something else. Unfortunately this is the way science works, but its the lingua franca so we wont go there. This year the age of life is reestimated at 3.8. So what about data from last year regarding the overlooked evidence of phototrophs is it now evidence, nope. So the problem here is perspective. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour basic argument is that this is one evidence, that is true, but up until about ten years ago that evidence would have been disregarded as meaningless, even as people are presenting even more controversial theories about life during the late heavy bombardment period. this is not the first time this has happened in PA, it happens repeatedly. It like the evidence for symbolic art, the problem is not that we have shockingly old dates for symbolic art, the MAJOR problem is that past generations a paleontologist summarily excluded the possibility. It was in fact one find, blombos cave, that blew the doors open. Once peoples eyes were open, then all of a sudden many artefacts of the same age appeared. So basically for 100 years of study the limit to symbolic art was 30ky and then one new find and it jumps to basically 100 ky. But even do these reformulators were dragged kicking and screaming by evidence from human DNA that AMH and there cognatove capacities must have migrated from africa, the reason we weren\u0027t finding them in africa is we expected them to have evolved not-there which was a leading belief of people who were born not-there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENature does not change for our finds, the most important point is the new finds reveal our bias and ignorance.
