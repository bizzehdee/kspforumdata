That\u0027s why we use those light-up buttons for things like SAS - they\u0027re about the only thing that has a collider that a player can click, and a way to animate it to provide feedback. I like the first switch, too - I\u0027d see it as a \u0022pull out / push in\u0022 plunger switch, but we\u0027d need a modeler to create one that has a collider and an animation before it can be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with most of the labeled instruments is that the label is built into the texture, so someone would have to take the original texture, edit that one little part, and export it as a new texture. That can add up pretty quick if it\u0027s being used extensively. The beauty of the ASET props is that they\u0027re designed to take advantage of RPM features, which is why you can have over a dozen push buttons that need only a single texture sheet for labels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andy81le","CreatedById":95393,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T19:42:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to implement getting science readings through RPM.
