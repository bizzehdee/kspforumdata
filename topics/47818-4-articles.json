If it moves, it\u0027s a control surface, and that includes the AV-R8 winglet. If it doesn\u0027t move, it\u0027s a \u0022Winglet\u0022, and that includes the swept wing and so on -- because of the confusion, I call them control surfaces and wings, respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wing gives lift that varies with \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Ecos(AoA \u002B 90) (1 - abs(cos(AoA \u002B 90))) cos(AoA)\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you multiply this by the lift value of the wing, the air speed, and the air pressure to get a force in kN. The direction is perpendicular to the velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat wing lift function increases until about 25.7 degrees. Then it slowly goes to zero as we approach 90 degrees. You never get a hard stall, you just slowly lose lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe control surface gives lift that varies with cos(AoA \u002B 90). So it goes up and up until 90 degrees. At 90, I believe it continues (and thus begins to fall), but I\u0027m less certain of that conclusion since a bunch of signs flip. I\u0027ll have to experiment -- so far I\u0027ve cared mostly about low angle of attack behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: contrary to real life, the canard loses lift after the wing.
