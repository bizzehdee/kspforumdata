Today as I was about to stage, the screen flashed as the heat effects kicked in. That\u0027s normal. Staged, then noticed a glowing white sphere following me to orbit. It followed all the way to Mun. I thought it was either a glitch from the heatshield or the surface lights. I added both just before launch to a craft I had been testing. Anyway, it was quite exciting for Jeb. On the return trip I ran low on fuel. Dipped the Pe down to 35k and came in at 3km/s. Had to roll the ship a few times to lose some heat. No problem. I think I have this heat thing conquered. However, the UFO shot out of my ship several times once the chutes deployed. Is it possible beings from another world stowed away on my craft to steal my fuel and that\u0027s why I ran low?
