They have 1.108M and 1.445L which puts them as G0V. Maybe I will tweak one to be a bit larger and so on for realism, but they share a barycrnter and orbit each other every day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis configuration puts a habitable zone at 1.7AU (64GM in JNSQ scale), and orbiting every 365 days. All the other planets from LSR have been repositioned into the system to give a starting kick off of\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E18\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ebodies. Revan will not be the homeworld, it\u2019s too far out. Instead\u2026 well, the community will have to come up with a body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo come up with a body:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nState the name of the body. If it has one. If not, it will be put up for naming. You can also name some of my LSR bodies as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nState the radius and gravity of the body. It\u2019s in JNSQ scale, where Kerbin for reference has 1600km and 1G. Make it realistic and i\u2019ll tweak if necessary. Larger bodies get denser and bodies further away that are icy are less dense, and as a rule of thumb a double in radius= a double in gravity or slightly more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is an atmosphere, say so and specify what it\u2019s composed mainly of. I will calculate stuff like the atmosphere height myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, state the orbital parameters (semi major axis and parent body), as well as a brief description of the body like it\u2019s color and overall terrain, as well as some specifications that may be needed like a high inclination, rings or eccentricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your planet is in the way of another, it may be sent into a trojan orbit or relocated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease hold back on habitable planets and make them interesting rather than what Vera (a clitche habitable planet is like). (In LSR, Revan is somewhat cold and heavy (and also the homeworld), Perbi has more gravity than Eve and double the radius and Heyu doesn\u2019t have oxygen which technically doesn\u2019t even make it habitable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nplease.suggest.moons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you would like to name a body, please specificy which one it is using provisional code or name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the name is in use, you will be quoted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProvisional names work the same way as LSR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nshould this be forum games?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni will *try* to make the body myself if the suggestions go slowly, but i\u2019m also looking to recruit developers.
