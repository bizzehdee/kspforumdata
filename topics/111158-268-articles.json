I got the chance to find out with the help of one of the mods a while back. I had wondered the same thing and a thread was unlocked by the mod specifically to find out. In a coordinated effort between us the thread was unlocked and my test post was loaded into the editor and I signaled my ready status and the thread was locked with my post in the editor. I got the signal it was locked and tried to post. The post failed. The thread lock takes temporal precedent over a post.
