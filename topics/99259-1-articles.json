Here is my perspective on this and some of the subsequent underlaying matters at play:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) There are no \u0022Engineers\u0022 in space. Where as there are \u0022space-going\u0022 engineers who are trained (on the ground by the way) in engineering, they are not permitted to do any real seat of the pants engineering in space except under the precise supervision of ground based engineering teams. The space guys convey observations about the situation to the ground guys who come up with any plans for repair, etc. It is called \u0022MISSION CONTROL\u0022 for a reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) [off-topic] I feel confident that a sensible person can make the same argument against scientists and pilots but let\u0027s let that one go for the moment - with the understanding that the \u0022Kerbal Role Train\u0022 has already left the station ---\u0026gt; (theme from 1970s Soul Train tele show playing in the background please..)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The exhibited comms behaviour by Squad is such that an intelligent person can easily interpret the entire Role and Experience elements of KSP as being designed \u0022off-the cuff\u0022 so to speak, with no overarching \u0022Systems Thinking\u0022 model which can be reasonably deduced - rather individual subsystems which require \u0022Balancing\u0022. Balancing is a natural component of an properly integrated system - reinforcing and balancing loops contribute to systems finding natural harmony or spiralling off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Regardless of whether one wishes to Role Play their Kerbals through an experience tree or not, it remains THE PLAYER who is in control of the game, the space program and all missions. As I have mentioned in other threads and posts, using experience to artificially introduce limited player information (including important dV) should be considered a negative, synthetic, and ultimately \u0022immersion breaking\u0022 concept.
