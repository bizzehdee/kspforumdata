I use air brakes for re-entry and they are extremely effective. You do not have to restrict yourself to only using them for aircraft. Not only do they slow the craft but they do the other important job of increasing drag at the back and so keeping the heat shield orientated into the wind.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou just have to make sure is that your air brakes \u003Cem\u003Ewhen deployed\u003C/em\u003E (and anything else you don\u0027t want to lose) are within an imaginary tube extending back from the heat shield. You can achieve this by careful placement and rotation of the air brakes at build time and does not necessarily involved clipping. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-11T06:29:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2016 06:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T14:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222507263\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136409\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460336544\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111592\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nater662\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, nater662 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerobrake into slow yourself down.
