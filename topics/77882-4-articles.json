However i am guessing that you are meaning theres 1 I2C bus and 1 SPI. Yes you can only read from 2 chips at any particular instant. But in many cases you can read and store values from several sensors several times a second. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany drones that run off of arduino are pulling from a gyro, compass, barometer, accelerometer, and sometimes the gps chip, all with the same spi wires (just with a different control line)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso on the note of gps shutting off at an altitude... i cant really help with that part, ive never tried to get an unlocked gps chip.

Needed 3 pins for the spi, and then for the trigger lines to the different sensors, i had 4 shift registers set up in series (3 more pins), they\u0027d just kick out a single 1, followed by 31 0s and as the 1 would get shifted through, and trigger 1 of them at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet it up just right with your data logger program, and you never need more than 6 pins to control \u0022infinite\u0022 amounts of spi chips (you will run into clockspeed problems with the shift registers though)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso as far as this balloon project, most of it could be hand prototyped on a small board oneself, or if you want a full sensor package. The 100-200 of a several sensors in 1 shield, might actually save you money and time in the long run. (3in1 sensor chips are always helpful too.
