They had almost nothing to do with\u00A0the console port, that was a separate company. As a result, porting to console had no affect on development of the PC version. If you want stuff to be fixed, complain to the company that ported the game. Squad will just keep ignoring you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes. External company ported the game. But:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Squad is still the company that ordered this port, tested the result and said it is OK to release in this state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Blitz ported the game. But Squad provided the source code. It may be tricky to find out who is to blame. Considering two different developers (one experienced port developer without issues with other ported games) created two separated ports that resulted in very similar results, one may argue that actually source code is written poorly (and changing controls breaks whole game). In properly written game, changing the GUI should not change behaviour like \u0022you can recover vessels from space now\u0022 \u0022two ships are recovered together after undocking\u0022 \u0022progress is ignored and revereted to old state\u0022. In these cases it is difficult to decide who to blame. By common sense I expect that contract to \u0022port the game to consoles\u0022 does not include \u0022also rewrite our poor coding please\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) The communication!!! Mistakes can happen. Bugs can happen. But since summer 2016 console players are basically ignored. With no info what is going to happen. After broken game was relesed there were 6 months of total silence. Then there was info \u0022going to be released early 2017\u0022. Then few months of total silence again and then periodic weekly empty info \u0022we are working on it. For real now\u0022. Then the game was released. Broken again. And there is again no info. Only pr stuff like\u00A0 \u0022we fixed something, and there will be patch somewhen\u0022. You can imagine why players are angry. If they said \u0022Sorry, we nened another two years. Look forward for new versions in 2020\u0022 I believe they would save themself lots of hate on the forums. But if they again plan to ingore the customers and provide only default empty PR answers, customer wont be happy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlitz did not created did port, but these lot they should take responsibility for.
