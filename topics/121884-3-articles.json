I know, from my personal knowledge of physics and engineering, and the arguments given here, that \u003Cem\u003Eultimately\u003C/em\u003E laser weapons are the only way to go, because there is no way to stop the beams and if at least 2 beam frequencies are in use, no way to reflect them. However, I also know that the enormous pieces of equipment, weighing thousands of tons, needed to generate and focus even soft x-ray beams may mean there is a brief period of time before anyone invests that much money where simpler kinetic weapons may rule the day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Current space telescopes can hold an attitude with 0.007 arsecs of accuracy, that gives us that the maximum engagement distance is of 83000 kilometers. Lets also say that the approach speed is of 6 kilometers per second, which is sort of reasonable considering the distance between colonies and the orbital mechanics associated (say a moon colony vs GEO colony). That gives us an engagement time of almost 4 hours, that doesnt seem too long actually.

(adjustable elements in the telescope). This lets you calibrate for conditions, as you can empirically discover the correct set of mirror settings this way. You could do the calibration much faster by using several laser frequencies and several sets of mirrors and adjusting each mirror asymmetrically. \u003Cp\u003EThis will stop systematic errors that are constant during the calibration period. Once you are zeroed in and have a narrow patch of laser light impinging on the enemy hull, burning a hole or just warming the surface, you can correct for small attitude errors by adjusting as the beam tracks due to attitude error. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, yeah, in some cases, I think the beam would kind of wobble over the enemy spacecraft, semi-randomly damaging different parts of it.

They would also be fearsome things at closer ranges, so no CIWS required to back them up. And much over their range, relativistic effects ruin the party anyway. Given that, the appetite for exotic X-Ray FEL lasers measuring kms in length, I think, will be small to nonexistant, for a long time. Such size of weapon almost counts as a fixed installation by default, and fixed installations are kinetic fodder. So yeah, in a sense, \u0022macross missile spam\u0022 makes sense, but with unguided projectiles to overwhelm CIWS of fixed installations.

And you certainly must count that the enemy will have a good read on your general capabilities, and won\u0027t be very far from them. I think in these scenarios, the laser drones I described in the other thread make a lot of sense... it will be a very ablative battle, as each side progressively losses weapon and sensor platforms as they start coming into range of each other, while trying to keep some active for later on. Dense volume of concentrated fire, or ablative defense in depth? I guess that depends on who thinks that he has the upper hand...
