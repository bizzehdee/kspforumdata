So this Sunday I started learning C# to make an add-on for Kerbal pace Program! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Since at the time in my Kerbal career I was struggling with making a reusable skycrane lifter, I figured I\u0027d make something to assist with that. I had just finished reading Peter F. Hamilton\u0027s Void trilogy, and the Regrav drive technology in that universe which seems to work best at low altitudes and badly in space seemed like a decent point of departure. I shall call it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPyrron Spacefaring, Inc. - Antigravity\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to create a working prototype in game as a proof of concept, which I\u0027m demonstrating here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/c2Uq4bHHWbY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that video, the antigravity force applied is constant. It is always applied in a direction away from the current SOI\u0027s center of gravity, so as you can see in orbit, it has the same effect as a radial burn - moving the Pe down and Ap up 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from where the craft is located in its orbit. This is just a first proof of concept, so those big colorful arrows are just visual debugging tools that won\u0027t be in the final add-on \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, my intention with this isn\u0027t to be a free propulsion device... I want it to be useful, but not overpowered to the point of cheating. It should fill a niche, and add interesting gameplay complexity. So I got some help from a friend (who is actually an aerospace engineer) coming up with a formula to make the antigravity force dynamic: it now scales with distance from the current planet\u0027s sea level, decreasing the higher you go. I thought about making it independent from the planet\u0027s radius and depend just on local gravity alone, but that turned out to be inconvenient to model in a way that makes it useful on more than one planet. (I\u0027ll probably revisit this later though, maybe scale it so higher gravities require more resources, or something like that.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a chart of what it could look like on different planets:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://stuff.pyrron.com/psi-agchart1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022psi-agchart1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe AG factors mentioned are AG strength and attenuation, and can be set per part. The different graphs show the effect of the same factors on different bodies. The vertical axis shows the difference between AG strength and gravity at that altitude. At 0 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 is the equilibrium point, where AG force and gravity cancel each other out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current \u0022development plan\u0022 is to keep working on it whenever I need a break from writing my thesis, so updates are probably going to be intermittent.
