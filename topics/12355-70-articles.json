Basically, an ascent turning into a landing at the apoapsis. This would be useful in a number of situations, for example when launching probes to the anomalies on Kerbin, or if travelling between bases on the same planet/moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) direct descent, ie. when entering the SOI of a planet you land directly at a (specified) location without first establishing an orbit. Not sure if this is cheaper or more expensive in delta-v, but it could be useful for low-grav moons and for impact probes, if you want to hit a specific spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castun","CreatedById":4581,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T12:20:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Innuce\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Innuce\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have repeated this maneuver a half dozen times now, same result.
