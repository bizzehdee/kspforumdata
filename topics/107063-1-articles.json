Not necessarily what they are, but how it\u0027s decided what show.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a friend try playing it, got a contract to Land on the Mun, he barely did it and got back (was more a fluke that he did actually), and then he got a contract to do 3 temperature burns on Jool? O.o; 2 for Duna, and another for one of Jools moons. x.x;;; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShouldn\u0027t these contracts go in order and gradually get you into the game based off of Delta V requirements, and what you\u0027ve successfully accomplished? You nkow.. stepping stones.. gradually upwards... yea! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now it seems to be ok, 1 -good job you launched a rocket!-, 2 - Great you exited the atmosphere!- , 3 -nice! you landed on the Mun!- , 4-puts you in a catapult kerbal style- Fire! -Go to another atmosphere planet, even though you\u0027ve not even learned how to exit Kerbins SOI, let alone rendevous with another planet, land on it, then take off, and come BACK! Yea! You can do it!\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings which are missing, or need to be added to fill in the -gaps- of difficulty. IMO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Add a 1 time contract to leave Kerbins SOI and return to Kerbin before unlocking contracts to go to other planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Split up the \u0022Explore planet\u0022 1 time contracts into smaller individual parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Make contracts calculated off of what you\u0027ve done, and total Delta V estimated to be required to accomplish the contract. Example: A Contract to go to Gilly would show far earlier than a contract to land on EVE due to Delta V requirements, and contracts to go to other planets wouldn\u0027t show until after you\u0027ve accomplished contracts to go to Minmus and the Mun, and SOI. (Or if you\u0027ve by passed those and went to another planet yourself already, then they\u0027d unlock based off of the Delta V of the planet you successfully got too). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Add more contracts for Planes.. like seriously please... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Add contracts for space planes specifically... please... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Add Contracts for more \u0022station\u0022 style setups.. like \u0022Position a new Refueling Station above Jool, that can hold x amount of x fuel as close to the orbit as possible, or \u0022Add a new science base on the Mun with at least 1 science pod and yada yada yada with at least 1 extra docking port\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Add more contracts that deal with parts already in space. (Using the above Jool station for example) \u0022Add 3 more x Fuel to the Jool Station with at least 1 extra Docking port\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) (If possible) Add Contracts that relate to situations currently player made.. (Like you crashed a ship on the Mun...again). \u0022Rescue x Kerbal from x\u0022 Which, your target is the poor kerbal from the previous mission. (Ok, so for these maybe you shouldn\u0027t get a \u0022pay out\u0022 since it\u0027s your own fault for them being there, but a boost to your standings would make sense, since you are proving that even if you do mess up you can back up your mistakes) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Change \u0022for 10 seconds\u0022 thing, because it doesn\u0027t make sense.. anyone can put a random rocket into an unstable orbit for 10 seconds.. (even if the contract says \u0022Stable orbit for 10 seconds\u0022 it can be in an unstable orbit and still count for 10 seconds). Instead increase these too several days or hours depending on difficulty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) Put Satelite in orbit Contracts, give us ticking science... I know there are mods which make satelites and what not give science, and yada yada but in the stock game there is ZERO point to them except to waste space, time, money, and precious RAM to the 3.5k cap KSP has... If you complete a \u0022Satelite in orbit\u0022 Contract, give us a lump sum of science \u002B a ticking amount of science per day for x days depending on difficulty and location of the \u0022satelite\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you can make it more interesting.. \u0022Science\u0022 Satelites in orbit will give a ticking science for x days for x amount depending on difficulty and location. \u0022Communications Satelite\u0022 will give you a bonus multiplier to your next accepted contract, and once complete will give you that bonus. Example: You put a \u0022 Communications Satelite\u0022 in orbit around the Mun, your next Contract you take gives you a x2 to your earnings and science for that 1 contract once completed if around the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) Keep up the good work! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional suggestions: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Add a Delta V chart for your planes and rockets.. I know there are 2 great mods for this, but it really should be in the stock game for those who don\u0027t like to use mods. It really is a necessity not a luxury. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Possibly put \u0022Recommended Delta V\u0022 on contracts? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E List the \u0022Recommended\u0022 total Delta V: For instance.. A contract to go to the Mun, land, and come back, would have a Delta V \u0022Recommended Requirement\u0022 that would safely get you there and back. (Extremely helpful for beginners). (This IMO is really required for Career Mode. You don\u0027t have the luxury as a new player to waste time building 20 rockets to figure out the amount of engines, thrust, etc. you need to go to each planet.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Make the \u0022Recommended Delta V\u0022 unlock as you upgrade the Tracking Station (but flawed, could be anywhere between 1000 to little or 1000 to much randomly). Make the \u0022Recommended Delta V\u0022 Help Tip on contracts more accurate for each planet depending on if you\u0027ve sent a satellite there. (Also another way to make Satellites actually worth launching) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) A tutorial on Delta V for the beginners, and even more advanced players who still really have no clue what it is or how it works, and why they are only torturing themselves for not knowing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T03:15:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 03:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LadyAthena\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe whole base contracts of Delta-V requirements is flawed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting say a satillite over Jool requires the same Delta-V as getting a station over it.

Just because someone can \u0022cheat the system\u0022 By using rockets for everything doesn\u0027t mean there shouldn\u0027t still be things there perfectly capable of being completed with just plane parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for \u0022Space planes\u0022.

(With mods btw, 15 un used satelites can be a bother in orbit of Kerbin, especially if you\u0027re like me and don\u0027t like to click the terminate button on anything) The point was, there should be a reason for it..

First you\u0027d need to unlock the highest tier of Tracking Station, then ontop of that to get the Delta V Requirements that may or may not end up not being enough, you\u0027ll need to send satelites there yourself to knock that number closer to the actual range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand what you mean by \u0022Oh god do I have enough fuel?\u0022 But you have to remember not having enough Delta V is actually low on the reasons of why most people get that \u0022oh god no\u0022 moment. I know how much Delta V it takes to get to most planets, but I still mess up my burns, burn too long, and or simply do something foolish while flying that wastes my Delta V and I often get into a \u0022oh crap\u0022 situation for fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of that, again.. you still need to build your rockets right and learn how too, screwing up your rocket in how you built it could still net you the \u0022not enough fuel\u0022 problem. Consider this: You know it takes 5,000 Dv to get to Duna, land and return (yea I know that\u0027s hella off, but just for an example), You make a ship with 5,100 Dv, and think you\u0027re golden. Now comes to landing on Duna, you realize you still have half a tank under your landing gear, and you\u0027re gonna need to jettison it to land, but that now knocks you UNDER the required Dv to get back home.... You gone dun messed up.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example that has happened to me countless times before is using under powered engines for a situation. I remember many times trying to exist the SOI of Duna, Jool, or other larger planets, I was using inferior engines for the gravity well and being too close in orbit.. I wasted to much extra Dv required and didn\u0027t have the fuel to get back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are countless mistakes beginners will make even knowing the rough estimation of dv required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing the Delta v is anything but a \u0022cheat sheet\u0022 Since there are countless things that can go wrong still....\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T04:02:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 04:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LadyAthena\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WOODY01","CreatedById":129358,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T04:07:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like your suggestions, I do not agree with the more plane contracts, all of the surveys on Kerbin I have done with planes and some of those planes needed a rocket motor to complete the contracts.
