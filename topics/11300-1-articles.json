This engine can work both as a ramjet in atmosphere as well as a conventional bipropellant rocket engine using onboard liquid oxygen once there\\\u0027s no air. When Reaction Engines Limited or anyone else for that matter go build a spaceplane they\\\u0027re not going to go \u0027hey, let\\\u0027s put some jet engines on the plane that use kerosene and then add a rocket engine running on LOX/LH2 for final orbital burn\u0027 and end up carrying three different kind of liquid on the plane. They\\\u0027re going to get their engines to run off the same fuel plus some oxidizer for the rocket.\n\nSo with a splaceplane it\\\u0027s not a question of \u0027how much jet fuel vs how much rocket fuel to carry\u0027 but rather \u0027what\\\u0027s the ratio between fuel and oxidizer\u0027 that the plane will carry given a fixed flight profile. So instead of thinking we\\\u0027re adding rocket fuel and jet fuel to our splaceplanes think of as adding just \u0027tankage\u0027 to the plane and the little Kerbal engineers will work out the exact details on the fuel vs oxidizer ratio for that tankage space. It\\\u0027s only fair since we have no precise control over this ratio ourselves.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You can land on the liquid fuel engines, but you cant on the aerospike....
