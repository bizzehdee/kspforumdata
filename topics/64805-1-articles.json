Even adding FAR wont change things too drastically as the terminal V at sea-level is still fairly low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did something similar to you, rocket-powered cars are awesome. I use the Minmus flats usually for drag-racing. As you pointed out, downforce is the tricky bit. Seems from your screenshot that you are using RCS for the downforce. Depending on the mass of your car you may have more luck with LFO burning engines for that aspect. I use ants (lv-1) or the little rockomax 48S quite often to stick the thing to the ground, just dont get carried away and add too much downward thrust as i snapped a number of wheel-bases before 0.23 brought us thrust limiters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve long suspected that the reason (or part of it) why minmus drag-cars liftoff is that the curvature of that world is so small. If you enable SAS before starting your run then the car will slowly increase it\u0027s \u0027Angle of Attack\u0027 as you burn across the flats. It\u0027s trying to hold the heading you began with, which is now above the horizon. Try with the SAS off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the other fun part of drag races across the minmus flats is that when (not if) you fail to stop in time, the slope at the end of the flat is often enough to punt the car into minmus escape (think Harvey Wedstone in The Darwin Awards and his rocket-powered Chevy)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-05T17:20:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2014 05:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
