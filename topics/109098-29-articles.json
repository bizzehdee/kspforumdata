Small craft that have a lot of fuel in tanks might not be able to take off fully loaded, but once you reach distant spot, fuel will be consumed and you will be able to take off vertically too. Might not look on the first sight, but craft actually have quite low drag. Such low drag allows supersonic velocity over 1 mach with single J33 engine that was originally not even designed for supersonic flights. For that reason you can\u0027t fly long on high speeds due to overheating, but 0.80 or 0.90 mach can be sustained for longer times. Stable craft design also allow maximum time acceleration without issues. That makes this craft a good choice for science exploration early in career.

A couple were basically Eurocanards, which I find a bit boring, although the Yakovlev one has a nifty cranked delta and interesting lines. Two ideas that really jumped out at me: a Mikoyan tailless semi-delta (not sure what else to call it), and a Sukhoi which was basically a single engined, kawaii flanker with canards. I attempted to make both.The MiG didn\u0027t come out quite the way I intended, but it\u0027s fast, if a little ugly. I decided it would make a good ground attack plane. The Sukhoi, though, is awesome. It ended up with a much more blended body than the original, partly because I wanted to see what I could get away with using B9 procedural parts.

Thanks [@tetryds](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/50204-tetryds/), I was just tired and couldn\u0027t remember how to do albums.\n\nAlso, if anyone does download the planes and is using DD, the Crow is set up for it but has very conservative settings. You can afford to be a lot more aggressive with the controls than I\u0027ve allowed.\n\n[edit edit edit] Just realised the \u0027unarmed\u0027 Crow had a flipping BD radome. All fixed now.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/wMSIG/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-06T07:09:42Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2016 07:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Doke**"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T03:14:42Z","Content":"[@Doke](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/149975-doke/) Try clicking the imgur image so that it shows the image link, with a .png/.jpeg on the end, like this: [http://i.imgur.com/qQhY2Wi.png](http://i.imgur.com/qQhY2Wi.png)\n\nThen just press Enter twice and your image will appear ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nI don\u0027t think people will download your airplanes without pics for them, so you can edit the images in.\n\nIf you need more help or it still does not work, please contact me and I will assist you."},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T13:58:41Z","Content":"This may be the right place to ask...\n\nI have some problems getting a craft inspired by the venture star SSTO flying properly:\n\n![4wTKqfP.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4wTKqfP.jpg)\n\nHere you can see it fly decently, nothing bad happens as long as i dont try to roll/yaw. Then this happens:\n\n![xbcwRpq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/xbcwRpq.jpg)\n\nThis is without any controll input other than a light nudge in roll or yaw. As you can see both spaceshuttle fins apply a rotational force in the same dircetion. Without seconds the craft is tumbling out of controll without any chance to recover it. This happens at high subsonic speed, but i remember haing that issue at higher speeds, too.\n\nSome details on the craft:\n\n![08CAcKZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/08CAcKZ.jpg)![GE0iePM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/GE0iePM.jpg)![l5pw4El.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/l5pw4El.jpg)\n\nIm using lots of tweak-scaled parts, due to some edits in parts the whole thing wheights only 80T empty (thats how im testing it).

Larger vertical tail surfaces - it is not enough for plane of that weight and length.\n\nMore wingspan for main wings, try to place them in a way that outmost wing tip is close to COM, just behind it works wonders for roll stability.  \n\nLess dihedral angle. Dihedirial angle on main wings help with roll stability, mut it seems you have too much. Small vertical surfaces on wingtips can also help with both - more lift from wings that have same wingspan and more roll stability.\n\nOverall craft length and weight might be too much for just small delta type wings on that craft. Consider design with main wings in the middle of hull with help of small canrads in front and some elevators on tail, it might be easier to create good craft that have similar shape without increasing wingspan too much.\n\nAlso, consider doing opposite than you already did. Put some payload in craft rather than design it with empty cargo bay. Try to put paload in a way that it does not influence shifting of COM trough length of cracft. Small  COM changes in up/down will not influence much in design process. That way your craft will be more than capable for stable craft while empty and you will have much less trouble with different sized payloads - craft wingspan will be ap\u0111ropriate for chosen payload."},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T15:32:55Z","Content":"Thanks for the tips, ill try them soon.\n\nThe payload is not relevant for atmospheric flight since this thing is designed as a reusable upper stage, it will only fly in the atmosphere without fuel/payload (or on a big booster).\n\nEdit: Now its flying way, way better! I made those tail surfaces 50% bigger (i love tweakscale), lowered the dihedirial angle of the main delta wings while placing them a tiny bit forward, also i added small vertical controll surfaces on the wingtips. Those add outward facing yellow arrows while in flight, whats the meaning of that?\n\nNow to hypersonic testing in the upper atmosphere...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-06T15:57:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2016 03:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Elthy**"},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T15:40:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 minutes ago, Elthy said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the tips, ill try them soon.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The payload is not relevant for atmospheric flight since this thing is designed as a reusable upper stage, it will only fly in the atmosphere without fuel/payload (or on a big booster).\n\u003E \n\nAnd how you plan to put it in orbit ?

In few previous versions those were turned off by default, perhaps ferram forgot to disable those for release.  \n\nIn stable flight there should not be any. It might be sign of unstable craft design, but on the other hand, it is normal to see hose in certain flight condition.\n\nIt is kind of hard to explain meaning of \u0022good\u0022 and \u0022bad\u0022 visualisation when comes to torque, that was probable reason why ferrram disable torque visualisation in previous versions - to be less confusing for people who does not understand meaning of torque forces."}]}
