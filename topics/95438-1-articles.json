Right click menus on parts in flight not following the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: Bad radial decoupling knocks off 1 of 4 radial attached engines, I want to shut off the engine on the otherside to regain balanced control,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit takes awhile to click the part (because the rocket is spinning) - well now the menu is spinning - Doh!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps being able to get the right click menus on the stagging Icons would help - or at least have the menus only move in response to user made camera adjustments or being draggable while holding a key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont realy know what the best way to handle it would be, but not having the menus follow the part the way they do now would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Tech nodes should do more then unlock parts, they should upgrade some existing parts, (I aready do this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: when reaching composites, New upgradded versions of command pods become availeable, using only extra configs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the Mk1-2 Command Pod would have a new varient (using the same model and textures), Mk1-2b Command Pod that contains more electric and more monoprop and a thermometer but at the same weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be due to the better materials and fabrication processes available as well as the miniturization of electronic components. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second gen skipper with same stats as the fist gen (but this one was in the dumpster and had a racoon living in it) but it\u0027s a little lighter - ect...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA way to put old versions in a depreciated parts catagory might be helpful to keep down the clutter, but the parts should still be accessable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso there is no appreciable performace impact by adding another config to the already existing part folders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.)
