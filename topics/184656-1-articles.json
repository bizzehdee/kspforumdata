The problem is I have never made any mods ever. I have had a look through the code and I believe I roughly understand it and I almost got it ported to 1.3.1 from 1.2.2. But it failed. Only pixelated\u00A0cloud textures show on earth\u00A0and it just shows the normal planet textures rather than making them go blank when it ran on 1.2.2. I am not sure if I can provide a GitHub link but I would really like this mod working with 1.3.1 so I can use it with Textures Unlimited. If you guys can help me to get it working I would like to try and Revive to mod to add more planets to it. I have already contacted nasa to get perms for use of super high res textures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
