Once it reached about a few kilometers above land, I think I\u00A0remember it being launched very fast to the side ( I can\u0027t remember very well).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI went to the tracking station to see what happened, and for a split second it was just above the ocean, then it suddenly shot up to space, and the speed of this thing was insane, but it\u0027s altitude wasn\u0027t changing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI checked out the rest of the debris in the tracking station, and I saw that some were on their way out of the solar system, and one of them even left the solar and went very far.

In the first image, I was going very fast despite my altitude and notice the\u00A0atmosphere meter contradicting my altitude.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the second image, you can see that that my Science Jr. and radial mount drogue chute were destroyed to some extreme heats, along with the structural linkage failure on everything.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the third image, you can see that some debris has left the solar system. It\u0027s speed is only going up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the fourth image, I think some debris is escaping the sun\u0027s gravity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI recently installed MechJeb2, however it was slightly outdated so that may have been the cause.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSorry in advance if this is the wrong place to post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-05T13:01:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s a standard Kraken attack- the game\u2019s physics engine can trip over itself and propel you to impossible speeds instantly, which is bad news if you\u2019re in an atmosphere and very bad if Kerbals are on board. If you have a save from before it happened, try loading that and reflying the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you only want to recover the science data, use a\u00A0\u003Cs\u003Escience lunchbox\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0experiment recovery cubit, which can store science experiments and samples and is much more heat-resistant than the science parts themselves. If you\u2019re trying to recover the science jr for a refund/reuse, ugly need to design your rocket carefully as the weight balance is tricky with a big but fairly light science jr under your pod; put a small fuel tank (FL-T100) under the science jr with the fuel feeds switched off to act as ballast and to protect the science jr from heat conducted through the heat shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso- never go to the tracking station when you have something you want to keep, deep\u00A0inside an atmosphere: the game will automatically erase everything below ~25km over Kerbin when it\u2019s outside of physics range (~2.5km from the active vessel\u2019s root part I believe); map view is OK for the vessel you\u2019re controlling, but in the tracking station the physics engine is purely \u2018on rails\u2019 and so nothing is active, so everything gets destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to recover stuff by just lobbing it into the lower atmosphere with some parachutes stuck to it, and to recover dropped booster stages too, try the Stage Recovery mod which can scoop up those \u2018destroyed\u2019 objects as well as any Kerbals and science on board and recover them \u00A0as if you had flown them down to the surface yourself. There are plenty of customisable options around how much of a refund you get for recovery, chances of burning up during re-entry and so on so it\u2019s a versatile and easy to use little mod that can really help a cash-strapped early space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-05T13:06:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2021 01:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NH04","CreatedById":207713,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-05T16:58:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had this happen to me once.
