So I\u0027ve optimised the Jeb out of it so it loads faster. It doesn\u0027t show quite the same level of info, for example the list of custom hangars no longer shows the count of craft in that hangar, but taking that out meant I didn\u0027t have to select a load of join tables just to get a count. It also doesn\u0027t have the list of mods that a user has used in their craft. That job has now been taken over by the ModPacks. All users now have a dynamic mod pack which you can get to by adding /my_mods or /used_mods or /uses_these_mods (I really counldn\u0027t decide which route I liked) after a username ie: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/uses_these_mods\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/katateochi/uses_these_mods\u003C/a\u003E (and there is a link to that on each users profile page now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod pack is more useful because it enables people to download a CKAN metapackage that lists those mods (or at least the ones available via CKAN) for easy installing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other slow place was the Hangars index page (/hangars). I\u0027ve changed how they function and that page has got a LOT faster at loading. I\u0027ve also jazzed up the way images are shown on that page a bit, cos I really didn\u0027t like how it was before (still not 100% happy, but it\u0027s better).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso (finally) fixed the link that lets you add craft to someone else\u0027s \u0022open\u0022 hangar from that page.

Soon you will be able to click on craft on KerbalX and send the directly to Eucl3d for printing. (will only apply for 1.0.x craft and there are some limitations about which mods can be printed).

The new interface is not enabled by default because it\u0027s still new and may have issues, but you can select to use it at the bottom of the craft edit page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt adds in a drag and drop interaction that makes it much easier to move and resize images and blocks of text and provides a couple of helpers for setting font size and color. It also lets you change which picture is used for the craft\u0027s thumbnail and prompts you to remember to set action groups, add pics etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be much more intuitive to use and it lets you be much more flexible in how you place things. In the current interface the various containers have limitations on where they can be placed so you can get areas on the page that you can\u0027t use, and the interface for moving and resizing them is clunky at best! The new interface lets you drag containers wherever you want, including on top of each other, so there is no restriction on where they can be and you can do things like put some text over an image, or have overlapping images. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft page is an example of what you can do with the new interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/KerbalXcom-Update\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/katateochi/KerbalXcom-Update\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis update also adds in some code that will bring the 3D printing feature, but it\u0027s not quite ready yet, we\u0027re still doing some tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StormKat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022StormKat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKatateochi,\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to change the order of the craft in a hangar?
