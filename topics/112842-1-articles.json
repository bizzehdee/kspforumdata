When you use it, the speeds it pushes you to at such a low altitude prevents you from doing your gravity turn low down, for fear of your rocket spinning out due to aerodynamic forces. This means you have to wait for that stage to burn out before beginning your gravity turn, but by then your apoapsis is quite high, so you get less out of performing you gravity turn. Is there any workaround to this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Theysen","CreatedById":144656,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T15:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight click the Boosters in VAB and set a thrust limit, which will reduce the acceleration and gives you even more delta V!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T15:14:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Theysen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Theysen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERight click the Boosters in VAB and set a thrust limit, which will reduce the acceleration and gives you even more delta V!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 to this. Take the mass of your ship, multiply by 9.81 (Kerbin surface gravity), multiply by 1.5 (or whatever reasonably low TWR you like), then divide by the sea-level thrust of your SRB (275 in the case of a BACC). That will give you the thrust limiter fraction to set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, consider adding fins to the back of your rocket, and/or streamlining the payload up front; will help with aerodynamic stability, and unlike SAS, its benefits scale with speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
