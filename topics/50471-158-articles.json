I don\u0027t know of any mods that can make it easier than realism, HyperEdit aside. Real Fuels, Procedural Tanks and AIES should give you plenty enough to make flying in the real solar system \u003Cem\u003Epossible\u003C/em\u003E, though. And then there\u0027s Hyper Edit, but that\u0027s basically a cheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m personally finding it SUPER useful, though. I\u0027m planning a mini Grand Tour and I need to make sure my lander will work at various locales so I zip it out with HyperEdit and test it out \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E (once the landers are finished, THEN I can design the mothership...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherBarry","CreatedById":100948,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T08:52:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bedi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bedi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt looks like the planets are aligned like on the picture from TOT (Even position of the descending node is perfect), however shouldn\u0027t Venus be on that position on the day of arrival?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E I know little about TOT (could never get it to work on mac) but yes, it seems as if Earth is in the correct departure position and Venus is in the correct arrival position, so your transfer is not going to work. Also your ascending/descending node are irrelevant to departure time, but relative inclination and normal/anti normal velocity in your departure burn. For reference, RSS starts on 1/1 1951 at 00:00, so you should be able to add your KSP Universal Time to that, and then use TOT to get an exact date rather than relying on angles.\n"}]}
