SI is a subset of metric. In metric there\u0027s many many terms for force, all related to each other by powers of 10. In SI, the standards pick just one of them and stick with it so that all your figures will be in the same scale - and the one that SI picks is newtons, not kilonewtons. Then, also the international standards groups pick the SI unit as the one for which there will be a physical standard derived from something materially existent, and then all the other metric units will be derived by multiplying that unit or dividing that unit by powers of 10. So for example, the international standards for SI mass has a kilogram bar stored in a lab in France as the basis for all the other mass measures that are derived from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and a litre is very much like a kilonewton. It\u0027s not the SI unit but it is a metric unit derivable from the SI units. Specifically it\u0027s the volume that, if filled with water, would have a mass of 1 kilogram. Much like a kilonewton is the unit of force you\u0027d get if you took the SI unit and multiplied it by 1000. It\u0027s not the SI unit, but is easily derivable from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way in which metric and SI differ is in where the \u0027base\u0027 unit sits on the powers of 10 scaling. In metric masses, the naming convention is to start from the gram and derive all the other mass units from that, so a kilogram is derived from the gram by multiplying by 1000. This is where the naming conventions come from and why \u0027gram\u0027 is the mass term that has no prefix. But in SI it\u0027s the other way around, and despite borrowing the same terminology as in metric, in SI the gram isn\u0027t in fact the base measure - it\u0027s derived. The kilogram is the base SI unit, and the gram is derived backward from that, by dividing the official kilogram definition by 1000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at any rate, this is all parenthetical to the point I made originally, which is that the claim that the units in the game don\u0027t need to be specified because they\u0027re metric is a false claim. They do need to be specified. You can\u0027t work out your TWR when mass, thrust, and gravity, are all unitless numbers, unless you know they are in the same exact scale from each other (and they aren\u0027t). When the gravioli detector tells you the gravity is 9.8, and you start to assume that means standard SI units, you\u0027ll be wrong when you come to the thrust and assume it\u0027s standard SI units (newtons) when it isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason I worked out that thrust was in kilonewtons was that I saw that mass was in tons, that gravity was 9.8 \u0022thingies\u0022, assumed that 9.8 was m/s^2, and experimentally made several rockets until I got one that hovered in place at max thrust, knowing that would be a TWR of 1.0, then working backward from that to find out that the thrust was given in kilonewtons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a silly amount of extra work to ask the user to do when you could just put a label on the unit in the display instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-22T07:52:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2014 07:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T08:52:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: @vexx32: You implied \u0022knots\u0022 is an SI term.
