When I was just wrapping up my Advanced Stock Rocketry, Station Parts Project Redux, and Colonization Parts packs however, I couldn\u0027t shake this nagging feeling of having left a job half-done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I said eff it, I\u0027m in pretty deep already, so why not just slog it right down to rock bottom?
