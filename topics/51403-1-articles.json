Due to the high eccentricity it spends much of its time over 1 specific area of land. It\u0027s useful for communications and spying on others. For example, Russians used Molniya orbits with a period of 12 hours and the apoapsis above the US during the cold war. That way they only needed 2 sats or so to make sure there was always a spysat above USA soil.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iron4venger","CreatedById":89812,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T09:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyoure welcome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9q-3mzTxC4I?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe beauty of molniya is that you need to recalculate everything for any point you want to cover down there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-01T09:20:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2013 09:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Iron4venger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T11:55:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow to make Molniya orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/ make a 70 km orbit (or 75 for some safety margin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ when you are at the exactly opposite side of Kerbin than the place you want to \u0022spy on\u0022, start burning prograde\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3/ click on PA and AP to see the numbers.
