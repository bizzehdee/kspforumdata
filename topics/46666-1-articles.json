When the ship starts landing, legs in contact with ground would give way, extending legs not in contact with ground until either the leg is fully extended, or the pressure on each leg is equal. When the engine is shut down, legs would lock in their positions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it can be done many other ways, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither curent LT-2 and LT-5 legs can be adapted to work this way, or completely new landing legs could be added for this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Floule","CreatedById":82840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T08:48:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like this idea.
