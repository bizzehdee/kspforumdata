However, one of the features it offers to counteract that is an option for the players to set a soft speed cap on their wheels where they\u0027re set up to not provide additional acceleration above the specified limit. Kinda like cruise control. I think being able to set something like this up as a tweakable for wheel parts would be really handy for driving rovers around in KSP2. Make them feel a lot less tempremental.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
