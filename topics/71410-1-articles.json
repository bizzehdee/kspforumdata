And with me I bring my long awaited (probably not but well...) Saturn style Mun rocket. It\u0027s quite part heavy (600\u002B) but I like it anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have decided that i will keep developing this rocket as a long term project, I will also upload earlier versions of the rocket to this page (you can probably find them somewhere in the cellers of the forums).But as they are older, they are also worse! Especially the first version has about a 5% chance of making it into orbit :/. I\u0027m also changing the name to fit the development section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent version is Neptune-III and has still got some issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ugly fairing around lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- stability issue in stage 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- no fairing around stage 3 engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- rover is hard to deploy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeptune-IV is under construction and will feature solutions for the given problems. If you have flown the rocket and have more problems to report, please write them down below so i can fix them for the Neptune-V.
