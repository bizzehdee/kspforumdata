But the 64bit client still offers some advantages over the 32 bit client, especially if you are using a lot of mods. Unfortunately some mods create such heavy issues, that you cannot even launch a savegame with the 64 bit client and the game will crash immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found a few comments in some threads and was starting to experiment with the following options (you need to put them behind your exe file as parameters):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-force-opengl\u003C/strong\u003E (Windows only)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake the game use OpenGL for rendering, even if Direct3D is available. Normally Direct3D is used but OpenGL is used if Direct3D 9.0c is not available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-force-d3d9\u003C/strong\u003E (Windows only)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake the game use Direct3D 9 for rendering. This is the default, so normally there\u0027s no reason to pass it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-force-d3d11\u003C/strong\u003E (Windows only)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake the game use Direct3D 11 for rendering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing d3d9 doesn\u0027t make a difference and it is the default setting. Certain mods seem to create an issue right at the beginning and the game won\u0027t start when you try to load/start a savegame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpenGL seems to avoid most of the bugs and is working so far with most of the mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDirectx11 reduces this bug a lot and it is merely happening occasionally to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth options seem much more stable than d3d9 and I get a lot less crashes. It seems that the bugs caused by the unity engine are only or at least mostly tied to Directx9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately there are also downsides to the alternatives: opengl is in my opinion not offering the same performance as directx, but it\u0027s still currently my favourite option. Dx11 seems to have a few texture glitches though since the game seems to be optimized for dx9 (minor spaces between columns of the right click menu, buttons not perfectly aligned, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo not attempt to activate threaded-optimization or to set a pre-rendered framerate. Either one will create problems with the timewarp for both the d3d11 and the openGL methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe squad can focus on dx11 in the future and make it the default rendering method.
