If I launch a few other flights do other stuff, then come back to check on the probing for Kethane, the map dosent change, so i am assuming the probes stop scanning and are turned off when not in focus or active. Is thier a way to allow them to continue to scan while not active so can do other things while it still scans other areas its orbiting?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-14T01:13:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2013 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by midnight109\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESolved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T02:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently all scanning has to be done while the probe is in focus.

It\u0027s gotta be in focus, because the mod is attached to the part, and is active only when the part is active. Also, I\u0027ve found my screensaver (blank screen) stops the mapping process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gotten some pretty good maps, but they took a long time. Put the probe into a polar orbit, do the 50x time-warp to get a rough map, then slow down to 5x and let it run overnight to fill in the top and bottom rows. (I like to switch view to \u0022free\u0022 and point the camera into space, so that the GPU doesn\u0027t work so hard during that time.) Next session, change inclination to about 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, use 10x time-warp, and let it run overnight again until the arctic regions look pretty good. Next session, change inclination to about 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 10x, and in just a few more hours your map will be nearly solid. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all that seems too compulsive, remember that a quick, rough map will give you enough data to pick a mining site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-13T15:16:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2013 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Zephram Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T15:56:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will not be able to fill the map in completely unless you are in an orbit that crosses the equator in enough unique places.
