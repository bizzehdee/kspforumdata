In my main career mode profile, I am a little bit stuck. I just completed my first orbit and I am doing a few contracts, but would very much like to land on Minmus. However, I cannot get enough science, and was wondering if someone knew a good way to get science in order to unlock parts.

Hmm, have you exploitedexplored the KSC and the areas immediately around it? Have you unlocked EVA, surface samples, and more science instruments?\n\nI was away from KSP for quite a while, so my first science gathering was in version 0.90. To figure out what I was missing, I personally found the Science Alert mod to be very handy to show me whats available.

But secondly, have you noticed how you can get science on the launchpad by name? Have you explored the crawlerway or the other KSC buildings yet? There might even be more to find in various sub-parts of each of the buildings. Plus the buildings do change and grow as you upgrade them.\n\nEDIT: If you have EVAs, low polar orbits around Mun and Minmus can make tons of science without ever landing.

A simple rover will do the trick. (If rover wheels are too far down the tech tree, you can make a poor-man\u0027s lander by putting a little rocket engine on something that\u0027s sitting on aircraft landing gear.) EVA \u002B crew report \u002B each instrument, times every building in KSC, adds up.\n\nEVA counts as a separate science result for every biome you\u0027re orbiting over, so a single orbital mission can net you a lot of science. Hop out, EVA, wait until you\u0027re over the next biome, repeat.\n\n\u0022High space\u0022 counts as a separate location from \u0022low space\u0022, so you can get another chunk of science by lobbing something up above 300 km. (Doesn\u0027t have to orbit, suborbital will do.) If you already can orbit, then you can easily get that high.\n\nIf you\u0027ve unlocked any probe cores, and you have enough dV to put a manned ship in orbit, then you can probably muster the dV to send an automated ship on a Mun flyby... moar science!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T04:21:06Z","Content":"You can get a fair amount of science by taking readings during fly-bys of Mun and Minmus without landing.

I would give you the cut-off altitudes for those, but they were changed recently and I\u0027m not sure where they are now.

I just completed my first orbit.....I have unlocked EVA\n\nRight there is the magical combo!\n\nPut a manned vehicle in low orbit around any body. Now Eva out, and and do an EVA REPORT.\n\nNote that the report is specific to the biome you are orbiting over. \n\nre-enter the pod to store, or right-click the pod and deposit the report.\n\nRepeat for each biome!\n\nThis works better if you have a polar orbit, as there are bits (Icecap, tundra) that are mostly found at the poles.\n\nKerbin alone has 9 distinct biomes, not counting the fiddly semi-biomes of the spaceport.\n\nAlso strongly consider investing in the ability to surface sample.\n\nThen whenever at the end of a mission you land in some interesting new terrain, you can not only do a crew report from the pod, but also an eva report from the surface, \\*and\\* bring a sample of the surface along for study. Science Science Science!\n\nAlso Also..\n\nremember that each science type can potentially be done in each situation. So measure on the ground at launchpad. Measure on the ground after mission. Measure in the water. Measure in high orbit, and low orbit, and flying high, and flying low.\n\nAdmittedly it is a bit tricksy doing an eva report while flying through the clouds at mach 3, but imagine the science if you manage to pull it off!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T04:32:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 04:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MarvinKitFox**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T04:28:06Z","Content":"Wow, that sounds great then, I thought you needed something more, this is welcome news!\n\nI read about that biome thing on the wiki, it seems like a good idea.

Build your rocket to be about 10% more oomph than for a basic west-east orbit. (the planet\u0027s spin helps on an eastern launch, does not help for north)\n\nWhen launching, launch in the normal curve, but instead of heading to the east(90 degrees), aim just west of north. Say about 4-5 degrees west of north. Keep to this heading until your navball switches itself to \u0022orbit\u0022 mode at about 35000m, then adjust the aim to true north.\n\nAs for the biomes.. Most are obvious, but two are sneaky.\n\nYou can find Tundra at the edge between icecap and grassland, in odd blotches. Not very large.\n\nYou can also find tundra between shore and grassland! In very tiny little strips. There is a patch of tundra near KSC even.\n\nAnd don\u0027t forget about the Badlands. These are the very broken-up terrain on the far side of the planet from the launch site, surrounded and interspersed with highlands and some mountains."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T04:43:13Z","Content":"Ok, very interesting. I will find these biomes, I will try for the ones near KSC. I have seen the badlands, I will try for a landing there too! \n\nI\u0027ll try the polar orbit tomorrow, it may take a bit more work though, but it will be worth it! Thank you!"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T04:49:23Z","Content":"The good thing about polar orbits is that as the planet spins under you, you will eventually be over every part of the planets surface.\n\nPolar orbit around Mun or Minmus is also only slightly harder than a normal orbit. It also costs almost nothing if you set it up at the right spot. The best spot for it is usually about halfway between Kerbin and the other body (a mid-course correction). There you can do a small normal or anti-normal burn to put you above or below the relevant moon right as you get there. You might need to add a slight prograde or retrograde component to get the right timing to be just above or below the planet as it arrives there."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T04:51:33Z","Content":"That is true, what a good bonus, this makes me even more determined!

Upgrading the administration building to level 2 will allow you to transfer up to 75% of reputation or monetary gains from contracts into science. Then you do tourist sub-orbital flights and rocket part testing for a fair cash and science boost. In a recent hard-mode game of mine, I transferred 25% of reputation into cash, and 50% of rep into science - it worked well. \n\nHeading to Munar or Minmus orbits yields far more science, of course. For that, I might suggest upgrades to both mission control and the tracking station if you haven\u0027t done so, so that you can set up maneuver nodes."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T05:06:33Z","Content":"Really?

If you have enough dV to fly by the Mun, you can probably also manage to exit Kerbin\u0027s SoI entirely, and get science from interplanetary space.\n\nEscaping Kerbin only takes a bit over 100 m/s more than reaching the Mun, even without any gravity assists, and it doesn\u0027t require any fancy navigation; you can do it without having upgraded the tracking station to get patched conics.\n\nInterplanetary space is worth a fair bit of science, especially if you can then turn around and return the science to Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T06:49:48Z","Content":"One more thing that wasn\u0027t metioned in this thread: a scientist can take the data from the materials bay and the goo canister while on EVA. After that, he can reset those, so can reuse them in the same flight. The gathered data (from every science tool) could be stored in the pod, so you don\u0027t have to overwrite even an EVA report. Not to mention that the egghead increases the science yield, and having them leveled will prove beneficial later on. If you don\u0027t care about recovering the instuments, it\u0027s enough if only the pod returns to Kerbin if you load all data into it. A single can can yield thousands of sci - especially if you do some suborbital hopping on one of the bodies - it\u0027s pretty economical on Minmus as the gravity is very low.\n\nNote that unlike pilots, scientists can\u0027t use SAS to stabilize the flight. But the OCTO core can - it\u0027s pretty cheap and sits early in the tree, so you can just slap it on your manned craft.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T06:53:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:35:03Z","Content":"Very interesting, I would actually like to recover most of the experiments, but this would work as well!
