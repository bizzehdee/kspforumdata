From observation we can conclude they are far advanced beyond us in the biosciences, they have perfected cloning together with accelerated growth and full memory/personality transfer. Since no mention is made of life support means and requirements, we could conclude that perpetually sustainable microecologies are trivial for them. Then there is the lack of information about their reproduction, perhaps they bud?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"icefire","CreatedById":5242,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-07T03:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethey lay eggs that are hatched only in the fire and heat of a rocket explosion\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robotroadkill","CreatedById":3884,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-07T06:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir small population size is probably limited by the low biodiversity on their planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-10T22:26:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell in a cloned society genetic mutations are likely to become more severe as clones are taken from the clones before...
