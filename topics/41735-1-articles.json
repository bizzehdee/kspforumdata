The difference is that there isn\u0027t sufficient air pressure to pull them from their \u0027fairing\u0027, so they don\u0027t pop out. Once the air pressure is enough, then they appear. The drag model on them is shockingly bad, but the idea is that the drag is meant to be a function of air pressure, but it\u0027s coded as a function of height instead (which for all intents and purposes is the same thing at sea level). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure that chutes will get a reworking once the aero coding is done, but they have only one, singular purpose, which is to slow you down when you are falling. Landing gear are much more versatile - you could put one on one side to angle your craft at a specific angle, or, like others say, you may have multiple sets of landing legs, to cater for different heights when docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is that the benefit of deploying them automatically doesn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eadd\u003C/em\u003E anything to the game. It\u0027s one button press, which you can do at any point. I don\u0027t want to have to config when my landing legs come down every single time, I\u0027m happy just to press G and be done with it, but with the possibility to add more functionality through action groups - what about ladders, why wouldn\u0027t they automatically deploy at the same time? etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s just no real benefit for adding this, in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
