Yeah, for moon transfers, the theta symbol (before that phi symbol) is what you want to look at. It won\u0027t be adjusted for delta-V, so you want to find out the length of the burn, divide it by 2, and start your burn that long before it hits 0. Click on the theta column header to swap to time, and the delta-V column header to see the estimated duration of the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you have considerable latitude on the burn timing. Keep a close eye on the closest approach distance, and burn until that gets as close as you want it, or as close as it gets. If there\u0027s an inclination difference, get it as close as you can, and do a plane change during the flight to get it all the way close enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that\u0027s clear and helps you out. If not, well, you also know where you can often find me (on Twitch). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ethan829","CreatedById":23048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T15:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to integrate the protractor icon into the stock toolbar?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Addle","CreatedById":110752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T06:37:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ethan829\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ethan829\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a way to integrate the protractor icon into the stock toolbar?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot without code, which is the next thing I plan to implement.
