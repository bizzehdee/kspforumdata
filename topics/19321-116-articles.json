But i have 2 more suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- try to get a more aerodynamic air intake for the blackbird, with the deadly reentry effect mod (wich if you dont want to, you dont need to do this because its about co-operation between 2 mods) the blackbird can\u0027t reach more than Mach 6.2 or around that speed before tearing itself apart. Also, the blackbird loses control at 13 kilometers and after 15 kilometers over steering it a little bit can cause severe stalling and lose of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- the wind in real life its not something the pilot has to deal with to avoid stalling, its the other way around, in real life a pilot wont stall unless going really slow because the air is avoiding the pilot to get into a stall by forcing the plane to aim for the direction the air speed is going. That\u0027s why if you see pilots before fly-by-wire they had to pull the stick with a lot of force, because the air was not letting them move the plane. With this mod, you are the one that have to aim for the ball all the time if you dont want to flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Air is too light, it should be stronger and force the plane to avoid stall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Surefoot","CreatedById":89084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T22:48:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr. Death\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dr. Death\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-Planes not made for supersonic speeds should have severe damage when doing supersonic, the husky transport should experience tearing because of the effect and pressure.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont think that would be this mod\u0027s responsibility but rather something like Deadly Re Entry.
