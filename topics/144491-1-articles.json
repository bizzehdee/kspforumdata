After blowing most of my budget a few days ago to recreate the moon landing (yup forgot I was in carrer mode lol) I went back to the daily grind of exploding kerbals where no kerbals had sploded before! (or not that much anyway, and PROVING that if we can send Kerbals to the Mun then Apollo could still be faked or something like that lol).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had contracts set aside for a space station in Kerbin orbit that required a tourist which was different. So I built and orbited the station as there were no tourists to fire off. I came back today and all of my contracts had disappeared including the station one but I now had a tourist in the roster. I thought I had screwed up on the expiration but some of the contracts were open ended ie visit Duna Ike etc and other were not even 24 hours since being selected. So I shouldn\u0027t have lost any due to exceeding the expiration date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I selected new contracts and went to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and the contracts were gone. I had selected a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E rescue and while the contract was gone the kerbal was in orbit. I figured I would do the rescue and see what happened. I got the kerbal but didn\u0027t get any credit or notifications ie in quarantine, new member etc etc. I also noticed that the engines were not cutting off. I use mechjeb to control the burns. I plot them and tweak then hit execute. It makes things easy without being overly dependent on mechjeb. So for the engine burns for rendezvous the engines would burn down to 0m/s indicated normally then continue to burn until I manually cut them off. The other strange part was I didn\u0027t see any real change in the orbits from the extended burns. Not that I let them go too far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I am curious if anyone else is seeing this or has. I am running 1.1.3x64 on a win10 machine. There have been no updates for a few weeks and the parts I have been using have been in there for a while. The game has for me been fairly solid and glitch free for quite a while until now. Anyway before I start uninstalling mods etc I was hoping someone might have encountered this one before and has a idea of how to stamp it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTNX\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDave\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-25T00:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can generally happen\u00A0if there is some sort of exception while the game is loading your contracts.

You should consider copying and pasting the contracts from the last save file you have to your most current save. It\u0027s easier if you use something like Notepad\u002B\u002B set to display as C\u002B\u002B so you can collapse brackets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: see my post in this thread:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/143065-suddenly-all-contracts-vanished/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-25T03:42:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2016 03:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wragie","CreatedById":155599,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-25T05:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would have to copy a save file from another career as everything looks like it was dated within a few hours today.
