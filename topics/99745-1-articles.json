I had to figure out how to build a station out of sleek parts and deliver stuff efficently. I came up with these designs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. A heavy core with everything I\u0027d need to continue the construction (This one launched on my 20t rocket).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lkn7yy0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lkn7yy0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A \u0022Tug\u0022 able to deliver four arms at once. I didn\u0027t want to launch each one on a separate rocket for a bunch of reasons, so I designed this thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UOZVNjE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UOZVNjE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. A service module with lots of reaction wheel power to deliver the solar array and living space extension module.

Since I don\u0027t use Infernal Robotics, the arms were just long procedural tanks full of HTP.
