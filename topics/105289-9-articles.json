In the flight window, there is also a readout showing the current control percentage, Dynamic Pressure (Q), and a simple graph plotting the input points and the current output (dropdown at the bottom of window)\n\nAs far as observing that it\u0027s working, my favourite used to be an Aeris 3A (with a whiplash for ease of use)going full throttle and just watching stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E shake itself to pieces above ~200m/s. Happy to say that is no longer an issue (well, until you hit ~1000m/s at sea level...) but with that gone and stock still being rather difficult to disintergrate by pulling up too hard, it does make the effect of DD much less compelling.\n\nIt\u0027s main use now is for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E (preventing those \u0022oops I pulled up too hard\u0022 moments for keyboard players), and making life easier for flight control mods (I basically expect anyone using Pilot Assistant to also use this. It was originally a sub component of PA, I pulled it out as a standalone because it had many uses)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-09T06:17:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2017 06:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Dry","CreatedById":163177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-12T12:40:11Z","Content":"Last night I posted this:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/161967-ksp-13-roll-on-planes-always-inverted/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nand now I see this:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E # \n\u003E [Dynamic Deflection v1.2.3](https://github.com/Crzyrndm/DynamicControls/releases/tag/1.2.3)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![@Crzyrndm](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8765278?v=3\u0026s=40)[Crzyrndm](https://github.com/Crzyrndm) released this on 6 May \u00B7 [2 commits](https://github.com/Crzyrndm/DynamicControls/compare/1.2.3...master) to master since this release\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Actually fix the roll reversal bug\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m using v1.2.4\n\nCould there be a coincidence?\n\nEdit:\n\nAs it seems Dynamic Deflection only works with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, I installed the unofficial 1.3 build and now the issue is gone.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-12T19:41:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2017 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Gordon Dry**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-12T19:42:37Z","Content":"The fix is still in place this time ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif \u0022:blush:\u0022)\n\nTest without it to be sure that it is DD (most likely.
