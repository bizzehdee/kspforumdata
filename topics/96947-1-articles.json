I just thought of something. Your render looks nice so youll want to keep this layout for this model. But for next time,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E here:\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v9PD87H.png\u0022 alt=\u0022v9PD87H.png\u0022\u003E you have the oppertunity to merge geometry quite easily without adding extra geo and be able to use tiling for the round section. I dont have access to a computer right now but ill try to explain. First select the center loop of the horisontal ring. Grow the selection once and detach (p selected) select the detached obj in object mode and duplicate it. Hide the duplicate and select the end loop of the vertical tube. Make sure the tube is unwrapped. Slide it(gg) up so it is not touching the detached piece of horizontal tube. Detach it and add the shrinkwrap modifier (target the detached piece of the horizontal tube with projection mode) apply the mod and join it to the detached piece. Now depending on how far away the outer edges and the ring edges of the detached piece is from the joined vertecies you may want to add an extra loop in the middle between the two. Afterwards delete half of the piece \u002B end loop and mirror modifier it. Now turn on snap(to vertex active) and snap vertecies from the center loop of the detached horizontal piece to the loop from the vertical tube. Apply the mirror and unwrap it. Now attach the object to the vertical loop and bridge between the hole and the tube end. Slide the extra loop down all the way and select all, remove doubles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that i explain it it sounds complicated. But it takes less then 30 sec to do. Afterwards you can delete the horizontal tube if you want to use tiling textures. Rotate the detached piece you hidden earlier with snapping enabled and create a circular array of it around where the tube used to be. Hope it helps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate. I just saw that the loops are out of alignement. Youd need to rotate the horizontal tube to match the center of the vertical tube before doing anything\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-21T09:05:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2015 09:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
