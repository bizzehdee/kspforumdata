The water molecules in the cup have a distribution of kinetic energies - a small percentage have enough energy to escape from the liquid, taking their energy with them. This is how sweating works - the evaporating sweat draws energy from you in order to keep evaporating and so cools you down.\n\nHowever, this only works if the molecules can physically escape.

Even if there was some mechanism for your molecules to stick together (so you can conserve momentum), their energy has to go somewhere. In most cases the molecules will simply bounce off each other. In some cases, I suppose two water molecules might form an (unstable) transient excited state, which then decays to give your two molecules (and their kinetic energy) back."},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T09:53:03Z","Content":"Yeh, for molecules to behave this way, they\u0027d have to be more like billiard balls, but they simply aren\u0027t.\n\nEven when two billiard balls that collide on opposing vectors and come to a stop, they still release that energy as soundwaves, deformation, structural integrity loss(breaking of intermolecular bonds), and heat. This is why such a collision is louder than other deflecting collisions.\n\nThere might be some interesting things happen very very rarely on an atomic level. The energy level of molecules varies, imagine one might be bumped into in such a way enough times to get it going extremely fast. It could theoretically gain enough energy for a collisions to break it into hydrogen/oxygen, but it would be extremely rare. I\u0027ve seen someone do the calculations and the odds of it are extraordinarily rare that a molecule reach that energy level. Usually once a molecule gets going extremely fast it quickly bumps into enough things that the energy is spread out before it can go faster.

Any container must be made of matter. All matter absorbs and emits charge.

Temperature is thus charge-density, or the amount of photons in a given volume. You aren\u0027t applying any physical, mechanical definitions to temperature (heat). Heat is charge density, often given to the infrared photon, but all photons can potentially collide with larger matter (electrons, protons, neutrons) and spin up or down into infrared. \n\n3. The walls of glass, to absorb no energy, would have to exist in an ultimate vaccum with no incoming charge. This has never been shown to be possible.

Nullify and destroy mean the same thing here. Your definitions need to be rigorously examined. You state it almost correctly in the following sentence, but energy is mass in motion, and even in a 1:1 collision the masses are still in motion. Perhaps not relative to each other, but they must still have energy to have mass in the first place. They are still moving with the local system, in the solar system, in the galaxy, in the universe.
