It can take off vertically for sure, but I haven\u0027t been able to land it vertically yet. I have landed it though, so I dubbed it a VTOSL(Vertical Take-Off, Short Landing) for its concise use of runway space during landings. I\u0027m a terrible pilot, so I\u0027m hoping someone more skilled than I can fly it more gracefully. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo Demonstration:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERjIa34_EgE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModparts Used: B9 Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload Craft File: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/useq3ea23f33ras/VTOSL.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/useq3ea23f33ras/VTOSL.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JebThePilot","CreatedById":110764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T03:16:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is...utterly hilarious.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PaladinFoster","CreatedById":114164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T03:52:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad you like it....I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voculus","CreatedById":85437,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T05:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELove me some VTOL action, as well as 8-bit music.

When you\u0027re pitched down, the front engines are providing lots of lift, while the aft is thrusting mostly forward. I wonder how that works compared with a purely vertical setup.

It keeps the craft pretty stable while pitching downward, so moving around with it isn\u0027t so much of a balancing act. With a vertical setup the craft has a tendency to nosedive into the ground when you pitch down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDCollie","CreatedById":103176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T18:50:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like the Kerbal functional equivalent of a helicopter \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
