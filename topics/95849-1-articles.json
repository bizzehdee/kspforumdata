I wanted to share the development of a new mod I\u0027ve been working on sporadically for the past month or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first started playing the game a few months ago, I almost exclusively flew unmanned probes. For me, a big part of the game is about flying to different planets and soaking up all the science (I often create little \u0022profiles\u0022 of the planets, including theorizing make-up and formation) and I wanted to create some parts for probes that may add to that experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo download link yet, as I\u0027m about to skitter off to work, but I was hoping I could get some feedback on this idea and/or tips or comments.

IMO with it being a coiled antenna, it might be its own antenna and have an insanely small FOV (maybe like 0.1 FOV, perfect for long ranged missions to Eeloo or another star system, if you have one installed!) Like I said earlier, can\u0027t wait for release, looks like a lot of fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea: maybe you could make the double sided probe core 2 pieces so you could stick things inside of it to keep it protected (Far has a tendency to pluck things off up ships when they travel to fast, and DRE likes to make them into marshmallows).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing could maybe have the probe core contain fuel of some kind so you could strap little rockets to it (maybe a large reserve of monoprop) to help control its speedy decent thru the atmosphere/to the planet, because, no-one wants an uncontrolled rocket rushing twords the ground without being able to control it in any way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing: A camera. I know, I know, their over done, but hear me out. There would be 3 cameras. the 1st would be unlocked in the first science tier, \u0022a simple black and white camera someone decided to stick onto the ship with ducktape. The wires that make it work shock the scientists whenever they touch them.\u0022 Would provide very little science, but has full transmit data (because it\u0027ll go on a probe, and those are hard to get back IMO). The second would but a full color camera, unlocked in the Electronics tier, \u0022After the scientists complained about the first camera zapping them, the engineers came up a camera that directly attaches and uses some new fancy technology called \u0027Klu Tooth\u0027 to link up to the probe to send pictures. With the upgrade came better pictures to! Now with Tekno Kolor!\u0022 would have slightly better science value, same full data return. Lastly, a full spectrum camera, unlocked in the probe science/core tab, \u0022When the scientists complained to the engineers that their new camera interfiered with their selfies and pictures of the probe when they were building it, the two teams came together to develop a special camera that only required one wire to send data to and from the probe and the camera. Without the bulky Klu Tooth device haphazardly stuck into the camera, the teams were able to upgrade it once more, giving it a thermal option, UV option, and a higher resolution standard camera. The scientists talk with the engineers about upgrading it further, but the engineers say their tierd and have done their work requirements for the year.\u0022 Would give 10 science even from the launch pad (for scale so you know what to give other planets and such) and has 90% science return. a little flavor text that could be added to the part would be: \u0022But because of the high resolution, the camera can\u0027t send back all its data, at least with the current battery technology.\u0022 The camera Mits would be (based on from the launch pad) as follows: 10 Mits for BW cam, 50 Mits for Kolor cam, 150 Mits for Full spectrum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T20:10:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI may add a resource to the probe core so it contains some Monopropellant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe camera, ehhh.
