I\u0027m trying to write a kOS script that will activate the thermometer whenever I\u0027m close enough to a waypoint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem is, kOS doesn\u0027t automatically tell me whether I\u0027m within range of a waypoint, so I need to know what distance from the waypoint I should be looking for. I found these two lines from GameData/Squad/Contracts.cfg:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nMinimumTriggerRange = 500 // The minimum range to trigger waypoints on ground surveys before gravitational adjustments\nMaximumTriggerRange = 15000 // The minimum range to trigger waypoints on high altitude surveys\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027m not sure how these numbers are used in the game. Is the radius of an \u0022in spaceflight near \u0026lt;waypoint\u0026gt;\u0022 parameter always equal to MaximumTriggerRange (15 km), or does it scale with the size of the body and/or the altitude threshold on the waypoint?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-02T21:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAIK, it scales inversely with the difficulty of the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-03T00:52:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mod for science doors exactly what you\u0027re trying to do. \u00A0It will even reset experiments if you have a scientist on board. \u00A0Love this mod as right clicking just doesn\u0027t feel like science to me so I\u0027ll just let the mod handle that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
