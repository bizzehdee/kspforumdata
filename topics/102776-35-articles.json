To be honest the main challenge from NH ISN\u0027T the delta-v requirements to get to other planets, it\u0027s all about the change in thinking about maneuvers and burns to other places. Using the initial orbital velocity of kerbin to shoot out at other planets is the first big step into the world of New Horizons, the change in thinking about how to harness the gravity of other planets is the next step...and that step is: SLINGSHOTS! It seems weird that until now people have been trying to brute force their way to the other planets, always wondered how long it would take for people to come to the conclusion that you have!

Kerbin is about 2.3 times further from the sun than in stock, and that same multiplier in the 2-2.5x range multiplier comes up for Urlum and Neidon with OPM installed. On the other hand Eve and Jool are about level with their stock counterparts. Duna in its NH position ends up about 3.6x further from the sun.\n\nThis makes me think that a star 4-5 times as luminous as in stock KSP might be appropriate. If the sun stays the same size then applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law that should be a surface temperature 40-50% higher than in stock, which puts in in spectral type A, a bright white with maybe a hint of blue.
