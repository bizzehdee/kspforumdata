This order doesn\u0027t work at all. The smaller ones allow the player to form taller tanks from multiple smaller ones, at no downside. As such unlocking the taller ones in the next node does not add extra gameplay decisions. It just makes your rockets less ugly and requires you to rebuild your launch vehicles to replace the multiple short tanks with the taller ones. Flipping the unlock order would create more interesting gameplay, would make career rockets look less ugly and would mean less launch vehicle rebuilding for aesthetic reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does shorter before taller make career more interesting? It forces you to build crude and big, before you can go smaller and refined. Let\u0027s take the 1.25m tech as an example of what the change could result in: you start with the first tech node and you get the FL-T800. Combined with a T-30 most will be able to get into space or at least in the upper atmosphere. But combined with the (lack of) other parts in that node, you\u0027ll have a difficult time to make a multi-stage orbital rocket. In the next node you get the FL-T400, the T-45 and the stack decoupler. This will allow you build a launch vehicle that can get you to orbit. Example: a couple of engines and T800s in the first stage, a single T800 and engine in a second upper atmosphere stage and a final stage with a T400 tank to push you through the vacuum of space into orbit. But the lack of smaller tanks will make more advanced designs difficult to make, as the large tanks are cumbersome to rotate. Service modules for maneuvering in space will benefit a lot from the smaller T-200 and T-100 tanks. So you\u0027ll be inclined to unlock the node that has them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does everyone think?
