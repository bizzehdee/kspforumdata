After it drops them it has 1.7twr with 2 engines. Climbing till 5 when they burn out. Then second stage, transorbit burns etc. Its about the first stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems a perfectly smooth \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E curve. When I launch the rocket everything seems to be going fine untill it reaches 270 m/s (about ~30s into the launch). Then its speed stalls, and actually starts to drop steadely. Even if i keep pointing the rocket straight up during the entire flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no loss in thrust on any of the engines (neither the solids nor liquids). MechJeb and Engineer tell me my ship is above 2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the weight of the ship is dropping (the fuell is burning) but the thrust stays the same, and I am reaching a higher altitude, it seems phisycly impossible to me that the ship would actually loose speed So I guess its a bug, but I no idea whats going on. Maybe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is suddenly calculating and insanely high drag on the ship? Something like that?\u003Cbr\u003E\nhere is a picture, as you can see the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is 2.3 when I took it, the surface (as well as vertical speed of the ship) is dropping at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AD9Gpg2.png\u0022 width=\u0022854\u0022 alt=\u0022AD9Gpg2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone any idea whats going on?

As you can see the rocket had a bit of a weird shape, after changing to much bigger fairings (a less optimal rocket though, because of the added mass), the bug was gone. I guess \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E got confused by it.
