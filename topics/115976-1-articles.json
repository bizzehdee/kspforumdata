I could rip some sounds from another game i have but that would be quite rude, so i won\u0027t do that.

Once i find it, i\u0027ll consider adding it in. (I just tried to find it now and i realized that that post is REALLY REALLY hard to find. I hope it wasn\u0027t deleted or anything so that i could contact the author on how he made it.)\n\nI already included the compatible ammunitions in the description. For example from the T-34 description \u0022It contains a 76mm gun that uses the standard CannonShells that performs quite well against other tanks.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And/or could you make armor plates, just retextured steel plates with edited configs? (higher temp)\n\nI want to make \u0027spaced armor\u0027 that has just enough ablativeness to block one shot and get destroyed/dislodged from a craft in the second shot. What do you think?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E FLAK 36 is needed....., for reasons.....\n\nWhich FLAK 36 do you mean? The 8.8 cm or the 3.6 cm? I\u0027d definitely add the 3.6 cm along with the Bofors 40mm i\u0027m planning.\n\nThe 8.8 cm is very big IMO.
