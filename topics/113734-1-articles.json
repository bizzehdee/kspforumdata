I was wondering if anyone could help me with making a manuever node. i have looked at the wiki page for this and several youtube videos and it says to simply click on a point in your spacecraft\u0027s orbit and then select make manuever (or something like that). I have tried this with an orbiting craft. i have right and left clicked because i dont know which one if not both works. Please help me if you can, because I am lost as how to make one. (I am at an altitude of 240km and moving at 1950 m/s although i do not think that affects anything)\n\nThank you for your help and respond if you can."},{"CreatedByName":"SanderB","CreatedById":83050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T20:48:03Z","Content":"Left clicking anywhere on the blue line in front of the vehicle from the map view should bring up the pop up menu with the maneuver node option."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T20:52:15Z","Content":"It should be pointed out that if you\u0027re in Career game, you\u0027ll need to have upgraded both the Tracking Station and Mission Control facilities to Level 2 before you\u0027ll be able to make maneuver nodes.
