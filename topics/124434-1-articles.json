It\u0027s all about the fact that the rocket turned around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime dilation can occur in two ways in Special Relativity: You go really fast, or you\u0027re in a gravitational field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral Relativity points out that being in a gravitational field and accelerating are fundamentally equivalent. So here\u0027s the real sequence of events:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rocket launches from Earth and acclerates for a bit. By the time it reaches top speed, it has aged maybe five minutes while on Earth an hour has gone by. Even aboard the rocket, people will agree that time is going faster on Earth than in the rocket, which is \u0022experiencing a strong gravitational field\u0022 as it accelerates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rocket flies off at near light speed. As it does so, looking back, Earth appears to age in slow motion to people aboard the rocket, while the rocket appears to age in slow motion to people on Earth. Naturally the two will start to disagree on what time, day, and eventually year it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rocket accelerates again so as to turn around, placing itself in a \u0022strong gravitational field\u0022 for twice as long as before. Everyone agrees time slows down for the rocket - a LOT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rocket approaches Earth. As it does so, Earth once again seems to be in slo-mo from the rocket and vice versa. As time goes by, of course, this will make the people aboard the rocket perceive Earth as slipping ahead of the rocket in time, helping to make up for their period of slo-mo while accelerating. However, it never makes up for it all the way before they arrive at Earth again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rocket hits the brakes upon return, once more putting itself in slow-motion in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you carefully add up all the time differentials from the periods of acceleration and inertial motion, you\u0027ll find that the time differential caused by the acceleration is always more significant than the time differential built up or taken away during inertial motion. Traveling at a greater speed to increase the dilation in inertial motion (in an attempt to restore the paradox) simply means you have to do more accelerating. Traveling a greater distance will only make the time differentials bigger in all phases of the experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt best, you could get the rocket to age only a tiny bit less than Earth by running the experiment very quickly or moving very slowly, but of course this just brings us back toward everyday situations of short distances and slow movement. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Earth is of course also experiencing a gravitational field, but this is very small (we\u0027re not orbiting anywhere near lightspeed and neither Earth nor the Sun is massive enough to cause a large time dilation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If instead of turning around, you stopped the rocket and then took Earth and pushed it toward the rocket, Earth would end up experiencing the twins paradox itself and both would arrive together at the same age.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-04T20:20:49Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2015 08:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T20:49:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WedgeAntilles\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WedgeAntilles\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne frame of reference (Earth) is static.\u003Cp\u003EThe other (the rocket) is not.

Did you know that there exists an orbit where time advances at exactly the same rate as on Earth\u0027s surface, because orbital time dilation equals the difference in gravitational time dilation due to different elevations? IIRC, GPS satellites are above that altitude, so their clocks run faster. In contrast, ISS is well bellow that altitude, and their clocks run slower. And when you need to be able to position your satellites just right, it\u0027s the sort of thing you have to keep in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T02:42:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022impwarhamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022impwarhamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for all your comments guys!\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027m getting here is that its the acceleration of the rocket that cancels out the paradox?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGonna have to think about that for a bit, but its a start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, in any case, the fact that you have to change between two (or more) inertial reference frame destroys all kind of continuity given by usual special relativity. Even if we ignore general relativity, distance plays in the reality (like, how when you\u0027re 100 lightyears away, you look at your home 100 years ago, wrt your \u0022current\u0022 time). But a proper explanation does need general relativity, the key idea is that accelerating makes your time slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022llanthas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022llanthas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis gave me an interesting thought... \u003Cp\u003ESince we know that the earth is moving at 1,000s of mph at all times, shouldn\u0027t relativity apply more in our rocket if it launches prograde vs retrograde?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe tried special (maybe with some influence of general) relativity in planes that goes east and west, so on satelites it should be more pronounced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
