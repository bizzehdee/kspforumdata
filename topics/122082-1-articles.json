My request has to do with the problem that occurs while building bigger permanent structurs in orbit or on celestial bodies. You sooner or later awake the kraken or sstart to lag like hell as the components, their rendering and physical interaction (including the calculation) starts to tear the CPU apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like to request is a mod the works more or less like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Player transports a Geodetic Conversion Kit next to the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Player activates the conversion and selects the Ship / Outpost / Base etc. to be converted in to a geodetic sphere or dome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Kit creates a placeholder for the externals and physical elements of the converted entity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The mechanics (Kerbals inside, labs, solar panes etc.) are transfered to be (data)parts of the placeholder entity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The old entities are deleted, while the (relatively) low poly placesholder appears as a dome or sphere that has enough volume to incorporate the assimilated entities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. The dome has one or two (one on the top) docking port or a new docking port may be added by KAS where ships or new modules may be attached. It would be even possible to connect one sphere with another with colony tubes or some other link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this works, it should be possible to convert overly complex contrapments to save CPU load and propably even some memory load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0060s your opinion? Does it sound possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an additional idea: The access to the various functions of the assimilated entities would also either require a tree button layout in the usual right-click UI or an individual management UI.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-01T08:49:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2015 08:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by QPDO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T11:39:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehonestly, already solved this with MKS by allowing disconnected bases including automated resource transfer and power transmission - works a treat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T12:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you want \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107273\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUbiZor Welding\u003C/a\u003E, except in-flight?

You\u0027d have to replace the whole ship at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other idea: have a part (ugly cube, geodesic dome, whatever) with a KIS inventory. Then have a button on the module that will \u0022consume\u0022 the part(s) in the inventory, which will transfer the resources and mass to the ugly cube. Wouldn\u0027t work with multiple solar panels or docking ports, but would work with batteries, command modules, fuel tanks, generators, etc (basically same restrictions as UbiZor).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"QPDO","CreatedById":104760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T10:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah UbizorWeld more or less does the trick. But the size and load of the construction remains. That\u0027s why it should be the domes or placeholders. Even more as building a dome is quite common in colonization scifi and science. I guess for starters it would suffice to make ubizors code transfer the properties to the dome and then remove the old entities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for replying RoverDude! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I was already playing with your great MKS system. but at some point the physical load of all the single entities of a bigger colony is to much for the system (my system at least). From the technical side I\u0027d say that you got the best insight in if its actually possible to scram multiple module code together into a (relatively) low - poly single physical entity. All I\u0027d bet is that it would allow to create even bigger colonies even on weaker systems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
