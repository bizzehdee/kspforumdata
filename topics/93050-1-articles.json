In order to make both types better I\u0027d like to see the following things added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-At level 4 engineer kerbals can repair solar panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Scientist kerbals are the only ones who can remove data from experiments (they are the only ones who know how to do it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any other ideas for kerbals please mention them! (engineer still needs something at 5!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T06:32:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo suggestions for the mix one for each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA higher level Engineer should give continuous information about the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that the Fuel tabs gives readings in more directly useful fashion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBattery life reported like a laptop does time to charged/time till run. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV remaining by stage or burn time by stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigher level scientist should be able to compile a report of \u0022whats currently interesting\u0022. So basically an action group that checks instruments then trashes reports of zero value.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
