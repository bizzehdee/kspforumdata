A screenshot of the ship would help - even better would be to activate the CLS overlay and then do a screenshot.  (The overlay will show which parts are crewable, which parts are passable, and which parts are neither.)\n\nThe one other note I do have for that situation is that there was at least one docking port involved - Docking ports (even passable ones) are impassable until they are opened.  Basically, the Kerbals lock them shut until after you dock, when you have to go tell them to unlock them.

I probably did not open them. Thanks to your comments I think I get it now. But just to clarify:\n\nIt \\_IS\\_ possible to set girders as \u0022CLS Passable = Yes; CLS Surface Attachable = Yes; CLS Attachable Surface = Yes\u0022 and then have those girders attached to modules with living space, and with docking ports attached to the girders and (as long as all the settings are proper) have Kerbals traverse from the living module, through the girder, through the docking port, through the docking port of a docked vessel and into the docked vessel?\n\nTo clarify here is a (complicated) screen cap, that I\u0027ll try to explain\n\n![Fn7Q6.jpg](http://tw.greywool.com/i/Fn7Q6.jpg)\n\nAt the top of this we have a\n\nI. Universal Storage hexacore (Y, N, N)\n\nII. Botticelli crew module (Y, Y, Y) with two girders attached to its surface (both Y, Y, Y), one with DMagic\u0027s flexo port Jr. (Y, Y, Y) , the other with the standard clampotron (Y, Y, Y).\n\nIII. Mobile processing lab (Y, Y, Y)\n\nIV. Uni storage octocore (Y, N, N)\n\nV. UKS Orbital Workshop (Y, N, N) with one girder attached (Y, Y, Y), and the larger Clampotron (Y, Y, Y).\n\nI left the Universal storage cores with the two latter settings set to N because, why would I attach something like a connector to a hexagaonal module?\n\nSo specific questions:\n\n1. Because the Hexcaore, Botticelli, Lab, Octocore and workshop all have \u0022Passable\u0022 set to use, Kerbals can pass through all of them (so for example if a docking port were added on both ends of the thing, on the nodes for the hexacores and octocores) and the octocore between the lab and workshop will not impede movement between the two modules?\n\n2. If another Botticelli were added to top of the hexacore, and it had \u0022Passable\u0022 set to Y, then a kerbal could pass from that Botticelli, through the hexacore, and into the next Botticelli, into the lab, through the octocore, and into the workshop?\n\n3. Because the Botticelli and its surface child girders and docks are all set to (Y, Y, Y), anything that docks at either of those two docking ports (if its connections are also set to Y, Y, Y) will be able to pass kerbals into the ship?\n\n4. In contrast, because the workshop has it\u0027s setting as (Y, N, N), the girder \u002B clampotron attached to it are disqualified because the girder is attached to the surface of the workshop, not a standard node?\n\n5. If I were to launch it with the workshop set like that, then the only option to make that full-size clampotron \u002B girder passable would be to edit the vessels appropriate fields in the .sfs file?"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkonZ","CreatedById":161584,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-22T18:37:57Z","Content":"WIN7 64B KSP 113 64B CLS 1221  \n\nI just recently decided CLS needs to be part of my default mods setup and installed into all my various KSP games.

Personally I try to only set as passable parts that look like they should be passable - they have a crew tube or something, or at least could be hiding one.  (Near Future Technologies makes some very nice crew-passable girders.)  But if everything is set right, no problem.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 hours ago, Diche Bach said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Because the Hexcaore, Botticelli, Lab, Octocore and workshop all have \u0022Passable\u0022 set to use, Kerbals can pass through all of them (so for example if a docking port were added on both ends of the thing, on the nodes for the hexacores and octocores) and the octocore between the lab and workshop will not impede movement between the two modules?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2. If another Botticelli were added to top of the hexacore, and it had \u0022Passable\u0022 set to Y, then a kerbal could pass from that Botticelli, through the hexacore, and into the next Botticelli, into the lab, through the octocore, and into the workshop?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Because the Botticelli and its surface child girders and docks are all set to (Y, Y, Y), anything that docks at either of those two docking ports (if its connections are also set to Y, Y, Y) will be able to pass kerbals into the ship?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4. In contrast, because the workshop has it\u0027s setting as (Y, N, N), the girder \u002B clampotron attached to it are disqualified because the girder is attached to the surface of the workshop, not a standard node?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5.
