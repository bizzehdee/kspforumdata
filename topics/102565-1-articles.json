I certainly haven\u0027t done it yet, and neither has anybody else, as far as I can tell. This is not a challenge for beginners. It will take clever thinking and lots of tweaking to make this work. Are you up for this?*\n\n*Good. Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s get started.*\n\n![KPlugjd.png?2](http://i.imgur.com/KPlugjd.png?2)\n**The KSP Calculator Project!**\n\n**The goal of this project is to create a machine that is capable of performing the most sophisticated calculations possible, using nothing but stock KSP parts.**\n\n**~~~**\n\n***Is this even possible?*** I see no reason why it wouldn\u0027t be. If you have any ideas on how to make this work, I would recommend trying them! If they don\u0027t work, you may want to inform the Forum of your attempts, so that they don\u0027t have to waste energy. This isn\u0027t a challenge for any one individual, but rather a project for the Forum as a whole. (See below for more.)\n\n**~~~**\n\nThere is no time limit, nor part limit. As a matter of fact, using the Debug menu is fine (though Whack-a-Kerbal is not allowed).\n\n**To successfully complete this, one must build a machine that does** ***exactly*** **the following.** ***Please read the rules carefully, especially where they say \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cmust!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2***\n\n- The machine *must* start off in a stable state. The sum or difference of the numbers *must* be zero at this point.\n- It *must* respond to numerical action groups (the \u00221\u0022 action group, \u00222\u0022 action group, etc.). *Every action group* must *correspond to its corresponding number: pressing \u00221\u0022 should add/subtract 1, pressing \u00222\u0022 should add/subtract 2, etc.*  \n*Inputs can be made in the following ways:*  \n[FIRST NUMERICAL ACTION GROUP] [sECOND NUMERICAL ACTION GROUP] yields the answer.  \n[FIRST NUMERICAL ACTION GROUP] [bACKSPACE/ABORT] [sECOND NUMERICAL ACTION GROUP] yields the answer.  \n[FIRST NUMERICAL ACTION GROUP] [bACKSPACE/ABORT] [sECOND NUMERICAL ACTION GROUP] [\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CZERO\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 ACTION GROUP] yields the answer. (You are not required to add or subtract zero from numbers.)  \n*Other methods of input will probably result in the entry being disqualified.*\n- If two of the same number are added, subtracted, multiplied, divided, etc. [e.g. 1\u002B1, 2-2, 3x3], the machine *must* be able to yield the correct answer.\n- The machine *must* be capable of adding up to 3\u002B3, or subtracting up to 3-3, or multiplying up to 3x3, etc.\n- The machine *must* have an clear way of showing the answer, that is recognizable to any reasonably experienced KSP player.\n- The machine *must* work relatively consistently with all of its numerical combinations.\n- Submissions *must* include a photo or two *OR* a video of the machine at work (this doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to be very long or of good quality, as long as it shows that the machine is functional), as well as a brief description of how the machine works, *and* a .craft file. Oh, and include the name of the thing, too.\n\nThere is no time limit or part limit. As a matter of fact, using the Debug menu is fine (though Whack-a-Kerbal is not allowed).\n\nIt would also be very nice if the machine was reusable, or if it could perform the operations that are listed below in red (e.g. they haven\u0027t been done yet.)\n\n**~~~**\n\n**I would strongly recommend that you share your progress over time, including your successes and failures. I can\u0027t emphasize this enough.** Because this is arguably one of the most difficult construction projects ever posted, it may take more than one person to achieve the objective of this challenge. As a matter of fact, I have no problem with small \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cteams\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 of Forum-goers working on this project.\n\nIf you complete this, your name will be included on the list below, and you will likely earn some sort of ribbon (though I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t made one yet). In addition, I will urge visitors of the thread to give you Reputation, as a reward for your achievement. All people who complete the project will be given the same recognition (although re-posting an already viable entry or other such tomfoolery will be frowned upon).\n\n**Let me know if you have any questions or comments.** Again, this is an enormously difficult project, so don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be discouraged, and hang in there.\n\n**~~~**\n\n**Successful Entries:**\n\n**Starwhip.** Kicked off the competition with a landing-leg-driven craft that can add up to 3\u002B3.

The lights are wired to action groups so pressing that the number \u00227,\u0022 for example, will either turn on or turn off seven lights. (This is achievable with the ToggleLight option.) Because all lights initially start in the \u0022Off\u0022 position, seven lights turn on:\n\n![kFUzVDC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kFUzVDC.jpg)\n\n...and then it\u0027s time to input your second number, which is \u00224\u0022 in this case. Four lights turn off, leaving you with three lights for your answer.\n\n![RBOoyD0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RBOoyD0.jpg)\n\nSeven minus four is three. (Note: This calculator will give you the absolute value of your answer. 4-7 would also give an answer of three, for example.)\n\nThis thing can be reset by pressing the \u0022Lights\u0022 action group. After this, you can perform another calculation with neither fuss nor muss.\n\nSo that\u0027s my initial entry. I would provide the .craft file, but I made this thing in less than ten minutes. It would probably be quicker to create this thing than to download it... though you must place all lights separately and do some fiddling with the action groups. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Now that we have a successful calculator that adds and a successful calculator that subtracts, it\u0027s time to innovate further!** I would love to see a calculator capable of adding and subtracting... a calculator that can add more than two numbers... a reusable adding calculator... et cetera.
