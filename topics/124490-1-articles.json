My night sky is littered with sparkly planets. Lately I have been obsessed with Arkas. It is a desert world with mountains and volcanoes. The atmosphere gets thick at the surface making chute landing a breeze. The surface is rolling dunes of sand. It all looks pretty level until you try to land. Tried 3 real land and return missions. One ended with an explosion (it is KSP after all). One with a tipped over landing (I reverted). One I finally stuck the landing but lacked the TWR to attain orbit (d\u0027oh). So I have been using Hyper Edit to figure out what is needed for ascent. This morning I made orbit with sufficient dv for a return to kerbin. Yeah! In one year... Boo!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I went to the space center to decide if I wanted to wait a year or, you know, kill Harney. My no Kerbal left behind sensibilities kicked in and I decided to wait. Then I started looking at the in progress missions. What is this landed on Asclepius? I don\u0027t remember an incomplete mission there. Switched to fly the ship and discovered 4 kerbalnauts sitting in a hitchhiker can, on its side, stuck a really steep hillside.... O yeah. I forgot about you guys. Uhmm sorry? Guess I should design a passenger rover and go get them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else ever stumble on Kerbals you had forgotten?
