I have tried several times to land on the Mun, but I just can\u0027t get the right approach angle. The best I have done is land soft enough so that the capsule survives but everything else gets destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is that I always have lateral movement and can\u0027t come down vertically, so I attempt to correct this lateral movement but never can and end up eventually smashing into the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also redesigned my rocket so that I\u0027ll easily have enough fuel to make it back to Kerbin, but one step at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone give me any pointers?
