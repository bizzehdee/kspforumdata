Three legs are enough but 4 won\\\u0027t hurt anything. Unlike Mun, the landing impact is so light you don\\\u0027t need to worry about legs breaking off, and so don\\\u0027t need redundant spares. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHandy tip: if you aim for one of the low \u0027seas,\u0027 for once your altimeter will actually tell you how high you are, because they are all at exactly \u0027sea level\u0027 elevation of zero. The perfect flatness there also means you don\\\u0027t have to worry about hitting bumps or falling down a slope. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nomer","CreatedById":30789,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-09T00:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know, I doubt landing on minmus would be an issue since it\\\u0027s a pain in the ass getting there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiterally,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea pain in the ass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes me 30 minutes to an hour hours manually [successfuly]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 minutes with mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-09T03:13:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust get into a 90 degree orbit, burn out to 46000 km or whatever it is when Minmus rises over the horizon, then halfway there adjust the orbit plane until the map says you meet it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-09T03:38:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot always gonna work, for the simple reason that if you\\\u0027re timing\\\u0027s off, it could be ages till you meet up with it or before the patched conics tell you you\\\u0027re gonna make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prefer to do a normal orbit, burn 90 out to 46,400,000m or so, and then burn retrograde (270) so that you will always meet up with it within half an orbit.
