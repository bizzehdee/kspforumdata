If you want to do something like this in front of this audience, you must appear completely unbiased, and you must present enough options to satisfy everyone. This poll is far away from either proposition. As a result, it will go one of two ways: either it\u0027ll be largely ignored because most people sense the easily flammable material it is made of; or it will catch fire and end in an argument which may or may not get locked, but definitely will not result in a useful picture of public opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T09:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some suggestions for a better poll:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFavorite Space Launchers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace Shuttle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaturn V\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoyuz lifter vehicle (NOT THE SPACECRAFT)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProton\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI picked these choices as 1. most of them are already in the above poll and 2. these are the most commonly known launchers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KOCOUR","CreatedById":37749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T13:02:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E-Why has every shuttle its own line?\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Where are other spacecrafts?
