I only accept the part test and do science at x contracts if Im using that part or going to x anyway, and I only accept satellite contracts for things like geosync and useful seeming trajectories. It\u0027s a playstyle thing. I get the philosophical aversion to the game adding things you didn\u0027t, especially when it comes to the role-playing thing of being the first to duna or whatever. I don\u0027t feel like I could outright tell people they shouldn\u0027t have access to contracts I just happen to not like though necessarily."},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T22:39:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Multiplayer: still very much in development, but is a looooooong endeavour.** Like, to make it is fairly easy.

Yeah... Those should be more like reminders that you are running low on oxygen and food on one of your stations or bases, or kerbals low on jetpack fuel floating away from a station because that line holding him wasnt double-checked.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T01:23:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 01:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T01:58:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I kinda think the testing contracts should be like: \u0022Here\u0027s an engine we made, but we dont know its full specs.

Just trying to come up with something that would make more sense without the need of taking away parts of the game. This stuff can happen in real life. Its just that some contracts in KSP are very poorly executed (not sure if thats the word Im looking fo). \n\nSrry for editing my previous post. I do that a lot. Its a bad habit, I know.\n\nE: what I mean here is that they shouldnt be completely removed from the game but IMPROVED a lot and rewritten.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T02:28:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 02:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"}]}
