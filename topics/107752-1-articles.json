However what you say is probably what has been happening in the bulk of the incidents. I\u0027ll give up on saving my lower stages. Thanks for the clarification!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:40:51Z","Content":"There is a recover button in the tracking station to recover parts directly, without having to load them, if they have survived the fall they should be recoverable."}]}
