Farram Aerospace makes them harder, except that people always seem to use the SABRE engines when building spaceplanes with mods. I have personally found that building planes without SABREs but with FAR is quite a difficult (and fun) challenge. It may sound easy, but launching (and returning!) cargo in this manner is tricky. Rather than just slapping some engines on whatever (or spamming a ton of wings and intakes in stock KSP), you have to carefully balance lift, jet thrust, rocket thrust, and pitch surfaces. So I decided to create a game with the following rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Farram Aerospace plugin installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Spaceplanes only. No staging of expended parts. Everything must be completely reusable: all parts that go up, must come back down for a nice landing. Spaceplanes can separate into multiple smaller spaceplanes as long as they all make it home and land aircraft-style on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-No parachutes for descent. It would be fine to use them to slow down once you have landed though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Only stock engines and intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-No unrealistically placed intakes. No piles of intakes clipped inside each other, intakes facing backwards, or intakes inside an enclosed craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I\u0027m using the B9 fuselage parts and wings, anything other than engines and intakes are fine. Or airships. Airships would ruin it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If you are doing interplanetary missions, kethane might make it more fun. Or, you can just \u0027stage\u0027 by having a series of different sized planes stacked on top of each other, as long as each one can safely return home. Or, you could send a bunch of missions to refuel one large spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get this started, Thompdan Kerman lands and returns from the Mun aboard the Mosquito spaceplane lander:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/mX0oa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I use the turbojets from the stock KSP for most of my air breathing jet engine use, they provide the most power the longest before I am going to fast for them to be useful. That is when I am not using a SABRE. While I like SABRE engines, they do weigh quite a bit and are not the most efficient engine choice out there. And I rarely use Aerospikes for anything anymore, unless I am using on the bottom of something for a VTOL engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my designs have between 3:1 and 4:1 intake to jet engine ratio. Rarely do I go higher than that. And I can get them to 30km sometime 32-33km before I need to switch over to rockets. My goal is to hit Mach 5\u002B before I hit 30km, with the supersonic large intake or the divertless intakes I can achieve that goal without spamming intakes all over my craft or clipping them. One of my most fun designs is an accident. It is the SVO-11 and SVO-12. They have a 2:1 intake to engine ratio and they MORE than meet the goals I set for my SSTO space planes and they are also VTOLs which make them so much more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/f7PQ2#8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
