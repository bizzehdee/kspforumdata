Names that start S3 or S4 mean 3 meter or 5 meter diameter parts. Rockomax parts are always 2.5 meters. In the default listing, parts of a particular size also tend to be grouped together. Admittedly, the clues are not easy to spot, and you\u0027ll just have to memorize them all over again. Grab each of them and measure against the size of a known engine or crew pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) I find that it\u0027s always easiest to build the payload first. So I\u0027d build the satellite, set the root part to the attachment point, and then store it as a craft file. Then use the Merge function multiple times to add the payload(s) to the booster. But as said above, it\u0027s easy now in the game to create a fairing with multiple attachment points in it. This is by far the easiest answer to launching multiple sats on one booster -- look for the \u0022interstage nodes\u0022 button in the fairing\u0027s context menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-28T19:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor multi-launchers, I also do the launcher first - at least the upper stage - then build the first satellite.\u00A0 Assuming they are identical, Alt-left click copies everything \u0022above\u0022 the part you are clicking on, so if you Alt-left click the decoupler you get a complete copy of your satellite.\u00A0 It\u0027s my preferred method of setting up com relays.\u00A0 That always seemed easier to me than having one of several satellites being the root \u0026amp; not being able to copy them.\u00A0 If you aren\u0027t doing identical payloads, it probably doesn\u0027t matter which way you build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-28T20:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your satellites are small enough and you own Making History, I\u0027ve had luck attaching then to engine plates which themselves are under a huge fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t have MH, you can still do it with creative use of other structural parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
