FALD monitors typically won\u0027t run FALD properly with SDR because most algorithms require HDR to use it properly. This means that without HDR natively supported (not fake HDR enabled in Windows) the population of FALD monitor/TV owners can\u0027t see the beautiful black of space along with the powerful sun glares or even runway lights in future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolution: Since Unity natively supports HDR, can you please consider adding it in the future?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
