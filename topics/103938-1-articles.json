Thought it makes slight bit of maintenance work, I build modular wings in rows leading away from the fuselage and then strut in columns. The reason is it makes it easier to build without accidentally missing a strut and seems to hold together better without as much flexing. Neither way is wrong, just preference. Plus, with the new offset tool, it\u0027s really easy to shift the wings forward and back to adjust CoM/CoL relationship.
