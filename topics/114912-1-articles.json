A new space program! They deplaned and approached the building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where is everyone?\u0022 Kerrick asked. Just then he noticed movement overhead, and looked up to see a Kerbal standing on the roof of the mission control building, silhouetted against the sun. A familiar voice called down Kerrick\u0027s name. But, it couldn\u0027t be, thought Kerrick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, the figure on the roof did the unthinkable: it stepped casually off the edge and plummeted down to where Kerrick and Leonora stood. At the last moment, the kerbal deployed his rescue chute and landed nonchalantly in front of Kerrick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jednah!\u0022 Kerrick shouted. \u0022But-what happened to you?\u0022 he stammered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh,\u0022 Jednah replied, \u0022You\u0027ll never believe the crazy mission I just finished...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Since we\u0027ve been cut off from our old satellites, we needed to put up a new comms network for unmanned launches. But Jeb is adamant that we keep everything secret, so he decided to put a tiny glider on top of a rocket to make sure I would land back at this space center, instead of wherever my capsule ended up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But the rocket was wobbly and my wings kept making it unstable and flipping me over during launch. Eventually, we stole a few jet liner tail fins and stuck them on, and that seemed to work. The problem was, I\u0027m used to launching from the old space center, where the runway faced east! Even with all the fancy new instruments in my cockpit--seriously, it was awesome--I somehow got confused and ended up launching to the west!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So there I was in a retrograde orbit, but Jebediah being who he is, he just had me level out my inclination on instruments only and go ahead and deploy the satellites backwards! It was all fine until I tried to come home, because I was aero-breaking the wrong way. After everything, I still ended up coming down thousands of kilometers away from the space center! Luckily that was in the middle of the ocean and nobody noticed, but I was really embarrassed when Jeb had to come pick me up in the plane...\u0022 Jedna said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerrick cleared his dry throat. \u0022That\u0027s crazy...but not as crazy as the fact that you are alive!

All of this is his project. After the ban on space flight, he found some kind of secret backer who helps him pull off this operation. But what I can tell you is that we are not just going out to explore. This all started with what we found on Mun...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And what did you find?\u0022 Kerrick asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedna smiled. \u0022Something really cool.
