This will lessen the crosssectional area that can be fit into the cargo area.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u002B but because the payload itself does not need to survive Max Q cost spent on nose cone and fairing can be removed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u002B means the payload will conform to sears-haack body\u003Cbr\u003E\n- since most of the flight vector is horizontal the entire structure is subject to much more drag, for a much longer period of time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u002B but because this is jet thrust versus \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust the mass efficiency is much greater (unlike falcon 9 however, most of the weight is coming back to earth, thereforecost).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- but that has to be weighed against the fact you have only obtained a minimal orbital altitude, and nowhere the velocity to reach orbit.
