Just be sure to have an idea where your rescue ship is, select it from map view after the switch, then face it and negate your velocity that\u0027s not straight towards it and you should be pretty well off.

Well, it\u0027s not that hard, and EVA rescues aren\u0027t that hard either. Biggest trick is making sure Jeb doesn\u0027t sneak into the rescue capsule while you\u0027re not looking...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Go to the pad straight from the VAB and make sure to use the controls before you hit \u0022launch\u0022 that will let you pilot the craft unmanned - it\u0027s the blue one to the left of your craft name that looks like a Kerbal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, since it\u0027s your first rodeo, you want a rescue craft with about 1000 m/s of delta-V give or take. Usual accoutrements - you\u0027ll want a probe core to handle the unmanned portion of the flight (Stayputniks work just fine), a batt or two to support it (A Z-200 or a few Z-100s will do just fine) and maybe an OX-STAT panel or four if I\u0027ve got them, a Mk1 Capsule, a couple of radial chutes (two or three), and a decoupler on the bottom for chucking off your engines once you\u0027ve done your de-orbit burn. You also want RCS - tanks for the fuel and thruster blocks. You\u0027re going to want 8-12 blocks for your first rodeo - that\u0027ll be a quad at the top of the payload, a quad at the bottom, and a quad as close to the center of mass as you can get them (this set helps with translation, and there\u0027s folks that will tell you that you don\u0027t need these - take them or don\u0027t as you will). Below your decoupler, an FL-T400 tank and a 48-7S engine should give you more delta-V than you\u0027ll need; if you don\u0027t have the 48-7S you can take an LV-909, or even an LV-T45 set to about 1/4 thrust. The idea there is that you have an engine for rendezvousing with enough delta-V to handle screwups. Build whatever booster you want for the whole contraption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so rendezvousing comes first. First thing - target the Kerbal and wait until he is about 500,000 meters uprange of KSP (give or take) before launch. I find that waiting until then minimizes the amount of orbits you need until you get a close pass. Look at the Kerbal\u0027s altitude at that time; that\u0027s your target launch apoapsis. Launch and circularize like normal. Next thing next - you want to find a little marker that says AN or DN, and if you hover over that it should indicate a number of degrees. This is the seperation between your orbital plane and the Kerbal\u0027s. Set up a maneuver node at one of these two points and pull on the little purple indicators (the normal/anti-normal controls). If the number of degrees gets bigger, pull on the OTHER purple indicator - you want this number to go DOWN. Preferably to 0.0 or NaN (NaN is so dead on the game\u0027s programming language barfs). Make the indicated burn and be as precise as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re in the same plane, the next thing to do is find your \u0022closest approach\u0022 chevrons - this will tell you how close you\u0027re going to come to the Kerbal on the next pass. You want to get this number down as low as you can - what you do then is set up a maneuver node at the next apsis and pull prograde. See what kind of effect that has on the distance - if it increases, pull retrograde (just make sure that when you do this your periapsis doesn\u0027t go below 70,000; you can\u0027t rescue the Kerbal if your ship dives back into the atmosphere first). If the distance decreases, keep pulling until it starts increasing, then stop. Make the indicated burn. Set up another node at the next apsis, wash and repeat. Keep this up until you can\u0027t reduce the distance any more. If you still haven\u0027t got a close pass (2.2 km or closer) and you\u0027re getting no effect at the apses, try setting up at the midpoint between the apses. Eventually, you\u0027ll either get it or you won\u0027t; if your rendezvous engine runs out of delta-V, go ahead and use RCS to de-orbit and try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get the rendezvous, then you\u0027re on to the \u0022docking phase\u0022. You want your speedometer in Target mode at that point, and you\u0027re going to want to zero out your velocity (just burn retrograde) about the time you make your closest approach to the Kerbal. At that point, you need to find a pink meatball on the nav ball. This shows you the direction to the Kerbal. Aim toward it and thrust slowly ahead. You can use RCS at this point or give a low puff with your main thrusters to close the distance further. You want to keep it slow; 5 m/s or so is generally plenty fast when you\u0027re a few hundred meters out, 1 m/s within the last 100 meters. Since you\u0027re wanting to do a rescue, you want to get generally no closer than about ten meters or so and keep it slow. Use RCS to maneuver primarily; WASD to rotate, H and N to translate forward and backward (i.e. speed up and slow down). Use caps locks to turn on fine control if you find you\u0027ve got too much RCS thrust. Once you\u0027re within ten meters or so, slow down to zero relative velocity. Quicksave. Then hit one of the bracket keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be in control of the Kerbal at this point. Hit L to turn on his headlamp, then R to activate his rocket pack. Controls are LEFT-SHIFT/LEFT-CTRL for up and down, W/S to go forward/backward, and A/D to burn left/right. You\u0027re looking for the command pod hatch. Just keep your puffs slow. When the Kerbal\u0027s close enough, use F to grab, then F again to board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, burn to de-orbit, dump off your rendezvous engine once you\u0027re definitely flying, and pop the chutes when you\u0027re ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck; let us know how it turns out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
