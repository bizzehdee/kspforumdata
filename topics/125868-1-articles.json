Typically, the deuterium/tritium fuel mixture is heated up until it becomes plasma, then it is guided magnetically into the reactor chamber where it can undergo fusion and turn into helium. Now here\u0026#39;s what I don\u0026#39;t understand; where does the helium go? how can it be removed without letting the hydrogen isotopes out as well, or without shutting down the reactor?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T00:52:16Z","Content":"\nput it in party balloons, problem solved. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHelium is very valuble now a days.

The primary use right now for He-3 is as a gas to fill neutrob detectors. It being only available as a decay product of tritium makes it horrendously expensive.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T01:12:44Z","Content":"\nThat should answer it:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]https://www.euro-fusion.org/faq/at-what-point-during-the-fusion-process-do-the-helium-nuclei-stop-adding-to-plasma-heating-and-become-an-impurity-to-be-removed/[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for getting Helium 3 for fusion: The Moon at first, and later on Uranus.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T01:39:40Z","Content":"\nhelium is probibly going to be removed by the vacuum system.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor reactions that produce alpha particles (helium nucleus), you can let them pick up an electron (usually as part of a direct conversion system), which makes them neutral. then it can be removed by mechanical means. polywells would do this on the p-b11 reaction. i dont know how tokamaks would remove their alpha particles, but i think they physically impact the walls (energy is too high to contain by the magnetic fields) and pick up an electron there to become neutral.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T02:01:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 02:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T13:20:30Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027SargeRho\u0027]\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for getting Helium 3 for fusion: The Moon at first, and later on Uranus.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr, you know, just bombard Lithium with neutrons to produce He3....
