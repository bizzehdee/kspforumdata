I believe this has happened with other parts too, but I\u0027m sure it always happens with the service bay. Then I can\u0027t attach any part to any point,\u00A0or save the craft, or click on many of the UI elements on screen until I reload the craft (the UI elements to do that still work). Can anyone else reproduce this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
