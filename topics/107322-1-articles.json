(I don\u0027t think so, but I haven\u0027t played in a few months.) The terminal velocity for the kerbals themselves at Kerbin\u0027s surface seems to be below their collision damage threshold. Twice now, I\u0027ve had (ahem) parachute malfunctions that involved a rapidly descending control pod. I EVA\u0027d the Kerbal at 5km and blasted her EVA pack at full charge toward the ground (which doesn\u0027t seem to affect her velocity much.) When she landed, she bounced a couple times and walked away. This strikes me as -- resilient to say the least.
