But I realized I hate Real fuels and all the shenanigan\u0027s of Igniters and fuel technology and tank types ect so I would like to return the the simplicity\u0027s of Liquid fuel and oxidizer because honestly whne I build a rocket I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s liquid oxygen and what ever, the engine simply has to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m just curious if theres any mods out there that doesn\u0027t change the engines fuels and rcs but Makes the Engines Scale up in performance for a 6.4X solar system that would still make rockets look realistic in fuel tank size?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T09:45:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 09:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dermeister\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T14:55:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a patch called \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/131023-SMURFF-Simple-Mass-adjUstments-for-Real-ish-Fuel-mass-Fractions-1-0-%282015-Aug-08%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESMURFF\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 to do just that - reduce the masses of parts to give real-ish fuel mass fractions.
