Is there a way to fix it without removing interstellar? Is there are a work around that allows you to use air intakes? Or is it a problem from interstellar itself and do i have to reply to that official thread?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever i try to connect any air intake in symmetry mode, the part detaches immediately and can\u0027t be attached anymore. The whole editor window becomes un-workable after. You can\u0027t click on anything anymore except the exit button. When an air intake is attached without symmetry, editors still works, but when you launch, weird things happen. It\u0027ll show my space center (although not always, like in the picture), with the vessel itself being very far in the background with reentry effects and sounds. The gimbal will show completely bugged, and none of the controls work anymore. The Escape key works though, but it will not give the option to revert the flight, you can only return to space center or resume. It\u0027s a very annoying bug because i\u0027m not able to use air intake and therefore can\u0027t make any planes. This is a picture of what it looks like to load a vessel with air intakes on it:\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VJfGFwa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VJfGFwa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
