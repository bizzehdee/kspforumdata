So i used mech jeb and that helps, but still pitches and rolls some.\n\nOne thing I noticed, when in orbit and using RCS. The shuttle rolls, pitches and yaws extremely fast. Even with caps lock enables.\n\nOn rentry, as soon as i touched the atmosphere, the shuttle started to gain altitude and would not lose speed. I ended up over shooting KSP and going past it by to continents. Once I was able to slow her down, and went through the reentry heat barrier, the shuttle only wanted to pitch down until it was at -90 deg pitch and I couldn\u0027t recover.\n\nAll in all, minor things that can be fixed. \n\nAnyone else have these issues?"},{"CreatedByName":"cheech420now","CreatedById":32124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T20:40:17Z","Content":"Yea aero is way off again"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T21:35:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yea aero is way off again\n\nThanks for the heads up.

Seems to me like the figures are reversed.\n\nReason I say is because the orbiter itself flies semi-reasonably if I fly it belly up. It\u0027ll stay straight but its hard to get it to pitch. I pulled up the COM/COL orbs in the VAB and the SPH and its listing the COL as being ahead of the COM.\n\nWith the Boosters and ET attached, it does nothing but roll and pitch down. Likely due to the COL/COM being problematic. As powerful as the wings are (even when aero was correct I did have to turn the CS\u0027 until I was ready for reentry), its likely that this relationship is screwing up launch just as much as its screwing up in-atmosphere flight.\n\nHad to cheat it into orbit because I just couldn\u0027t power through the aero mess. Works fine in orbit, though roll using RCS only is SUPER weak. And not only is that an issue for on-orbit activity, its an issue for reentry as well. While torque does take care of the job, its more realistic to use RCS only to control the orbiters movement in space. Seeing as this is a replica, the orbiter should be able to turn off SAS and still be capable of roll. \n\nOn that topic, the RCS is slightly unbalanced between the front and back. Up and down translation causes the orbiter to pitch up and down a bit, which indicates one of the thruster sets isn\u0027t set to the same strength as the other one and/or that they aren\u0027t properly spaced compared to the COM.\n\nAlso, I have no idea what did it or what conflict caused it, but my first loading it actually broke my test save completely with the \u0022VesselName\u0022 bug. I went to a full stock \u002B CSS install and everythings working fine now. But I should report it because my mod install was very stable until I introduced CSS.
