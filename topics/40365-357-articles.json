Nobody seems to have responded to my inquiry. I feel like the current antimatter collectors are awkward and chunky, and don\u0027t attach to things in a way that looks right... I would build the part myself, but the model isn\u0027t publicly available and i\u0027m not incredibly familiar with unity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artforz","CreatedById":108793,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T18:02:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Einarr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Einarr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny chance someone can update the chart for the Thermal Rocket Nozzles on the Wiki to include data for the 2.5m and 3.75m fusion reactors?
