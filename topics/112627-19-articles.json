It says that the technology has unresearched requirements, but there\u0027s nothing else connecting to it besides \u0022Control 2\u0022 \n\n[![d4lfIEnl.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/d4lfIEnl.jpg?1)](http://imgur.com/d4lfIEn)\n\nAlso, same reasoning, but it seems weird to me that the fighter wings and the tail and winglet are on a different node (that one to be precise that\u0027s why I want to research it).

You then \u0027Commit changes\u0027after which you can (again) enter a changelog and compare it to the master file. If all checks out you can hit \u0027Pull request\u0027 and Probus will receive your offerings.\n\n[@Jofe](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/101640-jofe/) That\u0027s odd, the current tech tree doesn\u0027t appear to have the Advanced Control surfaces dependent on anything else than the previous one. You\u0027re on the the latest build?   \nAs for the wings and tail and winglet, that is exactly why there is a separate line for aerodynamic (lifting) surfaces and for dynamic control surfaces. Wings generally have no moving control parts. Granted; Firespitter does get confusing with this as it incorporates ailerons/flaps in some of its wing parts.
