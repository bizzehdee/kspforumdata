If your rocket is set up to launch 6 major payloads, and then, oops, 5 days before the launch, one of the heaviest ones runs into a major technical flaw and needs another month, you\u0027ll have to scrub the launch, and hold up *every other* payload on the vehicle, because otherwise it would be delayed even more to transfer them to other launchers, or to reconfigure the launcher to fly with only 5 payloads on board. At which point, the 6th is left high and dry, waiting potentially years for another ride-share opportunity on another large rocket.\n\nThe same applies in reverse as well.

Herscel and Plank were launched together, for example. Many launch vehicles offer standardized secondary payloads, with Cubesat deployment modules a common secondary payload. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5) for example talks about Ariane 5 supporting up to 8 secondary payloads.\n\nWhy are they not done more often?\n\nWell, a manned launch is going to be much more stringent on safety, and probably wouldn\u0027t want to deal with complex secondary payloads. Also, insurance is bad enough with one payload carrying rocket fuel, imagine if you have a bunch of other payloads that also have rocket fuel to reach their own final orbits to deal with!\n\nPlus, the flight profiles need to match up - paying for a plane change is expensive, or you might not be able to find a rocket-roomy interested in the same destination you are heading.\n\nMission timing could also be a factor - with 5 paying payloads, there\u0027s 5x the chance something delays one - do you stop the whole launch for one tardy satellite?\n\nBeyond EC, KSP doesn\u0027t simulate the hassles of a real multi-vehicle launch - crews checking out their payloads, comm systems, etc. That\u0027s probably a factor as well."},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T19:03:08Z","Content":"Ariane already does this routinely with 2 satellites, and it\u0027s not uncommon to have a number of CubeSats on another launch because they\u0027re so small. However, there are issues with launching tons of things on one rocket. First, it only works if they\u0027re all going into mostly similar orbits -- if you have them going into different orbits, then you need to waste a lot of fuel moving things around between orbits (GTO is an exception, as it\u0027s not rare to have two payloads going to GTO). Keep in mind that real orbits are mostly not equatorial and at similar altitudes; real orbits are almost always at some inclination, often a significant one (again, GEO is an exception).\n\nAlso, it\u0027s highly questionable whether you\u0027d be saving money. The issue with a huge rocket is that they\u0027re really, really, really, really expensive; you need a \\*lot\\* of payload to make that worthwhile. Unless you have tons of missions that happen to be ready at around the same time, and which all take similar orbits and all fit on the rocket, you\u0027ll end up substantially under your weight budget, which means the launch will be very expensive compared to a smaller rocket. It\u0027s similar to why airlines fly regional jets instead of using 747s everywhere, or why mail carriers don\u0027t use semis on their routes -- having a huge capacity is only sensible if you can actually fill that capacity in a reasonable amount of time. In the actual launch market, there just aren\u0027t enough payloads to be able to reliably fill a huge rocket going to a specific orbit with 5-6 of them; that means a customer has to either wait a long time for other customers who can share the launch with them, or pay the cost of a massive rocket without many customers to split it between.\n\nCombining a \\*crew\\* module with cargo is what happened on the Space Shuttle, and was one reason it was so expensive. Manned spacecraft have to meet extremely high standards for reliability, and you don\u0027t need that for cargo (you can get by with more risky launches and an insured payload). Manned missions are also \\*really\\* expensive; combining with cargo requires the cargo customers to subsidize the manned mission to some degree. One lesson from the Shuttle is that building a craft to take a crew \\*and\\* cargo means the cargo launches end up being expensive."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T19:53:54Z","Content":"Orbital constraints and general practicality.
