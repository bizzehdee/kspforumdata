However, there are issues with launching tons of things on one rocket. First, it only works if they\u0027re all going into mostly similar orbits -- if you have them going into different orbits, then you need to waste a lot of fuel moving things around between orbits (GTO is an exception, as it\u0027s not rare to have two payloads going to GTO). Keep in mind that real orbits are mostly not equatorial and at similar altitudes; real orbits are almost always at some inclination, often a significant one (again, GEO is an exception).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s highly questionable whether you\u0027d be saving money. The issue with a huge rocket is that they\u0027re really, really, really, really expensive; you need a *lot* of payload to make that worthwhile. Unless you have tons of missions that happen to be ready at around the same time, and which all take similar orbits and all fit on the rocket, you\u0027ll end up substantially under your weight budget, which means the launch will be very expensive compared to a smaller rocket. It\u0027s similar to why airlines fly regional jets instead of using 747s everywhere, or why mail carriers don\u0027t use semis on their routes -- having a huge capacity is only sensible if you can actually fill that capacity in a reasonable amount of time. In the actual launch market, there just aren\u0027t enough payloads to be able to reliably fill a huge rocket going to a specific orbit with 5-6 of them; that means a customer has to either wait a long time for other customers who can share the launch with them, or pay the cost of a massive rocket without many customers to split it between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombining a *crew* module with cargo is what happened on the Space Shuttle, and was one reason it was so expensive. Manned spacecraft have to meet extremely high standards for reliability, and you don\u0027t need that for cargo (you can get by with more risky launches and an insured payload). Manned missions are also *really* expensive; combining with cargo requires the cargo customers to subsidize the manned mission to some degree. One lesson from the Shuttle is that building a craft to take a crew *and* cargo means the cargo launches end up being expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T19:53:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrbital constraints and general practicality.

Then calculate how much a delta-4 heavy rocket launch will cost. I\u0027m sure there is a point in the delta 4 heavy payload where it would be cheaper to launch multiple satellites atop the delta 4 heavy than to use multiple single payload rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don\u0027t understand why the amount of delta v used wouldn\u0027t be beneficial. Heavy lift rockets are designed to push higher mass objects into LEO. Arrange payloads delivered top to bottom according to orbital altitude, decouple them, then proceed to the next orbit needed. The SM would be shedding weight as it went up as it delivered the satellite payloads. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta 4 heavy launch with max payload weight worth of satellites on top. Delta 4 H has a max payload to LEO of 63,470 lb, 31,350 lb to GTO... that\u0027s a pretty hefty payload. A modern satellite can weigh UP TO 6 tons. That\u0027s 5 satellites in one go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much are 5 separate satellite rocket launches vs. 1 delta 4 H launch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta 4 heavy launches cost $435 million each. Space X falcon 9 launch is $62.5 million.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E62.5 x 5= 312.5 million. So its cheaper to do multiple launches with space x than one big one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT the average satellite launch for everyone else is upwards of $100-250 million PER launch. 100 x 5 = $500 million.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as a satellite company, I wouldn\u0027t be paying for the whole damn delta 4 rocket... I\u0027d be paying for my contributing payload mass. If 5 different companies each want to launch 1 satellite up on a delta 4 heavy, they\u0027d be splitting the $435 million 5 ways. That\u0027s $85 million each. CHEAPER than the average.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The way to look at it is $/tonne rather than $/launch.
