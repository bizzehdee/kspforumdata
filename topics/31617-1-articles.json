But I just made a quick little Euler-integrating spreadsheet (RK4 is more trouble than it\u0027s worth in Excel) to convince myself for sure, and it looks like either you\u0027re right or my math is wrong. Or maybe both I suppose. But yeah, it looks like you are better off just taking the steering losses than letting gravity add any vertical speed. I might have to change my landing profiles now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: And regarding payload fraction for Mun ascent, can\u0027t say I\u0027ve tried that one. I\u0027ve done tons of Mun craft optimizing for Kerbin mass with all sorts of different combinations of constraints (jets/no jets, pod/seat, etc), but my Mun landers tend to be tiny enough that their design is dictated more by discrete engine/tank choices than anything continuous like optimal TWR or trajectory.
