So I can balance the plane to VTOL OFF of a planet\u0027s surface with a full fuel load before it converts to rear engine flight, but a VTOL LANDING coming in from interplanetary space with barely any fuel left is incredibly hard to balance. Even if I somehow balanced it for running on fumes... then with a full load it\u0027s imbalanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way I can think of to land a plane as big as mine on a body with no atmosphere is to come in butt first, use the main engines angled retrograde to kill velocity, and then land as gently as possible on the landing gear rolling backwards. My plane has gear on the tail for precisely this maneuver. I have yet to test this out though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the drill. Sitting on the runway, the drill goes through the floor, into the ground and has the drilling animation. Though I need to fly to a kethane deposit on Kerbin and see if it actually picks it up, I do believe it will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, yeah screens of your wing construction would be awesome. You can see in my last post I\u0027m using the ginormous wings. Though they give tons of lift, they\u0027re a bit big for my taste. Just make it harder to roll the craft around in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I tested my revised version of the interplanetary kethane plane, and it made it to orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E With absolutely zero fuel remaining. I didn\u0027t do a good job circularizing so I blame it on my own ineptitude that the plane is in this somewhat eccentric orbit, but it\u0027s orbit nonetheless.
