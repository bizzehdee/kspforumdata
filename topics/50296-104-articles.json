If you\u0027re coming in fast, keep it shallow; if you\u0027ve got enough DV to scrub most of your orbital speed in advance, you can get away with something steeper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Your first job is to halt the initial drop. Forget about ditching speed or anything else, just pull the nose up so you can level out again. Pull up too hard and you\u0027ll flip out of control and/or break your wings, but too slow and you\u0027ll cook. I usually keep an AoA of 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or so throughout the process, gradually pulling up as I go (actual recommended AoA varies based on aircraft, altitude and speed; you need to experiment for yourself). Aim to have it levelled out by 30,000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Now, watch the VSI and your temperature gauges (DaMichel\u0027s Kerbal Flight Data is very good for temperature monitoring). Gradually descend until the temperature is just shy of lethal (usually around 1,300\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C on my planes), then hold that altitude until it cools. Once the temperature drops, drop with it. Stay alert and be ready to pull the nose up quickly if the temperature spikes; there\u0027s a fair lag between lifting the nose and stopping the heating, so if you leave it too late you\u0027re toast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) You\u0027ll probably find that you need to stay above 25,000m until you get down to Mach 5 or so. Decelerating above 25,000m is slow; decelerating below 25,000m is fast. As well as greater drag, the lower air provides enough grip to get some useful S-turns happening. If you can get your reentry speed below hypersonic and avoid the initial high-altitude cooling phase, reentry and landing is a much faster process.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JamesL86","CreatedById":127321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T05:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem to be having an issue with the Inflatable Heatshield.
