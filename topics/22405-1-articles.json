Anyway I\u0027m super excited about this discovery as well, it made me completely forget about the presidential debate! It would be awesome to have a probe visit that system, my money is on antimatter engines fueled by antimatter harvested from the Earth\u0027s Van-Allen belts (making antimatter in particle accelerators is to slow and expensive). Perhaps the speed of the craft could be augmented by attaching a solar sail and sending it on a sun-dive to provide an extra kick to start its voyage, and we could build a big station in space or on the moon that could focus a powerful laser beam on the sail to accelerate it further. In that case maybe most of the antimatter could be used to decelerate on approach to Alpha Centauri B. Also, although it will be tremendously expensive, we should probably send several, just incase one bumps into a grain of dust while traveling at relativistic speeds or something. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-17T20:50:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlready have a thread on this, actually: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/24236-Earth-sized-planet-found-orbiting-Alpha-Centauri-B\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/24236-Earth-sized-planet-found-orbiting-Alpha-Centauri-B\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
