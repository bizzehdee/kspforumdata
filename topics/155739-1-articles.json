I believe there is a lot of space for improvement to the vanilla options, and have thought of overhauling some of the worst offenders and creating several new types of contracts in the hope of refreshing the game. As my first post on the KSP Forums, I\u0027d like to field my ideas to the community for peer review and see if this is something I should pursue or possibly start campaigning for others to pursue. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout much further ado, these are my current plans for the proposed add-on (copied and expounded on from the napkin it was originally written on)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECONTRACTS PLUS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncrease the # of contracts a player can choose from in Mission Control.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:80px;\u0022\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking by 1-3, just to add more options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERoutine Parts Maintenance.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:80px;\u0022\u003E\nIn real life, the stuff we put in space needs maintenance if we expect it to stay there for extended lengths of time. Random part failure being a little extreme for me, I thought of just making the upkeep contractual. The various corporations will pay you to go and perform maintenance, and refusing the contract won\u0027t cause things to break because it\u0027s assumed they would simply give the contract to someone else. Completing the contract would be done in a similar way to the parts testing missions done in the early game, with an additional button popping up in the parts UI letting you \u0022perform maintenance\u0022 provided you\u0027re currently on an EVA. There is also room for variety and varying levels of difficulty. The contract could merely ask a conveniently on-site Kerbal to do an EVA. You might need to rendezvous with an unmanned probe to do the EVA, and that probe could be in space or landed. It could even lead to a hunt around the craft to figure out which part needs the maintenance in true Kerbal fashion (the programming precedent is set by some EVA crew report missions asking you to find the source of \u0022observational inconsistencies\u0022). Finally, and more experimentally, I was thinking of adding a \u0022done by a professional\u0022 requirement to the hardest missions, forcing you to use a specific kerbal profession (pilot, scientist, or engineer) to do the parts maintenance and fully complete the contract (maybe even a specifically leveled kerbal!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECrew Rotation.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:80px;\u0022\u003E\nKerbals have families too! These contracts would essentially ask you to bring up a replacement kerbal to take over for more homesick kerbals, and then bring that poor astronaut back to Kerbin safely. It may also include contracts to fully staff those spacecraft with 21 seats but only 1 kerbal. #SaveMe #ForeverAlone\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETourism/VIP missions.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:80px;\u0022\u003E\nAfter completing several of these back to back in order to gain #AllTheFunds, I realized that they could use some more variety in terms of destinations. All the tourists these days want to see are the natural features of the Kerbol system, when there are probably a bunch of cool looking stations and bases which we want to show off. Overhauling the tourism contracts to include tours of the stuff we\u0027ve built, possibly requiring extended stays (precedent possibly set in the Asteroid Day developer mods included mission) could be really cool. Also the contract text could use a little more variety.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERefueling missions.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:80px;\u0022\u003E\nThese could pop up for any craft with a less than half full fuel tank and a docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFlag missions.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:80px;\u0022\u003E\nThe current flag missions, while great money makers, are bland. Plant flag on named planet. That simplicity is nice, but doesn\u0027t need to be the only choice. We could have contracts telling us to plant flags in certain places on a planet! see what I did there? the places could be determined by biome, or the more randomly specific \u0022Plant flag on the surface near Gamma Site\u0022. Corporations could also have you place multiple flags at sites alpha-gamma for them in order to mark out land use borders, before telling you to get off their lawn (Mission Control assures you that their claims are rediculous)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEVA missions.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:80px;\u0022\u003E\nSo, EVA missions are cool and fun to do. But in space, I rarely if ever have to do them. I\u0027m discounting the ones where I duck out of the hatch, take a quick report, and head back inside. While those have their uses, we could also use a little gentle prodding to let go of our handrails and really space walk. Conceptually, I\u0027d like to lift the mechanical systems used for missions requiring multiple surface samples, and apply them to the 2.5km physics bubble around a spacecraft, to result in \u0022sectors\u0022 spawning around the spacecraft and even moving with it. Contracts would be of 2 varieties that I\u0027ve thought of. Someone dropped their multimillion dollar Hydrospanner out the airlock and it\u0027s floated out to beta sector, go search for it (EVA report) or, Mission Control wants you to perform a photo op with (insert spacecraft here), head out to sectors alpha-gamma and take pictures of the old girl (Also EVA report). That last one though... I get a small chill thinking about doing it.

The ones we currently have are fine, but we can do better and with more variety. I\u0027d like to add harder rescue missions with eccentric and highly elliptical orbits, with multiple kerbals in need of rescue. I\u0027d also like to address the glaring hole in rescue missions... There\u0027s never anyone to rescue on Kerbin itself. Wait a minute, I hear your protests. But why would they need rescue and, wouldn\u0027t the recover vehicle system break the mission? Not if we\u0027re smart. A rescue mission on Kerbin doesn\u0027t have to be called a \u0022rescue mission\u0022 instead we can call it \u0022Extract Corporate Defector\u0022 or something similar, and stipulate in the contract that once you pick up the Kerbal in question, you must land again on the KSP runway to complete the mission. Completing the contract could remove some reputation, but what else are we doing with reputation in career mode? Done and Done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDebris Recovery/Destruction.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:80px;\u0022\u003E\nBring the space junk back intact for profit! But the game always makes space junk for me when I\u0027m making plenty of the floating space debris myself. I\u0027d like the system to also include as candidates for recovery the stuff I leave behind. I\u0027d also love to see a contract to de-orbit an aging space station.

Complete with hand holding and \u0022easter eggs this way\u0022 arrows. I don\u0027t want to miss seeing that stuff. So I\u0027d make a set of contracts which did that without being too meta about it, but add an option to toggle them off in the settings, cause I can totally understand it if that ruins the fun of finding them for others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbital Adjustment Missions.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:80px;\u0022\u003E\nSometimes, close is not good enough. The orbit must be perfectly circular and directly over the equator. I pledge to build in mechanics which can detect when you are too lazy to properly circularize, and then generate a contract to pay you to FIX IT! Why? I dunno, just because if I know I can occasionally get triggered by it, Some Kerbal somewhere must also get triggered by it, and I want to read that mission briefing.
