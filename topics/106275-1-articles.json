I need to ust tempscan in area above 19km.\n\nI had 3 attempts and all of the, ended badly. After i get 900 m\\s at 18km alt i have reentry heat crashing my plane\u0027s nose and it becomes unoperable. \n\nBut if i not reaching high speed i have no engine thrust to get 20km alt.

Your science gear can go in the service bay, and if you must have a Science Jr it can be stashed behind the cockpit.\n\nJust be sure to get it over 20,000m before you break 1,000m/s if you don\u0027t want your Kerbals to cook.
