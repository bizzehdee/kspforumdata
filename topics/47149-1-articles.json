I docked the two craft and left them there for about 6 KSP years, being to busy to recover the kerbals and not wanting to de-orbit a historic site. About a week ago, though, I decided to recover the kerbals from the craft. I brought up my standard recovery craft and EVA\u0027ed the kerbals over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E One thing I noticed was that Jebediah was smiling insanely and did so throughout the whole mission. The other three kerbals were acting normally. I landed the craft and am now preparing for a mission to Laythe, but Jeb hasn\u0027t stopped smiling! It\u0027s starting to scare me now.
