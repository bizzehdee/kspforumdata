At first it would break apart if it went above 5m/s, so I tried moving the engines completely underwater and forward of the COM. This raised the nose when underway which allowed slightly faster speeds so I suspect that, initially, it was a problem of too much drag or pressure with the nose driving under the water at speed. Following this logic, I removed the side tanks (also because you can\u0027t actually dock the little jet hopper craft using KAS because the legs just clip into the platform, so I didn\u0027t need that fuel) and moved the engines so that the center of thrust was only slightly ahead of the COM. Since the ship was already a bit rear-heavy at that point it floated with the nose tilted up. This actually works out better with a payload anyway. I took it up around 10m/s and suspect it could reach 15m/s at full throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-06T15:41:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2014 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
