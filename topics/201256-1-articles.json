You will need to make sure the blades are deployed. You need a blade angle around 9 degrees to get moving when stationary. The faster the plane goes, the more you will need to angle the blades. There are different ways to do this, but I like to use the KAL-1000 to set the blade deployment angle from 0 to 45 degrees. You can bind this to either one of the translation controls or to the main throttle. Here are a couple of tutorials that may help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/30R6sekvmrk?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-RtvjX5QZo?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
