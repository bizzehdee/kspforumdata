I like to put them on reactors so I can think of it as a service and maintenance port. You can save a lot of mass and design complexity by adding in this one small part. So many options open up when the majority of your vessels can have small support ships dock with them. You can even install docking adapters or extensions if you need to dock two larger vessels together.
