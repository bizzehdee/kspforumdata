Gene had designed it himself, and he was quite proud of it, pool included. It had it all--vending machines, meeting rooms and even a nice view of the VAB. It even had a helipad. As the head of KSC architecture, Gene considered the Administration Building to be his magnum opus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, the kerbonauts were having quite a lot of fun in the pool, so the Director had to tap the microphone to get everyone\u0027s attention. \u0022Thank you all for coming,\u0022 he said. \u0022I hope you\u0027re all enjoying the pool. I want to do two things while I still have your attention, and Harv knows how long that will be, so I better be quick about it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone in the pool chuckled. Despite appearances, the Director did have a sense of humor. He continued. \u0022First of all, I would like to thank Prokjet Enterprises for giving us these new parts to use in our spacecraft.\u0022 He pointed at the other side of the pool, where there were all sorts of shiny new parts on display, from cargo bays to adapters to a huge new cockpit. Everyone clapped and cheered--new spaceplane parts had been needed for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Second, I would like to welcome some new people to the JSP team! Please welcome Walt, Mortimer and Linus Kerman!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three kerbals walked out onto the podium, and there was even more clapping and cheering. They took a bow, and the Director motioned the first one forward. Clad in a HAZMAT suit, he looked like he belonged at the Quarantine Center in R\u0026amp;D. \u0022Hello, I\u0027m Walt Kerman,\u0022 he said, smiling. \u0022I\u0027m our new Public Relations head. You\u0027re probably wondering what the suit is about. Well, I used to work with monopropellant, and that stuff is really toxic, so I had to wear this. I never got out of the habit. But hey, it can\u0027t hurt, right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were some chuckles as Walt stepped off the podium and motioned the second kerbal forward. He was an older kerbal--much older than anyone else on the premises, in fact, and it was starting to show. \u0022I am Mortimer Kerman, your new accountant. I used to be the CEO of Rockomax, so I consider myself quite worthy of this position of illustrious power. I will serve this space program well.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb leaned over to Bob and whispered, \u0022He\u0027s an old geezer, isn\u0027t he?\u0022 Bob elbowed him in the ribs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the third kerbal stepped onto the podium. He looked like a typical scientist type, and had a bright smile on his face. \u0022Hello, I\u0027m Linus Kerman, and I\u0027m the new assistant scientist at the JSP. You may have heard of me from the Kraken Drive research papers, or from my website, Linus Academy. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m not replacing anyone. I\u0027ll just be handling the practical, day-to-day science affairs, while \u003Cem\u003EWerner\u003C/em\u003E handles the bigger, more theoretical science.\u0022 He spat out the name \u0027Werner\u0027 with absolute contempt and a little hatred.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Director stepped back onto the podium. \u0022It is my firm belief that this trio will serve the Jedi Space Program admirably. And now, as a special treat, you get to watch the first unmanned test of the Vulture Mk.1, a new SSTO using Porkjet parts!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone cheered as the new spaceplane rolled down the runway. It took off as majestically as an eagle...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...And promptly flipped over, did a corkscrew and and slammed into the Administration Building, as majestically as an albatross attempting a barrel roll. It went up in the biggest, most spectacular explosion the KSC had ever seen, topping the SRB Research Department\u0027s best efforts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs everyone else ran off to make way for the newly hired fire-and-rescue team, Walt, Mortimer and Linus stood in the rubble, watching Gene cry \u0022NOOOOOOOO! My baby! Why?!?!?!?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This won\u0027t be good for our PR,\u0022 Walt lamented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It will cost thousands to get this fixed!\u0022 Mortimer said, facepalming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus smirked. \u0022Good science, though. We now know that the indestructible buildings are actually destructible...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThanks for reading, and prepare for 0.25!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T22:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaha, nice summary of what most people will be doing in 0.25.
