I checked that the wheels are all aligned so don\u2019t know what\u2019s the issue. Spent several hours to fix this problem, but my attempts so far had been unsuccessful.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qWy8sd1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002261.77\u0022 height=\u0022585\u0022 width=\u0022947\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qWy8sd1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, I checked the wheels and made sure they\u0027re all aligned.\u00A0 So I don\u0027t know how to fix the issue.\u00A0 Wondering if you guys could help me take a look if you have time?\u00A0 I uploaded my craft to KerbalX.\u00A0 Though I\u0027m using mods, the spaceplane itself should be made of all stock parts.\u00A0 If you could help me take a look, I would be very grateful!\u00A0 Thank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Noblejms/Helio-Mark-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Noblejms/Helio-Mark-3\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clamp-o-Tron","CreatedById":201818,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-17T06:01:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis probably has something to do with the fact that the runway is flat, when Kerbin is very slightly curved, causing the drift. It should be going to the left, correct? Try tapping the D key periodically.
