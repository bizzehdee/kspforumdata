The problem being that if surface attachment is turned on, then you can attach things to the fairings themselves. This sounds like it\u0027s not a problem, except for the fact that things start phantom floating (sticking in their original position) when the fairings are jettisoned. So, a bug of sorts, but I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s due to the current mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:46:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could just turn on surface attach in the cfg and see what happens, seeing as it\u0027s off though I guess it\u0027s by design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
