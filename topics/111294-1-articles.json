Once I leave the atmosphere is it an instant change to a vaccum, or is it a gradual change?

From a practical standpoint, you should be using engines with a high TWR and good sea level ISP when low in the atmosphere. By the time you switch to vacuum-only engines, the air will be thin enough that the ISP will be practically identical to the vacuum ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T21:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, since the change in Isp is gradual (right click an engine on ascent and you will see its thrust rising as you gain altitude, and for the same fuel consumption) you almost have a vacuum Isp @35km. For example, the 909 sucks on the ground but has a good Isp in vacuum : you will already be getting about 50.5 kN (vacuum is 60) of thrust at only 35-40km, although perfect vacuum is 35km higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you use proper lifter engines for first stage (don\u0027t try to liftoff with a poodle or 909) , you shouldn\u0027t have to worry about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
