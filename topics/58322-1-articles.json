This means more setup work. I\u0027ve included a zipped bat file, unpack it in the main IDSkillfulR1 directory and run it to apply the Skillful module to all the stock parts. Optionally you can edit b9 parts as well as those for Procedural Dynamics (pwings) parts. As these mods change they will likely add more parts so the batch file will not cover those. If you\u0027d like a mod to support Skillful, then ask those mod authors to contact me, I\u0027ll help them out - its literally 5 lines to add to each part CFG.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdded heat seeking SAMs. Add them like any other missile/rocket to your craft... set the guard mode to true/on. Fly an hostile IFF vessel within 500m and it will launch. Add multiple SAMs to your craft... set one to guard, after the first one fires... the next one will arm in 8 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGone are the falling apart vessels, and say hello to higher frame rates!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate (Apr5@12:55pm) - Details to come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate (mar29@3:34) Fixed some issues with ordnance not clearing/loading. Added Dynamic vessel loading ranges. - Double clicking targets further than 10km away will result in the game loading all vessels within 20km. There are 4 levels of loading up to 99km. Added an experimental Trident missile as well as the KLU-82b Air-Burst bomb with parachute. These will need more tweaking as time goes on, but they both fill the void for air-burst weapons that was supposed to make it into the initial release. Major Fix for stock fuel tanks, after watching a few community videos I realized there was something wrong. Also Liquid fuel, Ammo, and Antimatter (interstellar support) will now cause some crazy explosions if hit properly. Fuel hit in space will need a supply of Oxidizer in the same part, without it no explosion!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate (mar22@2:44) Fixed the saving/loading... Fixed issue with the world position shift causing fires on the ground to follow you around in the sky. Fixed an issue with ordnance/rocket pods not being clearable. Improved rocket speed and now less likely to damage the firing vessel. Fixed bombs by allowing a brief moment of zero collision on release. Added new fire FX for smaller ordnance. Fixed cluster bombs so they now have Incendiary effects and damage. Added new model for the medium rocket Ex Hellfire... now Zephyr. Tweaked a ton of little things. Added one more pre-made craft... a ground attack aircraft, my Naval Bat - in CAS role. Very stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate (mar19@12:47) Fixed the saving/loading yet again, this was a key issue. Rocket pods/rockets underwent some edits as they were clipping on reload, and the pods would sometimes break/fail to load on EVA. You can now rescue the pod by EVA Fix Pod to reset it to it\u0027s start condition if an error occurs. Tweaked the rocket a bit to make it hit a bit better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate (mar16@11:07pm) fixed an issue with saving/loading, I\u0027m sure there are more, but this was somewhat important. I also fixed the issue with ordnance not showing up in the hangar when a craft is loaded. Lastly there were issues with detached parts bouncing under the ground, they will now go away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate (mar15@11:22pm) has added support for custom keybinds to control manual turrets and the fire key. This should support any Keycodes listed \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIN THIS LIST\u003C/a\u003E - be sure to edit the cfg for each of the 3 manual turrets (30cal, tank and battleship).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mod is not MULTIPLAYER. Nor can I say it will be supported when playing a multiplayer mod.

Really I wanted to build a damage system in the beginning, then realized the only way to make it work correctly was to make the projectiles that interact with it at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe damage system accounts for the structure of the part/object, the material hardness, how flammable it is, if it can sink. Etc. Fire might start in one part, then spread out. Etc. My parts will include multiple damage states, at least 1 damage state. So visually you\u0027ll see if you have penetrated the part or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system uses a flexible assortment of ammo types all are resources that have mass. So every bullet in the magazine has mass, I\u0027ve calculated all the different ammo masses so they are semi-realistic (if kerbal mass is 1 metric ton per unit). Each ammo has different characteristics mass, velocities and can be set to various warhead types, AP, HE Incendiary, or normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBombs and rockets and eventually torpedoes are loaded EVA from a common resource depot, all have changeable options - cluster, incendiary, HE AP etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CIWS turrets have what I call \u0027guardian mode\u0027 that essentially is activated when the player is not in control of the vessel the gun is on.
