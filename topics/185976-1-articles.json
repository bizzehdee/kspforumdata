As you enter the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E) it exerts its gravity on your vessel. If you pass behind the Mun (relative to it\u0027s prograde orbit) you get a slingshot effect, gaining velocity. If you pass in front of the Mun (once again relative to prograde orbit) it tugs you the other way and slows you down a little. I\u0027m guessing the rotate signs you are seeing is your vessel\u0027s exit point for whatever body\u0027s sphere of influence you are in. Hover your cursor over it and it should say and give you a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome orbits can have multiple encounters with the same body over consecutive orbits. In this case you would see the projected effects of each assist in map view as different colored trajectories. In the case below I will first enter the Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E at a low orbit (the purple bit). If I wish to enter orbit I would burn at the periapsis (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E) of that purple bit.

I think Ive got the hang of this now. Got a bit nervous landing on Mun as I was still too fast but it just slowed in time to feather it down. I was mightily impressed. My wife just looked at me like an idiot. 317 Science. yay!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Ive got all the normal anti normal, radial etc etc stuff sussed out. I picked my spot on Mun and landed there. So, Im simply a trainee now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow Im off back there using the bigger capsule for 3 kerbins and a better rocket. To try a different biome. Then I should try some aircraft maybe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBloody daft game, but strangely satisfying. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-30T17:48:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, sure.
