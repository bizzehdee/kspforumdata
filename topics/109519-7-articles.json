THANK YOU SO MUCH for this! Acceleration it is! Limiting it to 17ms in mechjeb works for pretty much every situation with this rocket. Although god knows I limited the thrust in many ways during my previous tests. Not enough it would seem.\n\nSo maybe we can assume some stock engines are a bit unbalanced? This set of parts was meant to recreate the SLS after all...\n\nAnyway, as a thank you, I\u0027ll reveal whats under the fairngs, or rather what would ideally be under there:\n\n![pmVwZlR.png](http://i.imgur.com/pmVwZlR.png)\n\nThe orbital stage engine is actually a LVT-45 \u0022Swivel\u0022, while the Rockomax brand adapter is modified to have some fuel, so it mimics the stats of the Rockomax X-200-8 fuel tank: 4.5 mass, 360 LF and 440 Ox. Here you can see a KW fairing support / decoupler, as well as the SHDI service module.\n\nFor testing purpose I used stock parts only exept for the modified adapter, but also tried the same as you.\n\nAnyway, your solution works for both configurations!\n\n@johnFX, I did use struts for the boosters, I lnow the rule ^^.
