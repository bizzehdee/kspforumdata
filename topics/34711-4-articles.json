I hope this gets some love and gets integrated and expanded. Try struting a small docking port to the end of an arm and docking it to the miner. Either just have vertical joints that are in line with the rover and use the rover to line up and the arm to line up vertically or make a long multi jointed arm that can home in on the port. Romfarer Docking Camera is very useful for giving you the point of view of the port and making it easier to line up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobhendly","CreatedById":70841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T17:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnything New?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothke","CreatedById":51185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T17:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bobhendly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bobhendly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnything New?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot before Kerbin City build 2 is out.
