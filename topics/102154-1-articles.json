If you can elaborate that is nice. Maybe the MJ/L isn\u0027t as high as some other fuels or some other reason, but I think that it is somewhere upon those lines. Also, Gasoline is probably pretty dense for a rocket fuel. Again, not sure, but if you could clear that up for me, I would appreciate it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T18:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ediesel can work not sure about gasoline\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T18:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the kind of temperatures you get in a rocket engine, various components in standard gasoline will polymerise together.

RP-1 is actually extremely similar to petrol, as is Jet A1 and its local variations - but all of them are, as mentioned, extremely refined to remove some problematic compounds that will tend to gunk up in these engines. Rockets are actually the more sensitive to this issue though, as they use their fuel for cooling where jet engines do not - fuel\u0027s first interaction with significant heat and air in a jet engine is combustion, and modern engines consistently have near-total combustion leaving very little residue. Jets can, entirely feasibly, run on petrol, and quite often will be demonstrated doing so - rockets are too sensitive to risk to a problematic fuel, and so performance-driven that you\u0027d rather have something you can be absolutely sure of the performance and behaviour of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T20:55:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHypothetically you could make a liquid-fueled rocket fueled by gasoline.

And there are probably operating difficulties of gasoline since it has much lower boiling point (difficult to stabilize I suppose).
