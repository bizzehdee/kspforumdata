It is known that some worms altered their biochemistry to make themselves work more efficiently in low oxygen environments. Most of the shale that we see that is rich in organics comes before the cambrian, so it is possible that these innovations in metabolism were novel for complex eucaryotes of the period. Because catabolism in oxygen poor layers was essentially stopped those layers once penetrated would have been rich in hydrogen sulfide and metal salts thereof. We know this is true because some of the most ancient bacteria utilize sulfate as an oxygen source when oxygen is in short supply for other organisms, and the end result is sulfide. So the sub benthic would have been diificult to access but a rich sourceof energy once mastered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, no one can travel back to the period and see for certain, and the sampling of this papers results are small so ............\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
