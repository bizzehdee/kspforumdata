Thing is, she wants it to be non-vocal, upbeat but not dance-y, and from the 1950\u0027s. This is a set of criteria that narrows my search quite sharply, leaving me with not much in the way of songs to page through. So, I was wondering if any of you guys knew of any such music. (It actually doesn\u0027t NEED to be from the 1950\u0027s, just sound like it.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
