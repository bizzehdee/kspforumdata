My understanding is that at the core of the warhead is a nuclear fission device, surrounded by a shell of deuterium. When the fission device is ignited, the adjacent deuterium has so much energy dumped into it that it actually undergoes fusion, which generates a huge amount of energy as well. As far as I know, a great deal of the bomb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s destructive power comes from the fission at the core, and the energy of fusion is just a way of boosting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the question. I was reading a little about the Tsar Bomba and how the fission device was so huge, yadda yadda yadda, and there was a lot of concern about the environmental impact the fallout would cause. But from what I know, radioactive fallout is just spent fuel from the fission reaction that has been spread out by the blast. So instead of scaling up a standard nuclear warhead and dropping that, would it work if you just used a normal fission device and encased it in tons more hydrogen than usual, since the heat of the fusion would spread throughout the entire shell and ignite it all? Would that work, and if so, would it be a more environmentally safe option? And if it does work, is there actually any limit to the strength of a thermonuclear warhead, since you could just keep packing on hydrogen?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T05:03:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, you do not understand how a thermonuclear explosive works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe output from the fission primary is focused to compress and heat the fusion secondary (the high energy neutron output from this secondary can be used to produce additional fission, if desired).

They considered only the lithium-6 isotope in the lithium deuteride secondary to be reactive; the lithium-7 isotope, accounting for 60% of the lithium content, was assumed to be inert.[8] It was expected that lithium-6 isotope would absorb a neutron from the fissioning plutonium and emit an alpha particle and tritium in the process, of which the latter would then fuse with the deuterium and increase the yield in a predicted manner. Lithium-6 indeed reacted in this manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was assumed that the lithium-7 would absorb one neutron, producing lithium-8 which decays (via beryllium-8) to a pair of alpha particles on a timescale of seconds\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACvastly longer than the timescale of nuclear detonation. However, when lithium-7 is bombarded with energetic neutrons, rather than simply absorbing a neutron, it captures the neutron and decays almost instantly into an alpha particle, a tritium nucleus, and another neutron. As a result, much more tritium was produced than expected, the extra tritium fusing with deuterium and producing an extra neutron. The extra neutron produced by fusion and the extra neutron released directly by lithium-7 decay produced a much larger neutron flux. The result was greatly increased fissioning of the uranium tamper and increased yield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T13:56:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, only a few bombs (notably neutron bombs) since castle bravo were enriched with tritium - but with the tritium short half-life, in order to keep those bombs ready, they needed to replace the decayed tritium each year (roughly 1 gram of tritium per year per bomb, and remove the byproduct from the decay too.
