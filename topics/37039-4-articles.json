This is wasteful for all but the biggest parts, and the smaller parts in this pack, like the sepratron 2, could look just as good with 256*256 textures, which use only one sixteenth as much RAM. Also, while the Twofold is incredibly useful, it uses 5 or 6 1024x textures. The textures should be resized to no larger than 512*512, due to RAM hogging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I see that a remodel of the twofold is scheduled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-29T19:24:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2013 07:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by wasmic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T20:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you started on anything new?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helix935","CreatedById":71312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T18:59:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis the LADEE still being worked on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T18:53:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how\u0027s it going?

Chimer4\u0027s is a good example of how the basic layout should look, but the Centaur (both SEC and DEC) needs to have a movable nozzle skirt.

As it stands, OAM works as a full 3rd stage, which shouldn\u0027t be the case. It\u0027s merely an adjustment module to fine-tune the orbit. Also, in reality, the OAM doesn\u0027t have a single engine, but four small MR-107 thrusters mounter along the inside of it\u0027s rim. They\u0027re pretty much RCS thrusters, used for attitude control and orbital adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T21:18:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe atlas v from chimer4 is pretty amazing IMHO, though atlas III needs work\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ganinian","CreatedById":65890,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T08:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ealright then, but I\u0027ll finish up the athena pack first, and also I\u0027m thinking of doing the minotaur to go with the LADEE\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T14:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMinotaur is a nice idea, too.

Minotaur I uses an Orion 50XL stage. The entire Orion family doesn\u0027t really differ from this stage, only be length. So you could have, for the cheap, Orion 50, Orion 50S and Orion 50SXL. That and a Castor-120 adapter would allow you to make Taurus and Taurus XL. You could also model a set of wings and rear fins and make a Pegasus and Pegasus XL rocket.
