I thought two would work because you can use two docking ports between the same craft.\n\nI tried connecting one grabber, freeing the pivot and swinging the other one into place but the second grabber would not take hold. It did seem to be connected as it would not show the disarm button but did not take hold as the chute craft could still swing on the pivot of the first grabber.\n\nThen I released the first grabber and the chut ship moved away from the debris easily, but the debris appeared to vanished and I could not go to space center or switch via minimap and had to Alt F4 to get out, so clearly a bug there FYI.\n\nI was going to make a bug report but though it my not have been designed for this kind of play so I thought I would put it in a suggestion. \n\nComments welcome.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T17:25:11Z","Content":"I do believe that you cannot claw onto your own ship, because of the way KSP\u0027s tree system works with .craft and .sfs persistence versions of .craft files.\n\nThough docking ports work like that.... ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nThe Klaw is extremely buggy, and I think that\u0027s what your problem is. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kTg3vB8x3TY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
