But a lot of these discussions seem to be putting the capsule before the booster and make big assumptions about what the design goals of this hypothetical multiplayer is. So I figured I\u0027d throw out a few questions to ponder how little we really know about what Squad is doing for multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHow many players can be involved in a multiplayer game? It would have to be at least two, otherwise it\u0027s not really multiplayer. Is that the maximum? Could there be 4? 8? 100? Will there be a fixed limit?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDoes multiplayer happen synchronously? Must all players be playing at the same time? If nobody\u0027s around, does time still move forward?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIs there a dedicated server? Or is it just synced between the players participating? (The answer here can greatly change the options/answers for some of the other questions).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECan I join a game in progress? As a new player? As a replacement for an existing but not present player?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAssume ownership of any vessel belongs to the player that created it. Who owns the resulting vessel when two vessels dock? Is it shared? What happens with ownership when we undock?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIs it cooperative or competitive by nature? Does everyone have their own little KSCs (possibly at different locations), or is it all part of one space program?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I\u0027m not really looking for answers to these (unless any of these have been answered by Squad before).... I\u0027m just trying to toss out the questions that I expect Squad would\u0027ve had to think about before embarking on this effort. If there\u0027s other design questions that you believe are important, let\u0027s hear them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, this is what I expect to see happen, as it what would be the least effort to add to the current game is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMultiplayer is not hosted, players arrange their own games. Games are limited in player numbers (2 being by far the most common and most manageable).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThere is one space program that everyone partakes in. Everyone has equal access to all vessels (ie. no concept of ownership).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThere is no concept of different time frames. There is global timewarp, probably with some sort of voting system.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMinimal Kerbal Alarm Clock type functionality will probably also get added so that you know when your probe is about to hit the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGoing interplanetary is only done once you\u0027ve gotten the okay from other players to warp ahead 3 years.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond, that I\u0027d expect to see features for chat/voice chat, view-only mode to see what other players are doing and that\u0027s about it. People will do their own space races, with the honor system for not messing with each other\u0027s vessels. Waiting is a thing that will happen when one person is in the middle of a launch and another in the middle of going somewhere (instead of waiting, this is the time you go design something in the VAB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s what I think multiplayer\u0027s gonna look like, after thinking about the most likely answers to the above questions. All the multi-timeframe stuff just gets way complicated way too fast (both from a development standpoint and a player standpoint), and the issues it causes are worse than the issue of forced-player waiting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T20:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgree with everything here, besides the no ownership part, you should be able to choose if it\u0027s a joint mission or your mission\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T20:31:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I had to wait 20 minutes to perform an interplanetary burn, then God-knows how long to warp the transfer period...
