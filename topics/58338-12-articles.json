I have to admit, I wasn\u0027t originally planning on adding AGX compatibility with this version, but when Diazo reached out and offered to write all of the compatibility code himself, how could I say no? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Thanks again, Diazo!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if you\u0027re running AGX you\u0027ll notice that the SmartParts UI has been slightly altered to support it. Rather than having AG1-10 as an option on the action slider you\u0027ll simply have an \u0022Action\u0022 option available, which will display another slider that allows you to select the actual action group. If you don\u0027t use AGX, then nothing will change and SmartParts will continue to work as it has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, SmartParts should now check for updates directly from my GitHub account and let you know if there\u0027s a new update ready for download. If there is it will link you right to my Releases page. If you don\u0027t have KSP-AVC, it does include Mini-AVC which will require that you opt into the version checking on first run. Some of you may have noticed that the version numbering has actually regressed somewhat. Unfortunately, in order to get my versioning system to be compatible with AVC I had to make a few alterations. I apologize for the confusion that may cause, but things should be straightforward from here on out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, since dtobi\u0027s mods were split amongst many different mod authors, many of whom are now releasing updates on a regular basis for their mods, I\u0027ve removed the Klockheed Martian \u0022branding\u0022 from Smart Parts and changed the folder structure slightly. This was just to ensure that other mods wouldn\u0027t share the Smart Parts folder, which could cause serious compatibility issues down the line.

Your radio controller part would be marvelous if it could extend beyond the 2K radius, I suppose that\u0027s a game limitation? Failing that, is there any way I could program one of your parts to cut off the engine at a certain periapsis/apoapsis?

However, the payload that I drop still has to perform a burn to stabilise the orbit.

While it is a game limitation that prevents the radio from being used on unloaded vessels, you might still have a few options. The first one I\u0027d suggest looking at is this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292-0-90-0-Flight-Manager-for-Reusable-Stages-%28FMRS-v0-3-01%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlight Manager for Reusable Stages\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not actually used it myself, but in theory it will allow you to manually control all of the rocket stages. So you initially do your launch, dropping stages as expected along the way. However, once you get your payload into orbit you use that mod to go back to the stage separation points and manually control each dropped stage until you get it on the ground and then move on to the next stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory it\u0027s a great idea, and if it works in practice then that will allow you to do exactly what you\u0027re aiming for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the radio\u0027s ~2km limit, there actually is no range limit on the radio. So if you could get the game not to unload/pack vessels beyond 2km, you could theoretically use the radio to control vessels from a much longer range. I know TouhouTorpedo made a mod that massively pushed out the vessel unloading range to around ~500km, but unfortunately it\u0027s no longer developed or supported. Still, there may be other mods out there that do something similar that I simply don\u0027t know about.
