No need to lift off! Trust in The Skate. When it reaches the end of the runway it will take off on it\\\u0027s own and start to climb. By about 500m altitude it will be pointing straight upwards. At this point cut the engine power (X) and release the engine coupler (spacebar). Assuming the engine didn\\\u0027t just plough into your face, you now have control of the glider! Gear-up, roll it right-side-up and off you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EGliding / Gaining Altitude\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\\\u0027s a couple of techniques for climbing but the best seems to be maintaining a tight turn. Wait til you have over 60m/s ground speed, roll the plane so that it\\\u0027s wing-plane is almost vertical (ie you\\\u0027re rolled over about 80 degrees) and pull up. With a little practice you\\\u0027ll find a sweet spot where the planes nose is angled up and the plane climbs fast. You may find alternating between levelling-off to gain speed and tipping up into a turn works best if you can\\\u0027t find the sweet spot or don\\\u0027t have the starting speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the most part you will find you gain altitude just by flying around and you won\\\u0027t have to work that hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hardest part is landing! It has so much lift that it\\\u0027s near impossible not to overshoot the runway, so best to just use flat grass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGD-09A\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://whitevinyldesign.com/GD-09A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GD-09A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGD-09A-S (with \u0027The Skate\u0027 Launcher)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://whitevinyldesign.com/GD-09A-S.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GD-09A-S.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve attached the craft files both with and without the launcher. I\\\u0027m hoping people might try other launch methods, as The Skate is far from perfect. Dropped from a rocket might be cool. Also if anyone wants they can try and stabilize the front/back wobble (I call this \u0027The Washing Line\u0027). It doesn\\\u0027t affect flight much but looks ridiculous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- UPDATE --\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorked a bit more on an updated version of the plane and a more practical launcher:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGD-10A\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://whitevinyldesign.com/GD-10A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GD-10A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGD-10A-S (mounted on heavy launcher)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://whitevinyldesign.com/GD-10A-S.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GD-10A-S.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane handles much the same but a bit less bouncy, and landing is a little easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher is more bulky but more usable/controllable.
