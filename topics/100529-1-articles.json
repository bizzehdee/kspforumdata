When they are pitched up and down, they generate a force on the craft. Normally, this force would adjust the flight angle of a plane or rocket. However, when your craft is on the ground, the force does two things if applied properly: it pushes your craft into the ground (downforce) and it pushes your craft forwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownforce allows for faster acceleration (as your wheels are gripping the ground better) but it alone isn\u0027t capable of making your car go faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe forward force, however, propels your car to speeds that it otherwise could not reach.
