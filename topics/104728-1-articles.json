I get to the point of the game where I should be using SSTOs, and see everyone else using them to conserve fuel, space and money, but when I get to that point I try again and again, failing over and over, until I finally get frustrated and quit. This has happened in .21, .23, .24, .9 when it first came out, and even now, when I came back to the game to try to get my basics down pat before 1.0 ups the difficulty with reentry heat.\n\nWhat should I do? What CAN I do?

The community here can definitely help you out there. Could you start by posting some screenshots or a .craft of the best attempt you\u0027ve gotten so far?\n\nAlso, some general tips...\n\nAn SSTO plane that takes off horizontally (I\u0027m assuming this is what you mean by \u0022SSTO\u0022 as technically a rocket can be a SSTO also) can really benefit by starting off small. Take baby-steps and try to get to orbit with almost no payload at first, meaning, your goal is just to get a probe core or a pilot into orbit. Once you\u0027ve got that mastered, you can try to scale up, carry useful payloads, etc.\n\nSecondly, you\u0027d be surprised how easy it is to make an SSTO plane with just one rapier engine (and no other engines).\n\nThird, moar boosters air intake spam! Careful, though. Some stuffy players think it\u0027s \u0022cheating\u0022 if you use more than \u003Cinsert arbitrarily=\u0022\u0022 picked=\u0022\u0022 number=\u0022\u0022 here=\u0022\u0022\u003E air intakes per engine. So once you get a proof of concept, and if you give a crap what other people think (I don\u0027t), you can try to refine your design and take intakes off until it looks reasonable to you.\u003C/insert\u003E\n\nFourth, you need to milk the atmosphere as much as possible. You do this by keeping your vertical ascent rate minimal while you pick up speed. If you get too high up, the air gets super thin and your engine(s) will choke. You can counteract this by throttling down. The crazy thing is, because there\u0027s less drag as well, you can actually continue picking up speed while ascending with low throttle! I\u0027ve gone as low as 25% throttle while still gaining orbital energy.\n\nAt some point you\u0027ll have to bite the bullet, pitch up, and switch to rockets. If you\u0027re using a rapier engine, I highly recommend using the tweakables to set it to MANUAL mode. Auto-switch to closed cycle (meaning no longer using air intakes) will make you miss out on milking the atmosphere (see my last paragraph).\n\nAlright, now let\u0027s see what craft you\u0027ve got so far!"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T03:02:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wait for 1.0!!\n\u003E  All this will change.

I\u0027ll try turning my mechjeb to prevent burnouts, though. I didn\u0027t know there was an option to. Mechjeb is always the first thing I research, and I have an increased size research tree, so I feel it\u0027s fair. I spend 4000 science to get the best mechjeb, I deserve to be able to use it! Besides, I make sure to always learn how to control it by hand, first.\n\nAs you can see, my game is HEAVILY modded. I\u0027ve honestly forgotten which companies are stock and which aren\u0027t at this point. I do know however that that engine in the back of the first model is called the SABRE-M, which is a more powerful 2.5m version of the RAPIER. However, I switched from that because I realized that even with full fuel I only had 2200 deltaV, which would hardly be enough to get to Eve and back.\n\nI have thought about air intake spam, but I also am worried about weight, and also I don\u0027t know what the best ratio is. I have tried to figure it out but no one talks numbers.\n\nAs for everyone who says SSTOs aren\u0027t needed is this true? I haven\u0027t seen anyone really do anything WITHOUT SSTOs. All the pictures, all the videos, everything I have ever seen with showcases have shown off these awesome SSTO designs and spaceplane stuff.\n\nAs for the changes with 1.0, shouldn\u0027t I sit down and learn everything now when it\u0027s hard so that the learning new things will be easier?

They are basically reusable rockets in form of a plane which can go back, land, and refund you all the cost. As for getting stuff to the ground, you just use just the normal landers\u002Brockets and/or parachutes. You need atmospheres for SSTOs, and then parachutes are a million times more usefull. \n\nMost spaceplanes don\u0027t have the capacity to go to other planets, especially with cargo, and there isn\u0027t really a point. Transport-motherships and parachutes/landers are a million times better.\n\nThe only real point to get planes to other planets is to easier explore them. Which is fantastic, but a purpose in itself. And you can only use jet engines on laythe, which means these planes have a very limited range.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T03:42:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 03:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T03:41:28Z","Content":"I have been playing this game for 3 years, and have landed on all planets, and come back from most of them, built big stations, all that stuff.
