I just set the guard mode scan interval to 0.1 through .craft file edit. It is legal i think, since the only thing it does is make you dump all the missiles a\u0027la Macross style! ^^\n\n**Alphasus:**\n\nNot that much of an expert, but from what i already tried it turns out that short fuselage helps in stability. Won\u0027t matter during missile fights at long ranges though. Your alierons should also be spread as far out as you can on your plane and elevators should be placed on the extreme points of the craft (canards as far to the front as possible, elevators far out to the back. I\u0027ve made a little demonstrator that I\u0027ll add with my revised XMF too.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T09:44:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 09:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EvenFlow**"}]}
