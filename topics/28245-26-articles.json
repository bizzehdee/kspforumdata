The major thing to ensure is that if you have either of their mods already installed, don\u0027t overwrite their plugins with the ones in this pack. I think the ones I have are the most up to date, but theirs are sure to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I have it set up cuts the tanks down to 12 total instead of the 150\u002B in the plugin-less pack. I may split the EL resource ones off so that they have separate tanks that show up in the utilities tab though. Currently all the different resources are all in the same tanks on the propulsion tab.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Talisar","CreatedById":62035,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T20:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sojourner\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sojourner\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooks pretty cool, but I\u0027d still include the raised cockpit bit.
