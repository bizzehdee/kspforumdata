The mass was easy with the mass of a Cessna 206 with 65 gallon tanks and full fuel, assuming a 70 kg pilot, being 1,234 kg. Now, in actuality, a combustion powered plane could not run on Mars, so we will assume that the engine is replaced by an electric motor of the same weight and the fuel tanks are replaced with batteries of the same weight, however unrealistic that may be. After looking at a couple of websites, we eventually found the wing area, which is 16.3 m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E.\u00A0The hardest variable to find was actually the Coefficient of lift, which we actually had to solve for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo find the coefficient of lift we solved the stall speed equation on Earth, with all of the variables plugged in.

What they mean is a level-flight stall speed. A stall occurs when your angle attack exceeds the maximum allowed and maintain bernolli\u0027s lift, this is about 15 degrees above the direction of motion. This can occur at any speed even Mach Speed (especially at higher altitudes).\u00A0 This means that for an airplane lift continues to increase to about 12\u0027 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E and then life flattens out and then suddenly falls.

to\u00A0 maintain level flight (and the more drag you produce) however once you reach a speed in which \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E is about 12 you should not further lower speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can do some fun things with stalls though, on flight simulator I pulled a 777 into a stall about 15 miles from runway at 45,000 feet (rather easy to do at that altitude because you are in coffins corner) and began tossing out flaps spoilers and gear, then dove the nose down to take advantage of the drag that the stall created holding the nose ever so slightly above the stall angle of attack, when you get close to the glide slope you remove the spoilers and roll the nose down below the horizon and add landing thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course if it was real life the 777 would have flipped over, because there is not enough laminar air flow over the flight control surfaces to maintain stable

It only needs 0.376x as much lift thanks to Mars\u0027 lower gravity... so, lets normalize this to the surface gravities: At the same speed, the cesna on mars will generate only 0.0621 x as much lift relative to the surface gravity as on Earth.

IIRC the oxidizer to fuel ratio for Kerosene (which is essentially what the SR-71 used), is something like 2.6 or 2.7 to 1 - quite a bit different from the 1.22:1 ratio that we have in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...fuel consumption would increase by something like 3.6x (2.6 tons of oxidizer per 1 ton of fuel, 3.6 tons total per 1 ton of the old engine). IIRC, the SR-71\u0027s engines actually only got about 2080\u00A0Isp. So 2080/3.6 ... I would expect trying to run the engines by just injecting oxidizer in with the fuel would get you about 570\u00A0Isp... which isn\u0027t great, but its better than a normal Hydrolox rocket. The J58 of the SR-71 was an engine of compromises though, since its a turbojet that at high speeds has a bypass/bleed system that makes it sort of a partial ramjet. I\u0027m sure a dedicated ramrocket would get better than 570 Isp... solid fuel ramrockets have already demonstrated 500\u002B Isp here on Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027d be no significant thrust augmentation until higher mach numbers (around mach 0.5 I seem to recall reading), so it would have to launch as just a normal Kerlox rocket getting Isps in the high 200\u0027s/low 300\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMar\u0027s orbital velocity is relatively low...

Supposedly the aircraft leaked a lot when it was on the ground. Apparently the leaks didn\u0027t stop until it got up to speed and things heated up and expanded.
