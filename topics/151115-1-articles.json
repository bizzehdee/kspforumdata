The thing is it doesn\u0027t work that way, first when I use \u0022D\u0022 the rocket almost doesn\u0027t react, when I start pressing it continuously at ~5kms all I get at 10 kms is about 6-8 degrees and never heading East, always North. I have to play with roll and pitch in order to get more or less right heading, but fighting with it I either overshoot the orbit (apiapsis ~100kms) or undershoot it (once it was at ~40 kms). What is most mysterious is why the rocket doesn\u0027t react to controls.
