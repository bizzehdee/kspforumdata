None of my .craft files (only stock craft) exist in the file system, and no .sfs files exist either.\n\nI was far more comfortable testing things in sandbox and moving/sharing crafts so this contains exceedingly sad panda\n\nNew saves are hidden somewhere, but they aren\u0027t hidden files. I can\u0027t find mention of this concern on the forum here.\n\nAs an experiment, I moved a \u003Csavename\u003E from KSP x86 .90.0.37 into the expected \u0027\u003Cksp_root\u003E/saves\u0027 folder of 1.0.2\u003C/ksp_root\u003E\u003C/savename\u003E\n\nThat save now shows up in-game under the \u0027resume game\u0027 options, and it loads/saves mostly normally (it\u0027s mildly modded and kraken-eaten)\n\nI downloaded a .zip of the windows x86 1.0.2 install, and the hidden save behavior remains. All my new saves work but are hidden.\n\nAre new saves stored in a database file instead of the file system now? Where are they hiding? Is my system alone in this behavior?\n\nThe workaround I have of creating the folder manually from an old install is my only way to 3D print or share my crafts now. Blerg.\n\nApologies for the grumblecakes.\n\nPlease help\n\n-|\\/|/\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOh, PS: I thought about posting this in support, but I found the tutorials on exporting .craft files here.\n\nThis seems like a feature rather than a bug introduced when going to release, but I\u0027ll be happy to move to support.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T23:15:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 11:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Amishacker**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:40:58Z","Content":"Wellllll that\u0027s weird Oo do you still have your savefiles etc when launching directly from the KSP\\_win directory?\n\nIf not maybe you are looking at a clean install?
