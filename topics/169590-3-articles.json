In fact the whole discussion here is rather oxymoronic in the abstract. The point is functionality, either you are improving or you are not you cant call the shuttle an improvement vampire. That improvement can come in two ways\u00A0 you are either increasing performance or lowering cost. The problem is the STS spawns do neither. . . .so who the hell is going to buy into these systems . . . . and so we have a bunch of companies now saying . . . I can do that (true) . . .and do more of that (maybe) . . . . and I/we will have more customers (likely).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you tell me . . . . .I can get 60 kT into LEO\u00A0 bbbbuuuuttttttt\u00A0\u00A0 its going to cost you 2 billion dollars only US pork can pay for that and thats it, that is a closed market.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you tell me . . . .\u00A0 I can get 60 kT into LEO but its going to cost you 300 million, then that market expands, but then your competitor comes back and says\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0. . . .\u00A0 .. . . . . . . . . . .I can get 60 kT into LEO for the same price that ^he^ can do for 22 kT . . . .\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd then you have a market and\u003Cu\u003E people \u003C/u\u003Ecan start doing things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second oxymoronic statements surround the faux debate. First that the shuttle was old and it was great back then, but became\u00A0 a space Vampire sucking the blood out of everything, and the reason we are so far behind now because while the shuttle was building the ISS it was sucking the blood out of space (other than it extended the life of hubble by 15-20 years the most productive scientific experiment in the history of science, but that has very little value to the wanted ignorant). Space doesn\u0027t have blood and shuttle has no control of ESA and RSA or Japanese space agency. Their economies together are double the size of US, so why aren\u0027t they offering cheap or modernesque alternatives. OK so SpaceX comes in and revolutionizes the economy, but SpaceX success was also not crushed by shuttle, SX has been in development for many years and had many problems to overcome while the shuttle was still flying and after it stopped flying. SpaceX proves the point, these agencies have rampant inefficiencies in their procurement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndependent of the Shuttle, SX was showing the dis-economies in both Shuttle industries and post-shuttle industries. The fact that these persisted despite the fact the shuttle was gone is notable. So part of it was not that shuttles were inefficient, but that NASA and US Govt does a poor job managing contractors and cost overruns. This has always been true in the defense industry, and Harry Truman probably would have never been president had he not repeatedly pointed this out. So that part \u003Cem\u003Ein and of itself\u003C/em\u003E is a Space vampire. Likewise this is going on in Europe and I\u0027m sure Japan. RSA simply lacks resources but we can see corruption there in the innovation. One can look at it a different way, given the rapidly falling budget and the inefficient procurement system we were damn lucky to get 132 shuttle missions to space and back again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third sort of oxymoronic comes out of the second and the fact the budget from NASA/gdp had been almost half of that 15 years previous, the budget was falling, and this was the biggest black eye because they are looking at the contractors and wondering why NASA couldn\u0027t negotiate contracts better when it was the US Gov\u0027t that built the inefficient military procurement system. OK so the big red-tanked\u00A0 vampire was sucking the blood out of NASA R\u0026amp;D budget. While there is a grain of truth, if the administration was asking the proper question it would be \u0027while understanding the need for a shuttle to complete ISS, how are we going to revolutionize and improve PL and naut to Orbit functionality while retaining the best part. There is nothing about Shuttle being a Space Vampire that would have stopped any administration from insisting on progress reports toward this (at the time of the addition of the unity module) that NASA extend itself into the study of functional replacements. In sports this is called an unforced error. That\u0027s what is is, the guidance of NASA did not do its job. . . . that\u0027s why we don\u0027t have a crew carrier, that\u0027s why we can\u0027t fix the Hubble. . . .no evil shuttle Vampires needed to explain this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe keep acting here like the structure of the Shuttle and its function are tied at the hip, they are not, shuttle should have evolved and could have been significantly replaced, the fact that it wasn\u0027t done appropriately was an error, plain and simple. While the shuttle was overpriced, IMHO, it was better to have it than replacements lacking in performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-15T16:53:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2018 04:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-15T17:34:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223268394\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516020231\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is an artificial argument, why the first two minutes.

I will address all of your comments in a second but I will address this specifically. The reason Air-travel is the safest per mile is a whole lot of things have to be correct before it takes off. You don\u0027t think of it now, but in the mid-1970s no one thought about vertical windsheer, in the mid to late 70s there were a few incidences where planes taking off and then engine loses power and it drops from the sky, nothing really wrong with the craft but people on the ground reported something about the air. Its was researched and found the aircraft was experiencing windsheer because the airport was close to a cell at the time the plane takes off. So they add windsheer detectors at the airport. There are other things, a plane flying across South America disappears, another pilot says geeze its interesting that I was 60 miles off course, and so high altitude winds become part of the weather estimates. This type of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the shuttle or any spacecraft is no different, Apollo 13 was hit by cloud lightning, the shuttles seal failed because of excessive cold. And so by flying we learned more parameters that constitute good flight. And these things are context specific, bad weather for a blimp is not the same as bad weather for a Concorde or the same as bad weather for the shuttle. That is not disingenuine, its just the way humans learn.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMany of the major pioneers of flight died while flying, dare to use the word hero, but of course if you are flying today your safety comes from lessons they taught us in their activities. This is what is, this is what happened. Of the 144\u00A0 flights of the shuttle their was one upper atmospheric failure, so it was not common, the flaw was researched and it was found to be a judgement error, not specifically a vehicle malfunction. There is no rationalization of judgement errors, depending on how severe the error any system can be compromised . . . . from confusion about the trustability of pitot-tubes on AF447 to the downing of the commercial plane to the disappearance of MH370. The STS-51-L vehicle did perform as rated or more correctly it failed when performing outside of its predetermined rating. This is physics plain and simple. So engineer looked at the thermal expansion of a rubber ring in manifold and determined that if the temperature fell below X, its position may not be fixed and it may move, and during the flight this happened and there was a highly predictable accident. It was not clear that the orbiter would suffer catastrophic damage but it did and people died, it was not the orbiters fault, the boosters fault per-say or the engineers fault since its limitation was known. But in these accidents we still learn things that result in improvements, we ask questions about safety margins, etc. . . . . we learn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not questioning the concept you present I am wholy questioning your focus.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe point is that the shuttle launched, other than the ISS living portions about a dozen science missions, including one it left in space and then retrieved to study the damage of space on a number of materials (the so called materials science test in KSP).\u00A0 OK, so we have to conceptualize what we are doing in a valid context, borrowing from above we ask the question what was the Wright brothers doing, it was certainly dangerous, but what was it. They are testing the engineering model as free standing aerodynamic system. The system is very crude, but we know very little about the dynamic, so that is OK, it is because they began the first serious model then today we have very safe models and we know magnitudes more about aerodynamics than they did. But that is what had to happen\u00A0 for us to have flight safety. Hubble was a model space telescope, it was found to\u00A0 be incorrect, the shuttle allowed us to test a repair, it worked, and more modifications were made and now Hubble is a historical science platform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the focus, so you know how to better use space you have to learn about space just like the writght borthers learned about aerodynamics\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n11.

So why Wright brothers take risk and why be benefit, to learn how for humans to fly. And why shuttle takes risk to learn how to do space in a different way an learn. If you can\u0027t understand that some risks are worth taking and some are not we have nothing to talk about. But I would say the Wright brothers would disagree with you, so would Galileo, so would Neil Armstrong, so would most of the astronauts. And that\u0027s the point, its their risk to take, not yours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-16T01:01:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223268903\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516064121\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can\u0027t understand that some risks are worth taking and some are not we have nothing to talk about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll due respect, but I believe you are the one who is struggling with this concept.
