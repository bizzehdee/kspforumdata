By clicking, the infopanel for the last completed contract opens up. After dismissing the contract again the green check dissapeared and everything seems to run fine again.\n\nI noticed it the first time after leaving the administration building.\n\n![FQaAOWO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FQaAOWO.jpg)"}]}
