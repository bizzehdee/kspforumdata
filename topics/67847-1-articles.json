Once you do that it will bring up your prograde/retrograde markers again. The pink marker indicating the asteroid\u0027s center of mass should stay on there I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurning your engine(s) while attached to an asteroid as large as a class C will be difficult. You\u0027ll want to manually line your craft up with the asteroid\u0027s center of mass as closely as you can using the pink marker on your nav ball and get that sucker locked down once you get it. The closer you get it to center, the more thrust you\u0027ll be able to apply with your main engine(s). Then keep your SAS engaged to allow the spacecraft to resist rotation. Even still though, even moderate amounts of thrust can overcome your SAS\u0027s abilities to resist rotation, so you have to play with the amount of thrust you use when doing your burns. Too much, and you will start to rotate again. Increase thrust gradually and watch that pink marker on your nav ball. The farther that pink marker gets from center, the more torque there is on the asteroid and the closer you are to spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a visual for you to consider. Think of three points: the asteroid\u0027s center of mass, the rocket\u0027s center of thrust, and the point between them where the AGU (the claw) is actually grabbed onto the asteroid. Draw a line from the asteroid\u0027s center of mass to the AGU claw. Then draw another line from the AGU claw to the rocket\u0027s center of thrust. Ideally, if the angle between those two lines (we\u0027ll call it the \u0022attachment angle\u0022) is exactly 180 degrees (i.e. the two lines make one straight line) then you can apply all the thrust you want and no torque will be invovled. If the attachment angle is not exactly 180 degrees, then you get torque. The farther you are from 180 degrees, the more torque you get. That attachment angle is what is represented on your nav ball by the pink marker. Having the pink marker perfectly centered on your nav ball represents an attachment angle of 180 degrees. If you see it drift from center, you\u0027ll know your angle not perfect. The more it drifts from center, the farther your attachment angle is from 180 degrees (and the harder your SAS is having to work to pull it back). When you\u0027re doing your burn, keep any eye on it and get a feel for how far you can let it drift from center and still maintain control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want more control I would recommend adding more reaction wheels and/or RCS thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tordan69","CreatedById":98506,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T07:45:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKgries, just want to check if the images I see in my head works.

The key was to take all those RCS thrusters off of the tanks and put them out on those girders instead, farther away from the CoM. This way they have the most amount of possible torque on the asteroid (torque = perpendicular force * distance from CoM). With the claw attached and locked, I used the RCS thrusters to slowly turn the asteroid to get my engines facing the correct direction for the burn. Then I set the claw to free pivot, made sure RCS and SAS were both activated, and burned away. I could burn at full thrust for however long I needed with no problems. The asteroid just followed along behind like a giant trailer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter multiple asteroid captures, I can say that pulling is FAR better than pushing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T00:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kgries3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kgries3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/598159759983703705/3F4EB54ACB1801836B0FFCF7ED2E0ADF9D8694E0/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/598159759983703705/3F4EB54ACB1801836B0FFCF7ED2E0ADF9D8694E0/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe angled engines are unnecessary, and you are just wasting a ton of fuel because of it.
