So, I ve been thinking about how high a plane can climb given an initial airspeed and a minimum airspeed. I first thought it was a simple matter of potential\u002Bkinetic energy remaining equal throughout the flight, but then I brain farted and now I dont really know what to think.\n\nIf the only forces acting on the aircraft were gravity and drag, then the final mechanical energy would be always less than the initial, but that is never true because we also have lift. When you add lift into the equations, the rate at which you lose energy diminishes considerably, if you are ascending at a constant rate that is. This is because the vertical lift force cancels the weight of the aircraft, and the resulting energy losses are only due to drag and the horizontal lift force component. \n\nExample: a plane is going at 200m/s, it performs a climb until it reaches 180m/s at a constant ascent rate of 5m/s. Without lift or drag the maximum height the plane coud reach would be 20m (1/2\\*20^2=g\\*h). Assuming that the angle with respect to the surface of the earth is small then the horizontal lift force component is negligible. In order for the final energy to be less than the initial energy, the acceleration due to drag has to be more than 5 m/s^2. But what if it isnt? \n\nLets say instead of it being 5m/s^2 its 4m/s^2, then, the plane will take 5 seconds to lose the 20m/s we were willing to convert into height. And as we said before, the climb rate remained constant at 5m/s, which means that the height will increase by of 25m. The thing is that, if it increased to 25 m then the system has more mechanical energy than at the start of the climb. So, what am i missing here? I have seriously got no idea where the extra energy comes from and wether its actually available for use.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading so far! Please reply and tell me what you think!"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T04:32:25Z","Content":"If you have no lift or drag, then it\u0027s pure ballistic motion, and with a 5 m/s upward velocity, you\u0027ll reach an apex of about 1.27 m at about 0.5 s.\n\nIf you want a constant upward velocity you either need to be adding energy with an engine or you need to be converting your forward velocity into lift (and changing the rate at which you do so).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T04:35:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 04:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pincushionman**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T05:27:55Z","Content":"Something else to consider is that a powered aircraft is not a constant-mass system.

Of course, it\u0027d never be able to reach that height, as drag would steal energy on the way, and it\u0027d have to follow a ballistic ascent, meaning non-linear vertical speed, but that\u0027s the maximum possible without engines adding in energy. If you\u0027re considering engines, then the arguments about energy exchange go out the window since you\u0027re able to constantly add more. As for your calculations with the vertical acceleration, they\u0027re even more wrong, as you\u0027re starting with a plane that is travelling 200 m/s horizontally (or mostly horizontally), but then trying to determine accelerations from its vertical motion, which is unknown without quite a few further calculations.\n\nAddendum: it\u0027s also kind-of a wrong question. If you\u0027d started with the correct values, then you might\u0027ve come up with a particular minimum deceleration the aircraft experiences. You then ask what happens if it accelerates less than that, and surprise, the numbers that come out say the aircraft has managed to gain energy - well, of course! That\u0027s why that\u0027s the minimum deceleration, because a lower deceleration breaks physics, and is therefore impossible. It\u0027d be like if I gave you a baseball and asked you to, using only your own arm and no extensions, throw it a kilometre up - there simply isn\u0027t the energy available in human muscles to come close to that. You can calculate what it\u0027d require - 1.46 kJ of energy and a starting velocity of 198.1 m/s - but that doesn\u0027t mean the system we\u0027re considering contains the capability to achieve that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T15:26:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 03:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Iskierka**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T15:45:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It depends on the power source.
