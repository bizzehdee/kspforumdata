It would be nice to be able to connect not only one part to another, but one part to many parts. For example, if I place 4 beams parallel to each other, I can\u0027t then place structural panel on top of them, I can only connect panel\u0027s center to one of the beams. In some cases it is possible to make something close enough to original idea using struts, but some constructions are impossible even this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope there wasn\u0027t ton of suggestions like that. Well, that\u0027s a minor issue anyway, the game is awesome and it\u0027s still possible to build almost anything if you have enough struts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T16:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would surely be a popular thing, but the whole way the current system is set-up goes against it. There is a strict parent-child relationship of parts; a part can have multiple children, but not multiple parents. As a result, it\u0027s not possible to make loops, or to connect a part to the common center of several different parts.

Btw, if I am not mistaken, there\u0027s one more thing you can\u0027t do in the editor: you can\u0027t connect tank to other part (other tank, maybe) if the center of the tank is lower then the end of the part.
