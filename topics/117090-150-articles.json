I\u0027m running into, is in regards to allowing resizing of crewed parts.  I simply don\u0027t think it is reasonable, or prudent, to allow such manipulation of the parts.  First the parts would end up with hatches/windows/internal areas that are either too large, or too small, for kerbals to use efficiently (or even fit inside of).  Second.. the ever-present problem of crew capacity and IVA layouts;  the stock system only supports a single IVA and a specific crew capacity for a specific part.\n\nThis means that most crewed station parts will be non-modular in nature, at least the crewed/IVA\u0027d portion of it (though could include adapters and optional resource-containing bits/models).  It also means that most crewed parts will only come in a single size/diameter and will not support scaling.\n\nAlso as far as station parts go I intend on relying heavily on the Near-Future construction trusses for most of the \u0027structural\u0027 bits.\n\nA few questions whos answers will help me lay out/plan the rest of the station parts; please keep in mind this is all for -orbital- stations, ground-based bases may have a bit more variety in their parts/sizes.  \n\n1.)  What diameter should the crewed parts come in?  I\u0027m leaning towards a 2.5m diam for most of them, as this enables them to be launched from stock-sized rockets and/or in shuttle cargo bays.  It also lines up with most other mods\u0027 station parts.  It is also the stock size of the NF-Octo trusses and maintains compatibility with those without any need for enabling resizing on them (which I may or may not do... still thinking things over).  \n\n2.)  What specific parts would you all like to see made?  Please see the initial concept list below to see if your desired part is already on it, otherwise please post a reply with the info regarding your part.  \n\n3.)  Modularity / configurability of station parts.  How complex should some of the parts be made, what options should they have, and why?  Please keep in mind that MODULES cannot be swapped (yet), so there cannot be any functional difference between the parts, only models/geometry/textures/resources.  For example, a part with a docking port must -always- have a docking port.  A part with an antenna must -always- have an antenna.  The specific models used and their positioning may be altered a bit, but the functionality must remain unchanged.  Yes I know this greatly reduces the actual use of \u0027modularity\u0027 as far as station parts are concerned, but this is a limitation of the base KSP code and not anything that I can solve or work around easily or cleanly.\n\n(below is taken directly from the wiki: [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/wiki/Parts-\u2010-StationCore](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/wiki/Parts-%E2%80%90-StationCore) )\n\n## \nParts Concepts\n\n- **Welding docking Port** - when two welding docking ports are \u0027docked\u0027 together and the \u0027weld\u0027 button is pressed, they will remove themselves from the vessel. These are intended to cut-down on the number of docking ports needed just to build any multi-part station, to reduce wobbles from excess docking port joints, and cut down on the part-count of a finished station (you just won\u0027t be able to undock/decouple modules from the finished article).\n- **Multi-axis Solar Panel Truss Segment** - large truss with 2 or 4 solar panels, whole truss rotates for second axis of sun-tracking, e.g. the ISS solar panel trusses. May have deployable radiators on the non-solar-panel equipped sides? Will likely only be available in a single size (2.5m), and will be based on the NF-OctoTruss form factor for compatibility.\n- **Inflatable Hab** - See Bigelow Aerospace / Boeing inflatable modules. Possibly 2-3 different lengths with varying crew capacity and/or integrated labs or storage.\n- **Inflatable Torus** - Basic habitation ring, or storage?, e.g. UKS Hab Ring. Is this even needed given the UKS one exists?\n- **Multi-docking-port-truss segment** - pre-built truss segment(s) equipped with multiple docking ports. Basically a docking \u0027hub\u0027 that can be added to existing stations. May have some modularity to it for swapping the length of the truss arm it is attached to.\n- **Rigid Torus** - Storage part. Intended to be constructed in-orbit through EPL as it will be non-deployable and far too large to launch on a standard rocket. Modular in so much that you can resize and select various model part diameters.\n- **Orbital Shipyard** - Deployable EPL shipyard part. 2.5m stowed form-factor, expands to 5m\u002B \u0027construction\u0027 area. Will likely be very similar to the UKS shipyard part... but easier to launch due to smaller diameter. Mass will likely be very similar; the thing should be heavy... but nobody needs 3.75m payloads. Ideally would be able to have a \u0027small\u0027, \u0027medium\u0027, and \u0027large\u0027 shipyard part with each having a maximum size (mass) of craft it can construct.\n- **Station Command** - Stylized command part that includes small crew capacity (1-2), unmanned control, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and reaction wheels.\n\nI tend to think that between UKS and Near-Future that most of the resource-processing, life-support, and reactor type parts are already available in sufficient variety.  Really have no desire to replace their functionality, and would rather work towards better integration with those mods to use their models and features as much as possible.  Mostly what seems to be missing for stations are construction aids and a few part-count reduction type parts (solar truss, multi-docking port part, welding docking port).\n\nAny other types of parts that are severely lacking in availability, or any other part-reduction type parts that could be made?  Pictures/examples for any suggestions would be extremely helpful.  In the end the goal is to enable nice and coherent looking fully functional stations, with a lower part count (and CPU overhead) than could be accomplished with stock or other mods\u0027 parts alone."},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T18:04:46Z","Content":"cant you just have no IVA for the crewed parts? and with scaling them, scales the crew limit, too? if its possible?"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T18:06:24Z","Content":"Hmm ... how would the welding ports \u0022removing\u0022 themselves work?

If you don\u0027t move the attached parts, you\u0027re left with a gap.  If you do try to move them, you will likely encounter issues with KJR.\n\u003E \n\nTheir attach nodes sit flush with the attach nodes of the parts they are attached to when in the \u0027retracted/active\u0027 state; they present an external \u0027ring\u0027 around the top of the parent part so that the user can interact with them when they are docked and retracted.  They will be resizable to be compatible with various diameter parts.  They have a \u0027docking animation\u0027 that pulls them from an extended state into the retracted and flush state.  When extended the magnetics are active (but not yet docked) so that the player can rotate them precisely.  Once the \u0027retract\u0027 button is pressed the animation begins retracting the extension bits, and the parent parts for each docking port end up sitting flush against eachother.  When the \u0027weld\u0027 button is pressed the two welding docking ports do the stock part.decouple() actions for themselves and part.couple() action for the parent parts.\n\nBasically I cheat and eliminate the gap by using docking ports that have no depth when they are \u0027retracted\u0027 (armed/docked), and thus there is no gap after they are welded and removed from the vessel.  The docking port magnetics close the gap as the animation is played.\n\nThe code for them is already written, prototyped, and tested to work (even with KJR as far as I know).  I just haven\u0027t had time or motivation/will to sit down and finish up proper models (damn wheels...taking all my time, and slowly eroding my motivation).

Indeed, PJ does have a nice selection of inflatable parts, and well done models/textures at that.  However, from looking at them, they seem to be 1.25m for some reason (or at least have 1.25m connection points)?  There are whispers about him re-doing/modernizing the pack/models, but I have not found any previews or information on it.  That leaves me still needing some 2.5m inflatables.  \n\n2.) Base parts will be coming (much) later.  Some of the parts may be compatible for either purpose, but mostly the base parts will have a different layout and feel to them (different aesthetics).  Yes, they will come in a much wider range of sizes.  \n\n3.)  Modularity - yep.  Nothing would prevent the crewed parts from sharing the same nose/mount system that the tanks do (top and bottom adapters).  So you could certainly add a \u0027life support\u0027 segment onto your crewed part, or various shaped/sized/modeled adapter segments.  However they will be limited to altering resources only;  there is no possibility to add a docking port, science lab, antenna, or any other functionality that relies on PartModules (MODULE\u0027s in the part.cfg files).  Although I am/will be investigating dynamic module swapping, I still don\u0027t think it will work out and so am intentionally planning the parts around not having it.  If I do happen to get it working.. well.. that can open up all sorts of new module combinations, and would be easy enough to add onto the existing planned parts.  One thing that I might be able to get working would be optional external lights on some of the parts, but it would be a bit hacky unless I can get the dynamic module swapping figured out.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What about a rigid deployable centrifuge that are not a torus?
