Where do I get the direct approach values from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I am trying to avoid making the game too complicated so I want to assert delta-v-stats to tanks and engines. But how do I measure the overall delta-v versatility of an engine? I tryed Isp*T/W but that gives high value for radial rockomax and low value for the LV-N, which does not seem right. Any ideas for that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"llamatoes","CreatedById":57750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T20:36:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should have done delta v from 100km orbit, as I am pretty sure it\u0027s not less for Moho than laythe\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T20:39:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDirect-approach is practically impossible to calculate for a moon, especially since all moons orbit atmospheric bodies with aerobraking options.
