I replicated his ship and managed to complete the same journey: land on minmus and return home on the first mission. So I was curious to know just **how far can you get using the basic parts provided at the start of career/science mode?** Has anybody tried to get to Duna and back on the first launch?\nI\u0027ve gotten to Duna using basic parts **plus radial and stack decouplers** (no fuel lines, no struts, no big rockets), which i unlocked doing a quick crew and eva report from the launchpad and runways, so technically it was not my first launch.\n\nI don\u0027t have the know-how to do it without those decouplers. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s possible though.\n\nAny of you rocket scientists wanna give a whack at this?\n\nMy friend and I like to do Science mode Duna races (first to plant a flag and return wins), and I want to make him feel really bad about himself...because that\u0027s what friends are for! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-03T00:45:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2015 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hobbez**"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T01:14:57Z","Content":"[well, it\u0027s possible to unlock the entire tech tree in science mode in a single launch](https://youtu.be/HcWwWAJt4dM).
