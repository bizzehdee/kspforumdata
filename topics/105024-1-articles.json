I know that I couldn\u0027t live without many of the mods that some of the mod makers have been working on and supporting for years. And so I\u0027ve made an open letter asking us all to remember developers this Release Season and to perhaps join me in finding one or two with a donate button and chucking $5 their way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a YouTube content creator I\u0027m even more conscious of the fact that I actually make (very tiny) amounts of money off the efforts of mod makers. Sure, making videos takes effort, but it doesn\u0027t take weeks like 90% of the mods do, and so I feel a touch guilty that I\u0027m earning a couple of bucks off the work of these guys and girls. That\u0027s why I\u0027m also pledging to donate a chunk of my channel profits from Kerbal mods videos to mod makers at each channel anniversary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see some people add #donationcountdown to their excitement over #kerbalcountdown.

I can also understand, how some might feel that they deserve some sort of compensation for their effort, after all.. why should someone benefit from the labors of their work for free? I do not necessarily agree, but I can understand.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is an example of the other side of the coin. Ignoring Valve and the complete mess they\u0027ve made of this, it\u0027s still exposing the fact that a huge portion of mod users feel that compensation for (often highly skilled and hard working) unofficial content creators is somehow taboo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nightingale\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nightingale\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat I find amazing is when I see the attitude that most people can pay $20 for KSP, play it for hundreds or thousands of hours and then cry foul when asked to pay $5 for additional content (whether that be DLC or mods).\u003Cp\u003EAnd then many of us (myself included) won\u0027t bat an eye at paying $5 for a latte....

I plan on having all of the plugins I develop (or in the case of B9 PWings, maintain) made KSP 1.0 compatible on day 1.
