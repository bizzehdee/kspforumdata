The science tree completely disappeared after I (finally) managed to dock a space station in orbit around the Mun, see screenshot below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=708663RDlabbug.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img15.hostingpics.net/thumbs/mini_708663RDlabbug.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mini_708663RDlabbug.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI began this career mode on my computer but as I was travelling a bit, I copied / pasted the save file (.sfs) on my laptop to continue. I managed to make this space station and after doing some science, I wanted to spend it on new tech. And there the science tree didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had mods on my KSP install (Chatterer and Kerbal Engineer), so I uninstalled them to see if the problem came from here but still no science tree. Everything else seems to be working just fine, just no science tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to start a new career on my laptop and the science tree was available, with or without mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my guess is my save file is corrupted in some way. Did anyone come across this bug before? Is there any way to restore the save file to make this tree appear again?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy specs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast version of KSP v1.0.4.861\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 7 on my PC, 8.1 on my laptop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying on steam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf nothing work, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll just have to wait to get back home to play on my original save file but this is annoying so any workaround is welcome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOz\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T21:21:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 09:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Oz89\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Oz89, please search your persistent.sfs for \u0022TechTreeUrl\u0022, it should point to \u0022GameData/Squad/Resources/TechTree.cfg\u0022, but may be pointing to a module manager file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that line is correct please upload your KSP output_log and save file to dropbox for us \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oz89","CreatedById":147969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T21:20:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi sal_vager\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much, that was the problem !
