The science tree completely disappeared after I (finally) managed to dock a space station in orbit around the Mun, see screenshot below:\n\n[![mini_708663RDlabbug.jpg](http://img15.hostingpics.net/thumbs/mini_708663RDlabbug.jpg)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=708663RDlabbug.jpg)\n\nI began this career mode on my computer but as I was travelling a bit, I copied / pasted the save file (.sfs) on my laptop to continue. I managed to make this space station and after doing some science, I wanted to spend it on new tech. And there the science tree didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t appear.\n\nI had mods on my KSP install (Chatterer and Kerbal Engineer), so I uninstalled them to see if the problem came from here but still no science tree. Everything else seems to be working just fine, just no science tree.\n\nI tried to start a new career on my laptop and the science tree was available, with or without mods.\n\nSo my guess is my save file is corrupted in some way. Did anyone come across this bug before? Is there any way to restore the save file to make this tree appear again?\n\nMy specs:\n\nLast version of KSP v1.0.4.861\n\nWindows 7 on my PC, 8.1 on my laptop\n\nPlaying on steam\n\nIf nothing work, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll just have to wait to get back home to play on my original save file but this is annoying so any workaround is welcome ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nThanks !\n\nOz\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T21:21:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 09:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Oz89**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:47:23Z","Content":"Hi Oz89, please search your persistent.sfs for \u0022TechTreeUrl\u0022, it should point to \u0022GameData/Squad/Resources/TechTree.cfg\u0022, but may be pointing to a module manager file.\n\nIf that line is correct please upload your KSP output\\_log and save file to dropbox for us ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Oz89","CreatedById":147969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T21:20:49Z","Content":"Hi sal\\_vager\n\nThank you very much, that was the problem ! I changed the line and now it works.\n\nTHe TechTreeUrl was refering to \u0022GameData\\ModuleManager.TechTree\u0022 for some reason.. I guess it\u0027s due to ModuleManager mod but since it was not installed for a while now I don\u0027t fully understand.\n\nAnyway, I will edit the topic to solved, thanks again."}]}
