IMO you just have to beat the drag using pointier fairings and less stacks and more aerodynamic end cap attachments and \u003Cu\u003Enever use Mk2.\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand if your playing career then Panthers early on can really pack a punch.

If your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is very streamlined it can reach orbital velocity ~22/2300m/s at 25-30km altitude without losing much speed when coasting to apoapsis.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI make these kind of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s primarily to get crew to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E for the least in game and real life time expenditure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general the combinations of engines on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s can be very broad oriented.
