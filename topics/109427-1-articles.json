For years after, the Joey Chitwood Thrill Show used AMC Javelins to do the jump.\nIn 2011 Chevrolet did it with a Sonic, calling the jump a kickflip. [https://youtu.be/esSRxB_xYCg?t=62](https://youtu.be/esSRxB_xYCg?t=62) Note the lousy, nearly sideways, landing due to the back end dropping as the car left the ramp. The designers of the stunt either didn\u0027t study the original or figured they could do it better.\n\nThe original had a way to ensure the car\u0027s roll axis would parallel the trajectory so that when the speed and launch were right it would set down smoothly on the other ramp. A couple of clips in the first video show over-rotation and/or jumping too far.\n\nThose all do just one rotation. Try for two or more. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T05:22:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 05:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Galane**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T01:00:32Z","Content":"Jumping, you say?

The test car was built like a dune buggy and they had ramps setup the exact distance apart as across the canyon. Zip, zip zip! The driver made several test jumps and made it look easy.\n\nThen they proceeded to screw it up by the numbers. The car for the canyon jump had the same chassis but a swoopy fiberglass body with a downturned nose. So they stuck a plastic airdam \\*on top\\* of the nose and expected it to counteract the downforce of the sloping nose. They also filled the body with foam so it\u0027d float if it landed in the river and the driver planned to slide up and sit on the back to alter the balance. (And how was he supposed to get back into the seat and belted in, in time for the landing?)\n\nNaturally as soon as it cleared the takeoff ramp it nosed over, the driver bailed out and it was a massive failure on live nationwide TV. They had a car they absolutely knew could jump the distance and stay stable, so WTH did they get stupid and try a car they hadn\u0027t put in a wind tunnel nor even tried out on the test jump?\n\nThis was on TV, very much pre-WWW.
