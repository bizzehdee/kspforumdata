Just make sure the Nereid subfolder is extracted in GameData, i.e. extract the archive into to KSP home folder. Unfortunately you have to check every addon how it has to be installed. Some choose to include the GameData folder in the archive, some don\u0027t. I have choosen the first option, so just extract it into wherever KSP is installed on your system and don\u0027t mess with the folder structure afterwards. If it still fails to load the ribbons, I will have to add log message to analyze this further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotebooks... I hate them.
