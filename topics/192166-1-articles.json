Unloaded, it should weigh in at a tad over 1400 tons and is around the length of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. Due to this, when I\u0027m rotating the ship, no matter with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or with reaction wheels, the entire ship flexes. Strutting helps, but as it\u0027s constructed in orbit, I can\u0027t strut different segments\u00A0together. The segments aren\u0027t connected via docking ports, I\u0027m using the construction port from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E to weld parts together. My reaction wheels are concentrated in one area, and I can\u0027t change that as I have a specific model to go after. Is there a way to stop this wobbling? I haven\u0027t dared to perform a manuever, it\u0027ll probably shake itself apart.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-06T02:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223752483\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192166\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221583461342\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022189011\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kev1n8088\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, Kev1n8088 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy reaction wheels are concentrated in one area, and I can\u0027t change that as I have a specific model to go after.
