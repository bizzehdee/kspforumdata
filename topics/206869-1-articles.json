A Kerbin -\u0026gt; Eve transfer should be performed when the phase angle between them is about 55 degrees, with Eve behind Kerbin in its orbit. The alarm is supposed to alert you when the planets are in the right alignment to perform the transfer. But instead of alerting me when the angle was 55 degrees, it alerted me when the angle was 165 degrees. As I said, not even close, mun or no mun\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miklkit","CreatedById":201493,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-12T05:21:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I have given up on that thingy.\u00A0 Mechjeb does a better job, but not by much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cfds","CreatedById":82109,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-12T14:45:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe usual mierdas touch of Squad development.
