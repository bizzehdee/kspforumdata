I have 3 very simple symmetric boosters. After decoupling the\u00A0 first booster, I can quicksave ONCE and then the bug appears.\u00A0 I load the quicksave done after the first decoupling, and again,\u00A0I can quicksave ONCE and then the bug appears. I do the same for boosters 2 and 3 and then\u00A0load the save in which I have separated all boosters. Then the bug appears, I cant quicksave at all. If I decouple all boosters at the same time, the bug also appears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I do not decouple, it works fine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIF I DECOUPLE IN THE AIR (well in vacuum but not touching the ground) NO BUG.
