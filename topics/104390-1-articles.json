The satellite moved *closer* to the vessel rather than away from it and I can only get it to wobble around. The RCS on the vessel is too weak to get the satellite to separate. Rotation also fails to fling it off. Perhaps I should have used the junior docking port but it wasn\u0027t possible due to reasons.\n\nThe docking ports need to be able to flip their magnets."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T18:59:52Z","Content":"The magnet effect is only when selecting a docking port. I don\u0027t understand you issue. I use docking ports a lot. Sometimes I even don\u0027t use RCS, I rotate my space station and the very slow movement push the undocked item away.\n\nThe only issu I\u0027ve notices is when you undock something, go back to the space center and get back to the undocked part. It sometimes redock itself when they are VERY near. So I wait a bit (time warp), THEN go back to space center."},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T18:59:59Z","Content":"After decoupling there is a breif period in which the magnets disarm and the satellite should have no problem escaping."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T19:07:56Z","Content":"This is a known bug. The only possible way to fix this, that I know of is through savefile editing.\n\nIt\u0027s a little fiddly but worth it, as to my knowledge there is no other way to remedy it.
