I don\u0027t understand you issue. I use docking ports a lot. Sometimes I even don\u0027t use RCS, I rotate my space station and the very slow movement push the undocked item away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only issu I\u0027ve notices is when you undock something, go back to the space center and get back to the undocked part. It sometimes redock itself when they are VERY near. So I wait a bit (time warp), THEN go back to space center.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T18:59:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter decoupling there is a breif period in which the magnets disarm and the satellite should have no problem escaping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T19:07:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a known bug.
