When I\u0027m in space and I\u0027m doing a normal burn my spacecraft will tip over/forward as I throttle up. If I engage the ASAS the craft will point itself a few degrees away from where the point I locked the ASAS too. I just want to understand why and how I can prevent this from happening. The center of thrust and the center of mass looks good so I don\u0027t think thats the problem. Any advanced spacecraft builders that can explain to me why this happends and what the cause might be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture of craft: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A4rTi.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/A4rTi.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T22:27:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d suspect it is a centre of mass/thrust problem, some modded parts only update their mass in flight (particularly fuel tanks) so the VAB\u0027s indicators wouldn\u0027t be accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this happen if you make it symmetrical top and bottom?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T22:54:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a ship that tumbled as fuel burned off, as EndlessWaves suggested. It was easier to debug after I added a fuel dump part so I could get rid of most of my fuel while still on the pad. I used the one in ORDA, but there are several.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/Balance was so far off that, if I turned on the gyros in orbit, they\u0027d work backwards and she\u0027d gradually tumble faster and faster until she broke apart.

It was a balance issue even though it was minimal it did affect. Like sal_vager said it was specifically the extras that created the problem, I moved them all to the bottom and I tried to place them symettrically, the spacecraft doesn\u0027t fly precisely straight in space now but it\u0027s much better than before and the ASAS works perfectly atleast. I\u0027ll continue to develop on this spacecraft and try to fix it completely.

I did this to counterbalance the big landing gear on my spaceplane, by calculating the \u0027bottom\u0027 mass, and simply adding extra parts to the top. It solved a tumbling spaceplane in upper atmosphere/space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T17:54:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOlsson, I know you said it does not fly perfectly in space, but there is another factor that can affect you in the atmosphere, that factor being the drag of the various side mounted components, even ladders have a small effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in space there is no drag, so it must be something else, I find with some large designs that the craft can twist under acceleration but that should not happen with your small design, but just in case, see what happens if you brace the nacelles with struts or mount them on decouplers so they don\u0027t touch the main section of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T19:41:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it is a weight inbalance.
