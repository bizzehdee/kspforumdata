In just 10 years, a small band of scientists, engineers and one very enterprising CEO had taken the business from a fringe startup to nearly trillion dollar status. The Helios project was a series of six potential mining sites on the Moon, constructed to automate the process of mining, harvesting and delivering Helium-3 to fusion reactors being built on the Earth. Four bases were already in place with two more nearing launch. No other corporation was even close to launching a human to the Moon.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003ETechnically, it wasn\u2019t the eclipse that caused the issues, but the large Solar Mass Ejection that coincidentally impacted the Earth at the same time. While most of the military\u2019s assets were hardened and mostly able to survive, the older commercial and GPS satellites had their circuitry overloaded and destroyed. Most of the power grid on Earth was impacted, and up to 95% of the planet was without electricity for the first week after the event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe people of the time said the impact had set technology back between 50 and 100 years. Many governments fell and several countries banded together to provide basic services, but it was the corporations that drove the rebuild. There were nine major corporations now, and PostCo, sponsor of the Helios missions, was the newest of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven now, though nearly 50 years after the devastating solar storm, repercussions were still being felt. Satellites were still being replaced. Great effort was being put into hardening communication and power systems in an attempt to mitigate negative effects of future events. Communications satellites and GPS were the first craft replaced. Smaller harvester drones were also developed to find, attach to and de-orbit the failed equipment still in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Helios base is designed to accommodate a crew of seven people, but only three people are needed before full operations begin. Dave Plowman was assigned the archaic title of mission commander, when he was really nothing more than a pilot and glorified middle manager at a branch office about 240,000 miles away from headquarters. Calling him a pilot was almost a stretch, as the computer did most of that work. Floyd Schmitt, great-grandson of Apollo XVII astronaut and geologist Harrison Schmitt, was the scientist responsible for analyzing the data being gathered at Helios III.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIf we shelter the scrapers and sifters, there\u2019s a better chance they\u2019ll survive. I should be able to get most of them in the garage before we need to go.\u201D Sydney Barrat, engineer of the Helios III site, didn\u2019t \u2018drive\u2019 the machines in the conventional sense, or even by remote control. It mostly amounted to sequencing events and allowing the central computer to orchestrate the individual movements, and Sydney had been a major player in the design of the system. If she remote controlled individual trucks, she could move them faster than the computer would, but she\u2019d only be able to move one at a time. The pressurized mechanical bay would serve as a quasi-Faraday cage for those machines she could move in before the storm arrived.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027, courier, monospace;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETo be continued...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-25T22:47:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2016 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Torgo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eformatting :(\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torgo","CreatedById":149873,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T18:42:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrelude continued - will add a couple pics in later....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAndromeda class crew transfer vehicles weren\u2019t designed with sub-orbital trips around the Moon in mind. They would launch from the Earth and travel to the Moon in just under three days, and touchdown at a Helios site. Then, when it was time to return, the vehicle was designed to launch directly into a return trajectory, travel nearly three days back to earth, then separate the crew capsule for a standard unpowered descent while the rest of the vehicle burned up upon re-entry. The only function the pilot had was to confirm things were correct, and then press the occasional button. Truth was, though, that they only got to push buttons to keep them from feeling completely useless. They weren\u2019t needed for any task outside of keeping the scientists and engineers from knowing their lives were all in the hands of a few thousand lines of computer code. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the three hour mark approached, the three humans of Helios III met in the conference room and established a connection back to Corporate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got bad news and worse new, Helios III.

It took several seconds for the sound to reach them. It was a sound unlike anything any kerb had ever heard before. It was so loud it shook the cameras and the windows of the mission control building. Many kerbs were thankful that they had only little holes in their heads, and not actual ears, or else it would have been unbearable.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust as quickly as it had started, the roar inside the capsule was replaced by the sound of air rushing by as it continued straight up from the ground.

Jeb looked at what the engineers had called an \u2018altimeter\u2019 to see it read just under 16,000 meters.

He had run a humble scrap yard from this swampy land, just as his father had before him. The most excitement he had, before that night which began this new chapter of his life, was tearing down old vehicles and putting the pieces together into something new. But all that changed with the arrival of a mysterious light in the sky, a strange piece of unkerbly metal and a swarm of government worker kerbs with clipboards and pens and lab coats. The replay of events in his mind was rudely interrupted by the jolt of the planet ramming itself into his capsule at just over three meters per second.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nEverything seemed to be in order, and he released the buckle of the straps holding him to his seat. The handle on the door turned when he pressed it, and the door swung open. Jeb clambered out and stood on the ground next to his capsule. A few yards away, he could see the smoking hole in the ground left by the booster rocket that had dropped back down below him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cQ7LAqx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cQ7LAqx.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOne short flight for a kerb, one giant leap for kerbkind\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first wave of kerbs took just a few minutes to reach him. The doctors wanted to poke and prod him to make sure he was okay. The scientists were tearing apart the capsule to retrieve the data. The reports were all yelling questions at him. It made the rush of the launch just a few minutes before seem quite sedate. Jeb was sheparded into a waiting car and driven back to the Astrokerb headquarters building for a more thorough examination. He was now the most famous kerb in the world, and everyone wanted to talk to him. One of the secretaries started going over his schedule. For the next month, he\u2019d rarely see his own bed.

The society had no laws specifically against dissent, but there had never been a place for it in their culture. That night, the Overkerb interrupted the nightly viewscreen entertainment shows to announce that a forum would be established where everyday kerbs would be allowed to respectfully ask questions about the space agency and space program, provided that questions dealt with science and facts, and not nonsensical fantasy like aliens and extra-terrestrial craft.

The solid rocket booster first stage was larger and heavier, but could not be fully loaded with fuel or else it would be too heavy to actually get off the ground. In sessions in the simulator, the second stage liquid engine kept failing to ignite, and none of the engineers could figure out why.

OK, he was a little scared but fully confident in the space agency team... He hoped that this new era of exploration would encourage young kerbs to learn math and science... No, he hadn\u0027t met the Overkerb in person yet... No, he hadn\u0027t met the aliens yet, er No there is no such thing as aliens and stop speaking such nonsense... Yes, he couldn\u0027t wait to get into space and maybe even go to the Mun, but there are still a lot of problems to solve before we get there...

He was hoping he\u0027d finally get an answer from Wernher about the mysterious light in the sky that had started\u00A0this strange new chapter in his life.\u00A0\u00A0Rocks had fallen from the sky for as long as anyone could remember. Jeb had even seen some of them streak overhead, but none of them looked like the one he had seen most recently. And why did the Overkerb take away his junkyard so quickly afterwards?

The team would evaluate the issues, adapt the designs to solve those, run tests, and find new issues created. As they were designing this rocket to carry a kerb, they wanted to eliminate as many problems as possible. Linus compared it to the process one of the side companies was facing when designing a viewscreen game that everyone could play which would simulate building rockets and launching them. Bugs would be found, then fixed, and then new bugs would be found. One reporter joked that maybe the Testus II design team was using that program. That reporter was quickly escorted from the property, and Gene wrote a note to himself that perhaps \u2018Human Space Program\u2019 wasn\u2019t the best name for the game and that his teams shouldn\u2019t be getting caught playing it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8t7hZSK.png\u0022 alt=\u00228t7hZSK.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHuman Space Program v1.1 due out soon\u003Csup\u003ETM\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were some other questions, mostly focusing on upcoming plans. One civilian kerb asked how they could go about applying to be an astronaut. Another asked about how the technology being developed here would affect the rest of the world. Others focused on the current crew of astronauts. It was about an hour into the program when someone finally asked about the aliens, and Gene abruptly ended the discussion and angrily sent everyone home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 19 saw an announcement from the kerbs in research. They had completed their work on Stability, and had delivered some new prototype larger fins to the VAB. The researchers were now turning their attention to developing more boosters and fuel tanks and expected to be ready to present prototypes within a week. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new, larger fins combined with a breakthrough that an intern thought up on a snack break (though a mid-level manager made sure to take full credit for the solution). The solid boosters all worked, and simulations with the new fins showed them to be much more stable in flight, so why not use the larger XL30 as planned as the first stage, but then use the Star 48B booster as a second stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey loaded the design into the simulator, which looked very suspiciously like the \u2018Human Space Program\u2019 game, and the results were nothing short of breathtaking. They ran the tests several times and got similar results. They were about to tell Wernher when the intern who had come up with the idea (before it was stolen) realized that the craft they\u2019d designed was too heavy for the launch mound and they\u2019d not be able to fly it. The middle manager who had claimed the idea as his own still had a meeting with Gene, who brought 2 agency security guards and an empty cardboard box with him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWork on the tracking station expansion was just wrapping up, and the crew was disappointed when Gus told them that their 3 day leave had been cancelled, as they\u2019d need to start upgrading the launch pad right that afternoon after the Testus E testing. It would take them at least 7 days of non-stop work to get that project done, but Gus promised the crew 6 days of leave if they finished on time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x77Pcae.png\u0022 alt=\u0022x77Pcae.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELooking at the tracking station from the roof of the VAB\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah had returned early from his maniacal misery tour. The day\u2019s events had been cancelled at the last minute when the PR team realized that one of the interviews was actually with the \u2018Ancient Aliens\u2019 guy who was using a fake name. Until all the event organizers and journalists could be verified as not alien worshipping crackpots, the agency was going to not participate in any more public events.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb was disappointed, because he\u2019d been looking forward to talking to that crazy haired kerb about aliens. He assuaged his feelings by stealing the Testus E out from under Bob and taking it to the pad to test the Merlin engine and the radial de-couplers. The engine worked as expected, but the de-couplers sent their empty tank attachments flying 60 meters in either direction, resulting in two loud explosions and a snack truck being rapidly disassembled while its owner was inside using the little kerbs\u2019 room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kdVzE6f.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kdVzE6f.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJebediah poses inside the new service bay module under the Testus E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTesting complete, two new engine testing contracts were hastily accepted and Jeb went to look for his sister Val so they could grab some dinner together. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was only going to take about 4 days to build the Testus II, so Gene had the teams begin work on the Testus F first, as it would be done and leave enough time for the II to be assembled and then launched with little delay. They also made plans for the Testus G.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Day 22, Bob brought the Testus F to the pad to test the RL10 engine, yet another liquid fuel solution that might someday help them leave the planet. The engine performed exactly as the simulation said it would, and it was carted back to the VAB to be disassembled and the capsule incorporated into the Testus II.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GSA36Lw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GSA36Lw.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBob and the Testus F\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Day 23, the designers submitted their plans for the Testus III, which would forego the use of solid fuel and use only liquid fuel. The craft would not likely leave the atmosphere, but would mark the first use of liquid fuel, which is what the team would need to build larger rockets capable of reaching orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDay 24 saw the completion of the Advanced Rocketry research, and Wernher now had the team go to work on Basic Science, which would unlock some new experiments which could be used to replenish their now depleted stock of science. He also announced that the Testus II would launch on the 26th day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDay 25 was quiet, as everyone concentrated on their jobs to make sure tomorrow\u2019s flight would be ready to go.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the sun rose on day 26, crowds of thousands jammed the area around the space center. None of the public could actually see the rocket, or the launch pad, or much of anything, really, but this was THE place to be. The operations team put the finishing touches on the new launch pad, which could now handle larger rockets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Testus II was trucked out to the pad and carefully moved into position. The pad crew helped Valentina climb up into the capsule and made sure she was securely strapped in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W04Qpe9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W04Qpe9.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Testus II on the pad, shortly before launch\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus sat with the news crews, talking about the details of the launch. He mentioned to them that the target was reaching the upper atmosphere, but that the simulator runs had indicated they could actually reach space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd chanted along with the countdown and as it reached zero, watched for the rocket racing into the sky. They were not disappointed, as soon they saw the rocket on its way up, angling ever so slightly out over the ocean. It was a few seconds before the deafening roar of the engine hit them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the capsule, Val watched the gauges even though she didn\u2019t have to do anything until after the second stage burned out.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the ground, Linus pointed out that the first stage was burned out, and would be dropped over the ocean as the smaller second stage ignited. As the rocket was already much too high for anyone on the ground to see, they all looked at the oversized view screens that had been set up. The telephoto lens on the VAB camera strained to keep up with the Testus II as it raced up and away on a new finger of flame.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe view switched to a feed from the external camera pointing back down at the planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XT6LbUw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XT6LbUw.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELooking back from the edge of space\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus explained that to escape the atmosphere, they needed to reach a height of at least 140,000 meters. Everyone watching could listen in to Val from the capsule as she read off the gauges as the rocket inched ever higher.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, after what seemed like forever, the altitude readout rolled over the goal and kept climbing. Calmly, Val started activating the switches that controlled the science experiments on board. All had been stowed in the service bay below the capsule and above the heat shield. As the craft topped out at just over 160,000 meters, she flipped the switch to jettison the spend rocket booster still attached to the ship.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BJznS0C.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BJznS0C.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EA screen capture from the feed on Valentina\u0027s helmet in the capsule of the Testus II\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was proving more difficult than anticipated to get the capsule oriented for re-entry, but just after re-entering, Val was able to get the ship close enough to where it would correct itself on the way down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd correct itself it did. Violently. Val experienced over 10 G\u2019s a few times on the way down as the capsule rotated, wobbling on its long axis while slowing down in the increased air pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe recovery boats raced towards the spot where they thought the capsule would splash down. They spotted the parachutes from a few kilometers away. The simulator said the capsule should float, but no one had thought to actually test that to be sure. But in the end, the simulator was right. The capsule splashed down and bobbed gently in the water as it rolled to its side. The crew plucked Val from the capsule, then attached the chains to the craft and gently hauled it on board.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack at the space center, the party had already begun. The mission had resulted in an influx of nearly 75,000 funds. The research team calculated that the experiments brought back were worth 87 science, more than enough to unlock 2 more nodes of research as they prepared for the next great task of placing a craft in orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd inside a dark\u00A0warehouse somewhere near the space center. the image of the Overkerb spoke to the small group assembled inside. \u0022Wernher, I never doubted you.
