Lightning is just an environmental hazard that happens by chance, but EMPs can be deliberately created by an enemy to attack planes. An aircraft from, say, the Vietnam era wouldn\u0026#39;t be as badly affected because it has little or no electronics in it. Modern fighters will be easily taken out by EMPs. The F-35\u0026#39;s biggest selling point; its stealth, is going to be useless very soon, so all the money that went into it will have been wasted. It probably would be a better idea to invest money in finding ways to make aircraft resistant to EMPs, so they can safely fly with all those fancy avionics.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T17:06:47Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027pTrevTrevs\u0027]An aircraft from, say, the Vietnam era wouldn\u0026#39;t be as badly affected because it has little or no electronics in it.[/quote]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo you have any substantiation for that statement?

There are no MFDs, all the instruments are in gauges which do not use electronics to give a reading. If a Vietnam jet gets EMPed, it will still have the systems necessary for the pilot to at least fly the plane, and the guns should even still work, allowing the plane defend itself if necessary.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat makes you think they did not do that?

It\u0026#39;s biggest selling point (and, therefore, the aspect which likely took up most of the designers\u0026#39; efforts) is what makes is such an expensive aircraft. So expensive, in fact, that several nations have decided not to buy significant numbers of the aircraft because they are afraid it will be too expensive to operate. It\u0026#39;s stealth limits its payload capacity drives up the process, complicates repairs, and for what? The chance to be able to sort of hide on today\u0026#39;s radar? Remember, the F-35 won\u0026#39;t be in widespread use until the 2020s, by which time radar will have advanced to the point where the F-35 is easily detectable.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T23:27:13Z","Content":"\nFighter planes have been FBW since the \u0026#39;80s.
