This is in hopes of making a mass-reducing set of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe annoying thing is, I cannot reduce the mass of any part that does not have access to this resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I was wondering if anybody out there could help me with a couple ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) A script/mod that will put a value of my resource on every attached part of the ship, with a max value = to its mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E going off a \u0022fuel lines\u0022 idea, I would also be OK if the part I made only reduced the mass of its self, and the part it\u0027s attached to (right now its a surface attached part.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand, in addition to those above,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) I\u0027d love for this resource to \u0022Decay\u0022 rather quickly. And while I could write it as a generator (of a negative value) onto the part, it wouldn\u0027t help much when the player could get the ship to 0 mass, and then just eject the generators, and not worry about the decay. So, I\u0027d like help getting the shortened life-span as part of the \u0022RESOURCE_DEFINITION.cfg\u0022 or perhaps the resourcename.cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance for any help you can offer!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T13:40:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuestion A is doable, you will just have to find the MM script for all parts, it\u0027s something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E@PART\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003ERESOURCE\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut find a reference on GitHub, that just from memory and probably has a typo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn B, that is doable, but would require a PartModule with custom code on each part you wanted to reduce the mass on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd C would require a ModuleGenerator of some sort, either your own custom one or the stock ModuleGenerator.
