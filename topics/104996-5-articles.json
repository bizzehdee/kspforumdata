Another option if people want is to get rid of the 2 center side hatches, and have the bunks located there instead. I can then shorten the modules by 1 panel section so it will match the size of the V4s. But, maybe it would be better to have the 6 kerbal version longer for the variety?\n\nSleep Hab V4-2 is a bit hard to figure out which way is up, so maybe I should add the hatch back to the center top. Otherwise I might add to the texture map to have some tag to help know orientation from the outside.\n\nI\u0027ll probably be pushing out the next update after I make the node covers. Though I want to have all the texturing completed for the gym module IVA props completed before I include that in this pack so the next update wouldn\u0027t have any new IVAs.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

With hatches that can be seen in IVA, but from the outside there may only be hull (like for the smooth versions of the parts)? \n\nIf that\u0027s the case, what do you think of just putting node attachment points on top of the smooth surfaces (no outside hatch texture)? Then if we decide to attach another part (or docking port) to the node, the two parts will be flush so we won\u0027t even realize or be able to see that there isn\u0027t *actually* a hatch texture there. We\u0027ll just kind of pretend there is. The hatches will still exist in IVA anyway.\n\nThis is just an idea to reduce part count.

Another issue is that the IVAs have been built around the Type 1s, so when the mod \u0022Enhanced IVA\u0022 is working, or if squad ever implements a stock version there will be a very large void space if passing through the center hatches.\n\nIf the smoother variant or node covers are considered bloaty by a bunch of people, I can always pack it in a separate folder.
