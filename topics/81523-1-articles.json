The contract says I have to get him into a craft and recover the craft. I\u0027m able to get to him in orbit, but I can\u0027t get him into the craft. The game won\u0027t let me switch to Milbrett to control him, and he\u0027s just floating in an EVA suit. I\u0027ve tried grabbing him in EVA, but it doesn\u0027t give me a \u0022grab\u0022 option when I bump him. I\u0027ve tried bringing the crew hatch to him, and even going eva and bumping him back toward the hatch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something that I\u0027m missing? Should one of these approaches have worked, and I\u0027m just doing it wrong?

That did the trick. I was able to switch to him at around 1km and flying him back was a snap. I landed him after like 2 days in orbit station keeping with him. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
