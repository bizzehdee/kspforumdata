The important ones to this situation are KAS and Orbital Material Science and the part in question is the KEES Passive Experiment Carrier.

For example, I have a little flier on Duna that I hook up to the main base to re-fuel with a fuel pipe. If I unhook that pipe and the pipe end and fly off, my ship rolls like the part is still attached.
