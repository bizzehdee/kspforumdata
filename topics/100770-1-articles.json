It actually seems to speed up a little (but not by much) if I.let go of the ship and move around with suit thrusters (which is rather dangerous when operating at extremely low fps)..\n\nI\u0027ve got a lot of mods so it\u0027ll take a long time to compile a list of what mods I\u0027ve got installed (but can if you really want me to). The important ones to this situation are KAS and Orbital Material Science and the part in question is the KEES Passive Experiment Carrier. The problem goes away, however, if I manage to get back inside and then EVA again. Basically it feels like it\u0027s going into a processing loop.\n\nWhat\u0027s causing these hangups? What, if anything, can I.do to relieve this issue?"},{"CreatedByName":"Secret Agent Kirrim","CreatedById":98579,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T10:27:06Z","Content":"May need to remove the mod. What I saw is that KEES is not compatible with both, and could be causing the frame drops."},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T11:35:30Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had issues with after altering a craft with KAS that the game still thinks the part is attached. For example, I have a little flier on Duna that I hook up to the main base to re-fuel with a fuel pipe. If I unhook that pipe and the pipe end and fly off, my ship rolls like the part is still attached. If I quick save and reload before flying off all is good.\n\nMaybe Quicksave and Reload. That has been a big work around for KAS for a long time."},{"CreatedByName":"Eiktyrner","CreatedById":127933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T21:21:52Z","Content":"Toggle to the ship and then back by using [ ] and it will be gone.\n\nNo idea why it\u0027s happening though but that solves it for me."}]}
