Wheels combined with lowerable landing struts are probably one of the easier ways to make a modular and mobile base, however they can be finicky trying to line up. I would suggest creating a subassembly of a reusable basic structure to guarantee your wheels, landing struts and docking ports all start at equal heights and then build around that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T20:57:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne problem with Eve is that the gravity is higher so don\u0027t expect two modules with different weight to line up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS help here as you can make an winch to raise and lower stuff in addition to pipes to connect parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to launch bases as single modules. 5 hitchhiker modules is just 20 ton.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TOROWY","CreatedById":13355,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T23:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Euse girders as landing legs, and test them on kerbin.

I find that the senior ports are the hardest to dock, especially on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a large rectangular mun base, launched it in 4 parts before I tested building one on Kerbin. I found it wouldn\u0027t dock on the ground, so I had to assemble it in orbit and land it as one huge bit, 14 hitchhikers with a large comms tower on top, plus 4 base rovers to carry it about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not tried building a base on Eve, I\u0027ve only landed single unit H.O.M.E. bases there. I\u0027m guessing the high gravity will make things trickier. Kas could help, or robotics, you can make nice lowrider suspension for rovers with Infernal Robotics. I think most of us have seen that epic base building video on Duna with the KAS \u002B robotics rover putting everything together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
