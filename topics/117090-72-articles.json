and somehow deal with the seam on one of the edges (or both edges....).\u00A0 Hmm.... perhaps not the best choice then (I cannot stand visible seams, and doing it this way would mean I could not use

a tunnel on both sides of the SRB), and use rotation-based-mirroring for the main segment sides.\u00A0 However, this would result in text being visible on both the front and back of the SRB rather than just the back.\u00A0 This would allow for using the existing UV layout, and would not require re-unwrapping much/at all, but I\u0027m not sure that I want tunnels and text on both sides (would
