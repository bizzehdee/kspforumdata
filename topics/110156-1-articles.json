I see you\u0027ve also got part 2 up now?\n\nAfter watching part 1:\n\n-Yes! This is what I\u0027m looking for.\n\n-This video starts with 3 minutes of a rocket standing still :/\n\n-While I like the commentary and the explanation images, you could really really use tighter editing. Less \u0027downtime\u0027.\n\nPart 2 is much better in regards of things happening on-screen."},{"CreatedByName":"BrettS983","CreatedById":144193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T14:17:46Z","Content":"Yep, part 2 is up now\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ASxp81UXjw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n.\nThanks for the feedback. Even though we only released a couple videos, we\u0027re seeing in our YouTube analytics that the videos are probably too long. Although part 3 is still going to be in the 20 minute-ish range, we\u0027re trying to keep the editing a lot tighter to focus on the more interesting stuff. And part 4, which we\u0027re just starting, is a whole new approach. It will probably be shorter, and we\u0027re going to do our narration differently, to try and keep it more interesting."},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T14:21:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yep, part 2 is up now\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ASxp81UXjw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E .\n\u003E Thanks for the feedback.
