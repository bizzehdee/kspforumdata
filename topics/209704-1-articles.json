I tried to drive trough an clipped hole at the Mun poles and succeeded, I fell down to the singularity at the core and was spit out at significant velocity, rover was still reported at traveling over surface so I had to revert, I think the travel over surface bug is why this worked. Repeated and was not able to do it again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso sent an rover with an small probe I put into the opening and it blew up all the time, probably because flying not driving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
