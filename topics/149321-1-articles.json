There are two craft in there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first one (\u0022basic\u0022) is what I pictured yesterday. It is quite minimal with a low part count (if you remove all but one pair of nosecones it\u0027s exactly 30 parts). It is a bit tricky to get to orbit efficiently since it is underpowered once the boosters have gone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo get to orbit: full power on launch pad, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on, launch, and after it reaches about \u003Cu\u003E40-50m/s\u003C/u\u003E start gently pushing it over to 80\u00B0 to vertical (heading right - east - of course).

Stage the boosters, and \u003Cu\u003Eright-click the drop-tanks\u003C/u\u003E so that you can drop them when empty. \u003Cu\u003EAction group 8\u003C/u\u003E toggles gimbal on/off for both rocket engines (the Swivel and, later, the Terrier) if you want (all the wavering around annoys me and makes me think it\u0027s inefficient).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe really important thing to watch is the exact moment the gravity turn crosses the 45\u00B0 line. It should be about 18-20km. If it is much lower or higher, you should probably revert and try again. If lower, you\u0027re likely not to make orbit due to the low-powered Swivel core, and if much higher you\u0027ll be losing more fuel to gravity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you do it really well, you should have just enough fuel to complete the Mun transfer burn on the Swivel stage. My best attempt was slightly short of that, and I needed to stage to the lander stage with about 100m/s still to go...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YAKz9xv.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YAKz9xv.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other variant is an over-engineered version of the same basic design, but with Reliant booster stages replacing the drop-tanks. It\u0027s also significantly heavier and more expensive (though that only really matters if you\u0027re playing career). You could easily add a materials bay under the last decoupler if you want.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s much more forgiving to fly due to the controllable fins and higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou should use the same basic approach for the gravity turn (aiming at 80\u00B0 by the time you reach 90-100m/s, then using \u0022prograde hold\u0022 all the way to orbit), but this time you can be more aggressive in the initial turn and/or throttle down to ensure that you pass the 45\u00B0 line at around 9-12km instead. If you miss that mark, the fins provide enough aero control to throw the rocket about quite a lot to perfect the turn (where the \u0022basic\u0022 rocket would certainly spin out of control).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should reach orbit with a nearly-full tank for the Swivel, and still have some left on circularising in low Mun orbit. You could even use some of it to deorbit and start your suicide burn - but that will make it impossible to plan ahead perfectly since you\u0027ll only get the final burn time once you\u0027ve started the lander stage. However, you\u0027re pretty much guaranteed to need about 32-35 seconds total for the suicide burn, so if you start burning that far away from ground impact you\u0027ll be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pfG224Q.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pfG224Q.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yes - neither craft has any solar power, just one battery (incidentally, batteries and the smaller science experiments add weight to the part they\u0027re attached to, so if it\u0027s a core element there is no off-centre weight distribution; however, goo cannisters add weight as discrete parts - so they need to be balanced.

Your angle of flight therefore drops towards the horizon.
