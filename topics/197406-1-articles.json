The only way i can get it to move is by attaching the wing to one of those other wing panels at the back which doesn\u0027t help at all. Why is it doing this and is there a way to fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-10T10:25:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2020 10:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Soyuzturtle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ei meant center of lift , not center of mass.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-10T10:31:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHold shift, then rotate the main wings\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Every slightly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0so the leading edge (front) is angled upwards by a few degrees.
