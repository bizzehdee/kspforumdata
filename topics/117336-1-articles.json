My question is why hasn\u0027t this been done sooner?

Part of it is because private launches are only becoming a thing. The other part is that as Kaboom points out, it wasn\u0027t easy to build small rockets. Still isn\u0027t. From perspective of rocketry, the larger it is, the less trouble it is to get it to space. Of course, at some point, you start running into just your regular engineering problems of building something really big, like, how do you get it to not collapse under its own weight. But there is a sweet spot for cost efficiency, which used to be pretty big. And now, with new materials, we can go much smaller and still provide cost-efficient launches.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T19:59:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was only viable due to the recent major increase in smallsats being produced, as they\u0027re now starting to overwhelm providers of ridreshares; this in turn had led to reasonably viable smallsat launch providers like RocketLab. Also, while not formally confirmed, there\u0027s a good chance this pad had already started construction for the cancelled DoD SWORDS small launcher project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T20:02:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kryten\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T21:08:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, most sounding rockets are only a couple of tons at the heaviest, whereas the smallest orbital launchers are in the tens of tons. Typical sounding rockets also use a \u0022rail\u0022 type pad, as opposed to the designs used by orbital vehicles. Finally, because sounding rockets are suborbital, their launch pads are often placed in locations where an orbital launch would fly over populated areas. So, sounding rocket pads aren\u0027t usually suitable for orbital launch vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T22:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
