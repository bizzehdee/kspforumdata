You launch with an extremely high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E which will make you hit the the air much harder in the lower and denser parts of the atmosphere. And your lower stage is short and heavy while balancing a long and light noodle on top. That\u0027ll keep your center of mass low and give the aerodynamic forces a long lever to work against you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other design suffers basically from the same problems: low center of mass with a light and wide payload on top. The FL-T100 of the payload weighs about 0.6t full and is probably the heaviest part of the payload while the Swivel on the bottom of your rocket already weighs 1.25t. So with only one tank your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E will most likely drop even further during ascent while you want it to rise to keep stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the blue indicator is not the center of pressure but the center of lift.

In rockets they can not. The vast majority of rockets consist of large parts that do induce large amounts of drag but not produce lift. The few parts that do produce lift will place the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E marker far from the CoP and may give the wrong impression.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E it\u0027s best to completely ignore the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E marker and simply keep mass near the top and drag near the bottom.
