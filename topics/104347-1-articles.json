I recently built a craft with 13 ion engines and more xenon tanks than I care to count to drag a lander to Eeloo. The problem is this craft is impossible to refuel because I can\u0027t click on all the tanks to transfer fuel, which makes it useless on future missions. The best solution would be a 2.5m xenon tank. I know there\u0027s mods for this, but why can\u0027t there be a stock 2.5m xenon tank?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T23:02:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause there wasn\u0027t a 2.5 meter Round8 tank for Squad to \u0027repurpose\u0027?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T23:35:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T23:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere will be a new 1.25m tank which Im jazzed about, no idea how much it will hold.

You\u0027re talking about a huge amount of weight for so little thrust. At some point you\u0027re just adding more engines to push more fuel to push more engines to push more fuel. You can get a nice manned mission to Jool with a science lab and all that down to 8 minute burns with 12 ion engines. You just have to be careful about weight.
