I recently built a craft with 13 ion engines and more xenon tanks than I care to count to drag a lander to Eeloo. The problem is this craft is impossible to refuel because I can\u0027t click on all the tanks to transfer fuel, which makes it useless on future missions. The best solution would be a 2.5m xenon tank. I know there\u0027s mods for this, but why can\u0027t there be a stock 2.5m xenon tank?"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T23:02:54Z","Content":"Because there wasn\u0027t a 2.5 meter Round8 tank for Squad to \u0027repurpose\u0027?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T23:35:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T23:04:14Z","Content":"There will be a new 1.25m tank which Im jazzed about, no idea how much it will hold.

Like it or not, you\u0027ll have to sit through lengthy burn times for any long range mission. You just have to cluster the ion engines to have adequate thrust."},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T20:45:40Z","Content":"I just don\u0027t know if its necessary before we get a large vasmir type engine. You\u0027re talking about a huge amount of weight for so little thrust. At some point you\u0027re just adding more engines to push more fuel to push more engines to push more fuel. You can get a nice manned mission to Jool with a science lab and all that down to 8 minute burns with 12 ion engines. You just have to be careful about weight. If each of the new 1.25m xenon canisters held 4k in fuel 2 of them should be more than enough."},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitusII","CreatedById":57305,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T21:11:06Z","Content":"The ion engines are designed with small, long-distance probes in mind and not large manned missions. NERVAs have been the go-to for all sorts of large-scale interplanetary missions for a while now and taking options away from that in order to benefit the ion engines (which are used quite a bit less and for much smaller missions) doesn\u0027t make sense. You also need to remember that unlike the ROUND-8, the Rockomax X200-8 is a staple part and changing it would garner much more outcry than the donut."},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T21:48:13Z","Content":"Only if a larger ion thrust can be made so as to not need multiple ions (perhaps name it a \u0022plasma\u0022 thruster?)."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T00:44:35Z","Content":"Just get NFP.
