It starts to turn to one side and is soon spinning out of control even with advanced SAS on. This also occurs mid-burn, so its not like some engines stop firing on one side. I am new to the game and maybe i am overlooking something big, any help would be appreciated.

The ASAS just auto controls the rocket to keep it pointed where you want. SAS act as spin counters. The cause of the flippy rocket isn\u0027t related to this. At 13-18km, you start losing the ability for aerodynamic control. If you have a weight imbalance or are using all non gymbaled thrust, it can cause a tip to start to form with no way to control it. Try posting up a pic of the rocket and maybe we can see for an asymetric fuel tanks or what engines if you cannot see any of these. Try having some gymbal engines engage at this point so you can use thrust to help guide the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UBERDOMINATOR","CreatedById":48288,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T19:25:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat the guy above me said. Plus, I have found that installing RCS thrusters with also help with stability when the ASAS is enabled. The cool part about that is that I believe the RCS will pull from the RCS fuel tank regardless of it\u0027s position on the rocket... I think!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T20:06:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome large rockets are also subject to the \u0027space kraken\u0027 effect. I have a recent ship that starts spinning out of control in about 30 seconds as soon as I turn off ASAS, with no control inputs whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T21:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt could simply be weight imbalances from the way your fuel tanks are draining. e.g., if you have a side mounted tank that drains out by 18,000m this could cause you to roll away from it once you don\u0027t have that weight anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
