Likewise you can just put a load of hab time on the ship and dump it on the launch pad, you effectively have that home time for the whole trip as long as you EVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been thinking about how the system could be fixed and one idea was to have each kerbal have a habitation percentage that drops from 100% to 0%. Hab modules would decrease the rate of decline rather than just adding n days. That way hab time isn\u0027t a static amount that can be reset via EVA and if you dropped hab modules or tried stocking up home time, it would have no effect as your actual hab time would depend on how much you actually have on your ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also wouldn\u0027t need to differentiate hab and home time any more which would reduce confusion. And finally the only way to increase hab percentage would be to use habitats like it currently is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis method would probably require the least amount of rework compared to other fixes, you just need to swap the timer attached to kerbals with a percentage (which in reality would still be a timer) and change it so that hab parts just act as a multiplier to the kerbals percentage/timer rather than adding time themselves.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only potential issue would be after a very long voyage, if a kerbal has very low hab time moves into a reentry capsule, the might end up with just a few minutes of time before striking. But this could be dealt with like supplies and electric charge with a few days grace period after its empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately I doubt RoverDude has much time to do this himself and I am not in a position to take the time out of my day to sift through the code myself to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-05T17:51:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2019 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spagoose\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-05T17:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to circle back, the design is as intended.\u00A0 The canonical example would be a manned landing to Duna.\u00A0 The main vessel would probably have a lot of hab (resulting in a large home hab value, being your upper limit).\u00A0 But when you go into a lander or EVA, you have a much smaller timer, so while your overall timer may be measured in years, you can\u0027t kick someone to sleep in the rover for months at a time.\u00A0 So while the EVA will reset your short term timer (this is to encourage more interaction), it will do nothing for your long term timer.\u00A0 Happy to tinker with any weird edge cases, but conceptually I am pretty happy with where it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spagoose","CreatedById":117283,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-05T19:42:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223646090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022105202\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221565027839\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105198\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to circle back, the design is as intended.\u00A0 The canonical example would be a manned landing to Duna.\u00A0 The main vessel would probably have a lot of hab (resulting in a large home hab value, being your upper limit).\u00A0 But when you go into a lander or EVA, you have a much smaller timer, so while your overall timer may be measured in years, you can\u0027t kick someone to sleep in the rover for months at a time.\u00A0 So while the EVA will reset your short term timer (this is to encourage more interaction), it will do nothing for your long term timer.\u00A0 Happy to tinker with any weird edge cases, but conceptually I am pretty happy with where it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main issue is that at the moment, it is definitely 100% possible to kick a kerbal into a rover for months at a time providing there are 2 or more kerbals in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can easily go to any planet in a ship with just a 2 seater command pod and no other hab modules if you wanted to, all you would need to do is get a high home timer from a station in kerbin orbit before you started the voyage.

And that doesn\u0027t address that I want to be able to set this group to two years and that group to four years and this one to 8. I\u0027ll have to build a station with docked hab segments and undock segments as necessary.

Best I have been able to do and still have something small enough to reasonably\u00A0get where they\u0027re going is a science station that sets all 9 scientists needed to operate it to a home time of a little over two years. I need three to five times that long for anything outside Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E unless I want 90% of my launches to be nothing but endless crew rotations or resort to using med bays to \u0022fix\u0022 kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat, to me, is gaming the system. It doesn\u0027t make any real sense that a space program would be driven by something as vague as home sickness or that this is somehow fixable in a medical facility. This is just my opinion, but if you need an override to your feature that is essentially a hack, it should suggest that the feature needs to be reconsidered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo one will be sending anyone into space long term or going into space long term without a hard contractual agreement as to the duration of the mission. Only exception will be colonists, for whom the space journey will just be a transit to a new long-term home;\u00A0they will have completely wrapped up affairs and packed and will be mentally prepared\u00A0for not returning. Everyone else will have an expectation of returning and will be extremely unlikely to get on a rocket without knowing when that is and be sure the agreement\u00A0has\u00A0legal standing.\u00A0And they won\u0027t accept a duration beyond what believe they can do, and whatever duration they agree to, they will mentally prepare themselves for it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHomesickness and anti-homesickness features would still be present, but they would change to things which either improve or degrade work output, engineers build and fix slower, scientists research slower, etc., so the homesickness value would still be critical and have large effects on the work output. And this aligns with reality, I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll see nice facilities built which people really like and so they keep working at peak efficiency, and on the other end is like the (fantasy) MIR station of Armageddon. You shouldn\u0027t expect quality or a large quantity of work from people in a crap station/base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut they wouldn\u0027t quit working, they have contracts. The only time they\u0027d quit working (barring some major medical event)\u00A0is at the end of their contract and again that aligns with what we can expect from reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027d like to see contract time be a parameter you set at recruitment time and have it affect the cost just like the existing params do. I really do think it would make the entire system more sensible and easier to work with for the players while being more realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW I just mostly wanted to write this down and make sure I\u0027d thought it through, I\u0027m not starting a crusade to change the fundamental design of MKS. First, you and the people who have used it seem to like it, and\u00A0I\u0027m sure you know better than me that KSP 2 plays into decisions on major work even if you saw something you thought was great.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m just saying this once and will move on, maybe if the subject ever comes up for you again you\u0027ll remember it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
