IMO this is a KSP bug: The GUI manager is started only once during game load and executed in a static way. That means there\u0027s only one instance of manager running and it\u0027ll be automatically destroyed when the game ends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReloading the database causes KSP to reload everything, including the GUI manager. But because the game session didn\u0027t end the old GUI manager didn\u0027t get destroyed. Now there are two managers, adding two app buttons etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if it\u0027s necessary to fix that. The bug occurs only in a very specific situation which won\u0027t happen to 99.9% of the players. Also I would have to find out how to destroy a static instance. There are no static destructors in C#. Also the reason I\u0027ve chosen a static instance is that it only runs once and it runs until the session gets unloaded. Well, in normal programs it works like that but KSP (or Unity or Mono, I\u0027m not sure who\u0027s the culprit) doesn\u0027t follow the standard behavior in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know anything about KSP programming, but I am guessing this would take much time and effort. So my reaction is a resounding \u0022meh.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne unusual behavior I notice - this may just be a property of how tracks work, and not a bug, I\u0027m just curious:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say you have a vehicle with four medium tracks where wheels would usually be: Picture Mk2 cockpit, long fuselage behind it, medium tracks stuck on sides (kind of the bottom-side, rotated).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you come to a stop, you can turn in place, slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you move forward without steering, no problem: accelerates fine up to 10.6m/s or whatever the top speed is (can that be tweaked by the end user? that would be neat. TURBO TRACKS! Is that what torqueCurve does?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in a certain range of very slow speeds while moving forward, turning one way or the other seems to lock things up and make motion of any kind much harder. When moving relatively fast forward, turning seems OK.\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this basically how a set of four tracks would work IRL? You can turn while stationary, but you can turn a lot easier if you\u0027ve only got one track on each side; you can turn OK while moving relatively quickly (when you\u0027ve got 4 of them total), but you can\u0027t do much at really slow speeds? Intuitively, seems like they might work that way - I mean, they aren\u0027t actually turning like wheels, just applying different torques or whatever, so that would seem to make sense: really hard to turn in place with a vehicle with four tracks, but maybe possible; hard to turn when going real slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, with respect to the GUI thing - the weird logic from my non-programmer perspective isn\u0027t that the icon would duplicate when you reload the database. That would actually make logical sense from a purely intuitive perspective, but it doesn\u0027t.
