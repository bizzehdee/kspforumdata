It would not be inflatable, but an actual dome of reinforced glass. It would start with just a new resource called \u0022Glass\u0022, and you\u0027d need to send 10,000 tons\u00A0up to your colony site. It would not only take a lot of time, but be very expensive. One the glass is up there, You\u0027d need to land a special object onto the colony site which would produce glass frames. They\u0027d be pretty large, and a full dome would consist of about 15. You\u0027d need to put them in place with your Kerbals. The dome would consist of an airlock on the side for Kerbals to enter and exit, plus a hatch on the top for space ships to come through. The main purpose of glass domes would be to provide a large habitable environment, which I\u0027ll go into later. While setting up a large dome network would be tedious in singleplayer, it would allow for incredible civilizations once multiplayer is officially released. When a dome becomes habitable, then the surface inside it would slowly become green and Kerbals would no longer need a suit to walk around in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EInflatable Tunnel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inflatable tunnel would be a thin but long and flexible object used to connect domes.

Without food, your Kerbals would slowly started \u0027leaving to go back home\u0027, which would in more blatant terms mean they are dying out. Greenhouses would produce food at a steady pace, but a larger Kerbal population in the dome would mean that they\u0027d go through food faster. You\u0027d also be able to ship food to the colony from Kerbin if needed. Domes would also become inhabitable without a space suit if they reach a certain threshold of oxygen along with nitrogen. If a dome has too much oxygen, then things inside would become much more likely to explode and Kerbals wouldn\u0027t be able to safely live in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENitrogen Extractor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nitrogen drill would simply extract nitrogen from the planet\u0027s crust.

I am afraid I am just a dabbler in the sciences.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option for large, open-spaced habitats (as opposed to a dome on the surface) would be to build sub-surface (i.e., underground) habitats.\u00A0 Given that Mars lacks tectonic plates that shift around, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that subsurface structures would be relatively stable and safe.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll that rambling aside, yes, a colonization feature/aspect to KSP would be amazing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-10T20:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always felt like colonization should be handled with a Civ 5 style of interface.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI guess it could work like Spore (shudder) in that you can actively switch between Regular KSP mode (what we have right now) and Colonization Mode.
