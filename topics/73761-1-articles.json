That may not be the best decision for you, it really depends on your skill level and such. I\u0027ve done manned round trips to Duna and Ike\u0027s surface without a single 2.5m part, as well as Eve orbit and Gilly\u0027s surface, and just about any other planet with probes. Basically, I don\u0027t need 2.5 meter parts to finish the tree, so I don\u0027t prioritize them. Science parts on the other hand, help a lot towards that goal. On the other hand, the last time I played a stock tech tree was before 0.23.5, and the changes to the 2.5 meter part placement in the tree has changed, so those parts may be more viable now that the poodle isn\u0027t the first and only 2.5m engine you get at the first node with 2.5m engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve got the first three items on that list. I\u0027d definitely spend your remaining science points on Fuel Systems and Space Exploration, that gets you fuel lines and the thermometer. Fuel lines let you more easily create multi-hop landers if you want to go back to the Mun or Minmus (Minmus is a fantastic place for science if you don\u0027t get bored of it, 9 biomes and low enough gravity that almost any craft that can land there should be able to hit multiple biomes) or cross-feeding fuel boosters for larger launchers if you want to start going interplanetary. The thermometer gets you a good bit of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, I think we\u0027d have to ask what you want to do? Would you enjoy more trips to the Mun or Minmus (yes, Minmus is easier to land on, even takes less delta-v including the transfer)? Or do you think it might start feeling repetitive? Do you think you\u0027d want more science parts before you head out to other planets? Or will more science parts want you to go back to the Mun and Minmus to get it all before you go on (yes, I can be a completist, so I speak from experience here). If you\u0027re more of a completist, I\u0027d probably recommend getting the rest of your science parts via Mun/Minmus science before going to Duna/Eve/etc., as going back to the Mun to finish up science with new parts is a lot easier than \u0022oh, a new science part, let\u0027s redo that huge mission to Jool that visited all its moons.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-31T21:00:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2014 09:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tortoise","CreatedById":68002,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T20:51:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest going to a planet\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T23:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, first I\u0027d go to Minmus and Mun a few times until you have more science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThan, unlock the nodes you need to feel comfortable going out of the Kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are alot of ways to help you go to another planet.
