I don\u0027t want to get rid of a mod I really love if it\u0027s not going to save very much RAM. If there isn\u0027t, then I think a sticky should be started to pool this information together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T09:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnything with textures will use the most RAM.

In general those will use the most RAM, though sometimes a small mod will cause lots of memory usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo really tell the only real way is to profile your memory usage individually with each mod installed. So uninstall all mods, profile memory usage with a test mission, then install your first mod. Profile again. Install the next mod. Profile again. Etc. This takes a LOT of effort if you have very many mods, which is why no one does it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
