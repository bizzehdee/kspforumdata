If not using any of the MCM functionality works for you, I\u0027m cool with it.

So for those who want to remove the MCM functionality, you\u0027ll have at least one example of what you can do with just the WildBlueTools. For a quick look, download DSEV and check out the FLM-1800 fuel tank.

I also assume you have some type of storage, and your MCM modules are just sitting on the ground.

Efficiency drops with increasing working modules, though I had enough extensions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no solution for this, because I don\u0027t know the reason. But some facts indicates, that the workspaces and livingspaces are calculated only from MCMs not from extensions.

If you use Kerbitat and Aeroponics, assuming infinite Spareparts and Machinery, it should be a closed loop.

To compensate you\u0027ll need twice as high efficiency for Greenhouse as for Composter. But somehow I can\u0027t get it managed. Habitat has 10 times higher capacity as Greenhouse, so it isn\u0027t a bottle neck. What I\u0027m doing wrong? I don\u0027t use MKS anylonger due to ram issues, so I can\u0027t compare.

E.g. a 15 kerbal station needs 750% and 375% that means at two 5star kerbals per module extended with 6 IMEM(Aeroponics) and 3 IMEM(Kerbitats), all without any penalties for many modules activated, see 2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EII. Missing Modules in Config Files\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned a few posts ago, there are some new modules in MKS for scrapping parts and (automatic) maintenance.

MKSStoragecontroller does not. Due to this, there might be some problems to implement USI_ResourceWarehouse and USI_Recyclebin to the parts which use both, colony and storage templates (e.g. Homestead). Q: In which direction works ignoreTemplateModules?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Epart is scrapped\u003C/span\u003E, USI_ModuleRecycleablePart will check for room of Recyclables in parts nearby which have USI_ModuelRecylebin module. Because MKSStoragecontroller doesn\u0027t check for modules in the templates, USI_ModuleRecyclebin has to be added to all storage parts: MSM, IMW and MBU2. I don\u0027t have a solution for Homestead yet.For \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Emaintenance\u003C/span\u003E of a single colony module, it needs USI_ModuleFieldrepair module in its template. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen doing a maintenance it checks for parts with USI_ModuleResourceWarehouse and the desired resource (Spareparts, Machinery and Enriched Uranium) to pull the resource from that part. Further it checks for parts with USI_ModuleCleaningbin for pushing DepletedUranium to them. So USI_ModuleResourceWarehouse needs to be added to all storage parts. Again what to do with Homestead? By now there is only Scienclab which uses USI_ModuleCleaningbin.Repair Shop template should have USI_ModuleResourcewarehouse, too, because it produces Spareparts and doesn\u0027t consume them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a ScienceLab or Repair Shop is fully manned there is an \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eautomatic maintenance\u003C/span\u003E with USI_ModuleResourceDistributor module, which at first pulls resources from Warehouses and then push to colony modules and finally push surplus back to warehouses. USI_ModuleResourceDistributor should be added to ScienceLab (EnrichedUranium) and Repair Shop (Spareparts), and I don\u0027t see any reason why it shouldn\u0027t be added to PDU (DepletedUranium). Of course machinery can be pumped, but when aiming for full automatic maintenance it would be nice to have it in Machinery Plant, too, but there is a problem if Repair Shop has USI_ModuleResourceWarehouse it would pull from there, too.
