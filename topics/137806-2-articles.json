somewhat differently from BatteryIndicator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

works specifically with emissive shaders, and the Z100\u0027s lamp is actually not an emissive shader-- it\u0027s an \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eunlit\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E one, which is different.\u00A0 So to get it to work in my own mod, I basically had to hack it:\u00A0 I made a little lamp that\u0027s exactly the same shape as the stock Z100\u0027s lamp, but just an invisibly tiny smidgeon bigger, and then use it to \u0022cap\u0022 the other one and hide it from view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difference between an \u0022emissive\u0022 shader and an \u0022unlit\u0022 one:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAn \u003Cstrong\u003Eemissive\u003C/strong\u003E shader has a \u0022glow\u0022 color that can be on or off; setting the color to \u0022black\u0022 doesn\u0027t make it black-colored, it just turns off the glow.\u00A0 The important thing is that such a color isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ejust\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a glow.\u00A0 It still has a regular color that\u0027s there when the glow is off.\u00A0 (In other words, when you turn a lightbulb off, it has a \u0022native\u0022 gray color and looks like a normal object-- it doesn\u0027t turn into a black \u0022hole in the universe\u0022.)\u00A0 When you see KSP engines glow when they get hot, what you\u0027re seeing is an emissive texture.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAn \u003Cstrong\u003Eunlit\u003C/strong\u003E shader is much simpler:\u00A0 you assign it a color, and that\u0027s the color that it\u0027s drawn on the screen.\u00A0 It completely ignores light and shadow conditions, just draws in that color.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nLights that use emissive versus unlit textures look pretty similar when they\u0027re turned on.\u00A0 It\u0027s when they\u0027re turned off that you see the difference.\u00A0 You\u0027ll note that in BatteryIndicator, when the light gets turned off, it doesn\u0027t look like an extinguished lightbulb-- it actually turns inky dark black.\u00A0 Whereas in IndicatorLights, turning the light off just makes it look like a\u00A0 normal, dull-gray object that responds to the lighting conditions around it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbOrbiter","CreatedById":58103,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T18:32:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

the problem, because when you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eare\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in daylight, half the ship is typically in dark shadow, and there\u0027s no easy way to account for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also thought about possibly adding some sort of animation (pulsating, blinking, whatever) for the non-happy-green cases... but that can get \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E annoying and distracting to people who don\u0027t like it, so I\u0027m trying to keep that sort of thing on an absolute-bare-necessities-only basis.\u00A0 I\u0027ve added pulsating to the extremely-low-charge case, which I think is about the limit of what\u0027s reasonable.\u00A0 So I plan on sticking to constant uniform brightness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I could probably crank \u0027em down a notch more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing I plan on doing is making the \u0022base colors\u0022 (i.e. the high, medium, and low colors, currently green / yellow / red) configurable via ModuleManager, rather than hard-coded as they are now.\u00A0 That way, if you don\u0027t like the default brightness settings, all you\u0027d have to do would be to add a single snippet of MM config to adjust the brightness levels of whichever parts you wanted to tinker with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Such a feature is important not just for brightness issues such as you mention, but also to be friendly to color-blind people who may have trouble distinguishing red from green-- let folks pick whatever colors work for them.\u00A0 A surprisingly large percentage of the population has some form of color blindness.\u00A0 It\u0027s an important UI design principle never to make color the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eonly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E indicator of crucially important information, particularly if the color is hard-coded and not user-settable, and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eespecially\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E if the colors involved are red and green, which are the most commonly problematic colors for folks with such issues.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022

implements all color changes directly in code (rather than using Unity animations built into the parts) means that it\u0027s easy to customize the behavior exactly how I like it.\u00A0 I currently have two kinds of animations programmed, which may be sufficient for everything.\u00A0 One is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eblinking\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (with a customizable period:\u00A0

this, I\u0027ll include a \u0022For modders only\u0022 explanation in a spoiler section at the end of this post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, you\u0027re a player, and you\u0027re worried about breaking a save game, and you\u0027re interested in IndicatorLights.\u00A0\u00A0 There are two categories of potential issues to be aware of:\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003Emodifications to stock parts\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Enew IndicatorLights parts\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding modifications to stock parts (for example, indicator lights on stock batteries, that sort of thing):\u00A0 You\u0027re completely safe, there.\u00A0 For example:\u00A0 Install IndicatorLights, and open up a pre-existing save.\u00A0 All your batteries for your already-launched ships will magically have indicators on all their batteries.\u00A0 Now uninstall IndicatorLights.\u00A0 All the indicators go away, but the ships are otherwise unaffected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason it\u0027s completely safe is that it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoesn\u0027t actually touch your save file\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 All of the modifications to existing parts are purely run-time ModuleManager tweaks to the parts themselves, and don\u0027t have any persistent data that\u0027s actually written to your save file.\u00A0 You could crack open your .sfs game or your .craft ships, and you\u0027d be completely unable to tell whether IndicatorLights is even installed, because it doesn\u0027t write anything there, \u003Cem\u003Efor the stock parts\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the new, standalone IndicatorLights parts (currently just the BL-01, but I\u0027ll be adding more):\u00A0 These ones \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E have a presence in your save file, so like any parts pack, there\u0027s the potential for save-game breakage if the author (i.e. me) makes some really incompatible change (like deleting a part) after you\u0027ve already launched ships that have that part on them.\u00A0 Therefore, there\u0027s a bigger onus on me to be careful about that sort of thing, and a greater risk to you (i.e. you\u0027re at my mercy, if I screw up and accidentally break something; basically, you have to trust me to be both virtuous and vigilant).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can say there that you ought to be fairly safe.\u00A0 I really want to avoid the possibility of breaking people.\u00A0 That\u0027s one of the reasons why I\u0027m waiting until relatively late in the mod-development cycle to add a bunch of new parts, because I have to be mindful that once I\u0027ve released a part out into the wild, folks are gonna be using it in their saves and I\u0027ll then have to worry more about breaking people if I touch it.\u00A0 The times when I\u0027m more likely to need to tinker with things are in the early stages, since I\u0027m making all this up as I go along and things are in a much greater state of flux.\u00A0 So I\u0027ll likely wait until things have stabilized pretty well before adding a bunch of parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said:\u00A0 the BL-01 is currently pretty minimal, and although I\u0027ll likely add some \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enew\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E

may be thinking of taking a dependency on IndicatorLights in their own mods:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

perspective, IndicatorLights provides the following assets that may be of use to you:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nA set of indicator meshes in the \u0022/Meshes\u0022 subfolder of IndicatorLights, which you can use for decorating your parts, if you like.\u00A0 (They\u0027re just there for convenience-- you don\u0027t have to use them.\u00A0 As long as your part has a mesh somewhere on it that has an emissive shader, you can use that.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA set of PartModules for specifying and controlling the behavior of the emissive light.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, I will try not to break you, where possible-- that is, I\u0027m proceeding on the assumption that with each new pre-release version of IndicatorLights, there may be other mods that were based on the preceding version, and I\u0027ll generally make a good-faith effort not to break such mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, since I\u0027m still actively coding and rearranging things, I can\u0027t \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eguarantee\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E that I won\u0027t break your mod, at least not while I\u0027m in pre-release.\u00A0 During pre-release, \u0022get the architecture of IndicatorLights right\u0022 takes a higher priority than \u0022make sure that I couldn\u0027t possibly break any other mod ever\u0022, so I\u0027ll make changes for the greater good of IndicatorLights (including breaking ones) if I feel they\u0027re necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Once I\u0027m out of pre-release and declare 1.0, then that rule will change, and the priorities will be swapped.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I do encourage you to write mods that use IndicatorLights-- I would love for folks to do this, I want my mod to be as useful as possible to people, and if lots of modders use it, then that\u0027s fertile ground for me to receive feature requests and usability improvements and such.\u00A0 But I do have some recommended best practices while IndicatorLights is still in pre-release:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFirst and foremost, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elet me know\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E if you\u0027re releasing or pre-releasing a mod that has any dependency on IndicatorLights.\u00A0 I\u0027ll be happy to add a link to your mod in my thread post.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nReason why this is a good idea:\u00A0 If I know who\u0027s using IndicatorLights in their mods, I can coordinate better.\u00A0 If I\u0027m considering making a change that might break folks, I can contact them to ask how they\u0027re using it, so as to better determine potential breakage.\u00A0 I can issue warnings in advance, before making the change, so that people have a chance to get prepared.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt also helps me gauge just how cautious I need to be, based on how heavily (or not) IndicatorLights is getting used.\u00A0 If I know that lots and lots of people are using it in their mods, then I\u0027ll know to devote a lot more caution to making potentially mod-breaking changes.\u00A0 Whereas if it turns out that nobody\u0027s using it at all, then I can just do whatever the heck I want.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSecond, at least during pre-release I would recommend that you take a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esoft dependency\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E via ModuleManager, rather than a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ehard dependency\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E with modules integrated directly into your parts.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIn other words:\u00A0 Design your parts so that they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ework\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E just fine without IndicatorLights, it\u0027s just that they happen to not have any indicator-light functionality on them without it.\u00A0 Then add some ModuleManager config to add in the IndicatorLight functionality, the same way that I\u0027ve modded the stock parts (here\u0027s an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSPSnark/IndicatorLights/blob/master/files/Parts/batteries/Z400Indicator.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eexample of how I modded a battery\u003C/a\u003E); the only difference is that your MM config will have a \u0022NEEDS[IndicatorLights]\u0022 in it so that it\u0027ll only apply when my mod is installed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPut another way:\u00A0 treat IndicatorLights as an optional \u0022patch\u0022 to your mod, and include the patch with your mod.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThat way, not only do your users have the option of playing without IndicatorLights if they don\u0027t want the extra dependency, but also, the worst possible scenario if I screw up and break something is that I simply break the lights on your parts, rather than breaking your mod\u0027s savegames or whatever.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope I\u0027ve addressed any potential concerns-- please let me know if you have
