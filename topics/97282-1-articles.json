As you know, you can only take one copy of each data inside a pod, meaning if you want to maximize collection, you\u0027ve got to land several pods... or just one lab. You can lift a lab, a probe core, and a few parachutes to orbit with a couple cheap SRBs and maybe a small liquid stage. I\u0027ve saved this as a craft called \u0022Lab Lander\u0022 and it only costs a few dozen thousand funds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tadswana","CreatedById":137657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T03:55:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting confused about how science is run now, once the experiment is done, do you have to EVA and manually retreive data and then store the data to get the full points?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t been doing the EVA really...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T08:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to manually move the experiment results from the instrument to the pod, or recover the instrument\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T17:12:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI pretty much always leave the lab in orbit. For example, I have a station at Minmus that contains a lab. The lander detaches, does science in a couple of biomes, then returns to the station for refuelling/experiment processing.
