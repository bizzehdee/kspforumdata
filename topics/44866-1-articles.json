One of these is Firespitter, the other is Hooligan\u0027s Submarines. Otherwise, you have to make your boat able to drive from the runway or Launchpad into the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from this, there are 4 ways I know of to make boats that move much at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Stock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want as little touching the water as possible. The best things to have in the water are structural panels cocked up at an angle at the end of vertical I-beams. Then you have a hydrofoil that can get up to very respectable speeds. It\u0027s a VERY good idea to make it 3-legged to prevent it from rolling over. I here there\u0027s another option that uses long I-beams for pontoons with the hull above but I\u0027ve never tried that myself. But either way, you can\u0027t turn if you\u0027re moving more than about 10m/s no matter how many control surfaces you stick in the air or in the water. In fact, you don\u0027t really turn at lower speeds, just rotate so you can go in another direction. All in all, not very satisfactory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Firespitter Mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides the \u0022spawn in water\u0022 part, this also comes with pontoons for seaplanes. But a seaplane without wings is a boat. The pontoons have rudders on them that somehow actually work when moving at speed, and can also be equipped with retractable, steerable, powered wheels to make a fully amphibious vehicle. The pontoons aren\u0027t too buoyant so they need to be pretty big to float anything, and they seem to fail at about 125m/s. Here\u0027s an example of such a boat powered by 2 jets from B9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oMyoPjr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oMyoPjr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one crossed the ocean heading 090 from KSC in 54 minutes at an average speed of 107m/s with enough fuel to return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. R3 Boat Parts Mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis allows you to build ENORMOUS aircraft carriers that move pretty well under their own power, plus are big enough to land airplanes one. And it also has parts to dock the planes, an arrestor system, and working flightdeck elevators. Besides this, it comes with a small motorboat hull but if you get this going too fast, it will shoot up about 3000m into the air so it\u0027s a good idea to equip it with a parachute so it doesn\u0027t splatter when it comes back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Hooligan Labs Submarines Mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotally redoes how \u0022water\u0022 works, allowing not only boats but submarines. Also allows Kerbals to sink and be able to walk on the bottom, and tweaks the camera so it works underwater, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T13:14:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dispatcher\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dispatcher\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve used the SPH for building.

Stock KSP water is very dense and dangerous. It will destroy your parts as if you are hitting it as hard as ground. That is, a part with impact tolerance 30 can survive hitting land or water at speeds up to 30 meters per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the Firespitter mod lets the pontoons hit the water at speeds up to 125 meters per second. My submarine mod changes the whole vessel. Any part can survive water impact at speeds up to 10 times ground impact tolerance. So the above example can enter the water at up to 300 meters per second.

But anyway, if you use the Firespitter pontoons, this might work. I\u0027ve come down from orbit to safe landings in the oceans of both Kerbin and Laythe so there is hope for your project. Just make sure you can slow down below the horizontal fail speed of the pontoons and your vertical speed is very low so your pontoons stay on the surface--otherwise parts of the main plane will break off. While Eve\u0027s dense atmosphere should solve both these speed problems (in fact, you\u0027ll probably have to work hard to get any speed at all there), I don\u0027t know if that molten metal might lower the fail speed of the pontoons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hooligan Labs\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hooligan Labs\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the Firespitter mod lets the pontoons hit the water at speeds up to 125 meters per second.
