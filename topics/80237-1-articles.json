I finished a work for a very good client of mine, and as a gesture of good will, he gave me a bottle of sake. This is in UK, and he got the bottle from his daughter who lives in Japan. I have gladly accepted the gift, but when I got home and had a good look at the bottle, I have realized that It had golden flakes floating in the sake!!.
