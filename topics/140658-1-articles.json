Speed is indicated\u00A0in a scale you\u0027re not used to, and wholly unrealistic. \u00A0We typically don\u0027t measure our forward (or vertical) velocity in m/s. \u00A0We measure them in knots and feet/second. \u00A0Most aircraft under 18,000\u0027 MSL operate at 250kts or less, even those sexy fighter planes and airliners. \u00A0That\u0027s a mere 128m/s. \u00A0The slowest useable approach speed for most aircraft in KSP, even propeller-driven light aircraft using firespitter and KAX is around 65m/s. \u00A0That\u0027s a blistering 126 knots, faster than the level cruise speed for most piston-driven light aircraft. \u00A0For contrast, the recommended approach speed of a Boeing 757 is 132 knots, which is only 68 m/s. \u00A0Keep that in mind next time you\u0027re trying to land a cessna mockup in KSP at 125 m/s. \u00A0Also, as a result of this, most KSP aircraft cruise at entirely absurd speeds. \u00A0A propeller-driven airplane cruising at 150m/s is blasting along at 291 knots, which would appear to be a blatant violation of FAR 91.117(a). \u00A0Except it\u0027s not, because\u00A0our altitude expectations are also wonky. \u00A0We\u0027re used to measuring altitude in feet, not meters. \u00A0The upper limit of most non-turbocharged piston aircraft is around 12,000\u0027 MSL, which is only 3,658 meters. \u00A010,000 meters is about 32,000 feet MSL. \u00A020,000 meters is pretty much in the stratosphere. \u00A0And\u00A0that\u0027s on Earth, Kerbin probably has smaller atmospheric layers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. There is zero turn coordination in KSP, unless you do it yourself (or use a mod). \u00A0When you bank a real airplane, centrifugal force will try to push the airplane to the outside of the turn unless you apply yaw correction in the direction of the turn. \u00A0The aircraft will still turn in the direction of the bank due to asymmetric lift, but the turn will be very inefficient, as you see in KSP. \u00A0A properly coordinated turn requires both rudder into the turn, as well as slight back pressure on the controls to keep the nose from dropping. In KSP, we tend to just bank the wings and hope for the best, whereas in properly controlled flight, a turn\u00A0requires adjustments along all three axis, and possibly power adjustments as well. Also, going back to point #1, because we\u0027re flying at 90% of ludicrous speed all the time, there\u0027s a fair amount of inertial coupling going on as well, so your control surfaces either have to be cartoonishly large or are ineffective outside of the small subsonic sweet spot that real aircraft operate in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T15:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\npls. let me add to jje64 (had a ppl myself over 10 years), that once an aircraft is trimmed to a certain speed it holds that speed. I\u0027m not talking about any sort of axis-stability or lability, which apparently is not modeled in ksp, just the power of the engine or the aoa. If trimmed, when you change engine power, a real aircraft sinks or climbs but it holds the speed. In ksp it changes the speed, the altitude stays the same. Furthermore, a real aircraft, once you change the trim (aoa), it changes the speed, higher aoa meaning lower airspeed. Well, if you pull it will certainly climb a bit but speed will drop, you\u0027ll have to pay that climb back after a few seconds. Or you change the engine power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the aircraft flies straight while kerbin is a ball. So after a while it \u0022climbs\u0022. Or Kerbin disappears. I find that weird too. Furthermore no, an aircraft has no sas.

The whole point of SAS is to keep the vehicle pointing the same way so, yes it WILL make turning hard(er). \u00A0Assuming you are using it for a bit of \u0027auto-trim\u0027 as above then before any deliberate manoeuvre you should turn it off, then back on again once you\u0027re back in straight (but not necessarily level) flight. \u00A0The full sequence for a turn to the right, for instance, is therefore: disengage SAS (T), roll right (E), co-ordinate with yaw-right (D) and keep the nose up by pulling the stick back (S), return to wings-level on the new heading and re-engage SAS (T).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow consider what will happen to a vehicle nicely-trimmed for straight and level flight when you disengage SAS (which is just trying for \u0027straight\u0027). \u00A0In theory - not much. \u00A0In practice - maintaining a fixed altitude a\u003Cstrong\u003Eround\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0the world is not \u003Cstrong\u003Estraight\u003C/strong\u003E. \u00A0Therefore the longer you\u0027ve been using SAS the higher and higher it has been pitching you - straight to Mun if you set it up right! - so when you disengage it and the vehicle settles back to its trim settings the nose is very likely to drop quite a bit and there are likely to be \u0027disturbances\u0027 along the other axis too. \u00A0So - if you want hands-off\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elevel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0flight you should disengage and re-engage SAS every now and again anyway (and adjust trim), just to reset it to current conditions. \u00A0This is also the RL case with any gyro-stabilised system (depending on how cleverly they are built).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLINKS! \u00A0A screenshot (F1) of a vehicle, preferably in the VAB/SPH with CoM and CoL displayed (buttons bottom-left of the screen when in those buildings) will usually tell the cognoscenti here enough to diagnose the more usual things. \u00A0Otherwise the craft file itself is just a text file stored in your KSP_win\\saves\\\u0026lt;save game name\u0026gt;\\ships\\SPH or \\VAB folder (If you\u0027re not on Windows change the \u0027KSP_win\u0027 as required). \u00A0It\u0027s called a craft file because it has the extension of \u0027.craft. so \u0022My Plane\u0022 will be stored as \u0022My Plane.craft\u0022. \u00A0In order to post either of those to the forums you will need to use a file-sharing web site such as imgur (for pictures) or dropbox (for any files). and post/embed the link here.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T17:33:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222605394\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140658\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464456251\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291917\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n31 minutes ago, KerikBalm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#1) You can design planesto land at far slower than 68 m/s...

SAS attempts to hold the craft in a particular orientation in space. That means that if you bank your aircraft, SAS \u003Cem\u003Efights the turn\u003C/em\u003E and puts you into a slip, the plane flying slightly sideways through the air. You have to wrench the plane around with manual control inputs to turn effectively when SAS is on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer to fly stable planes without SAS, and instead use trim, which is set by Alt\u002BWASDQE, or RShift\u002BWASDQE on Linux. This sets a constant control input, which you can see in the bottom left when SAS is off and you aren\u0027t making manual inputs. I use pitch trim to maintain level flight (or a climb or descent as desired). I hit Caps Lock to enable fine controls, the markers in the bottom left turn blue, which smooths out direct control inputs. I find many planes in KSP don\u0027t really need rudder input when banking, the turns are good enough anyway.

This will cause pitch down that is never completely corrected by SAS alone (SAS isn\u0027t sensitive enough, so all rounding errors are consistently on the \u0027not quite enough\u0027 side. Trim will help better but will require constant manual adjustment.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. the CoT/thrust vector is out of alignment with the CoM. This will also cause pitch down that gets worse the harder you\u0027re working the throttle, and if those engines are shut down it will cause pitch up due to asymmetrical drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. the Tail Fins you\u0027re using for control surfaces provide tremendous amounts of steering torque - really far too much for light aircraft (for this reason I never use them except when messing around). I would swap them for static tail wings and control surfaces like those you\u0027re using for ailerons (which will help with the CoL/CoM problem too).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. flying with SAS on will prevent your aircraft from sideslipping during a banking manoeuvre because the yaw input corrects it too effectively (see 3.). Turning it off will cause you to pitch down due to the reasons above. Trim would be better than SAS (but see 1).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Adjusting CoM/CoL/CoT issues is the best solution and would produce better aerodynamic stability all round.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. user controls aren\u0027t precise enough to maintain constant altitude at all, and since mass is always decreasing trim will also become inaccurate. RL aircraft have autopilots for this same reason.
