So far hundreds of designs have been patented which claim to achieve just this, although none of them have proven to provide any unidirectional force at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy design would involve using a flexible belt arranged around 2 narrow pulleys, (one pulley larger than the other) in a figure of 8 the pulleys are then rotated quickly. At the larger pulley, weights are attached to the outside of the belt in such a way that they would effectively \u0022miss\u0022 the smaller pulley as they rotate. All the weights maintain a constant orientation to the belt as they travel around at speed. As the weights go around the larger pulley they splay outwards and create a certain amount of centripetal force. As the same weights then proceed around the smaller pulley, they are compressed inwards closer to the center of the rotation and create slightly less centripetal force. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me (a mere layperson) logic dictates that the variations between the relative speed between the belt and the weights, ie the weights traveling faster than the belt on the large pulley, and slower than the belt on the small pulley, but the belt itself always remaining at a constant speed. A net force would be produced in the direction of the large pulley. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I want to know is whether this would be a feasible design or whether there is some obvious standout error in my logic?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T14:10:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, you can\u0027t impart momentum on an object without something pushing against the object other than itself, or having the object push something other than itself.
