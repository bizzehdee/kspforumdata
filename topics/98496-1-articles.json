I can picture things very clearly. So much so that its become a double edged sword. I can close my eyes and put myself into a seat on Columbia in its final second as it lost stability, rolled over and disintegrated around me. Scary stuff. Kinda stuff that gives you nightmares. I wasn\u0027t around for Challenger, but that one haunts me even greater. The fact that some 02 sensors were shown to have been switched on after the incident. The fact that some of the people survived the initial breakup...awful. Just awful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet the show must go on. And like they said with Apollo 1. If we were to stop these people would have died in vain. We have to continue doing this stuff. More people will die in the future with spaceflight. its gonna happen. But I suppose its progress.
