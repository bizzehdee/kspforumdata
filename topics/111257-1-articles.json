The reason it lifts is because of the force applied by the person or object supporting its weight in the first place. If you could do this, it would violate Newton\u0027s laws of motion."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:02:15Z","Content":"Gyroscopes may be magic, but Conservation Of Momentum have Total Magic Immunity."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T21:09:10Z","Content":"Just to try and clarify a little, forcing gyro to precess faster is like applying a torque to a regular rigid object.

That makes sense. So it\u0027s not actually moving in a straight line, and only rotates about a center point, which if inside a spacecraft would just make the craft rotate but not actually get anywhere. Ah well."}]}
