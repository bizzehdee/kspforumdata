According to Encyclopedia Astronautica, the Mercury-Redstone combination generally acheived an apogee of 220km and a downrange distance at splashdown of 380 km, with a speed at burnout of 6800 m/s. (The longest-range flight of it I can find is Grissom\u0027s MR-4, aka Liberty Bell 7, which hit 190.3 km apogee and 487 km downrange splashdown.) It gives a total thrust of 357kN and a launch mass of 28,400 kg, which equates to a TWR (and acceleration off the pad in Gs) of 1.32, pretty damned close to the FASA MR. (Note that going by typical scaling laws for Kerbin, those altitude and range performance figures would equate to typical numbers of 55km apoapsis and 95 km downrange and burnout speed of 1700 m/s, with Grissom\u0027s flight equating to 47,475 m apoapsis and 121.75 km downrange.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMercury orbital flights were flown on the much larger and heavier Atlas ICBM, which Frizz is going to develop in Stage 4 of the project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-13T14:36:47Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2013 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by rdfox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T14:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, if Redstone would be capable of making orbit, that\u0027d make it an SSTO.
