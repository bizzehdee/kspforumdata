That\u0027s good. Now I only have to bring back the can/pod to get full science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed that the one manned lander can or pod can only store one of each experiment. Shouldn\u0027t the pods that carry multiple Kerbals be able to store multiple copies of the same experiment? What is the point, science wise, to make a ship that carries more than one Kerbal in the same module?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed that if you perform the experiment on different locations/biomes, you can store multiple experiments of the same type. You pick up a surface sample and store. Move to a different location, get another one and store. That way you can have several experiments in the same can/pod. Is this intended behavior?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestions are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bigger cans/pods should be able to store more experiments that one manned ones. As it is now, there is no reason, science wise, to build a ship with a large can/pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Storing multiple experiments of the same type but from different locations seems to be a bug. It makes no sense that I can store two surface samples from different locations but not from the same location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Maybe the limit should be about data size or number of experiments, regardless of type.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
