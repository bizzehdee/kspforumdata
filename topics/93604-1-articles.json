It\u0027s ceramic tiling wasn\u0027t designed to cope with the heat of such a fast re-entry. Of course, if you have the delta V you can always bring it back into a nice stable LEO orbit before re-entry, but that\u0027s not the point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I actually wanted to say, was look up the \u003Cem\u003Eoriginal \u003C/em\u003ESTS plan, not the shuttle. Originally the shuttle was intended to be just a single part of a range of both vehicles and space bases. It was a very interesting proposal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you want a serious, realistic development of the apollo program, look at the Apollo Applications Program, not one of Von Braun\u0027s monstrous insanities. He was a visionary, and a genius, but that doesn\u0027t mean his idea\u0027s were feasible. Assume your budget doesn\u0027t drop. You have 4-4.5% of the US annual budget. AAP can be run under that with ease. Most Von Braun idea\u0027s would need significantly greater funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEqually, once you have Saturn V, there isn\u0027t really a need for Nova. One of the main reasons for rejecting Nova was the sheer quantities of propellants involved in building such a god awfully enormous rocket. A launch accident would wipe out not just whatever brand new launch complex they built for the rocket, but a decent chunk of the land around it as well. Saturn V can do serious on-orbit construction, it has a payload to LEO of 118 tons, there were proposals for mars ships smaller than that. Nova is, quite simply, unnecessary, and considered dangerous.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-19T08:02:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2014 08:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by HMS Sophia\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HMS Sophia","CreatedById":122688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T08:05:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Konstantine the Great\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Konstantine the Great\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom what I understand, Nova was to be used with the Direct Lunar Landing, or two Saturn IB\u0027s for Earth Orbit Rendezvous, or the Saturn C-8(later renamed Saturn V, the one we witnessed built) for Lunar Orbit Rendezvous.
