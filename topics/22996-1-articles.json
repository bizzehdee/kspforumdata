In hindsight the shuttle program didn\u0027t turn out to be such a good idea. Whatever it\u0027s achievement are it didn\u0027t achieve it\u0027s primary goal of cheap access to LEO. Instead it turned out to be one of the most expensive launchers on a kg to orbit basis. NASA is giving up spaceplanes to go back to Apollo style capsules with Orion. In the mean time Russia gave up on the Kliper (and Buran), ESA gave up on Hermes and China long ago gave up on their Tianjiao 1. The only serious work going on in space planes these days are USAF\u0027s X-37, Dream Chaser and Skylon.

For lifting big payload to orbit expandable rockets are the way to go. If you want to lift people up or bring them down capsules on top of expandable rockets are quite adequate.

It could be just my n00bness, but I simply couldn\u0027t get one into orbit until recently. Now I\u0027ve learned of the advantages of multiple air intakes and a single engine to prevent fatal spins when I run out of oxygen. I still cannot manage to make a SSTO spaceplane with the Mark 3 cockpit and fuselage. I personally enjoy capsules much more, with their Rube Goldburgian decouplers and staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, in theory a spaceplane would be perfect for servicing Earth/Kerbin orbit, as it could launch with cargo, drop it off, then return, preserving the launch vehicle itself. However, the shuttle required a complex booster system (and extremely dangerous in hindsight, as I\u0027ve found from modelling it in KSP), so it was pretty much half-rocket itself. Spaceplanes do provide great cross-range capabilities, which comes in handy if your landing site becomes suddenly unavailable due to weather. The Skylon spaceplane looks quite promising, with its dual-purpose engines.

If you can get your plane over the hump of around 40km altitude and still be going up then you\u0027re probably laughing all the way to orbit. Spaceplanes can have a larger proportion of their weight as cargo because they\u0027re getting lift from wings for a lot of the way up rather than the engines overcoming drag *and* providing lift - I have a 74t plane ( fully fuelled \u0026amp; otherwise empty ) which has so far lifted 25t to 100km orbit, I\u0027ve not got anywhere near that efficiency out of a rocket yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to mostly use mine for shuttling Kerbals around - having a couple of designs for anything up to 18 saves me messing around - and launch hardware on rockets still as my cargo spaceplane is rather limited physically.
