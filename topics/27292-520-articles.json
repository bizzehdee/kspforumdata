This created a new problem. The 2 mining vehicles, and mobile refiner are still on KSC grounds. Instead of driving them one at a time, Mission Control ordered a Crawler Transporter to carry them at once. All 69 tons of empty goodness.

Meantime, I can finally join y\u0027all in the fun of 0.90. So far that\u0027s involved a run around KSC in an hourglass (to unlock early science) and about a half-dozen parts testing missions. Making money in the new version has proven quite difficult but I do have Stayputniks and batteries unlocked at this point, so I\u0027m hopeful that I can finally complete a contract to test a Mk-55 engine in orbit.
