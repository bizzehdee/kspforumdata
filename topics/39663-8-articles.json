To do it they would have to have been much larger and that would defeat the object of my \u0027smaller\u0027 Saturn V Launch vehicle. You should see what Mulbin had to do to Munbug after adding Ibeam \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efairings. Its crazy!

Because I made a B9 Aerospace weight-accurate size-accurate shape-accurate thrust-accurate replica of the F-35A earlier today and I looked up the engine specs. It says 125 kN dry, 191 kN with afterburner engaged. Regardless, that is not two engines worth. (280 kN). The plane there appears to be about 7 tonnes, which is only 30% the weight of a real F-35A. An F-35A has a TWR of about 0.9 with the afterburner engaged. Your plane has a TWR if about 4.1.\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed this is a pretty common thing with replica jets, people make accurate-size engines instead of accurate-power ones, so they wind up with absurdly powerful planes. The B9 aerospace parts pack\u0027s Strugatsky is an 80-tonne transport with a grand total of ~1300 kN of thrust. That is 5 times what real airliner-like planes have for TWR. It has a better TWR than the F-35A for goodness sake!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat really illustrates this point well is looking at a typical modern 737. Over 20 tonnes of fuel, 10 tonnes of passengers, and 40 tonnes of plane are lifted into the air by just a bit over 20 tonnes of thrust. A TWR of about 0.3, not 1.6. The Concorde had a TWR of 0.373.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven the highest-performance real jet-engine planes have TWRs that hover around 1.0. Some might get to 1.3, but certainly nothing exists short of a cruise missile with anything beyond that.

If it had a 10-square meter front surface and a Cd of 0.2, it would be able to go around 447 m/s at sea level in FAR (calculated not tested, actual speed would probably be higher due to smaller frontal area.).

They could do it right every time. But a nuisance that made for eyesores was, they had to provide some sort of RCS control so the module could dock, and the RCS couldn\u0027t be anywhere on the craft, except around the CoM, to provide optimal control.They got around this by slapping parts on the tug to drag the CoM down to below tug level. Then late in the spring of star year 5034, General Jebediah Kerman ordered that in order to keep launch costs down, they couldn\u0027t drag down the CoM by slapping on useless parts on the tug until the CoM was below tug level. Because of this, the station constructions had to be halted for 5 years while the engineers wracked their brains, but none of the technique ideas floated around came to fruition. Then one day, a young engineer named Appledavidjeans Kerman invented what he called \u0022disposable RCS thrusters.\u0022 This was an ingenious idea, and the admin monkeys at Squad decided to award him a bunch of medals that were too long to read, and a lifetime salary boost so fat that he couldn\u0027t decide what to do with it except chuck it into his savings account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***NOTICE: Though I used mod parts as part of this demonstration, this can be done using stock parts on anything.
