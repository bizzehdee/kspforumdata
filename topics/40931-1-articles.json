Every superb NASA launch pad photo you can think of has an analogous one taken at night with those spectacular flood lights. Launching a mission in KSC at night ought to have the same thing. For that matter, I\u0027m sure spaceplane pilots would appreciate some runway lighting as well. I did a quick search for mods that might exist to add them but couldn\u0027t find to any. Anyone else feel that KSC lights would add to the game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nexustrimean","CreatedById":33308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T05:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts fairly simple to build your own mobile pad lights if you feel the launch pad is too dim.
