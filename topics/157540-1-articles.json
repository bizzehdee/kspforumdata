Some are just stock with Kerbal reusability legs or as much as the full SapceY set up. But every time I try to get MechJeb to do a powered landing it consistently overshoots the Pad at KSP by the same amount (talking like 20km, not sub 100m). It\u0027s almost as if it isn\u0027t factoring drag or something. I mean it shows how much drag etc, but I can\u0027t for the life of me work out why it is consistently over shooting....
