I can land on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus without any problem. I once managed to get a probe in orbit around Eve, but ran out of fuel before landing. My question is where do I start for interplanetary missions? With the new science updates, a mission that returns to Kerbin would be preferable, but anything would do.
