When its sitting on the launch pad, in space or on the way up, the pitch moves like its supposed to, the roll moves like its supposed to, but when I try to move the yaw, nothing happens to the ship. It just rotates like I am using roll. It used to work just fine, but now I can\u0027t get it to work and I can\u0027t find anything on google, or the forum to help.
