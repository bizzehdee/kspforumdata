Where can I find out how much Delta-V I would need these to have in order to go basically straight from a Mun orbit back to Kerbin. I don\u0027t need to orbit Kerbin, so the charts I found don\u0027t seem to apply. They all show Delta-V from orbit to orbit. I just need to get to where I can hit atmosphere of Kerbin and let natural decay take over at that.\n\nI can guesstimate, but since these are for \u0022emergency\u0022 purposes, I want to make sure I don\u0027t under-guess and strand my team.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T19:53:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mellojoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T18:29:37Z","Content":"Takes about ~250m/s dV to go from low mun orbit to suborbital kerbin in my experience.

If you\u0027re using something like this [http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png](http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png), you can see where you can aerobrake. In this particular case, you can see that it takes about 300 to go from low Munar orbit to a Kerbin-Mun transfer orbit, at which point you can aerobrake down to Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T19:54:00Z","Content":"Thanks, guys."},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T21:00:18Z","Content":"Can\u0027t give you numbers, but a great way to test it out is to send a rocket to the mun and circulize at the same altitude as your station will be, then just use a maneuver node to figure out how much dv will be needed. \n\nI believe any periapsis should start you decaying your orbit except for maybe one just below 70km that last for a second or two. Also depends how hardy your craft is and if it has airbrakes or if it is not very aerodynamic. I usually build my return vehicles pretty hardy with only a heat shield to guard from reentry heat and aim for a periapsis of 30km, but you could go for one at 50-60 if you\u0027re sending a pancake in and not have to make a billion orbits to return."},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T21:55:41Z","Content":"Bare command pods do just fine hitting 35 km.
