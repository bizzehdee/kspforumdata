Where can I find out how much Delta-V I would need these to have in order to go basically straight from a Mun orbit back to Kerbin. I don\u0027t need to orbit Kerbin, so the charts I found don\u0027t seem to apply. They all show Delta-V from orbit to orbit. I just need to get to where I can hit atmosphere of Kerbin and let natural decay take over at that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can guesstimate, but since these are for \u0022emergency\u0022 purposes, I want to make sure I don\u0027t under-guess and strand my team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T19:53:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mellojoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T18:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETakes about ~250m/s dV to go from low mun orbit to suborbital kerbin in my experience.

In this particular case, you can see that it takes about 300 to go from low Munar orbit to a Kerbin-Mun transfer orbit, at which point you can aerobrake down to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T19:54:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T21:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t give you numbers, but a great way to test it out is to send a rocket to the mun and circulize at the same altitude as your station will be, then just use a maneuver node to figure out how much dv will be needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe any periapsis should start you decaying your orbit except for maybe one just below 70km that last for a second or two. Also depends how hardy your craft is and if it has airbrakes or if it is not very aerodynamic. I usually build my return vehicles pretty hardy with only a heat shield to guard from reentry heat and aim for a periapsis of 30km, but you could go for one at 50-60 if you\u0027re sending a pancake in and not have to make a billion orbits to return.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T21:55:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBare command pods do just fine hitting 35 km.
