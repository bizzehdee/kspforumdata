This meant that, if a problem presented itself during launch, they could abort the mission. After picking up too much speed and getting too far away from the runway, the shuttle would no longer have enough delta-V to get back to the runway, and would be forced to continue the mission--that\u0027s the point of no return. After the point of no return, the shuttle still had the option of speeding up a little and landing at an airstrip in Europe, or otherwise getting into orbit and then deorbiting itself after going around the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can imagine, flipping the shuttle and burning back to the launch site is a mildly insane maneuver, so it was only reserved for very critical problems (and never ended up being used).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-25T20:09:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2013 08:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kimberly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T20:04:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell it could be a few things, but most likely it meant that during launch, the rocket passed a point where the crew could not fly back to the launch point if a failure occurred.
