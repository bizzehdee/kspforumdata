I already dwiddled with some add-ons and tried to change some part.cfg-files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to increase the ElectricCharge energy consumption rate for the scientific Enviro-sensors, but I absolutely don\u0027t know how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere I read that the sensors depletionrate is 0.075 but I can\u0027t find where to change that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy motivation was to increase the Importance of electricity since in spacetravel almost everything needs electricity. I also want all my antennas to use electricity when they\u0027re activated and thought that I could use the same techniques as with the sensors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope someone can help me or at least point in the right direction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d appreciate it and thank you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest regards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.: Please excuse my english. I\u0027m from Germany and english is not my native language. Thank you\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
