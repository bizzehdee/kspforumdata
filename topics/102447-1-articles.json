An excellent job by Frizzank, [who is showcasing the work here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113605-New-IVAs-for-1-0).\n\n 04:00\n\n\u0022It\u0027s been a couple hectic weeks at Squad. we\u0027ve been working hard on getting the update out. And although we\u0027ve been doing our best to listen to you guys, and to see where we can have a better release... Now, I know we talked about reducing the number of features in order to actually give proper time to bug fixing and all that, but I want you to know that none of the things that have been shared with you so far, as far as our dev blog goes, and any progress shots you have seen - none of them are even remotely at stake. We\u0027re talking about very small features that have been kind of just recently been added into the Plan... like, I am not 100% sure that we can put in the UI elements that we want to do for the Kerbal skills, so you can see delta-v for example, that kinda stuff... is, ah, we are currently considering it..., it\u0027s looking like... a no. \u0022\n\n 05:00\n\n\u0022A couple weeks ago I believe, I tweeted about having a crystalized release date... that looked like this is very much The One, and it\u0027s going to happen, and that\u0027s\n\n*IT*\n\n...\n\n[pause]\n\n**We listened to you guys, and decided to further extend our test cycle**\n\nto make sure that release date is...\n\n*Agh!*\n\nHere\u0027s the thing... it kinda sucks that I can\u0027t tell you WHEN it is gonna be... but, we are pushing the release date a little further back. Not like a \u0022full release\u0022 date back, but a\n\n*little*\n\nbit back. \u0022\n\n[based on hand gestures, lol... I think the unspoken intended release date was pushed out by some number of weeks, not months.]\n\n 06:10\n\n\u0022I totally adore and endorse\n\n**Kasper\u0027s early April 1st prank on the forum update**\n\n... OH MY GOD so many people got so upset. I personally thought it was SOO obvious no one would fall for it, but I \u0027m kinda amazed and disappointed at you guys. You actually believed we would do that to the forums?! Are you\n\n*HIGH?!*\n\n**No guys, we are certainly not doing that to the forums**\n\n, the premiums...\n\nHere\u0027s the thing, we kinda went, well, Kasper went through everything the KSP forums community dislikes about other communities that discuss KSP, and kinda condensed it together, so we had stuff like...\u0022\n\n[What\u0027s happening on screen interrupts that line of thought, Mun collision alert!

And hopefully it can be at least a good point to start a conversation, I think.\u0022\n\n 11:00 [twitch question: **Multiplayer** progress in 2015?]\n\n\u0022Well, ideally we want it to BE in 2015, but, its a\n\n*beast*\n\nof a task, we\u0027re still working on it, we have great progress, but nothing we can fully show yet.\u0022\n\n 11:30\n\n[ What\u0027s up with this satellite contract?

It\u0027s looking promising, but also... it kinda looks like every time... how to put it...\n\nlike, there\u0027s a lot that CAN happen with Unity 5, but the work we have shown [internally] so far, is that it can... just about IGNITE the computer it is running on.\u0022\n\n*[Think he is suggesting stuff like KSP getting bogged down, GPU/CPU overload.]*\n\n\u0022\n\n**We are absolutely committed to getting to Unity 5.**\n\nIt can\u0027t happen this release cycle ... the timeline simply doesn\u0027t pan out for the amount of work it has to be, the same goes for the 64-bit update [client] but yes, we absolutely want it in.\u0022\n\n 14:00 [ Shifting back to the game session, and lack of funds, Max brings up a new *Strategy* ]\n\n\u0022If this were 1.0, we could go back here to our strategies, and try the\n\n**new strategies**\n\nthat give you, ahh... not a GREAT deal, I\u0027ll be honest, they\u0027re not meant to replace the other ones, but, you can choose a strategy that will give you an economic return in any currency you want, immediately. That\u0027s what we are currently running in the [internal] builds. We\u0027re playtesting them to see how they work out. \u0022\n\n 15:00 [twitch question: **giving copies of 1.0 to reviewers?**]\n\nMax talked about getting a ton of feedback on the subject, still looking into it.\n\n 19:20 [twitch question: **rovers?**]\n\n\u0022There are plans to do something fun with rovers, they are kinda cool toys, and I think we can show something cool with them.\u0022\n\n[interpretation:\n\n*Eventually*\n\n. Nothing was shown today.]\n\n 19:30 [twitch question: can Max name three **bugs** that have been fixed by anyone?]\n\n\u0022I know Mu has touched about... something in the lines of, I think 12 to 15\n\n**memory leaks**\n\n... do those count?\u0022\n\n[Yay!]\n\n 20:30 [twitch question: where to host a Kerbal Kon?]\n\nNo matter where it is hosted, it will be far from someone. Maybe based on players choosing to say where they are, we could graph and average every player\u0027s location and come up with a good location, but I\u0027m going to guess it would be somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean... give or take. [so, what about the moon, that is far away FROM EVERYONE!] \u0022You are... full of wisdom ;)\u0022 [what about Australia] Max said that Australia is/was ranked number three in regards to sales, lots of KSP fans - but hasn\u0027t seen regional stats in a while, it could have moved.

I can\u0027t right now. I keep looking for UI elements that don\u0027t exist ;)\u0022\n\n 24:20 [Max can\u0027t stop smiling about this]\n\n\u0022Kasper has put me in a very awkward position.... where I have NO idea how to out-do that [forums prank] for [the real] April 1st... if we have TIME to do an April 1st kinda thing, \u0027cause all of our pipelines are super tight right now.\u0022\n\n 26:10 [twitch question: why the **resource map** view layout was changed from the original version?]\n\n\u0022The original version... I believe is one that NovaSilisko came up with, um, we thought was a cool version, like, its very, very much in-depth, but, its kinda\n\n*so*\n\nin-depth, that it stops being user friendly... it adds... our game..., if you want to say that our game suffers from something, and I\u0027m not going to say this is something people are going to agree with, but more from in the general game design stuff, .... it can be said to suffer from, it is from... incredible complexity. And, that resource system,\n\n*while solid*\n\n, it was also incredibly complex, to the point that it would have just made it... so that people who already having problems\n\n*playing*\n\nKSP, would have had just a litany of more problems.\u0022\n\n 27:10 [twitch question: **Science of the Spheres**, NovaSilisko\u0027s project?]\n\n\u0022I haven\u0027t had the time to test it, but, if he is half as dedicated as he was to KSP, that game is going to be\n\n*A Monster!*\n\n\u0022\n\n\u0022Nova is very talented, and I\u0027m certain ... once he gets that done... he will usher in a new era. Like... he has a bunch of great ideas, and I\u0027m certain Science of the Spheres, once he gets it completed to a state where he wants to show it to the world, the world will be richer for it.\u0022\n\n 30:50\n\n\u0022OH! There was a bug in animation, where Kerbals plant a flag, and it kinda goes through their helmet, and we fixed that little clipping thing.\u0022\n\n\u0022...a polish thing that definitely needed to be dealt with.\u0022\n\n 31:20 [twitch question: **new atmosphere?**]\n\n\u0022We are not in a position just yet to show you how it works out, but you are certainly going to get a lot more videos than usual on the new update.\u0022\n\n 32:10 [twitch question: Clippy Kerman?]\n\n\u0022We\u0027d absolutely LOVE a picture of Clippy Kerman ;)\u0022\n\n[That refers to the \u0022April Fool\u0027s day\u0022 forums prank.]\n\n 33:20 [twitch question: since there are more airplane parts, would you consider having **Firesplitter, like propeller engines stock, as well as more types of jet engines?**\u0022]\n\n\u0022We\u0027re not 100% sure on where... how we would add more stuff to the tech tree in at least 1.1 or 1.2, but its not outside of the realm of possibility. We\u0027re kind of giving a quick look at the tech tree this time around, nothing major, we\u0027re trying to make sure that it just makes a little more sense. ... We wrote a new tool, that lets you modify the tech tree on the client, and have different tech trees within different save files. People no longer have to break their game in order to modify the tech tree. \u0027cause that was kinda crazy.\u0022\n\n[Note: this was\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113382-Devnote-Tuesday-Experimenting-and-Researching\n[discussed at length in Devnote Tuesday here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113382-Devnote-Tuesday-Experimenting-and-Researching)\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113382-Devnote-Tuesday-Experimenting-and-Researching\n.
