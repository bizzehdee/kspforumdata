You pass through the intersection of these two planes twice an orbit. When you pass through the intersection, thrust perpendicular to the plane of your own orbit (i.e., thrust parallel to the surface and perpendicular to your velocity) and your orbital plane will start to rotate.

Seriously, I think going to the M\u00C3\u00BCn and back might require less fuel than a full 90 degree plane change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the quick and dirty of it is to burn at a right angle to you current orbit, example, if you are in a perfectly eastward orbit, you\\\u0027d burn north or sourth, and in a perfect polar orbit, east or west. This is called your orbit \u0027normal\u0027 and \u0027anti-normal\u0027, the normal being on the left of prograde and the anti-normal to the right. Exactly what normal you burn towards depends on which way you want to move the orbit, and this is made worse in that, as the orbit moves during the burn, so does the position of the normals, but we have exactly 0 normal markers on the navball (why Harv doesn\\\u0027t add them, I do not know), so once you start the burn, you\\\u0027re guessing until you re-check with the prograde or retrograde markers, which are the green circle and green X\\\u0027d out circle respectively on the navball, and move 90 degrees from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as to what will happen when you burn is pretty easy to visualize, as long as the orbit is roughly circular. Imagine the orbit as a ring, which isn\\\u0027t so hard because the map view displays it as such already. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow imagine that ring is mounted to an axle, such that the axle passes through the center of the ring like a pair of opposing spokes on a wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne end of the axle passes through your ship. The other end passes through the point on the exact opposite side of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow up and down are kind of relative terms in space but visualize that one side of the ring is \u0027up\u0027 and the other side \u0027down\u0027. And remember that all this time your ship is in orbit, the direction it is orbiting in is \u0027prograde\u0027 and the direction opposite its movement is \u0027retrograde\u0027 and so the imaginary spoke/axle is rotating like a wheel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you burn on the normal, the orbit will tilt on the axle such that the half the orbit that you are heading towards will move \u0027up\u0027 and the other half will move \u0027down\u0027. And vice verse on the anti-normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor low and therefore fast orbits, it might be more fuel-efficient to burn into a very elliptical orbit, do the plane change at the apoapsis, where orbital velocity is low, and then burn back into a circular orbit at the desired altitude. The same concepts apply, but are a little harder to visualize, and you must place your apoapsis at the correct spot for the desired plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-26T23:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the boards. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-27T01:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xivios\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xivios\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso once you start the burn, you\\\u0027re guessing until you re-check with the prograde or retrograde markers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s worth emphasizing that the normal moves during a plane change.

OK, you want to line up one orbit with another, put them both on the same plane right? There will be two points where the orbits cross. The altitude will be different, but they will cross. In fact the MunLander1 in you picture is pretty close to that point right now. That\\\u0027s a node. You want to burn at the node. To make it fuel efficient, make the node the apopsis of the elliptical orbit. Which means you\\\u0027ll want to burn prograde at the opposite node, which will move the periapsis to that node - where your ship currently is - and move the apoapsis to the opposite node. Then you\\\u0027ll want to burn at the correct normal at the first node - which is now your apoapsis. So, burn prograde at one node to create your elliptical orbit, burn normal/antinormal at the other node, which will be your apoapsis,to accomplish the plane change, then burn retrograde at the other node - the periapsis - to circularize the orbit again. At least that\\\u0027s the theory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
