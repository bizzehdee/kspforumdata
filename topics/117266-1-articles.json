Odds are that we would either find a planet with single-celled life or a civilization millions of years ahead of us.

The problem is that objects traveling at an appreciable fraction of light speed are never where you see them when you see them (i.e., light-speed lag). Relativistic rockets, if their owners turn out to be less than benevolent, are both totally unstoppable and totally destructive. A starship weighing in at 1,500 tons (approximately the weight of a fully fueled space shuttle sitting on the launchpad) impacting an earthlike planet at \u0022only\u0022 30 percent of lightspeed will release 1.5 million megatons of energy -- an explosive force equivalent to 150 times today\u0027s global nuclear arsenal...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not going to talk about ideas.

According to Powell, given the proper detecting devices, a Valkyrie engine burn could be seen out to a radius of several light-years and may draw us into a game we\u0027d rather not play, a game in which, if we appear to be even the vaguest threat to another civilization and if the resources are available to eliminate us, then it is logical to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game plan is, in its simplest terms, the relativistic inverse to the golden rule: \u0022Do unto the other fellow as he would do unto you and do it first.\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen we put our heads together and tried to list everything we could say with certainty about other civilizations, without having actually met them, all that we knew boiled down to three simple laws of alien behavior:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETHEIR SURVIVAL WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OUR SURVIVAL.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf an alien species has to choose between them and us, they won\u0027t choose us.

Consider several broadening ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, relativistic bombs are powerful because the antagonist has already invested huge energies in them that can be released quickly, and they\u0027re hard to hit. But they are costly investments and necessarily reduce other activities the species could explore. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDispersal of the species into many small, hard-to-see targets, such as asteroids, buried civilizations, cometary nuclei, various space habitats. These are hard to wipe out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait -- while relativistic bombs are readily visible to us in foresight, they hardly represent the end point in foreseeable technology. What will humans of, say, two centuries hence think of as the \u0022obvious\u0022 lethal effect? Five centuries? A hundred? Personally I\u0027d pick some rampaging self-reproducing thingy (mechanical or organic), then sneak it into all the biospheres I wanted to destroy. My point here is that no particular physical effect -- with its pluses, minuses, and trade-offs -- is likely to dominate the thinking of the galaxy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what might really aged civilizations do? Disperse, of course, and also not attack new arrivals in the galaxy, for fear that they might not get them all. Why? Because revenge is probably selected for in surviving species, and anybody truly looking out for long-term interests will not want to leave a youthful species with a grudge, sneaking around behind its back...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with most parts of points 2, 3, and 4. As for point 1, it is cheaper than you think. You mention self-replicating machines in point 3, and while it is true that relativistic rockets require planetary power supplies, it is also true that we can power the whole Earth with a field of solar cells adding up to barely more than 200-by-200 kilometers, drawn out into a narrow band around the Moon\u0027s equator. Self-replicating robots could accomplish this task with only the cost of developing the first twenty or thirty machines. And once we\u0027re powering the Earth practically free of charge, why not let the robots keep building panels on the Lunar far side? Add a few self-replicating linear accelerator-building factories, and plug the accelerators into the panels, and you could produce enough anti-hydrogen to launch a starship every year. But why stop at the Moon? Have you looked at Mercury lately? ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDr. Wells has obviously bought into the view of a friendly galaxy. This view is based upon the argument that unless we humans conquer our self-destructive warlike tendencies, we will wipe out our species and no longer be a threat to extrasolar civilizations. All well and good up to this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then these optimists make the jump: If we are wise enough to survive and not wipe ourselves out, we will be peaceful -- so peaceful that we will not wipe anybody else out, and as we are below on Earth, so other people will be above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a non sequitur, because there is no guarantee that one follows the other, and for a very important reason: \u0022They\u0022 are not part of our species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore we proceed any further, try the following thought experiment: watch the films Platoon and Aliens together and ask yourself if the plot lines don\u0027t quickly blur and become indistinguishable. You\u0027ll recall that in Vietnam, American troops were taught to regard the enemy as \u0022Charlie\u0022 or \u0022Gook,\u0022 dehumanizing words that made \u0022them\u0022 easier to kill. In like manner, the British, Spanish, and French conquests of the discovery period were made easier by declaring dark- or red- or yellow-skinned people as something less than human, as a godless, faceless \u0022them,\u0022 as literally another species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresumably there is some sort of inhibition against killing another member of our own species, because we have to work to overcome it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the rules do not apply to other species. Both humans and wolves lack inhibitions against killing chickens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumans kill other species all the time, even those with which we share the common bond of high intelligence. As you read this, hundreds of dolphins are being killed by tuna fishermen and drift netters. The killing goes on and on, and dolphins are not even a threat to us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs near as we can tell, there is no inhibition against killing another species simply because it displays a high intelligence. So, as much as we love him, Carl Sagan\u0027s theory that if a species makes it to the top and does not blow itself apart, then it will be nice to other intelligent species is probably wrong. Once you admit interstellar species will not necessarily be nice to one another simply by virtue of having survived, then you open up this whole nightmare of relativistic civilizations exterminating one another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an entirely new situation, emerging from the physical possibilities that will face any species that can overcome the natural interstellar quarantine of its solar system. The choices seem unforgiving, and the mind struggles to imagine circumstances under which an interstellar species might make contact without triggering the realization that it can\u0027t afford to be proven wrong in its fears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot that? We can\u0027t afford to wait to be proven wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey won\u0027t come to get our resources or our knowledge or our women or even because they\u0027re just mean and want power over us. They\u0027ll come to destroy us to insure their survival, even if we\u0027re no apparent threat, because species death is just too much to risk, however remote the risk...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most humbling feature of the relativistic bomb is that even if you happen to see it coming, its exact motion and position can never be determined; and given a technology even a hundred orders of magnitude above our own, you cannot hope to intercept one of these weapons. It often happens, in these discussions, that an expression from the old west arises: \u0022God made some men bigger and stronger than others, but Mr. Colt made all men equal.\u0022 Variations on Mr. Colt\u0027s weapon are still popular today, even in a society that possesses hydrogen bombs. Similarly, no matter how advanced civilizations grow, the relativistic bomb is not likely to go away...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe ask that you try just one more thought experiment. Imagine yourself taking a stroll through Manhattan, somewhere north of 68th street, deep inside Central Park, late at night. It would be nice to meet someone friendly, but you know that the park is dangerous at night. That\u0027s when the monsters come out. There\u0027s always a strong undercurrent of drug dealings, muggings, and occasional homicides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not easy to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. They dress alike, and the weapons are concealed. The only difference is intent, and you can\u0027t read minds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStay in the dark long enough and you may hear an occasional distance shriek or blunder across a body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you survive the night? The last thing you want to do is shout, \u0022I\u0027m here!\u0022 The next to last thing you want to do is reply to someone who shouts, \u0022I\u0027m a friend!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you would like to do is find a policeman, or get out of the park. But you don\u0027t want to make noise or move towards a light where you might be spotted, and it is difficult to find either a policeman or your way out without making yourself known. Your safest option is to hunker down and wait for daylight, then safely walk out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are, of course, a few obvious differences between Central Park and the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no policeman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no way out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the night never ends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T17:50:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Awaras\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T17:53:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest that we make first policy trying to kill it if it attacks us.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T18:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut dude, Stephen Hawking \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E an alien.

The problem I have with the media focus on Hawking is that yes, the man is smart; however, there are many theories out there that deserve equal attention if we are truly going to have an academic discussion on the possibility of intelligent alien life. I proposed the current topic as a means to generate such discussion here in this forum, where I believe it could truly be an interesting and challenging discussion...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. In the defense of humanity, most of our technological advancements happens in great spurts (for lack of a better term), the most recent being the miniaturization of technology we are currently witnessing and the increased micro-processing power of computers (we are nearing a stall point in computer technology according to some experts). These spurts are normally the outcropping of our volatile nature (even here in KSP, how long was it before the various armed mods began creeping into the game? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ). Even if we just take the American Civil War, there were great advancements made in medicine, weaponry (Gatling Gun, Dirigibles as combat vehicles, submarines, ironclads, brass cartridges, and the repeating rifle), photography, and transportation. I would suspect if we did come into contact with a superior species through radio communications (such as SETI), we would undoubtedly begin to contemplate newer technologies and tactics to neutralize any perceived threat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Not necessarily - one thing that the colonization of the New World has taught us is that genetics contains the key. There have been great strides in figuring out where various populations of peoples originated from based on the human genome. Now, I will admit I mainly threw out this point for the sole purpose of trying to generate discussion... but it does have some interesting ideas. What if xeno-human settlement occurred where a native humanoid species already existed and interbreeding occurred for a number of reasons (biological diversity for future generations to be able to survive within the biological conditions of the new home being one of these) as suggested in the SyFy Channel remake of \u003Cem\u003EBattlestar Galactica\u003C/em\u003E? Do not get me wrong, I am not saying the SyFy Channel is going to promote strong science (Sharknado, yeah, historical documentary on global climate change?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) however, the idea that a superior or advanced form of life would forsake technology as a means of ensuring survival is a common sci-fi theme for those, such as Issac Asimov, who saw the dangers of rampant technology usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I agree with you with the consideration of Darwinism into the alien life equation - but would throw out the possibility of a prey species forced to become technologically advanced. As is witnessed in Earth\u0027s biodiversity, there are creatures that have evolved defensive mechanisms (coloration, horns, chemical smells/poisons) to deter attacks by predators. Imagine if a planet had the development of a sentient organism that had been historically prey (I kind of think Kerbals here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E ). At some point, it would allow for the development of technology for a totally different purpose than for conquest (but would still be able to use such technology for an offensive purpose). One of the reasons I enjoyed Star Trek Voyager was because there were a few episodes that actually dealt with this sort of idea. Ideally, it would be one of these types of alien civilizations we would want to come into contact with...otherwise...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T18:41:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022adsii1970\u0022 data-cite=\u0022adsii1970\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA few days ago, while reading an article on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.space.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpace.com\u003C/a\u003E, there was an article about Dr. Stephen Hawking\u0027s latest statement regarding the possibility of alien life.
