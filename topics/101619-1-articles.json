I have things like B9 wing segments, but no fuel tanks or cargo bays.\n\nOr with the mk. IV mod. I have the mk. IV cockpit and cargo bays, but no mk. IV fuel tanks or cargo ramps.\n\nThe game is stable, it crashes very rarely but it does happen from time to time. I just want to get access to all the parts I have loaded so I can build heavy cargo planes.

If it is the 64bit ksp then just dump that and get the 32 bit version.\n\nCan you post your output\\_log? If you don\u0027t know where to get it [look here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29)\n\nDid you install everything properly? B9 requires the Firespitter plugin to switch parts up, should be included in the download.\n\nDo you know about the firespitter part switching? Pretty much all of B9s parts will be found under structural, place a part then right click it and it will let you switch between different fuel tank options and such from that one single part."},{"CreatedByName":"mckay221","CreatedById":119525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T17:44:01Z","Content":"Ok sorry about that, still new to the forum. I\u0027m on windows 8 (not 8.1, I mean 8) Its the current version of KSP, and yes it is the x64 version. I am fairly certain that firespitter is installed correctly but to be honest I\u0027m not sure.

They\u0027re not showing up because they share textures and the parts that are missing are being told their texture should be at X when it actually is at XX etc. There should be no KSP\\Gamedata\\Gamedata\\B9\\_Aerospace or whatever.. could you post a screenshot of your Gamedata folder please?"}]}
