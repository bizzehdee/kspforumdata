Once kerbals have been properly integrated in the game (like with mission stats and skills that matter) it might be nice to be able to give them medals though, so you still get a reward for them doing awesome stuff in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on 3... aren\u0027t you talking about Jeb?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a nice day!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T21:24:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see a few problems with this.
