It would be kind of weird to have yellow light coming from a blue star.\n\nThanks dude, the stars won\u0027t be implemented until after kopernicus 0.0.7, so it\u0027s still on the stock system for now. The color of light emitted will be modifiable, so blue stars can have blue light and red stars can have red light, even IVA views get the color changes! see here for a little peek (very rough early version); [http://i.imgur.com/xn5yTZH.png](http://i.imgur.com/xn5yTZH.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T12:36:49Z","Content":"Update 1.5 is now live!\n\nAlthough no new stars yet, this update patches ALOT of annoying things i always forgot to fix.\n\nChangelog;\n\n- Increased surface colormap resolution for most bodies\n- Fixed pressure \u0026 temperature curves to replicate stock atmospheres\n- Tweaked many textures and normals\n- Moved CRP resources to separate install to avoid problems\n- Included CRP in download to prevent \u0027M700\u0027 bug\n- Tweaked Planetshine configs to reflect atmospheres properly\n- Fixed Ernus being too close to the Sun to reach\n- Greatly reduced \u0027lines\u0027 on Derso\u0027s terrain\n- Fixed Ete having parts of surface underground\n- Fixed Etal\u0027s height causing ships to be flung off the surface\n\n- **Arin Tweaks**  \n\n    - -Fixed Terrain brightness at midday\n    - -Increased Atmosphere height to 52km\n    - -increased ASL pressure to 0.35\n\n    [\\*]**Serran Tweaks**\n\n    - -Fixed Terrain brightness at midday\n    - -Increased Atmosphere height to 61km\n    - -Increased ASL pressure to 0.45\n    - -Flattened terrain to give rolling hills instead of high peaks everywhere\n\n    [\\*]**Lave tweaks**\n\n    - -Increased Atmosphere height to 38km\n    - -Increased ASL pressure to 0.15\n    - -Reduced terrain \u0027lines\u0027 greatly, terrain is a lot flatter now\n\n    [\\*]**Leouch Tweaks**\n\n    - -Lowered Leouch\u0027s pressure to 21atm\n    - -Increased atmosphere height to 85km\n\n    [\\*]**Titanus Tweaks**\n\n    - -Fixed Terrain brightness at midday\n    - -Fixed horizon color being too bright"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerolfos","CreatedById":93635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T13:43:36Z","Content":"The new Sun: Other, in the comments, a black hole!
