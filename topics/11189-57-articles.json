Welcome back to the guest list aka roll of honour\n\nDrMoo the K-Prize committee extends its deepest sympathies to the family of Camlin Kerman and all survivors of the ill fated Minmus mission which saw Camlin\u0027s rocket bike lose control over Minmus\u0027 unforgiving surface and crash with a full tank of fuel due the loss of electrical power to the capsule reaction wheels. Though it cast a long shadow over the proceedings, the accident did not disqualify the mission which continued to successfully achieve the highly prestigious Astrokerbal and Utilitarial Distinctions for delivering a payload to the surface of Minmus and an Advanced Pilot Precision Award for returning, albeit missing a crew member, with Condor EX-VIII Experimental SSTO. RIP Camlin we will not forget you. Welcome to the K-Prize guest list and roll of honour (at last) and let me know if you would like your gatecrasher entry removed as is your right now you have completed the mission successfully, should you wish it."},{"CreatedByName":"Dr.Moo","CreatedById":101899,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T22:55:33Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think that I want to remove that yet for I have (an admittedly shaky) idea on how to conform to the rules using a craft intended for vertical take-off, and I want to remove myself from the gatecrashers list when I have made such a craft. Thank you for your condolences with Camlin Kerman, may he rest in the icy Minmus soil.

Phendrana 6-D, a modified version of a stock parts SSTO I posted in the showcase thread, piloted by Kenster Kerman. Now capable of lifting loads into orbit. \n\nStats:\n\n- 124.76 ton (no cargo).\n\n- 453 parts (no cargo). \n\n- 11 RAPIERS, 2 LV-N.\n\nAble to haul a 36 ton orange tank to LKO (72x92). \n\nI had about 1000 units of oxidizer left, but only 56 units of fuel, so it can still be optimized, as the initial climb was excruciatingly slow (maxed out pitch \u002B rcs).\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It weighs in at 30.13 tonnes and is designed it to carry up a FL-T200 sized module up into orbit around either of Kerbins moons. In this case I dropped off a small satellite around the Mun for science or communications or something.But more importantly it can bring a tub of snacks to a space station. The take off went very smooth but I can\u0027t seem to get action groups to work any more so I had to cut all power to engines while I killed the outer 2 turbo jets to rely entirely on the RAPIERS. This made the ascent pretty inefficient because I dropped from 1500 m/s to 1300 in the time it took to do that. Once I ran out of air it went easily to LKO and then to the Mun and circularized the orbit. I dropped off the mini satellite \n\nThe real problems came at landing. For some reason the landing gear decided to splay out like crazy no matter how slowly I touched down. I was touching down with less than a meter a second of vertical velocity and the landing gear kept flexing in and out and this would cause the craft to veer left or right on landing. The weird thing is that I tried landing it with the payload with full fuel and it didn\u0027t splay out at all. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nOn the second try they both flexed out so I could control the landing. I put on the brakes pretty hard to stop and then it decided to do a wheelie ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif). \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
