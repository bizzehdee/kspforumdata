My plan if I set up a moon base is to do all my refueling at the moon, since I don\u0027t want to do a ton of aerobraking. My question is if it\u0027s worth it to aerobrake every time you have a fuel delivery from minmus or to refuel at the moon. (refueling at minmus is not an option due to its very long orbital period and inclination.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T01:06:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by peachoftree**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T21:31:02Z","Content":"I think minmus is waaaaay better. Think of it this way, orbital velocity around the mun at low alt is ~570 m/s if I remember correctly and around minmus it\u0027s only ~160 m/s or so. That means more fuel into orbit. Also lower gravity means less gravity losses, and you don\u0027t need as much engine mass on minmus due to the low gravity. Insertion into munar orbit can be rather expensive in terms of dV due to the high orbital velocity. Also, when departing from minmus you don\u0027t need much dV to leave kerbins SOI as you are already close to the edge.\n\nHowever inclination is a problem as you say. To circumvent that I would reccommend a reasonably large (huge if you dare landing it) fuel lifter and a LV-N powered fuel tug in low minmus orbit. Refill the tug and leave minmus, refuel a massive fuel depot placed at the same orbital altitude as minmus with out the inclination. That way you can have a lot of fuel in high kerbin orbit without the added inclination.\n\nI had a discussion about something similar a while back on these forums and while departing from LKO is cheaper in terms of dV (due to the oberth effect) you will actually have more fuel once you have reached escape velocity if you refuel very high up in kerbins SOI since it costs almost nothing to reach escape velocity from there\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T21:34:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T21:40:52Z","Content":"Neither is really truly worthwhile: launching extra fuel from Kerbin is easy and totally affordable (unless you\u0027re playing on special difficulty). \n\nBut if you want to do it, Minmus is preferable. Most launch windows are weeks or months apart; just get your tanker to Minmus ASAP and return it to LKO at the first opportunity, then let it sit there until it\u0027s needed. Every 30 days or so, there will be a launch window where you can return without plane change. Or just suck it up; we\u0027re only talking about something like 50m/s anyway.\n\nAlternatively, you can launch your interplanetary mission right from the Mun. In that case, fuel from the Mun may be cheaper overall. Requires some maneuver-fu and a mod like precise node for sanity\u0027s sake.

I took part in quite a lengthy discussion on the topic of oberth effect and the most efficient way to leave kerbin and the consensus was, if you are not refuelling try avoid circularizing and instead go straight for an ejection. That is the most dV efficient way. However the way to leave with absolute maximum dV left would be to have a fuel depot right on the edge of kerbins SOI. Then fly up, refuel and do maybe a 15m/s burn to eject yourself into solar SOI. That way you have mor dV in solar orbit. Ejection angles aren\u0027t hard if the orbital period is longer. you just have to plan things a little more carefully since the most important factor for an efficient transfer is not hte time of departure but the angle.

Its far simpler and more time efficent to build a fuel launcher with a recoverable booster if you want a LKO depot.\n\nAs for minmus itself I often have a fuel base on the planet and a depot in orbit. I send interplanetary ships up to minmus to refuel befor being sent out. it only takes a couple hundred m/s to escape minmus for a low flyby of kerbin to get an oberth assisted boost out to your destination. most launch windows have enough leway in them that you can still hit the target easy enough a week on either side of them. If you leave minmus when its in the right position a week or two either before or after the launch window you\u0027ve already got the 900 dv or so worth of orbital energy already that you dont have to spend agian. minmus\u0027s inclination has a relitively minor effect on your transfer orbit to another planet.

Like a week off is fine as long as you adjust the ejection burn to interplanetary space accordingly. Also, if you first place one node to lower your PE to ~80km (should cost no more than ~200 m/s) and then do your ejection burn at the lowest point you will get a massive boost from the oberth effect because you have a really damn high AP and the lowest possible PE meaning you should be going some 3000m/s at PE.
