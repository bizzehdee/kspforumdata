I\u0027ve started the career mode and at this point I have several missions in which I have to take some equipment into a scape trajectory.

A fast calculatino gives me an escape velocity of v = sqrt(GM/r) = 3430 m/s. I could just design a rocket with such deltaV (with margin for drag and gravity) and that would be it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould the cost of the mission be higher than the rewards?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould I just add a Solid Booster as last stage, so I can reverse the trajectory and end up again landing on Kerbin? Is this feasible? Mainly because I don\u0027t want to lose a pilot with a mission like this and also because I still don\u0027t have the expertise to perform a rescue mission at this stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-12T18:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, rpedrosb!

I hope you don\u0027t mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your question: I think all of your ideas will work, but remember that you don\u0027t have to use a pilot at all.

That kind of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E takes quite a bit of mass, and launching such an upper stage to an escape trajectory would be very expensive early in the game. As Deddly said, a probe core is the correct answer. It makes your rocket into a robot. The probe core probably needs an antenna and some solar panels,\u00A0 so that it has a long life -- and can send back science reports from beyond Kerbin, for science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-12T21:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually an escape trajectory can be gotten and escaped from with scant little fuel expenditure.
