So if one single part in the center gets destroyed your craft will fracture into many small-ish pieces, even without destroying any more parts.(*) And all the forces of holding the lower stage in the air are going through this one single piece. I don\u0027t know how KSP models this kind of problem, but in one of my Eve crafts (it\u0027s always Eve, isn\u0027t it) I also had all the parachutes on the top, and all the rest of the craft hanging from one part (a mk1 capsule, the root part). During descend this part tended to spontaneously disintegrate (I think when the chutes went from partly deployed to fully deployed, but I don\u0027t really remember anymore). My solution was to spread out the parachutes over more than one part, so that not all the forces go through one single part. You could try with struts between the lower stage and the upper stage parts with the parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(*) See: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/187189-eve-%E2%88%9E-hard/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3668785\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis report\u003C/a\u003E for a somewhat role-played description of a similar event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-20T20:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say there is just too much mass hanging off a few decouplers.
