You can use Imgar to host the images.

Upon removal of those and the no longer needed SAS under the command capsule, those rockets made stable flight. Solar panels were then added to provide power during orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RFK128","CreatedById":26685,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T07:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bZ85UvC.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022bZ85UvC.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not really interested in troubleshooting this particular ship, as its been happening to ALOT of my craft that are heavy.

If you try to turn too quickly the drag on the front of the rocket (from going upwards so fast) can cause the rocket to flip out. This is better simulated in FAR but I\u0027ve had it happen with stock aerodynamics as well. The solution is to try turning sooner and slower -- gradually turning till you are at about 45 degrees at ~12km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T08:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure, but you might be getting them too fast. 4 mainsails seems like an awful lot of power for what they are carrying. Late in that stage, the orange tanks will be depleted, leaving very little too lift and most of it far on top of the rocket. My suggestion for the rocket displayed above would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Try something less powerful than the mainsails - augment with SRBs for lift-off if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Try to lower that central coloumn so that it sits right between the boosters. Use seperators on the later, if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T08:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd your ship is top-heavy, with those fuel tanks way above Center of Mass.
