I don\u0027t know why the one radial drains first though... its as if there is a fuel line going from it to the core rather than the other way around, but I can\u0027t find such a fuel line on the craft or in the file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the core fuel will be enough to achieve orbit when its fully loaded... so... in flight fuel transfers with this buggy craft... yay\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
