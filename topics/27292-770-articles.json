This second mission was designed to be longer, with real time spent on the Mun\u0027s surface, including a rover to be assembled on the surface for a wider exploration radius. The launch system was refitted to take the heavier load, and the launch went smoothly. Lunar orbital insertion occurred with a polar orbit. The target area for landing was at the northern end of a ravine that lead to the far side crater. Our engineer, a newbie, and a rescued scientist boarded the LEM and decoupled from the CM, leaving Val all alone. Using the computer guided landing system, the LEM desended gracefully towards the surface. At around 1000 m, something was noticed to be vary wrong. What was originally thought to be a flat plains area was a small crater with very steep walls, and the computer was taking the LEM right for the cliff face. Acting fast, the engineer disengaged the guided landing system and switched to manual controls. Unfortunately there was no stability assist, so a light tap on the RCS thrusters sent the lander spinning wildly out of control. The choice was made to about the landing and return to the CM. The rover containers were jettisoned, and the launch boosters were fired. The lander flew up in an erratic fashion as the inexperienced engineer tried to maintain control, all the while the scientist was in the corner shouting \u0022NOT AGAIN! NOT AGAIN!\u0022 The brave engineer nearly gained control of the craft, but has a nervous tic that caused him to spin the LEM on it\u0027s axis. At around that time the main engine was out of fuel. Only RSC thrusters where working. Unfortunately for the brave Kerbals, they weren\u0027t enough to stop the LEM from crashing down hard, destroying all the scientific equipment, the power packs, and the emergency life support systems. The Kerbanauts survived..... at least until the electricity ran out. The last words heard from the surface of the Mun was \u0022I picked a hell of a day to look at the Mun.\u0022 That\u0027s when the simulation reset itself back on the launch pad, as the crew of the Pioneer 2 prepared for lift off.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.....this is the twilight zone....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T08:34:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Endersmens\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Endersmens\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBroke the game for the first time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/0VzKT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/0VzKT\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Mind = \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66465-Work-in-Progress-WIP-Design-Thread?p=2237703\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2237703\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eblown\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Belphegor","CreatedById":118918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T08:44:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust some small stuff that had to be done.. first a few contracts for cash, saved a few kerbals from orbit and brought 2 scientists back home after 7 years on minmus. i also flipped my duna rover upside down just before reaching it\u0027s 3rd biome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T10:55:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELanded safely a bunch of noobs with a shuttle.

I was way too deep into Jools and too low energy. And every encounter I could find with Laythe either threw Kronos_A out of the solar system or (most of the time) smacked it straight into Jools. We burned precious propellant, again and again, to escape disastrous encounters. As the days and orbits around Jools counted up, the frustration, stress and despair mounted. I think it was day 127 or so, around Jools, that Bob started to talk very sarcastically and harshly about mission control. But there was really nothing else to do but keep searching for some positive encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, at about this point the newbie gals at Duna called home and explained that they wanted to stay another year.

And all three loved long walks in the Duna highlands. Normally, I\u0027d told them to get their asses into the rocket, but this time it was a relief. Fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, on day 140 or so, orbiting Jools, we encountered a sling that lifted us up into a considerably better orbit. Joy and celebrations.
