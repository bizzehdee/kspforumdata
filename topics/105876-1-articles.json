B-52A Stratofortress [With two Hound Dog cruise missiles]","CreatedByName":"andrew123","CreatedById":46719,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T03:02:41Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"andrew123","CreatedById":46719,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T03:02:41Z","Content":"![XaGk0N5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XaGk0N5.jpg)\n\nAfter the rather terrible performance of the P-8 Poseidon, I decided to do a replica of the 8 engine B-52A Stratofortress, with extremely good performance compared to the Poseidon. It cruises at 300 m/s and can carry a monstrous combat load, both internally within the large bomb bay and externally on the wings.\n\nIt carries about 22,000 units of fuel internally, and has the ability to carry more.\n\nAfter launching the cruise missiles, you must right click the probe core and set to control here to correct the orientation. The cruise missiles are meant to be launched with the B-52 at cruising speed, and do not make erratic maneuvers with the AGM-28 Hound Dog.\n\nAfter having read the instructions posted here, you\u0027re ready to fly this baby: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/2mjx1z7jgje583i/B-52A-1.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2mjx1z7jgje583i/B-52A-1.craft?dl=0)\n\n![NJ7fVnu.png](http://i.imgur.com/NJ7fVnu.png)\n\n![2l9Rv3x.png](http://i.imgur.com/2l9Rv3x.png)\n\n![GSufE2P.png](http://i.imgur.com/GSufE2P.png)\n\n![VPwHq2t.png](http://i.imgur.com/VPwHq2t.png)\n\n![Gqr6Qnw.png](http://i.imgur.com/Gqr6Qnw.png)\n\n![ITLUo2c.png](http://i.imgur.com/ITLUo2c.png)\n\n![sQxpyx5.png](http://i.imgur.com/sQxpyx5.png)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ly8_wwGuU2Q?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUEINQCKLHc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUEINQCKLHc)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T03:09:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by andrew123**"},{"CreatedByName":"War Eagle 1","CreatedById":67109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T04:36:23Z","Content":"Need an escort?\n\n![4n3RLtI.png](http://i.imgur.com/4n3RLtI.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T18:46:46Z","Content":"It needs an F-16. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T18:49:43Z","Content":"Awesome!

Second would be the wings, to me it just doesnt look right when its sitting on the runway with the wings straight out like that they should be swooping down with the tips almost touching the ground, and finally the landing gear might be a limitation of the game but it sems to sit very high, sorry for nitpicking, but when you see these things everyday characteristics rub off on ya"}]}
