I got the first piece into a nice orbit by just launching it like most people do. I decided to do something a bit more exciting and harder and try to make a space shuttle where I could put parts of my station into, launch into space attached to rockets/boosters and glide it back down to earth and land it. I have designed a prototype of my spaceplane going with a similar design in a youtube video I saw. I cannot seem to maintain control of it though as it likes to turn on the runway or spin out of control mid-air. Was wondering if you guys had any tips/tricks and saw any flaws in my design and could help me out. I am just testing it out at the spaceplane hanger currently and plan to launch it vertically like a shuttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T21:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith an MK1 cockpit, you a probably doomed on reentry.

I also do have solar panels they are just packed inside for when we get into space to get a bit of power while unloading and the batteries are in there also, as seen in the new pics I am posting. It still likes to flip out of control but it is a bit more stable now. Still wondering what I am doing wrong, I have a feeling it might have to do with the wings, maybe I have to make my own?
