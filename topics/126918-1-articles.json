If your rocket is reasonably shaped - i.e. it has a pod with a parachute on top, as opposed to a lander can with a flat uncovered end - then you need TWRs in excess of maybe 4 to have a chance to keep up with it, and you\u0027ll hit orbital velocity while still in the lower half of the atmosphere. After all, terminal velocity approaches infinite (not orbital velocity) as atmospheric density approaches zero, and atmospheric density drops exponentially with altitude. As such, you can pretty much forget about terminal velocity altogether. You will never hit it unless you overengineer to absurd levels. (Which some people do, but hey, they have fun with it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, as you can imagine from the description above, if you are approaching terminal velocity during ascent, you\u0027re going to have much more serious problems than the risk of wasting one or two m/s of dV. Namely, you\u0027re probably going to overheat whatever part acts as your nosecone, unless you took special precautions. Now \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E is a valid reason for throttling down during ascent. You want to keep your structural integrity after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe dV cost of reaching orbit breaks itself down thus, very over-the-thumb, for a typical and suitably pointy rocket:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 70% goes to accelerating to orbital velocity\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 22% goes to gravity losses\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 7% goes to aerodynamic losses\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 1% goes to steering losses (when your engines gimbal away from thrusting straight forward in order to steer)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis vey much illustrates the fallacy of trying to throttle down to reduce aerodynamic losses. Not only are they an incredibly minor position in the first place, which makes almost no difference either way; but you are also increasing gravity losses by accelerating more slowly - and gravity losses eat a far larger share of the dV pie. That means as you throttle down, you lose far more to gravity than you gain from aerodynamics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is that so? Because gravity is negative acceleration. Every second you spend thrusting straight upwards, gravity gobbles up 10 m/s\u00B2 of your engine output. If you want to accelerate at a steady pace of 2G, then your engines have to put out 3G worth of acceleration - and 33% of the fuel you expend is just plain wasted. Now imagine you want to reduce drag losses, and you throttle down so that you are only accelerating at 1G, not 2. Now your engines have to put out 2G of acceleration, and 50% of the fuel they consume is wasted to gravity. You could continue this game of throttling down all the way to a standstill in the air: now the engines have to put out 1G, and 100% of the fuel spent is wasted to gravity. This is why I often refer to this as the \u0022hovering component\u0022, or \u0022maintaining the status quo\u0022. You don\u0027t want to hover or maintain the status quo. You want to \u003Cem\u003Echange\u003C/em\u003E your velocity and altitude! So kick that pedal to the metal and go full burn to space!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow of course this applies to flying straight up. The more you turn over towards the horizon, the lower the percentage of thrust gets that must be expended to maintain the status quo. So throttling down hurts less and less as you approach being horizontal. And when you do burn horizontal, there is no gravity component at all - 100% of your fuel goes towards changing your forward velocity. This is why upper stages get away with very low TWRs for orbital insertion: it simply stops mattering at that point. However, at the same time, aerodynamic losses have also long since ceased to matter by the time you are fully horizontal. So there\u0027s nothing to save here by going slowly either. The only reason you bring a small engine here is because it saves weight, not because going slow is a good idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helped you! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T13:35:39Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 01:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T19:42:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222306217\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126918\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449156683\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022143148\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cephalo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/12/2015 16:31:23, cephalo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can probably get into orbit without a mod with much trial and error, but if you don\u0027t know your dv, failures will become intolerable.

Not only are they an incredibly minor position in the first place, which makes almost no difference either way; but you are also increasing gravity losses by accelerating more slowly - and gravity losses eat a far larger share of the dV pie. That means as you throttle down, you lose far more to gravity than you gain from aerodynamics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile everything Streetwind said is absolutely true, it doesn\u0027t necessarily help for the demo, since you have no gimbal-able engine and no decent automatic pod.

Just accelerate fast to 100m/s then go third throttle to get to about 200m/s at 10km. Turn a tiny amount when you leave the pad then just stay centred on prograde until you can start turning more at around 14-18km. When you can turn significantly without flipping, then you can raise throttle to 100% and watch your Ap. Shut off engines at 71km, then circularise at Ap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut of course, if you DO have the fins available, and can build more than 30 parts, add four to the bottom of each of the vertical stages and go faster.
