Two were to carry out science near the poles (one pole for each contract) and another was to establish a surface base on wheels. The plan, therefore, would be to land a mobile base that would circumnavigate the planet and gather all the science on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we see the \u003Cem\u003EMagellan\u003C/em\u003E base- named after Magellan Kerman, who historically first sailed around Kerbin a long time ago.

They have been named after Amundsen Kerman and Scott Kerman- the famous explorers of Kerbin\u0027s poles. They will also be retained in orbit of Duna when the mission is complete. Between the lander stack and the launch vehicle is a docking port adapter, which will no doubt come in handy at the space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XljzN3W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XljzN3W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, this crew capsule will serve as additional accomodation during the mission, and will also be the crew\u0027s return vehicle.

The tug itself has a large docking port at the front, plus a medium-sized one at the rear (currently hiding under the tank.) The first task was to drop off the extras on the front of the crew return/tanker modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c2Hqakm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c2Hqakm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, the payload\u0027s own booster stage was dispatched on its way back to Kerba firma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MrNhtWx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MrNhtWx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tug was then undocked from the payload, leaving the science and adapter behind.

There will need to be at least one scientist to allow the experiments to be reset in the lab modules, and at least one engineer to repack the landers\u0027 parachutes. Dedicated pilots aren\u0027t technically required since the landers and tugs all have the advanced probe cores. However, I think it\u0027s always good to have pilots available. Most of my experienced crews are currently busy at either Minmus or the Mun, so will need retrieving and returning to Kerbin before they can be sent to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T17:41:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlyingPete\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
