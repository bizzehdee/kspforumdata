Could we get a specialized engine rotator with offset attach point, at the moment it\u0027s quite hard to make one. The picture will probably explain better than I can with words, a single piece that achieves what that little contraption does, would surface attach at the rotator and a 1.25m and 0.625m high variant would accommodate quite a few engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f70Wvh7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f70Wvh7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T03:32:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToo bad KSP\u0027s limitation of not allowing loops of nodes prevents using this to make a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/search?q=saurrus\u002Blinkage\u0026amp;ie=utf-8\u0026amp;oe=utf-8\u0026amp;aq=t\u0026amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official\u0026amp;client=firefox-a\u0026amp;channel=sb#channel=sb\u0026amp;q=sarrus\u002Blinkage\u0026amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official\u0026amp;safe=off\u0026amp;spell=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESarrus Linkage.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELate part suggestion.
