It would be a birds eye view of the past, no? - nzuri bwana; I know it sound crazy, but hey!

However, it\u0027s not a \u0022time machine\u0022 in any sense, i.e. it cannot actually travel through time.

But I gather that, life in general or life that was only about as advanced as us, could readily go undetected even if it were within a \u0027fairly\u0027 short distance of the Sol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have to put into perspective that \u0022fairly short\u0022 means, much farther away that we will likely ever visit (or at least until we have space programs that are many orders of magnitude more progressed than at present). The nearest star system to Earth are Proxima and Alpha centauri at about 4.8 and 6.5 light years. It has been a while since I did the math, but . . . at the best speeds we have currently attained, that is about 50,000 years travel away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing nuclear pulse propulsion, it could be as short as 40 or 50 years travel, and that is one technology that is \u0027technically\u0027 feasible though it would be exceptionally expensive. Moreover, there may well be nothing of any merit or interest at either of the two centuari systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a thread where I got several of these guys to comment on some of the themes related to this stuff: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/46086-Maximum-Velocity-Currently-Attainable-The-Future?highlight=maximum\u002Bvelocity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMaximum Velocity Currently Attainable?
