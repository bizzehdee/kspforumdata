It\u0027s distinctive theme music plays as the attraction mode displays a character going between floors of a building, getting files from rooms and dodging hat clad bad guys. It triggers something in you, a faint sensation that the reason you keep going up is because something is following you and you have to stay ahead of it. You use the vending machines to stock up on supplies and then realise that one wall you thought was painted differently to the rest, is actually a rare window. You step over and look out. In front of you you see black, broken up by twinkling stars, you look down and see far below you a planet curving away from what must be the base of this tower. You marvel at how far you have come but again you feel the urgency that says you must keep going. You look around you for stairs to go up, but instead there is some hollow glass tube. You step over to it and feel an uprush of air. You take a deep breath and step in to the tube.
