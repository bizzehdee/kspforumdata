Now I make models for other games, most recently Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. Some time ago, A man named Coxxon Released his Battlestar Galactica models on Sci-fi Meshes, and I downloaded them, so I have had them for awhile. Now I plan on doing expansion components, like a extending docking clamp, and other things similar to that, but to test how to export and everything I decided to go with something a little more complex. That is where the Viper Mk VII comes in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v205/Azrel_Omega/KSP/2014-02-05_00004.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-02-05_00004.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first imported it, all I did was the mesh, didn\u0027t break it up or anything.
