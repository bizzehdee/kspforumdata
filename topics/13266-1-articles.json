Methane hydrate is methane molecules trapped in a cage of water molecules surrounding it. Now, methane hydrate can exist in a vacuum only if the temperature is -10 to -15 degrees Celsius. After doing a quick look on the forums, I found that the temperature of space outside kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere is around 0 degrees Celsius, so I\\\u0027m guessing its the same on minmus. Now, that doesn\\\u0027t rule out that minmus can\\\u0027t be frozen. It can also be composed of other rock like substances on the surface with a methane hydrate layer underneath. Methane hydrate at 0 degrees Celsius forms if there is a pressure of around 50 earth atmospheres. Heavy rocks would do the trick and I would also imagine that it gets colder the further underground you go. The methane lakes are a bit tricky, since they exist on the surface. My theory is that some of the methane hydrate evaporates and forms a methane and/or water fog on the surface of the methane hydrate lakes. With cliffs as large as around 4000m (give or take a few thousand) surrounding the methane lakes, that fog ain\\\u0027t goin nowhere and can build pretty thick. once its thick enough it acts as an insulator blocking the heat that comes from Kerbol and cooling the surface of the methane lake to -10 to -15 degrees Celsius where the methane hydrate lakes can exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, it is said that methane hydrate can form in the outer reaches of the solar system. Being a small, icy body, I think minmus originated from the outer reaches of the Kerbol system that was slingshoted into the inner system where Kerbin picked it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\\\u0027s my theory on how Minmus\\\u0027 origins and how it can exist as it is now.
