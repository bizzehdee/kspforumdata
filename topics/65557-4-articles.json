The sideways momentum required to do so is provided by the wheels which can\u0027t move sideways. Then, precession kicks in; the sideways momentum is transformed into forward momentum.

To get from the pendulum to Jones\u0027 device, you can make the following iterative changes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Replace the pendulum with a ball rolling on a track that follows the same path as the pendulum weight.

Probably misinterpreting though.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, energy has no direction. The potential energy does get transformed into kinetic energy, which also does not have a direction on its own, but of course it needs momentum to exist. That momentum, at first, is only directed sideways. That direction then gets turned forward with the external help of the wheels blocking sideways motion and Jone\u0027s hand. Without the hand, I\u0027m sure the cart would move a bit backwards and then forwards again. I expect that in the original, genuine presentation, that forward movement was indeed bigger than the previous backward movement. The reason I expect that (apart from the obvious one that nobody would have been impressed otherwise) would be friction, of course. As the sideways motion is slowed down, the wheels are pushed sideways and have a bit (how much depends on the quality of the wheels) more friction than later on when the forward moving gyro is slowed down again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T16:44:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlex Jones as in the nutjob radio-host conspiracy-fanatic Alex Jones?
