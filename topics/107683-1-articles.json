To me, none of the strategies really seemed any better than just collecting science and funds myself, but I thought I might be missing something. So my question is, do you use strategies? If so, which ones, and why?"},{"CreatedByName":"Masetto","CreatedById":115203,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:12:03Z","Content":"Yeah, I think they may have overnerfed strategies a bit. \n\nI\u0027m not at end-game, where I might look at money-saving strats, but in terms of accumulating science... strats don\u0027t seem worth it. Too expensive, especially since everything else in the game feels a little more expensive now.\n\nAs another poster pointed, you\u0027re giving away major fractions, like 25% of your cash-earnings, and getting basically *nothing* in return.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T17:18:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Masetto**"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:12:10Z","Content":"Only rarely"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:13:17Z","Content":"I usually take science, but it seemed to be bugged.

The amount of grind has been reduced drastically (mostly because tourists, which can easily be combined into a single mission), but it\u0027s not as if cash was lying by the wayside: no funds-for-something for me, either. And of course, I need every point of science.\n\nI guess that means that career mode is pretty balanced overall. Eventually I will pipe all science into funds, of course, but I wonder if that will ever be necessary. I suspect that even the \u0022fine, I was doing this anyway\u0022 kind of contracts will keep me afloat.
