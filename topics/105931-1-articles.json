I press escape and it will take me back to the VAB, if i try to launch again it is black. If i go to the space center the screen is a space view similar to the map view however everything (celestial bodies) are mission and the view can be panned but is stuck at a single spot. From here my only option is to restart the game, but this happens each time. Once it is stuck in the space view I am unable to access anything except the esc menu to go back to the main menu. \n\nThis is a new issue since 1.0 dropped. Was able to play the previous versions fine.\n\nI have played around with the graphics settings. Adjusting the resolutions and windowed mode. force opengl and not. Lower graphics settings. \n\nSome specs:\n\nAsus G75VW\n\nIntel i7\n\n8GB RAM\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 660M\n\n1920 X 1080 X 60Hz"},{"CreatedByName":"BaryonicMan","CreatedById":99615,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:05:16Z","Content":"Did it look like this?\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/su-mH2a_gm8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThis is the result I got on a PC with Windows 7 64-bit. \n\nIntel i7\n\n8GB RAM\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTS 450\n\n1920 X 1080 X 60Hz and other resolutions (tried different resolutions: the result is the same everytime.)\n\n(On a Windows 7.1 64-bit, two addons: Kerbal Alarm Clock 3.2.2.0 and Lazor Docking Camera (last version))\n\nAfter removing of addons: same result.\n\nReinstalling KSP 1.0 solved this problem for me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T14:49:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BaryonicMan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lithium-7","CreatedById":37150,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:11:46Z","Content":"I have this problem as well (exactly as it\u0027s depicted in the video).
