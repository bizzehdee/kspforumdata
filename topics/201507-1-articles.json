This idea was in Beta for nearly two years before being released sometime in 2016. It was added to Steam for a couple of reasons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThis feature allows the owner of a game to be able to play flawlessly on various devices providing the game\u0027s software supports playing on that type of device. To help make it easier for the player, Steam makes a copy of your local files to the cloud storage linked to your account (everyone has cloud storage linked to their account. There is no way to completely disable the feature from your account). When you log onto your Steam account and download the desired game to your device, the files in the cloud are also copied. This way you can play a seamless gaming experience on your tablet, PC, or laptop. Your saved game data is synced with the cloud each time you load a game or exit a game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThis feature allows you to be able to permanently delete your Steam library and account from your computer without losing your game\u0027s progress, downloaded content, or downloaded mods. You can install Steam, log in to your account, and transfer all your games - with the saved games files - to your new computer and not have to spend hours transferring stuff to an external drive or a lot of flash drives.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the most part, it does well. But with \u003Cem\u003EKerbal Space Program\u003C/em\u003E and a dozen other games I have come across, this feature does not always go as planned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-07T17:07:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI update my mods manually or with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E; why is KSP-AVC (\u003Cem\u003EKerbal Space Program Automatic Version Checker\u003C/em\u003E) telling me I do not have the latest update for this mod installed?! \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Kerbal Space Program, there are two folders which get uploaded to the Steam cloud for you.
