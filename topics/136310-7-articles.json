never quit KSP even if all mods failed one day and were never updated) would be Hyperedit and KIS.\u00A0 Hedit i use for simplifying menial tasks (such as bringing entire armadas of the exact same ship to teh exact same spot.\u00A0 Ill launch 1, take it to its destination normally (as in burn and get there), and then ill Hedit copies of it to roughly the same spot and remove an equal amount of fuel from it.\u00A0 Used to use MJ for that task, automatically delivering vessels, but its time consuming and cheat or not, Hedit does that job faster, better, and most of all it saves time.\u00A0 that and i use it quite a bit to save myself from kraken bugs (like bring my ship back to the proper orbit it was in after it for some dumb reason decides to go all out and either goes FTL or does that instant 0m/s orbital velocity thing.\u00A0 As for KIS, well its pretty self explanatory, you can assembly ships and vehicles outside the VAB/SPH.\u00A0 While it has plenty of other neat features, the only part of that mod i ever cared for was the ability to repair (or completely reassemble) warships in orbit after a hole got torn in its side via missile fire.\u00A0 Also its very immersive in that you can drop off a pile of structural parts on some planet, and have a few kerbals assemble a bunker or something.\u00A0 I used to use KAS alot too (winches were alot of fun), but only bother using that now when i feel like screwing around and making stupid things like trebuchets or other completely insane inventions.\u00A0 I also used to be obsessed with the robotics mod (turrets anyone?), but my recent experiments with stock turret bearings have made that mod way less worthwhile, and i find it more fun/challenging to make my own rotational elements with stock KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for things i enjoy but couldnt care less about, id have to say visual mods go here.\u00A0 EVE (or should i say my own custom modified version of it with custom sci-fiy configs), planetshine, distant object enchancement, scatterer, ect.\u00A0 Kinda working on updating my EVE configs (since everything broke after 1.1), so hopefully ill have my clouds/dust on every planet/moon (prolly minmus was my fav since i gave it these creepy green clouds that made it very scary looking, as well as dres with pitch black dust storms).\u00A0 The rest is just minor improvements that i use on and off depending on how much performance i need like when im working with 1000\u002B part counts every bit helps so i tend to disable these mods when i get into fleet scale fights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, after i discovered DMP, i seriously stopped using any mods that add parts, and just today finished modding KIS to not require any parts at all.\u00A0 This lets me use KIS\u0027s main feature i care for (assembly/disassembly outside kerbin), while retaining full DMP compatibility with my ships so i can always go online and vaporize someone with
