It would take effect as soon as asteroid tracking is available. It would make it so asteroids would be able to actually cause damage when they hit Kerbin. Basically, the damage done would depend on how close the asteroid was to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E when it crashed. The shockwaves from the asteroid would do some amount of damage to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E when it hits down. To give you an idea of the damage it would do, the entire \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E would be obliterated if an asteroid happened to crash right on top of it (which is too rare to really happen to anyone), however if it hits the opposite side of the planet, almost no damage would be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
