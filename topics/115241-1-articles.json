Type in \u0027dxdiag\u0027 and press the [ok] button. A new program will pop up called the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. On the bottom of this screen a [save All Information] button is located.

At a glance, we can tell if your system should be experiencing any performance issues, and whether the system is correctly registering and utilizing an installed video card, sound card, and so forth. All the hardware information for your system is contained within these files (and is extensive). As such, it\u0027s a must-have for those of us trying to diagnose and solve certain issues.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E When KSP crashes it will general a folder with files with details surrounding the crash. Usually a window will pop up ingame asking you to send this information to the developers, along with the name of the folder. You can find this folder in the KSP install directory.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E If KSP **doesn\u0027t** crash, start KSP and cause the problem. Quit KSP and find the output\\_log.txt (**not** the KSP.log) at the location below:\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E - Windows: KSP\\_win\\KSP\\_Data\\output\\_log.txt -OR- KSP\\_win64\\KSP\\_x64\\_DATA\\output\\_log.txt (depending on which used)  \n\u003E \u003E  - In case you installed KSP into a Windows protected directory (C:\\Users, C:\\Program Files or C:\\Windows\\ and their subfolders) the output log file may be stored in the folder called C:\\Users\\[username]\\Appdata, this folder is usually hidden so you should enable the view hidden folders option ([more information](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35464-Cant-find-your-save-files-Read-this)). Note that for the demo you should find the output\\_log.txt file located in the KSP\\_Data folder.  \n\u003E \u003E  - Steam users should right click KSP in Steam, click on Properties, then in the Properties box, click Local Files, then Browse Local Files.\n\u003E \u003E - Mac OSX: Open Console, on the left side of the window there is a menu that says \u0027files\u0027. Scroll down the list and find the Unity drop down, under Unity there will be Player.log Aka Files\u003E~/Library/Logs\u003EUnity\u003EPlayer.log\n\u003E \u003E - Linux: The log is written to /home/user/.config/unity3d/Squad/Kerbal Space Program/Player.log\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E You can upload these files to any file sharing site (such as [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/), [Mediafire](http:///) or [File2web](http://file2web.com/)).

Anything out of the ordinary will often show up in the log files, and it gives us a good idea of where to start looking for solutions.\n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Sham3R","CreatedById":147599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T09:54:00Z","Content":"Crash Filehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9du2ta2brwg83a8/crash.dmp?dl=0\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9du2ta2brwg83a8/crash.dmp?dl=0\n\nOutPuthttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zi1t1cbrpvksk5x/output_log.txt?dl=0\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zi1t1cbrpvksk5x/output\\_log.txt?dl=0\n\nError\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/dqy3asvz8zextuf/error.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dqy3asvz8zextuf/error.log?dl=0)\n\nDxDiag\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/6mfau6581ycvonk/DxDiag.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6mfau6581ycvonk/DxDiag.txt?dl=0)\n\nSorry for the delay in getting these!
