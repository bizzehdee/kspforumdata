Is that even possible? And if it is, how would it tally the points? Because if it isn\u0027t possible, there will need to be some sort of checks-and-balances system in place to prevent players from completely and utterly dead-ending their science potential by radioing in all of their results and being able to only get paltry returns for repeat missions that actually do return a sample. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if Squad already has something in place to account for this, but if not, well, point of consideration if nothing else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeFudge","CreatedById":74270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T20:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI heard they\u0027re working out exploits and such so people cant abuse the science, so it will hopefully be balanced upon release.

Then you do the same experiment again at the same spot and actually bring the unit back to Kerbin for salvage.
