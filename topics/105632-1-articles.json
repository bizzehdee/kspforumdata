While everyone is posting high tech stuff, I\u0027m sitting here in career mode annoyed I can\u0027t use any of it until I get more science. But here you have something that\u0027s available early. Stable and great distance (made a trip to the north pole with this and still had half fuel left). Highly recommend it and hope to see more early career rockets and planes cropping up soon!"}]}
