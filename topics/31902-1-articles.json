I was reading a book the other day and thought that there seemed to be a lack of a certain craft in the forums, a missile interceptor! The design was based heavily on the Bristol Bloodhound Mk2, which was a missile which intercepted high altitude bombers (or was planned to.) The Bloodhound was based on the preliminary missile tests which were carried out from the Thunderbird missile. The missile has been out of service since 1991. The Mk3 and Mk4 variants were planned to have a small nuclear warhead and a mobile launch platform, respectively. The video/or link leads to the video of the \u0022Blud-Hound\u0022 during tests. It reached a record height of 1,000,000m in height. Although this is far below the range of the actual Bloodhound, which was 185km (roughly 185,000 metres.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFLmBFlW6UE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESamGaming\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
