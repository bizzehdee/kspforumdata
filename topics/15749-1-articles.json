That craft, while able to make it off the ground, was nowhere capable of making even suborbital flight on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo tonight, on a whim, I asked myself why I couldn\\\u0027t try to reassemble her with the new stock parts. Well I was quite able to, and she is pretty sound as she is, but completely unable to leave the ground on her own. Being a test vehicle, I thought it best to have her as a 1-man affair. Don\\\u0027t want to be throwing away kerbals by the busload now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I do aim to assemble a launch vehicle myself for her, I thought it might be fun to share the current version with you kerbineers and see what you come up with to get the Palomino up into space for exo-Kerbin missions. Mods are of course welcome, but do share what ones are used so others might find them if they don\\\u0027t already have the parts. I look forward to seeing what gets this legendary craft off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterthought: I feel I should give a word of caution to those who might want to bring their pilot out for a wave goodbye on the generous top of the craft. Don\\\u0027t jump, except the initial jump off the ladder. Apparently such actions cause instant disintegration of kerbonauts. Proceed with caution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine print: This current assembly of the Palomino is compatible with KSP 0.16 only. Any use with other versions may result in unforeseen explosions, panic, planetary destruction, and/or just general apathy to assembling the craft at all. Use at your own risk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
