(The difference between the 2 ending orbit dv and the starting dv). That seems like an enormous loss for a thin 5kg chip on the side of a craft imho... should that be happening? Am I just completely ignorant on aerodynamics? Totally willing to admit if I\u0027m wrong, just seemed like a lot to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS. Obsessed, you\u0027re completely correct a different ascent profile can have a profound effect, that said I tried to find numbers that were efficient enough and worked with MJ. For example with a shallower ascent profile at 45 degrees (reduced 5 degrees), lowering the acceleration to 14 m/s, gravity turn at 75m/s, the crafts don\u0027t even make orbit. Other tests (16m/s, 48 ascent, 90m/s turn) just led to lower numbers remaining dv in orbit. I know MJ isn\u0027t perfect, but like I said... more about the consistency for testing purposes rather than ideal flight paths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPSS. The same effect happens with a MJ chip on the side of the ship, but to a much lesser extent, and it becomes almost negligible if the MJ chip is tweakscaled down a step. Not sure if it is because of the mass being 1/50th of the KER chip or because of the \u0022drag cube\u0022 I\u0027ll try to test that next time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPSSS. To anyone wondering why I put the chips on Craft 2 on the rear end of the craft by the engine... i was testing whether putting them on the side versus underneath the tank would make a difference. My thought process was that the tank might shield the chips from creating drag.
