Here is my entry, requiring a total of 1297m/s to get from LKO to Jool: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gallery/XQSnn/new\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/gallery/XQSnn/new.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was based on hopping up to a 3:4, followed by a 1:2 solar orbit, using retrograde apoapsis DSMs to create\u00A0angled orbits. Can you get there for less, using only the Kerbin system? Can you go to a different body with a better ratio of actual dV to nominal dV? Based on the Olex.biz calculator, the linked tour has an actual/nominal ratio of 0.68. Beat that for any other body and you win! You should start from close\u00A0 to a circular 100km LKO.
