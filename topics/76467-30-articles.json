If you can\u0027t afford anything newer (granted, original Gemini hardware would be pricey, but the technology used to make it is and might be less expensive, especially the LV), or have some other reason to still use it, you should be able to. Also, if you opt to keep using the Gemini (like Russians with their Soyuz), you should also be able to. We are more advanced than we were in the 60s, but some stuff from that era still flies (or used to fly until recently) with modifications.

Build it wrong and blow things up, or fly it wrong and put something into the wrong orbit and a contract is left unfulfilled and therefore no money is gained from it. Maybe introduce a money system where loans can be made, and then repaid. Successful contracts generally can bring in money, and increased reputation, which makes more lucrative contracts appear for even more money. Maybe some contracts where there is no monetary gain, but larger increases in reputation (like building a GPS constellation. I could go on and on. The sky is endless.

So, for example, if you\u0027ve launched the same rocket 32 times it costs less than half the original costs. By combining this with a time-based reduction of such a factor - for example, every five unused years reduce the factor by one [2].
