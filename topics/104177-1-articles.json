It runs perfectly fine otherwise, unless you bring another ship too close to the site of the base on Minmus, where it starts to lag and then crash. Also of note is that in the roster are duplicates of some of the Kerbals on Minmus. That is to say that Jeb, for instance, occurs twice in the list, both times stating he is on Minmus. \n\nScreenshot of Minmus base [http://i.imgur.com/BJlNdwD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BJlNdwD.jpg). There are numerous parts missing from the base, as well as the Kerbals. And Minmus.\n\nDxDiag [https://www.dropbox.com/s/tzb3s7824z2bx89/DxDiag.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tzb3s7824z2bx89/DxDiag.txt?dl=0) \n\nOutput log [https://www.dropbox.com/s/h9wyncnjt7un2uq/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h9wyncnjt7un2uq/output_log.txt?dl=0) \n\nSave [https://www.dropbox.com/s/018fxfwbr26avxi/borked.sfs?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/018fxfwbr26avxi/borked.sfs?dl=0) \n\nOf note in the save is that a lander (named \u0027recovery vehicle\u0027) is en route to the base. Once it closes the distance, the lag begins, followed by the program crashing.\n\nAny help is appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceJuice","CreatedById":129597,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T18:56:25Z","Content":"It seems that something called \u0022coroutine\u0022 is not loading because of the objects at the KSC.
