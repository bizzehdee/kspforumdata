Essentially, you could place an object of any mass you want on the same orbit of Jupiter without any clear difference. Basically, the orbit of an object is not defined by it\u0027s own mass, but by the mass of the object it\u0027s orbiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, since reality is always a little more complex, you /could/, and the above statement isn\u0027t true when the orbiting body starts having a significant amount of mass compared to the parent body. In reality, neither does Jupiter orbit the Sun, neither does the Sun orbit Jupiter. They\u0027re both orbiting around their common mass barycenter. And unless I\u0027m confused, I believe that Jupiter is the only body of the solar system for which the Sun/planet barycenter isn\u0027t located inside the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you want to know the mass of your pot of petunias, you could start by find the mass of the Sun with the usual formulas given the pot\u0027s perigee, apogee, and speed at those respective places. Then, if you had instruments precise enough, you could look at the oscillations of the sun as the pot of petunias orbits it. That would be insanely small, but hey it\u0027s a thing. Then from the Sun\u0027s displacement and from the distance of the pot of petunias at that time you could figure out the mass the pot of petunia must have to move the Sun in that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this gets near impossible to do when you translate from a two body system to a system like the solar system that has a /lot/ of bodies involved, but it\u0027s as good as it gets I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T05:22:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can find the SUM of the masses of the two objects using Kepler\u0027s Third Law (as modified by Newton).
