Do you not realize that Pluto is much, much smaller than seven moons in our own system? Our own moon is almost six times Pluto\u0027s mass, and then there are the four Galilean moons of Jupiter Titan (Saturn), and Triton (Neptune), all of which are considerably bigger than Pluto. Basically, it\u0027s better to be a Titan-analogue than a Pluto-analogue; it\u0027s not a demotion for Eeloo to stop being a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, what\u0027s the point of Eeloo currently from a gameplay perspective? You go there once, just to say you did it, and then you have no reason to go there ever again. (As my ribbons show, I\u0027ve done it. There\u0027s nothing there to see.) Compare to Jool\u0027s moons, where you\u0027ll go to the Jool system repeatedly; it\u0027s not just Laythe that gets all the traffic. (In fact, I\u0027ve landed on Pol more than Laythe, since it\u0027s where my main Kethane fuel depot is.) Eeloo isn\u0027t even difficult like Moho, it\u0027s just... there. So when they add a second gas giant, and put Eeloo there alongside a couple other moons, it\u0027ll become a much more popular destination, especially if the planet is Saturn-like with visible rings (as opposed to Jool\u0027s boring appearance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is especially going to be true once the new resource system is put in place. A solitary planet is going to be difficult to refuel from, especially if that planet has no atmosphere to extract oxygen from to make fuel. Even if the planet is rich in resources, it will likely be missing one of the ingredients to make the various fuels. But a system of multiple moons/planets is MUCH better, since you can get one ingredient from one moon and another from a different one, and refine both at a space station orbiting the planet. Sure, they could add a unique resource to that solitary planet, but given that resources\u0027 only use is to make fuel, it\u0027s not cost-effective to haul a raw material back to civilized space just to turn it into fuel to replace what you spent bringing it back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T20:53:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait for Christmas Eve.
