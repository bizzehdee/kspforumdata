A few I\u0027ve thought of, that are rather obvious, instead of launching an entire Mun base/mining rig in one go, without docking/refuelling during the Kerbin-Mun surface trip, do it in sections. But the point is, to try launch something over 100-150T that can get itself to the Mun (or potentially Duna) that is all the one vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal weight on Launch: 666T 290 parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal payload weight: 160T\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal rocket base weight: 506T\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR at launch: 1.34\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContents of payload:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne large docking station centred on the top of the craft, as well as four standard docking ports on the fuel tank reserves.

Landing is more advised than this, because minerals and stuff to mine and the drill doesn\u0027t work well in pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to segue randomly but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I go about putting pics of it up, don\u0027t have the option on my account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, have to this, this is one of the most promising games I\u0027ve seen, in regards to Dev-Community interaction, how the community itself interact, the biggest \u0022flame war\u0022 type thing I\u0027ve seen really, is when people talk about weather or not to use MechJeb, and some people say they use it for everything and others are against that, etc, but it\u0027s never bad (Anti Mech-Jeb here, vote JEB2013, help him keep his job before the robots rise up) just cause I never got to using it, plus kinda enjoy docking/landing everything, plus the SAS already seems like enough of an auto pilot, I was playing for a few hours before realising that was there and then everything became so much easier \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe games ambient musical scores don\u0027t really ever get on your nerves like some can sometimes, if anything the game is too open ended/enjoyable, leaving you planning/plotting what to do next, spending hours building/testing craft, but that\u0027s what you want/part of what makes it fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally looking forward to the future updates to KSP, really keen for the Career, like the idea of being limited until you make a progression. Would go well with the future \u0022possible\u0022 weather updates, clouds and shiznet, different atmospheric pockets of pressure to cause destabilisation, etc. Even the glitches aren\u0027t too bad, you could pretend the nav balls screws out sometimes because of overheating (which would be cool if implemented, like distortion of data/visuals if you heat up/get out of range of some signal sat for navigation or it itself get\u0027s damage, solar radiation, etc. All really promising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing, to add to this giant clusterfrak of text, are there any mods that change how the part models behave, by that I mean, rather than vaporising, they go through deformation stages, so if I was to go too close to the Sun, I\u0027d see my ship/sat crumple up/bend and break and not the weird wobbly bending things do in KSP when you forget struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, end pointless rant/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat jumped all over the place.
