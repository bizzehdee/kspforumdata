Now that I have figured out how config nodes work I was able to get the editor saving data working in short order last night so I\u0027d say I\u0027m about 30% done. I still am not 100% sure how I\u0027m going to handle parts changing vessels (such as undocking where a single vessel becomes two) but I\u0027ve got some ideas. It will probably depend on how the code looks when I get to that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo progressing but enough unknowns left that I\u0027m not even going to guess at an ETA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-01T16:50:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2014 04:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Diazo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FacialJack","CreatedById":114369,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T18:39:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ety 4 answer, and ty for showing me how rebinding (so simple... i just didnt look on settings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the mod...
