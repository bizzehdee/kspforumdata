I\u0027m still relatively early in 1.0, but I have found the stations to be quite lucrative so far and easily combined with other plant flag, launch satellite, or rescue missions (I use 4 or more side mounted rescue ships on my stations which are each fully functional with probe cores solar panels and a pod so the required kerbal capacity isn\u0027t just a bunch of useless hitchiker containers). A satellite anywhere around Kerbin/minmus/mun doesn\u0027t need to cost more than 20,000 to launch and generally yields 100k\u002B if you just start small and put the bare minimum couple of panels, antenna, . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe funds seem to come primarily from learning to do things better and cheaper. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it is a bit of a grind to get enough to upgrade the buildings to level 3. But every time I do it I get better at it. It really helps to figure out what smaller or larger parts you can use to get things done more cheaply.
