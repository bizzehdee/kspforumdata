Anyone good with GIMP? I\u0027m trying to modify a texture for the sky box in ksp, I got Raredens\u0027 high res one, but wanted to add some flair to it by adding a nebula. Thing is I want to kinda make it (a little) transparent around the edges so the stars blend better and get rid of ugly \u0022cut offs\u0022 (really noticeable in the in game view). The nebula should probably be scaled up a bit more, so its\u0027 stars are the same size/density as the background texture.
