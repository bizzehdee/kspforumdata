If Alice leaves a focuseable tagged ship, then the M/P updates stop happening, as if Alice went offline. An online/offline message must be transmitted to all connections.

It appends the name of the ship with the name of the player to make \u0027ownership\u0027. Perhaps a UID would need to be appended to the end of the ship name to prevent collisions. The name would look something like this: {ALICE-\u0027SHIPNAME\u0027-UID} The name would be parsed internally by the plugin and mapped to the appropriate ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat stops a player (ALICE) from screwing with another player\\\u0027s (BOB) ships?

Perhaps a \u0027ALICE_isWARPING\u0027 tag must be TX\\\u0027d along with \u0027ALICE_WARPRATE\u0027 and \u0027ALICE_GAMETIME\u0027... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENegative warp-rates may be required to keep in sync due to the significant latency in the connection. This one is a stickler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the module must TX to a local cache which keeps a record of all transactions and interpolates between positions.
