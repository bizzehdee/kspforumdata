I do hate lag and such complexity, so since they were from an older version, I ripped off ALL the radial air intakes, ALL the canards, and some struts, to make her lighter and sexier, and since she seems no worse for that, I added a small tank between the skipper and the orange tank to eliminate over-heating. The performance might be just as good, and it\u0027s a bit less laggy now, with 433 parts instead of 512.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also discovered the parachute glitch where it won\u0027t deploy after being repacked and/or staged and not used - I think. I added the chutes to the Brakes Action Group, since there aren\u0027t any wheels, and it\u0027s logical, but I also moved them to a separate stage, just in case. I haven\u0027t done a lot of chute testing yet. If anyone learns more about that, please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you guys fly it? How did it do?
