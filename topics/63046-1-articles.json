Much carnage ensued, but I finally made it to Mun safely, and home again(!). I am ready to purchase the full version, however I need a question answered first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe demo is laggy enough on my (ancient) laptop. It is mainly on takeoff that I get the slideshow effect. Is the full game likely to be much worse?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T04:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the demo still 1.7, or 1.6?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe full game is a bit more optimized so it\u0027ll probably run better. I can\u0027t see it running worse. However, it (and the demo) both tax the computer quite a bit and as you get bigger (and more) ships going that will take its toll. Flying the same 50-100 part mission will be better, but in the full game you\u0027ll eventually be trying to get 300, 500, 700 and more parts going and that will bring most any computer to its knees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doozler","CreatedById":103369,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T09:09:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHiya, newbie on a rubbish laptop here as well.

What a n00b. Ok, I run the demo with everything turned off/down. If I enable ground scatter and land on Mun it turns into a slideshow, wont register any keyboard inputs etc. Im not sure how to check part count, but if I build anything big(ish) it just crashes out. I had to re-write the engine programming to give me double power and weight per engine so that I could half my part count...

Is there any hope for me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know when you\u0027ve a rocket saved it shows part count as part of the name when you open save file. Same when you click on (empty) launch pad.
