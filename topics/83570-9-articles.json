I am not positive, but I believe the errors I\u0027ve been getting have to do specifically with parts whose nodes may be toggled on or off. Here\u0027s how I have been able to replicate the problem so far:\u003Cp\u003E1. Place any part in the VAB or SPH whose nodes can be toggled on or off. Can be the root part of a craft or not, same things happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Upon placement, no errors are thrown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Pick the part up, and do one of two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.a. If it\u0027s the root, simply click to put the part back down, anywhere. Many \u0022Input is null\u0022 errors thrown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.b. If it\u0027s not the root, place the part \u003Cem\u003Esuccessfully\u003C/em\u003E in any configuration attached to another part - if it\u0027s set down and shaded red, meaning not placed successfully (or however you call it), errors won\u0027t occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach time 3.a. or 3.b. happens, \u0022Input is null\u0022 errors occur. The number of errors is equal to 2x the number of nodes that can be turned off or on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that\u0027s vaguely helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also seems to occur when another part - possibly any part - is attached \u003Cem\u003Eto \u003C/em\u003Eone of the node-switching parts. Happened when I stuck a mechjeb box onto one of the 2x1 bays...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I should clarify before, TweakScale does not correctly judge the mass of mesh-switching/mass-switching parts in real-time, but it may do that on reload, not sure. My ships seemed roughly as ludicrously massive as they ought to be, but that doesn\u0027t mean the masses were correct after reloading. In real-time, it does the same thing it does for tank-swapping parts: if you put the tank in or swap the mesh, THEN scale, the scaled values will appear correct. If you scale, THEN swap, it will revert to whatever the non-scaled mass or tank capacity is for whatever you just switched to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT AGAIN: This particular problem is not related to TweakScale; removed it and nothing changed.
