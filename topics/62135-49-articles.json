Go to your GameData\\Romfarer\\Parts\\Romfarer_RoboticArmBuran\\ folder and you should find a part.cfg file. In that file under the \u0022// --- asset parameters ---\u0022 heading there is a line that says \u0022rescaleFactor = 1.25\u0022, without the inverted commas. Simply change that line so that it says \u0022rescaleFactor = 0.7\u0022, again without the inverted commas. For an extra bit of realism you can also change the following property; under the heading \u0022// --- standard part parameters ---\u0022 there is a line that says \u0022mass = 0.5\u0022, I reduced that to read \u0022mass = 0.35\u0022, again without the inverted commas. I have no idea if I have used the correct figure for the mass reduction, but it all seems to work ok at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps.
