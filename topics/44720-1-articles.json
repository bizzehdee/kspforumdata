I am making an Energy to Mass generator, but for it to even work, I need it to be toggle-able. Currently, I know that parts, like rockets and solar arrays, can be right-clicked during flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, that\u0027s only part of it.

I modified the XenonGas engine previously to produce XenonGas faster than it uses it (A bit cheaty, but yes, I wanted to make my \u0022Warp\u0022 engines a reality), and I know that LiquidFuel generation can be done just as easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem I have is that there is no On/Off switch...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDP","CreatedById":30775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T03:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EModuleGenerator has the requisite KSPEvents (and KSPActions btw) to allow toggling on/off from either context menu (right-click) or action groups.
