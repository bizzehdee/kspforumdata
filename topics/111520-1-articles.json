Perhaps some sort of cage that holds them under would work.\n\n I stuck two long Mk3 fuel tanks on a Mk3 crew tank, and that got me down. Also used hullcam units to get photos. The problem with undersea missions is the camera plays up, you\u0027re limited to looking down, or to certain angles in chase/locked view. \n\nI got up again when my \u0027submarine\u0027 disintegrated on reload, leaving just the crew pod. On its own, it did not sink, which is a change from previous experiences. \n\nThough, the Tardis mod may still be the better option for undersea exploration. That thing sunk well, I used it to explore the bay of old kerbin city. It is also able to generate thrust to get back up again."},{"CreatedByName":"TheBrisbyMouse","CreatedById":80175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T15:08:04Z","Content":"You can use ore tanks so you can dump the ore when you reach the bottom.
