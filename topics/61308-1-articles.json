Had a question though. When I want to disconnect the command module from the lunar module there is the cover over the engine of the service module. The one that automatically placed there when you put a stage separator on. So when you disconnect them it\u0027s just floating there between them. So when I go to flip the command module to dock up I have to do like a box maneuver around the engine cover to hook up. I tried to connect a little rocket on it to scoot it out of the way but it won\u0027t let me connect anything to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys do to get it out of the way?
