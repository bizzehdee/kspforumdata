If I wanted to make a pointed part I can slap some fins on there like the \u0027tail Fin\u0027 or \u0027AV-T1\u0027 fins to get that nice Horton flying wing shape. Having a wedge shape stock kinda closes-out options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be happy with the radial cockpit as is, but there is something a little irksome aesthetically about the triangle windows. I think my advice would be that you have lots of curves going on with the canopy frames so it makes the little pointy windows seem tacked on. Maybe try them with curves to mimic the rear canopy mating surface?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xjFDUp7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xjFDUp7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, shave off that sloping-down curve at the rear a bit if possible and slap a hatch there! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside contender:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VCChQmC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VCChQmC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo excited...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-20T20:29:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2014 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Exothermos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boomerang","CreatedById":92198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T04:36:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorry, no.
