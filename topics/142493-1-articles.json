I\u0027ve read up on the mobile lab part, because last time I played this game extensively enough to use it was some time ago, and it sounds like it works much differently now.. I know if you keep using\u00A0different labs you can keep collecting and using the same experiment results and processing them into data. I also know you get multipliers for the amount of science payout depending on where the lab is. My question is this: can a lab do the one-time processing into data in orbit, then land on the surface of an object, and process the same results again for the new modified science amount? I\u0027m guessing I would need to gather the experiment results a second time, but would it work with the same lab like that? Or would I absolutely have to make a second lab to be able to do this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T23:18:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would need a second lab. Each lab keeps a checkoff list of which experiments have been processed inside of it. Can\u0027t do any of them twice, ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkippydaHippie","CreatedById":147118,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-26T02:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks man\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
