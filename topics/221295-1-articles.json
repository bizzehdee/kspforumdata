Very well done, and omg the music... -chef kiss-\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGot me thinking... what if there was a KSP movie? Even a cute short one.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think a lot.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeres what I got.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nafter ksp1, slight amount of space exploration lets say, Just got to Mun and back for the 3rd time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen, during the 4th, something happens.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nA mysterious force rips the ship in half, and blows up. . . sure, blowing up we\u0027re used to, but this force stretched parts and broke what laws of kerbin physics they know.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey dub this force, the Kraken.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey plot would be trying to get away from this force. Or, where KSP2 comes in.\u003Cbr\u003E\nColonization, and other galaxies. Maybe solar system.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpoiler, but the kraken is actually an unstoppable other dimensional beast, that sadly rips apart and consumes the Kerbin solar system.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut, the ending of the movie should be like, them crashing on a habital planet, respectfully so, and starting out with nothing again. One kerbal could be trying to make a airplane out of sticks and leaves, and try to throw it, and it flawlessly floats, where everyone should be thinking it would crash or break... \u0022Well, we can start here\u0022 or some dialog that would tie it perfectly, and tie in a GOOD song as the dev team does in the trailers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIdk... I think a lot.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d like to know what others think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JKpart","CreatedById":231588,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-19T18:24:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\naccidently posted this twice somewhere in the forums.
