First launched on April 12th 1981, it served as the US\u0027s manned launch vehicle until its retirement in 2011. In that time it flew 135 flights, carried 833 astronauts into space, and launched some of humanity\u0027s most awe-inspiring scientific instruments, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station. Despite its flaws and small number of tragic accidents, the Space Shuttle will surely be remembered as one of the most influential space vehicles of the early space age.\n\n[Download](http://kerbalx.com/Naito/KSP1-Shuttle)\n\nNaito\u0027s Shuttle-C Concept:\n\n![9ObCTAXl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9ObCTAXl.jpg)\n\nNASA examined a number of ways to extend the capability they had developed with the Shuttle. One of the most analyzed variations was to make a cargo-only version known as Shuttle-C. It was basically a Shuttle orbiter stripped down to only the propulsion system and the cargo bay. By removing the crew cabin, life support, and reusability capability, it was intended that this would allow reuse of Shuttle technology into a cheap to develop heavy-lift launcher. This idea came and went a number of times, and the final variation that got closest to being produced was the \u0022Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle\u0022 in 2009. Ultimately all Shuttle derived ideas were scrapped as the fleet was retired.\n\n[Download](http://kerbalx.com/Naito/KSP1-Shuttle-C-Fuelpod)\n\nNaito\u0027s Shuttle Aft Cargo Carrier:\n\n![Hb1FyPvl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Hb1FyPvl.jpg)\n\nAnother way that NASA sought to maximize the Shuttle\u0027s capabilities was with the Aft Cargo Carrier. This concept came about due to fact that since the external tank was essentially already carried up to orbit by the Shuttle every launch, why not actually bring a little extra up with it? This was briefly studied and proposed in the Shuttle\u0027s heyday pre-Challenger, but has been largely forgotten since then.\n\nSee [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19850002742](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19850002742) and [http://www.wired.com/2012/05/shuttle...-carrier-1982/](http://www.wired.com/2012/05/shuttle-with-aft-cargo-carrier-1982/) for more information\n\n[Download](http://kerbalx.com/Naito/KSP1-Shuttle-ACC)\n\nMikeFox1\u0027s Falcon 1:\n\n![EdMY8lM.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/EdMY8lM.png?1)\n\nFalcon 1 was the first SpaceX launch vehicle to reach orbit.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/KLtKR)\n\nThe Delta 3 was initiated as a response to increasingly high payloads in the satellite market. Built to carry 3.8 metric tones to GTO, it contained a beefier kerosene tank, shorter than the Delta 2\u0027s but equaling in fuel amount. The SRB\u0027s were upgraded, and a Cryogenic Upperstage was built, unlike the Delta K Hypergolic fuel mixture 2nd stage on the Delta 2. The first launch in 1998 ended in failure 73 secs in the flight due to a faulty guidance system, and the RSO (Range Safety Officer) destroyed the rocket and the payload, Galaxy 10. The second launch put Orion 3 in a useless orbit due to a defect in the 2nd stage. The last launch in 2000 succeed in carrying a dummy payload to an specified orbit (though on the lower part of its margin. However, development on the Delta 4 led to its replacement.\n\n[Download](http://kerbalx.com/SaturnianBlue/Delta-3-and-Galaxy-10)\n\nColumbia\u0027s Delta IV Heavy:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

This one features the \u0022Straight Eight\u0022 Fairings (referring to the fact that the fairing is straight up the central core). It has 9 Castor 4A SRB\u0027s, the wordy Extra Extended Long Tank Thor with an RS-27, the Hypergolic Delta K, and a Solid fuel Star 48. The only launch with the Delta 6925-8 was with the HS-376 Palapa B2R, a reflight of Palapa 2, after the Star 48 kick motor failed after being released from the Space Shuttle in 1984. It was retrieved, refurbished, and then relaunched in 1990. \n\n-This Replica, having been built in 1.0, may suffer from low Delta-V in 1.0.2, so adding fuel to the Central first stage is recommended, and note that the Star 48 and HS-376 kick motors are SRBs, so KER is recommended for Delta-V adjustments.\n\n[Download](http://kerbalx.com/SaturnianBlue/Delta-6925-8\u002BHS-376)\n\nMikeFox1\u0027s Nautilus-X:\n\n![j0dYmHC.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/j0dYmHC.png?1)\n\nNautilus-X (Non-Atmospheric Universal Transport Intended for Lengthy United States Exploration) is a NASA design for a future space exploration vehicle.

As of now, both are technically still running, even though both are shutting down many systems and activating their backup thrusters just to conserve the tiny bit of power left in those probes that mean that they can only communicate several times a week. Thankfully, we still have contact with them at all, and Voyager 1 is actually in interstellar space right now. It is actually the farthest man-made object from Earth, even farther than the dead Pioneer 10 probe, and even it\u0027s brother Voyager 2. But mind you, even Voyager 2 is amazingly far from all the rest of the manmade stuff that exists (and it\u0027s farther from us than Pioneer 10 too). These are truly wonderful probes that deserve to be remembered. (And a side note, the assent for this thing is pretty hard. Even though after that, it\u0027s cool; just know that. Also, taking control in the probe core on the launch stage is advised for that. Oh, *and* there is very little torque in the transit stage, but there is some. *And* it has a really small solar panel under the fairing, not none though.)\n\n[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6kMiFN2UFJoZkdsN01ob3BwZk0/view)\n\nCAKE99\u0027s Minuteman 3:\n\n![2i4IrlK.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/2i4IrlK.png?1)\n\nThe LGM-30 Minuteman is a US land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), in service with the Air Force Global Strike Command.\n\n[Download here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c470f4z0v7zxnhr/Minuteman%20III.craft?dl=0)\n\n* * *\n\nREAD BEFORE YOU REP!\n\nSince this is a community project, it has submissions from many different forumers, so make sure to rep the respective builders for their crafts, instead of repping this page.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-29T21:02:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2015 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mad Rocket Scientist**"},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:11:58Z","Content":"\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRiO1ihcQA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\ni\u0027m on it!"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:13:56Z","Content":"Good idea I\u0027ll drop a link here when I\u0027m done updating my Falcon9.\n\nThe new winglet added with 1.02 are incredibly useful and good looking"},{"CreatedByName":"Zucal","CreatedById":139764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:28:47Z","Content":"Will you be accepting rockets that haven\u0027t flown IRL yet?
