I would suggest looking through the last few (most current) pages of the B9 mod to see if this issue has been brought up for 0.90...Or maybe just post the question there...??\n\nAnd yeah, I agree with Recognize-Me...I think thats the only mod I\u0027ve seen for enlarging the VAB/SPH... And I\u0027ve never before had an issue with HE not playing well with literally hundreds of mods, pre-0.90...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T04:20:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue**"}]}
