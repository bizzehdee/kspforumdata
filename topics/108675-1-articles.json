Their specifications make it rather clear that the main priority during development was performance in CPU demanding applications (image and video editing for instance, but also numerics), while gaming performance obviously was much less of a concern. That being said, KSP is one of the few games that can actually benefit from such a design, as it\u0027s mainly CPU limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when the question comes to MacBook vs. iMac, I\u0027d focus on iMac, as from my experience a bigger screen always improves gaming experience. Also, as cool as a thin keyboard might be for portability, for gaming it\u0027s (again: in my opinion) preferable to have a decent lift of keys. So, even if you\u0027re planning to get a MacBook, consider buying an external screen, keyboard and mouse (and while you\u0027re at it, get a gamepad as well, as the new aero model feels much better with analogue sticks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, the bottleneck for KSP is usually single thread CPU performance. I\u0027m playing on an FX-6350 (3.9 GHz), what can \u003Cem\u003Eapproximately\u003C/em\u003E be compared to an i5 or i7 clocked at 2.5 GHz, and I must say that it\u0027s barely fast enough. With bigger ships the ingame clock often turns yellow, meaning insufficient CPU power for realtime simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\u0027s have a look at the iMac models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe cheapest one, for USD 1099, has an i5 clocked at 1.4 GHz (dual core, but that\u0027s nearly irrelevant for KSP). If it reliably would clock at its highest turbo boost frequency (2.7 GHz), it\u0027d in principle be fast enough, but afair the turbo boost clock rate depends not only on CPU load, but also on temperature, and it\u0027s very hard to predict that beforehand. The integrated GPU should in principle be enough to run KSP at low graphics settings, but I\u0027m not sure if it can deliver the game without stuttering in the screen\u0027s native resolution of 1080p. I personally wouldn\u0027t consider this model for playing KSP. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe second cheapest model, USD 1299, has an i5 quad core clocked at 2.7 GHz, with turbo boost at 3.2 GHz. This CPU is definitely fast enough for KSP. The only thing I\u0027m sceptical about is the lack of a dedicated GPU. I\u0027m rather confident that this integrated GPU can display KSP at the screen\u0027s native resolution, but again I wouldn\u0027t bet on it being able to render high terrain details, or to allow using visual enhancement mods without occasional stuttering. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow the last of the 21.5 inch models (USD 1499) of course has a fast enough CPU (i5 quad core, 2.9 Ghz with 3.6 GHz turbo). I wouldn\u0027t bother about the possible i7 upgrade, as the main difference between i5 and i7 is in multithread performance. This is the first (and only) 21.5 inch model with dedicated graphics card. The nVidia GTX 750M is actually on the border between entry-level and middle class graphics cards, but as KSP is not very GPU demanding, it probably will allow running the game at highest settings (except maybe for anti aliasing), and will very likely have enough reserves left for using graphics enhancing mods. It\u0027s definitely the most gaming friendly iMac of that size. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the 13 inch MacBook Pro: They all have a fast enough CPU, but all use the integrated Intel graphics processor, so what I\u0027ve been writing about the USD 1299 iMac applies here as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the question which one to buy is also a question of finances. If you have enough money and are really determined to buy Apple, I\u0027d recommend you to get the USD 1499 iMac, with the USD 1299 iMac as second best option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally would still build my own gaming PC from selected components. It\u0027s cheaper, and assembling a computer is fun. Also, as the 64bit version of KSP is (currently) only available for Linux, you might end up installing Linux on the Mac anyhow, and then there\u0027s the question, if the higher price really pays off, as the only thing that makes an Apple PC different from any other x86 based PC is the operating system. I don\u0027t know about the legal situation, but there\u0027s of course also the option of building a Hackintosh.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T11:16:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 11:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T11:25:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWant a real experience?
