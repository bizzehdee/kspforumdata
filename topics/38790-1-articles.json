At surface level (0-1000) it will not go upwards simply due to not having enough power. So I usually connect it to a Booster to get it up high before flying with the top ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QKzJtyF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QKzJtyF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is the setup I\u0027m using, it flies just fine and is able to get the top ship high enough to where it\u0027s thrusters are able to have decent speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the top ship is disconnected, I aim it 45 degrees so I can go horizontally across Kerbin at an altitude of around 15,000. However, when I try pointing it at 45 degrees, the ship will jerk back upwards towards 0 degrees then spiral wildly out of control. I have no idea why!! If I try adjusting for the jerk towards 0 degrees, it\u0027ll just jerk downwards past 90 degrees and spiral the same way. It\u0027s frustrating but I have no solutions for this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only solution I had was to remove the bottom 3 fuel tanks of the top ship, but I want more fuel otherwise the ship won\u0027t go far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny solutions? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Help appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T16:37:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose standard canards are up too high; you need to move them to the outboard stages below the center of mass (lower tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther things - lose the third FT-800 on the central stack and slap an LV-T45 on the bottom of it, and you should be able to make orbit with what you\u0027ve got without needing a booster (the canards and the -T45 will give you good steering authority during the launch). Be sure to drag the LV-T45 engine indicator down to the second stage (i.e. set all three engines to fire on launch). Then it\u0027s put on a small RCS tank and 4 blocks so you can deorbit the command pod when you\u0027re ready; obviously you\u0027ll want that above the stack decoupler. You also don\u0027t need the Mk-16 XL chute - the standard Mk16 will work just fine; if it\u0027s coming off on you and you\u0027re losing Kerbals, strut it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd make sure to not put your stack decoupler and the chute in the same stage.
