Seriously, I know there\u0027s some issues here with allowing it, but given that this is the forum of a \u003Cem\u003Escience\u003C/em\u003E game, S E X ought to be allowed, at least in the Science Labs. S E X and Gender are also not the same thing, Gender is mental while S E X is biological. And there is an important distinction. Honestly, I think that the fact the word is censored is more inappropriate, because it essentially forces you to think about the word being used in a dirty sense. I even did a little test on this once last year, where I showed people a paragraph about biological reproduction, but where S E X was censored. They all invariably laughed at the censored version, whilst those viewing the uncensored version simply gave a dull, bored look and went along with their work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the Science Labs forum, there\u0027s a whole category of \u003Cem\u003Ebiology\u003C/em\u003E, which prominently features reproduction. I understand that on some kind of unmoderated archive of some kind this may be a problem due to trolls, but isn\u0027t that we have moderators? If the word is used in the wrong context then it can be removed? Is it really that important to keep the forum super-child-friendly in a game that covers concepts most 5 year olds can not grasp? For Kraken\u0027s sake, I was fully and accurately educated about human-reproduction by the time I was 8 from a scientific standpoint!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this is all bull, or maybe it boils down to politics, but I still don\u0027t think the word should be censored. Just moderated.

That debate, and a few closely related topics in science are simply not enough to warrant the removal of the filter, this is after all a forum where people of all ages (this includes children) should be able to access. As a result we have a rather short list of words that are banned to protect the more vulnerable people here. Dimorphism is an interesting topic but it falls out of the scope of Kerbal Space Program, and a gender discussion very quickly borders on political or ideological discussion, both of which are banned in the Community Rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwear words are a different category of course, and the same reasoning applies as with the s ex filter, but added to that is that those words tend to cause more harm than good in discussions, where their use will inflate to the point of.. well.. perhaps what you hear in your average multiplayer Call of Duty game.
