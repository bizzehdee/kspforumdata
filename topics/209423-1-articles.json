Additionally, the stage light is off, but I still can\u0027t stage, even after fixing the staging. My mod list is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GiJvQGj14bx24A6LdG9PlCwGwaBxYi0r/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, I have no idea what\u0027s causing the problem, but I really don\u0027t want to uninstall and reinstall every mod one by one to find the problem, as it would take ages to do so. In addition, I have a _patches folder with one single patch, aptly named \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GBkYpwafVUaLUwrucLRbbPFlpoFft8cL/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eengine_startup.cfg\u003C/a\u003E, it\u0027s a very simple script which makes engines have a realistic warmup process. Also, I have a couple of manually installed mods, the only ones I used on this craft are reDIRECT and SOCK, along with SOCKrecolored and SOCKrepainted. I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s a problem with the craft, as other craft work perfectly fine, I launched a small test rocket, it worked fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/11jiXGxPvnukVl3nXSR-osqbcaddiXpat/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP.log file\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: So I figured out the source of the problem, it\u0027s Modular Launch Pads.
