While in real-life space stations have always been found to be of great use, in the game they just do not have enough going for them to be considered as fleshed out as normal spacecraft. Below are some roles I envision space stations could have and possible ways to implement those roles. First and foremost this thread is starting point for a broad discussion on making space stations come to life in KSP.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuel Depot\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile refueling in orbit can be useful in certain situations, if the fuel has to be launched from Kerbin it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s often going to make more sense to have a tanker vehicle deliver the fuel, than the entire vehicle rendezvousing with the fuel depot. This changes however if the fuel can be \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153flown\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 in from somewhere other than Kerbin. The Delta-V required to get to orbit from Kerbin is so high that flying from orbit to and from the Mun, Minmus or asteroids is more efficient fuel-wise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is cheaper to launch with a minimum of fuel, transfer to a fuel depot and fuel up with mined fuel, then an orbital fuel depot suddenly becomes a viable option. With the announcement of resource mining in the future, possibly from asteroids, this type of station seems to be only a matter of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EResearch Station\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor science purposes, space stations are currently often a waste of time. Stations can do no more science than a simple suborbital hop or a barebones probe can do. There needs to be a reason for a large manned station to be in a stable orbit, to make research stations work. The lab could become truly useful station part with the introduction of biomes to all planets/moons in 0.90. Coupling 0.90s Kerbal Experience introducing a science skill that will boost science output with the few biome-specific orbital experiments would create a reason to put a station into orbit. While both uses sort of work, it might be necessary to add more functionality to make research stations as awesome as they are in real-life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience-over-time might be the answer. Not in the sense that there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a small trickle of science that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s endlessly produced, as that can be exploited with time warp, but rather like SCANSATs mapping implementation. That mod bases the science payout on the percentage of a planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve mapped. If you want to get all of the science, then you need to think about altitude, inclination and other orbital mechanics that require skill. Once in that stable orbit is achieved you can, if you want, timewarp until the planet is mapped. The science can then be collected. Combining this implementation of science-over-time with the science bonus of a station full of scientist Kerbals would make research stations viable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbital Shipyard\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a few select situations it might prove useful to assemble a large spacecraft at a dedicated construction station, but in most cases orbital assembly is more efficient without them. To make orbital shipyards really useful, one needs to be able to build things in space. This would require the resource mining that will be coming to KSP in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if the things that you could build in an orbital mini-VAB were limited in size, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d still be an interesting addition to the game. In the vacuum of space, even a small stage can get you a long way. Being able to build anywhere (after going through the challenge of getting the shipyard there) would really open up the game and allow people to explore the game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s worlds in greater depth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbital Factory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShipyards need building materials, so an orbital factory would be needed. This would take minerals mined from asteroids, planets or moons and convert them into generic rocket parts that would be used to build spacecraft at shipyards. A good place for an orbital factory would be as close as possible to the mined resources as in every situations products will be more lighter than the minerals/ore it came from (as you get rid of a lot of excess stuff while creating the product). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESo what do you think about these ideas and what are your ideas for the future of space stations in KSP?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T01:45:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptRobau\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptRobau\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuel Depot\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do that now.
