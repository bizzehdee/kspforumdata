The thing ran out of liquid fuel but luckily periapsis was below 70 000. After a few orbits velocity was low enough to ensure we would stay in the atmosphere, but I ran out of electricy. Plane was tumbling end over end at several times the speed of sound for a very long time. Eventually I decided to go EVA with Valentina just as an experiment. The whole thing was a disaster anyway.
