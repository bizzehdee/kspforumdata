I\u0027m not saying I\u0027ve done no advanced procedures; I\u0027ve done docking, assembled small stations, and even landed on both of Kerbin\u0027s moons. The one thing I have trouble with; my LAST hurdle in KSP is getting to other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can read Delta-V maps fairly easily, and I just want to know how much extra Delta-V I should have my rockets reach in order to get to other planets with the technology I want in tow. It would also help to be able to make more efficient Kerbin system rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much should I have as spare Delta-V for different operations? I could theoretically land on Duna with a rocket of only 7360 m/s of Delta-V, even though I know in actuality that would \u003Cem\u003Eneeeeeever\u003C/em\u003E happen.

I understand what you mean about inaccuracy in maps. I built a rocket with lander that should\u0027ve been able to get to Eeloo orbit with half of it\u0027s fuel left, but it only has an eighth soooo.... I would recommend at least a thousand if not more delta-v extra than what it says for any mid-course maneuvers. Also, use something like kerbal alarm clock to get the launch windows to other planets right to use the least delta-v possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T02:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI generally allocate anywhere from 5% to 15% extra delta-V for the inevitable corrections. 5% extra for around Kerbin operations because it\u0027s so easy to be precise and pick up the Kerbals in the case of a mishap, and 15% for trips to Moho where you never can be sure how hard you\u0027ll have to brake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only use delta-V maps for landing guesstimates; I find them a bit too optimistic regarding everything else.

Similarly, for landers, I\u0027ll aim for ~25-50% extra, since I take the \u0022slow and steady\u0022 approach to landing most of the time rather than relying on hair-trigger suicide burns. For takeoff after landing, I\u0027ll typically add another 10% extra or so (since it\u0027s not as critical to have a buffer as it is for landings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, these are very approximate guidelines, and sometimes I\u0027ll use more or less buffer depending on how confident I am with a given target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T02:11:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the reccomendations!

Sometimes its enough. Sometimes it isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have found that the latest iteration of the delta-V map is a bit more accurate than previous versions; the nice thing about it is that it also includes the amount of delta-V required for orbital plane changes.
