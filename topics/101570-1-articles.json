This craft is can actually more efficient and way better, although it does have more parts. In the past, I have created perfectly functional crafts, but they do look like examples why the current aerodynamic system isn\u0027t a system ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Now I\u0027m starting to make better ones and, of course, way better looking. If you actually try to bring 36 tons to orbit, you may notice that it has way too much spare fuel. So, you may be able to actually bring more than 36 tons, if you can fit it into the cargo bays.\n\n[**Download**](http://www./download/720sc77pd8jnd9z/Naga\u002B-\u002B36\u002Bton\u002BSSTO.craft)\n\nAction Groups:\n\n1 - toggle all Jet Engines\n\n2 - toggle all Rocket Engines\n\n0 - toggle Cargo Bay doors\n\n![gb7PlUH.png](http://i.imgur.com/gb7PlUH.png)\n\n![gUDK2p4.png](http://i.imgur.com/gUDK2p4.png)\n\n![Rf9Fv2F.png](http://i.imgur.com/Rf9Fv2F.png)\n\nAlso, when you land, you will end up having the craft\u0027s butt wanting to scrap the ground, so you want to pitch down slightly and when stopping, the butt will go down, but nothing bad should happen.\n\n![HkYhlEu.png](http://i.imgur.com/HkYhlEu.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T23:39:09Z","Content":"That is awesome!

They are were I hid the clipped wings too, in the small fuel area in front of the wings ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
