I built the module and started recording, but then partway through the trip to Duna I got a couple of neat ideas to do things differently. I felt like the video woulda been kinda boring the way it was. So as it stands right now I need to rebuild part of the module (the probe that\u0027s going down go the surface) and rerecord everything. It won\u0027t take long, but unfortunately I\u0027m busy with work for the rest of the weekend. I\u0027ll get it done on Monday for sure! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still need to update the opening post and get in touch with some othsr KSP youtubers, too.
