Not only is this annoying for mod authors but it also means that relevant information about\u00A0bugs in CKANs infrastructure don\u0027t reach the appropriate ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeing as it has recently been made a rule that you cannot repeatedly ask about addon-updates I would like to propose that you cannot badger modauthors about CKAN unless they clearly state in their OP that they are the ones handling, or have an interest in the,\u00A0CKAN metadata for their mod.
