We will inevetably move towards a model akin to that of nature; every material is a resource for another material. As mining will become more expensive and essentially is finite, we will start shifting existing materials around. Production and refinement is likely to be much more local, as resources will at that stage be fairly equally distributed around the globe through the industrial and transportational efforts we see today. This will also mean the cost of a product is purely based on the energy it takes to make instead of the cost of transport and things like that. This will be augmented by the further development of 3D-printers and the capability to manipulate materials on a molecular level (very local and small scale production) and open-source information though the internet combined with smart and easy computer aided design (no dominating brands making you pay for designs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as we are able to develop a cheap and virtually infinite energy source in the form of renewable energy or nuclear fusion, products will barely cost anything. Discarding them will not have the negative consequences they have today, as all parts will be directly or indirectly recycled into a new product. The whole process will go full cycle - at some point in the far future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA major advantage to go along with these developments is a lot more stability on a world scale; instead of countries fighting over resources, trading rights and routes (a, if not \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E, major source of conflict today) the resources and production are much more evenly distributed across the world. Local conflicts will not affect the rest of the world as they do now and rebuilding afterwards will be relatively painless.
