And 2) If you can get a nuclear engine on a space plane you can really go places, but more than one is a waste of mass. 3) Given how planes work you usually have to choose between 2 jets and 1 nuke or 1 nuke and 2 jets. Both solutions violate items 1 or 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I made this guy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.minus.com/jbgNkueF11jWTi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jbgNkueF11jWTi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI call it Omnidirect. I think it\u0027s a fun idea! and solves the problems I mentioned. It\u0027s a little tricky getting him to orbit, as there\u0027s this very tense moment where you have to spin, and you\u0027re still inside the atmosphere (slightly). But it works.

I thought the atmosphere was making it hard to turn but it really doesn\u0027t do anything. But it\u0027s still a race against your apogee, you have to turn as fast as you can before you reach it and hope the nuclear engine will have enough time to push it forward before starting to descent again. I added a bit more fuel on the new version and it\u0027s harder to get it to orbit but I got plus 200m/s dv (not sure if that\u0027s worth it)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space.exe","CreatedById":132688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T01:53:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could use it to get to a station and make it a interplanetary plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
