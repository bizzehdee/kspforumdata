When using the jet engine get the apoapsis as high as you can, around 75km if you can and coast above 50km before switching to rockets. The rocket engines will get your apoapsis to 100km, (if you\u0027re good enough you can get an apoapsis of 100km with jet engines alone).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final burn you make at the 100km apoapsis is entirely dependant on how high the periapsis is. If you flew well enough to get the periapsis as high as 35km then the final burn will only be in the region of 50 deltaV but it takes a lot of horizontal flying and speed to achieve that, (with small planes you may even run out of jet fuel). Getting your periapsis to -50km is quicker and more achievable, (that\u0027s what I use), and you will still only need 150 deltaV to get that final orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to look at it, particularly if you are not using mechjeb, is to climb quickly to 10km and then set the glide angle of your plane so that the yellow pro-grade marker is at 10 degrees. You may need to angle the plane 20 degrees to get the prograde marker at 10 degrees but it depends on how much thrust your jet engine has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, light weight is not always better. I like the challenge of building light planes but sometimes they are so light the plane ends up with a very large thrust to weight ratio and you end up flying out of the atmosphere before you have had a chance to go more horizontal to raise your periapsis which means you will have to spend more deltaV using the rocket engines to achieve a circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sploden","CreatedById":54111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T21:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NikkyD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NikkyD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThose tiny crafts are unmanned!

Continue connecting small struts towards the rear of the tank without allowing them to snap together, manually place them all. Now connect your turbojet to the back of the tank. Next you want to connect your nuke to the small strut that allows the tail of the engine to stick out a bit through the turbojet. You may have to experiment a bit as if you get it wrong it will either be to tail heavy or explode on ignition.
