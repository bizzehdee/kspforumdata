I go straight up like a rocket, im more worried about final speed n altitude, because thats what really saves me delta-V for creating a stable orbit. I admit, that here there is a benefit of having less weight (small caps) but ill have to see how much v-max it costs me.\n\nThe wings, tbh i just took the best normal wings and accepted it. I realized later that i dont really need them... i just want it to look like a plane, at least a bit.

It looked to me like you are trying to build the lightest manned vanilla SSTO possible and that means using the Mk1 can not the MK2 cockpit. Atmo drag falls of at an exponential rate with altitude so if you climb very quickly past 5,000 meters then you won\u0027t have much extra drag to deal with. The 400 extra KG of the MK2 cockpit matters a lot more at higher altitude then the drag. The higher drag will probably help with landing as well."},{"CreatedByName":"NikkyD","CreatedById":97466,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T19:14:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Mass matters more then drag.

When using the jet engine get the apoapsis as high as you can, around 75km if you can and coast above 50km before switching to rockets. The rocket engines will get your apoapsis to 100km, (if you\u0027re good enough you can get an apoapsis of 100km with jet engines alone).\n\nThe final burn you make at the 100km apoapsis is entirely dependant on how high the periapsis is. If you flew well enough to get the periapsis as high as 35km then the final burn will only be in the region of 50 deltaV but it takes a lot of horizontal flying and speed to achieve that, (with small planes you may even run out of jet fuel). Getting your periapsis to -50km is quicker and more achievable, (that\u0027s what I use), and you will still only need 150 deltaV to get that final orbit.\n\nAnother way to look at it, particularly if you are not using mechjeb, is to climb quickly to 10km and then set the glide angle of your plane so that the yellow pro-grade marker is at 10 degrees. You may need to angle the plane 20 degrees to get the prograde marker at 10 degrees but it depends on how much thrust your jet engine has.\n\nFinally, light weight is not always better. I like the challenge of building light planes but sometimes they are so light the plane ends up with a very large thrust to weight ratio and you end up flying out of the atmosphere before you have had a chance to go more horizontal to raise your periapsis which means you will have to spend more deltaV using the rocket engines to achieve a circular orbit.\n\nHope that helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"sploden","CreatedById":54111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T21:05:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Those tiny crafts are unmanned!

I think this is due to an in-built speed limit in the game with jets and without any more speed the periapsis won\u0027t go up. A 70-30 orbit is still a very good orbit and you\u0027ll probably only need a small amount of deltaV to make it circular.

You just can\u0027t get it higher than the atmosphere: you can never get periapsis up higher than where you are when you\u0027re thrusting, and with jets, you can only really thrust within the atmosphere.\n\nNikkyD: why do intakes store air is because it simplifies the implementation. IntakeAir just behaves like a fuel that is stored and moved to the engines that need it using the same code that\u0027s used for monopropellant and electricity.
