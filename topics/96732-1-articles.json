Jool is an analogue to Jupiter, and Kerbol to our Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJupiter has zones and belts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.vcse.hu/images/jupiter_zona_sav.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jupiter_zona_sav.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wisp.physics.wisc.edu/astro104/lecture20/F13_11.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022F13_11.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest 3 places for Kerbals to visit: \u003Cstrong\u003Ezones\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Ebelts\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Epoles\u003C/strong\u003E. These things are very different, physically and chemically. Poles are places of additional phenomena related to electromagnetism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Kerbol, stars also have various parts on their surfaces. Kerbol is static, but it could have \u003Cstrong\u003Eequatorial photosphere\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Emiddle photosphere\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Epolar photosphere\u003C/strong\u003E. Each latitude of a star rotates at a different rate, so the equator is different from the rest, and poles are even more special.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T06:58:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this. I already missed it with jool. I mean it\u0027s a rly cool planet and since jool is the only gas giant it\u0027s one of the most interesting and unique places to visit. Visiting all the biomes of kerbol should be quite interesting aswell, and challenging. A polar orbit around kerbol should be quite heavy on the d-v budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think an overhaul of the textures for both would be required though. Atm stock jool is not that pretty, at least not if you\u0027ve ever seen what a texture mod can do. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I don\u0027t want to melt the older pc\u0027s graphics cards. if it looked a little less like a dirty ball of green whool and a little more like an atmosphere with cloud layers (not actually clouds, just \u0022rings\u0022 paralel to the equator) it would look a lot better\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T17:22:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrue, it would be better if it had more defined zones and belts, but it\u0027s already a decent candidate for this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
