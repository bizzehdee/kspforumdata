Part of KSP\u0027s lasting appeal for me is that it\u0027s open-ended, you\u0027re never finished, and the only goals are those you set for yourself.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of the problem with career mode right now is that the progression is limited to UNLOCK ALL THE NODES. Budgets might help, but I have a distinct feeling that veteran players who want a challenging experience are going to be required to mod the game. Add on to that the real issue with this game: once you know your way around it and the parts, it\u0027s not exactly \u0022challenging\u0022 anyway, at least if you want to retain the sandbox flavour instead of having a \u0022guess what I \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E want you to build now\u0022 sort of mind-reading progression.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T08:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou guys are so anxious. Just where do you get the idead that everyone interested in career mode is wanting to grind again and again through a techtree? Or that the techtree is the point of the game? Those ideas are completely absurd. And budgests won\u0027t only help, they are the main element of the career. That\u0027s where KSP get will get an additional level of complexity, and therefore more challenge.

I\u0027ve played through career mode a couple of times, and once I reach a certain point in the tech tree it just makes sense to keep using the same design over and over, and it winds up as a science point grind. By the time you unlock enough of the 2.5m parts to actually make a working ship, it\u0027s almost done anyway. I just keep using the same 1.25m design until the tree is filled out. From that point on, it\u0027s just sandbox with science reports. I think that contracts and budgets are going to add a whole new level to career, but until then I just keep horsing around in sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T07:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECareer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(one word is apparently too short to post, but this should do it :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jean Deaux","CreatedById":59842,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T11:42:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI enjoy the career mode only because of the open science facility.
