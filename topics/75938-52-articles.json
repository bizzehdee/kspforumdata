It\u0027s like one side has a ball and the other side sorta snaps onto the ball to create a rather free-moving joint.

Unfortunately, like normal docking parts, it also had the tendency to try and straighten out whenever possible, so the connection is far from free-moving. Otherwise you could connect a free-moving docking plate with an unpowered hinge to create a hitch that would be able to move around freely without trying to re-center itself. However, that would not create the prettiest of solutions unless you tried to combine those functions into a single set of docking ports.
