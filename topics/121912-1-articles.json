You\u0027ll get reentry effects all the way to orbit, and your rocket is probably going to be a few degrees from exploding due to overheating on every single part, but you\u0027ll have spent less than 3000 m/s that way. Not sure what the record is, might be as low as ~2600 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic gist is that engines firing in the vertical is wasteful. Every second you spend vertical, you give away 10 m/s dV without getting anything in return, just like that. It is spent just to maintain the status quo versus gravity. On a normal ascent, those gravity losses are easily 4-5 times as high as drag losses. So in order to save dV, you want to minimize gravity losses first and foremost. The way to do that is obvious: don\u0027t burn vertically. You want to turn over as soon as you can, as hard as you can. This of course means that your rocket is going to fall back to the ground... \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E you accelerate so fast that your rocket doesn\u0027t have time to fall. That\u0027s why you need the absurd TWR. Now, accelerating hard low in the atmosphere does give you a lot of extra drag losses. But since gravity losses are so much greater than drag losses to begin with, the trade is generally going to go in your favor.

That being said, from a payload and cost perspective, I don\u0027t think you should ever throttle back a liquid fueled engine. If it is necessary to throttle back, that just means the engine is bigger than it needs to be. The biggest payload that a particular engine can lift into orbit comes when you load up on fuel to the point that you bring your liftoff TWR down to nearly 1.2. You then run at full throttle the whole way. The low TWR results in significant gravity losses, but with all that extra fuel (which is cheap) you can burn longer and lift a big payload for a low unit cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T14:39:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OhioBob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OhioBob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...snip...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027m sure its not the most efficient route under any context, but it works very consistently with any craft I fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you not get significant drag losses at full burn all the way?
