Makes the large distance I\u0027m currently travelling seem much less boring.\n\n![1909277_896133623763091_1202490070096717839_o.jpg](https://scontent-dfw1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/t31.0-8/1909277_896133623763091_1202490070096717839_o.jpg)\n\n![11313082_896133627096424_8640357458333922222_o.jpg](https://scontent-dfw1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/t31.0-8/11313082_896133627096424_8640357458333922222_o.jpg)\n\nGranted, anyone who make a rover with a command pod kind of already got this sort of experience, but even so.

I bring along a couple of ground pylons (the KAS one works best) to rest the rover base on. This stops it from falling through the ground and makes it easier to attach parts to it. And after your done, all you have to do is move the pylons out of the way and bam, it drops down like a dainty butterfly lol. (I also found this construction platform technique useful for any sort of in-situ rover construction)"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T00:50:07Z","Content":"Takeoffs using hullcam are also a one of a kind experience, it must double (at least) ones sense of immersion!\n\n[![zTPABGY.png](http://i.imgur.com/zTPABGY.png)](http://imgur.com/zTPABGY)"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T00:56:07Z","Content":"Oooh, I gotta try that.
