Unfortunately I came across the segment halfway through and was doing something else at the time, so only half watching, meaning I missed crucial details.... like the name, developer, and any information which would have been helpful to Google. I liked what little I saw though.\n\nI went looking for this cool space game. But, had little to go on, unfortunately \u0022Space\u0022 and \u0022Game\u0022... do not limit hits in google as much as you would think. \n\nBecause of the sketchy graphical details I saw, I thought it might be a smart phone game. Thought it would be cool to launch rockets while on the train to work. But alas, could not find it. \n\nEventually I saw it on Steam Early access, bought it... the only early access game I\u0027ve bought. My love for it is strong, even though the frequency I play it ebbs and flows. I find I\u0027ll playing it feverishly for a couple of weeks, then peter out... I\u0027ll play other things, then.... a vision.... an invention, or design will come to me in my sleep... and before you know it I\u0027ll be right back again. Its very much a \u0022project\u0022 based game. \n\nAnyway... musing over."},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T06:05:39Z","Content":"Mister \u0022Hello Procrastinators!\u0022 was responsible for my affliction.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T15:16:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by T-Bouw**\n  \nTypo"},{"CreatedByName":"AndyMt","CreatedById":123144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T07:18:27Z","Content":"I actually came accross it when SpaceX tried their very first \u0022first stage\u0022 ocean touchdown in September 2013.
