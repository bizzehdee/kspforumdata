This should only take an hour or so of your time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on a rough simulation on a mission to Alpha Centauri and would like some help. Back of a napkin calculation says it should be possible with existing rockets, I\u0027m also setting the mission up using NASA\u0027s General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT), but a second set of eyeballs is always welcome. So, I thought, what better tool than KSP?! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission is to send a 50kg payload into a direct ascent solar escape trajectory towards Alpha Centauri at 50 km/s, i.e. no gravity-assist trajectory around Jupiter etc. and using chemical rockets only. And don\u0027t forget that Alpha Centauri lies outside of the Earth\u0027s orbital plane. From GMAT, it looks like it\u0027s generally in the southwest with respect to the Earth\u0027s axis of rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi60.tinypic.com/j5ce88.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022j5ce88.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I initially considered a direct ascent escape trajectory is because the target star system is out of the solar system\u0027s planetary plane, but you\u0027re certainly welcomed to try a gravity assist trajectories via the Moon, Venus or Mercury. The velocity gain from \u0022falling towards\u0022 the Sun might indeed be quite significant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, again, here\u0027s the mission parameters:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Spacecraft dry mass: 50 kg \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Min. Velocity (after final burn of upper / kick stage): 50 km/s \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Existing launch vehicles preferred: Soyuz, Proton M, Delta IV, Atlas V, SpaceX Falcon etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease post your results of velocity achieved with the type / fuel mass of launch vehicle used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecorous\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
