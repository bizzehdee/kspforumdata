And it\u0027s not just industry; everyone who has a materials science department is scrambling to get Carbon-Nanotubes into a shippable product. Purity is a MAJOR issue as any lattice defects or bonding issues make the whole fiber useless and the fact you\u0027re working with something so small means introducing defects is rather easy.

It\u0027s more than just nanotubes, nevermind that making nanotubes of arbitrary length is a \u003Cem\u003Ehuge \u003C/em\u003Echallenge in itself. A space elevator may \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E be practical, in fact, due to reusable rockets getting cheaper all the time. Before\u00A0we get to the point where we could make nanotubes of sufficient length, we might start building everything\u003Cem\u003E in \u003C/em\u003Espace, and reusable orbital ships would be so cheap that passenger transport would not justify investing in an elevator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClaiming that they are \u0022near future\u0022 is utter malarkey. They\u0027re about as far a future as you can get. They also certainly don\u0027t compare to mass drivers, which are already used on a small scale (on the other hand, they aren\u0027t so hot of an idea, though they do have their uses).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xurkitree","CreatedById":187694,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-08T14:45:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think we\u0027re missing the point of the topic here - this is a discussion on whether we should have Space Elevators and Mass Drives\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eingame\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003Eor not.

One could use it for quick and easier returns or launching resources to orbit with minimal fuel. Having them on kerbin is a terrible idea since the atmosphere would probably break them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-08T15:20:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223668883\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188084\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221567953944\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022187694\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xurkitree\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n31 minutes ago, Xurkitree said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think we\u0027re missing the point of the topic here - this is a discussion on whether we should have Space Elevators and Mass Drives\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eingame\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003Eor not.
