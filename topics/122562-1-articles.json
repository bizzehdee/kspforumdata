I\u0027m simply reluctant as heck to scrap all these contracts. I put a lot of work and money into them. However I guess my question has more to do with what my methods will be in the future regarding recovery missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote - I do have Kerbal Inventory System, but no engineers in the barn right now to go up and try to fix things. However I do suppose I could wait a couple of weeks in game time for an engineer to return to Kerban. But even then, how would he be able to rendezvous with ships on elliptical orbits returning from the Mun and Minmus? And also, after sending off a truly massive expedition to Duna and Ike during this same period, I now only have $450,000 in funds left. So this has all become a huge pain in the rear to deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any information or suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T21:43:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 09:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by seamutt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manaiaK","CreatedById":129599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T07:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have recovered a few parts using the klaw and parachute on a capsule method, and all the contracts have completed OK despite, er, \u0022rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022 on landing a couple of times (the parts didn\u0027t explode, the joints failed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not using KIS though, just KER and Alarm Clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope someone more knowledgeable helps you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T07:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlace chutes near the klaws, keep it at the same side of CoM as the rescue part.

As suggested, I just F5 saved and decided to see what would happen. I did not fool around with trying to add more parachutes using KIS, etc.. Here\u0027s the report:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbodyne S3-3000 Fuel Tank - \u003C/strong\u003EThis was my first recovered part try, and as mentioned nothing seemed to work here. I got the impact speed down to 3.8 (this part has a listed impact tolerance of 6.0), and it was still no go. I just cancelled the mission. One further thought occurred to me, though. Perhaps the tank had fuel in it and that made a difference. With a fuel tank recovery it might help transferring the fuel out before touchdown. The claw connection can apparently do this. If you have the \u0022TAC Fuel Balancer\u0022 mod (with it\u0027s dump feature), it would be easy. Otherwise, maybe not so easy if you don\u0027t have enough space in your primary vehicles tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPoodle Engine - \u003C/strong\u003EImpact Tolerance 8.0, my touchdown was at 6.8.

As I saw mentioned in a few other posts and videos, many of these recovery contracts, and especially parts in Kerbin orbit, pay extremely poorly. They are probably best avoided in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
