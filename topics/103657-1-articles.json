If the wall and clock are transparent, then looking from \u0022behind\u0022 the wall, the hands are moving counterclockwise. Normal clocks only go clockwise by convention of looking at them from the front.\n\nThe same goes for planets. \n\n1) Find the axis of rotation. (Nothing to do with magnetic fields. Look at the rotation of the body).\n\n2) You can look at the planet from either end of the spin axis. Looking back along one pole, the planet rotates clockwise. Looking back along the opposite pole, the planet rotates counterclockwise. Clockwise is a matter of perspective. \n\n3) The oriented reference plane mentioned above is the plane through the equator of the planet, and by convention, the up direction (the orientation) from the equatorial plane is the direction along the spin axis from which, if you looked back down at the planet, the planet rotates counterclockwise. For the Earth and the Sun and most planets, we call that direction North. Not magnetic north, but true north.\n\n4) If the angle between a planet\u0027s north spin axis is within 90 degrees of its north orbital axis, then the planet orbits and rotates in the same sense. If you looked at Uranus from north of the ecliptic, the surface would appear to (very modestly) rotate counter to the direction of its orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T07:40:48Z","Content":"Thank you everybody, I think it\u0027s clear now why uranus has 97 tilt and why it rotates retrograde\n\nEven tho I understand it now, I think this can be misleading, and honestly I don\u0027t like it very much.\n\nBasically you have 2 \u0022variables\u0022 that are redundant ( tilt\u003E90 equals retrograde rotation and vice versa)\n\nAnd you lose the information about how much the axis got actully tilted overtime.\n\nTo explain:\n\nWhen you say earth has a 23 degrees tilt most people will imagine the axis being straight some time in fhe past and then it got tilted progressively untill it reached a 23 degrees angle.\n\nAnd this is consolidated when you explain the axial precession comparing earth to a spinning top.\n\nBy this logic, if you say venus has a 177 degrees tilt people will imagine the planet having flipped upside down between the time it was born and now. And if my knowledge about venus is correct, this is not the case.\n\nTo me it would look more normal to define the N pole as \u0022the original pole around which the (proto)planet rotated counterclockwise\u0022 and defining the tilt as the \u0022inclination between that axis (in its current position) and the ecliptic\u0022\n\nThe rotation would be prograde if the planet is still rotating counterclockwise around the N pole, retrograde if clockwise.\n\nWith this rule, venus would be a planet with a 3 degrees tilt and retrograde rotation\n\n(the most common theory is that it was rotating prograde, than slowed and turned retrograde)\n\nAnd uranus would be a planet with 97 degree tilt and prograde rotation\n\nEither because the planet formed from a weird cloud that was rotating that way already or because it was knocked around by an impact.\n\nAnyway since all the major moons are orbiting prograde to the planet I think it could mean that at some point there was an accretion disc rotating that way.\n\nMaybe there\u0027s something wrong in this method, I\u0027m no astronomer/physicist.\n\nBut to me looks more intuitive\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T08:01:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 08:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sigma88**"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T12:34:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Why is that Uranus is considered having a 97\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 tilt and retrograde rotation?\n\u003E couldn\u0027t it be that the planet has a 83\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 tilt and prograde rotation?\n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a reason why they chose the North pole to be *that one* and not the other one?\n\u003E \n\u003E I feel like I\u0027m missing something, but I can\u0027t find any explanation\n\nFrom what I read about Earth its tilt is changing over time, so maybe Uranus is still in prograde rotation just its tilt is changing faster."},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T12:52:20Z","Content":"\u003E It still feels wrong to be honest\n\nI know, but you should be honest anyway.
