If they can get the private sector to work on it, they absolutely will.

Sadly there\u0027s an US law which forbids NASA from doing anything at all with China, but ESA has indicated a level of interest.

They tend to use the graveyard orbit for old satellites and is take care so you don\u0027t get tings blowing up there as this might well affect their bottom line, it might also give problems with various governments.\n\nFishing is probably an million minor actors, overfishing is also managable in well regulated areas, an serious problem in international water where its less control and outside corrupt states where anybody can either buy and license under the table or pay off the coast guard."}]}
