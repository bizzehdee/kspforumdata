A ping sent out would echo, naturally, with a 1/4 to 1/2 second pause before the next ping was emitted after the echo was received? Being radar waves propagate at 10^8 m/s, a bit quick for the purposes I\u0027m imagining here, perhaps a reduced propagation rate could be utilized, like, say, the speed of sound (340.29 m/s, at sea level)? For docking purposes, and just for cool effect, I would think that would work nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, left up to the developer, it could be linked/tied to the docking camera addon, \u003Cem\u003Eor\u003C/em\u003E as a new part to be incorporated into the Tech Tree ... a nifty little dish or array panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeedback/opinions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T08:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111519-Proximity-Sensor-For-Switching-Action-Groups\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESounds like a job for the Proximity Sensor.\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T08:48:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need to calculate echo ping assuming a propagation rate, or make the echoes directly audible (the last part, even IRL).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest to code the distance value into the pulse rate of the beeps.
