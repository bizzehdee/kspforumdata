laptop (where this 1.3.0 version install and save originated) and my desktop (previously hosting a 1.2.2 install, which will likely remain intact).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m doing this in part to be able to directly compare performance between the laptop (Core i7-3520M, dual core 2.9 GHz with 3.5 GHz max turbo, 8 GB RAM, Intel graphics) and the desktop (Core2Quad 2.7 GHz, 8 GB RAM, nVidia GTx750, soon to be upgraded to AMD FX8350, 8 cores, 4.0 GHz w/ overclock capability, 16 GB RAM, same graphics), both before and after the upgrade -- and in part just to be able to play the same save comfortably, at home, on my big monitor, but still be able to play it on my laptop when I\u0027m out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are probably multiple ways to do this, but the one I\u0027ve chosen is to use my Google Drive, already set up at the 200 GB size to accommodate automatic\u00A0 backups for my laptop as the shared storage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows users could use the Google Drive app, which automatically maintains a local copy of the cloud drive and synchronizes both ways, but Google Drive for Linux doesn\u0027t exist in a usable form.\u00A0 I already have both machines set up with google-drive-ocamlfuse, which makes the remote storage look and act like a local folder, but doesn\u0027t synchronize the data, instead doing all loads and saves through the network, treating the cloud storage as a network drive (NAS or similar).\u00A0 This, however, seems likely to be very slow starting up KSP -- the 2\u002B GB for my save (with Better Burn Time as the only mod) must be loaded into RAM on every program start, and doing this through a 150 Mb/s wifi connection (likely further throttled by Starbucks when I\u0027m there) seems likely to significantly protract the \u0022loading hints\u0022 stage of startup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, there are several choices available to allow a Linux system to maintain two-way sync between two folders, local or remote.\u00A0 For my setup, guided by a handy answer on askubuntu.com, I\u0027ve chosen Unity, a mature and maintained free utility that, after a simple setup, will continuously sync my local KSP_Linux folder with a matching folder on the Google Drive cloud, and thence to the other machine (I routinely leave both machines running 24/7 because they also run BOINC @Home distributed computing tasks).\u00A0 Unity has an easy GUI setup and controls, automatically handles empty (newly created) folders at one end of the link (meaning I needn\u0027t manually propagate the save), and is available from the same repositories used by a default Ubuntu (or other Debian) distro, so may be assumed to\u00A0 be safe and reasonably reliable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve chosen to mirror the entire install -- there\u0027s a remote possibility of this causing issues if I set screen resolution on one machine outside the capabilities of the display or graphics system on the other, but I normally play in a window at modest resolution, so don\u0027t anticipate this being a problem.\u00A0 The up side is, if I choose to install a mod (say, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E or RP-0, which I\u0027ve considered) it will automatically be present on both machines.\u00A0 If I create a sub-folder so as to have saves both with and without certain mods, they\u0027ll take up extra space on the Google Drive, but my backups are currently using only 4 GB of the 200 GB I\u0027m paying for ($2/mo as of Jan. 2018), and a base install of KSP takes up between 2 and 3 GB, so I have room for a fair amount of this if I choose, and I can use different launchers on my desktop or menu to select the different installs.\u00A0 This also ensures I have matching versions of KSP itself and any installed mods -- no downloading a mod on one machine to find it\u0027s incompatible with the one installed two days before on the other, because of an update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure. over the course of a year or so, a thumb drive would be cheaper, and likely would sync faster (even a low-cost thumb drive has a higher data rate than 801-N wifi, though slower than my 1 Gb/s ethernet and comparable to the 300 Mb/s of my internet service), but this solution avoids the potential of a lost or corrupted thumb drive (and Ubuntu is notorious for marking thumb drives as read-only for no apparent reason, which costs time to correct even if it\u0027s as easy as logging out of Ubuntu and back in) -- and doesn\u0027t require me to remember to bring the thumb drive with me, even if it\u0027s not actually lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-28T15:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would do the
