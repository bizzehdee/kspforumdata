Since I did so, Mapsat runs perfect on my Ubuntu 13.10, x86_64 machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I looked into the old source of Mapsat and checked, if I can find the reason for this behaviour. I found there, that \u0027Hilo.dat\u0027 is written with capital \u0027H\u0027. It seems that ISA_MapGen.exe (I use it, as found on another forum entry, on Linux with mono) uses hilo.dat without cap \u0027H\u0027. Maybe, if it\u0027s still the same reason why hilo.dat is not accepted by MapSat 4.0 in Linux (game crashes on switch to launch pad) you might take care of that in future versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the really nice Plugin! :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHandir\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Catullus","CreatedById":51486,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T15:12:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry making a hard link from hilo.dat to Hilo.dat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T16:40:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDabbling around in modding myself, but some of the folk on the fora these days are seriously making think about not bothering...~I don\u0027t really want orders coming at me from the internet, of all places, telling me which bit of my behaviour is baffling,what my motivations are or for me to get of my *behind* and do some work...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESOMETHING baffling is going on here, but its not insewerants\u0027s behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T17:21:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMany mod makers are simple hobbyists tinkering with games they play, and who will leave them behind. I think people find these the most troublesome because they\u0027ll drop something promising, support it for a while and then drift off. I think what you are seeing is basically brand loyalty. The lord built a town and showed it to the people, but up and left without someone to maintain it and so it crumbles away until forgotten. Most people don\u0027t want to build a new town, they just want upkeep and progress on their current town. I admit I find it amazing to see how entitled some users can be\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACit is rude to tell the maker how to spend their time and demand of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, providing something for public use inherently comes with its own share of responsibility. Choosing to release your work means you need to be upfront about your position, \u0022Hey guys, this is just some tinkering I did. Keep in mind I may flake whenever.\u0022 or to accept that burden of responsibility by telling people when you no longer do and taking down the project. Whether you like it or not, people may very well come to depend on what you built and I don\u0027t get paid is a piss-poor excuse; an author who doesn\u0027t want attention or the pressure to perform should simply be upfront about it or keep their work to themselves. The larger your mod, the more people who are bound to use it to define their game and slowly it becomes a sort of social obligation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the Minecraft Forge for example. If development on that simply ceased, it would deal a devastating blow to the modding community. To choose to be a member there is to shoulder a very large chunk of responsibility. It is truly a unpaid job. Now, I won\u0027t tell you who is right. When the players are not customers, they have no bargaining leverage. But to simply say the community is acting churlish because they expect a project to be continued is not unreasonable. Be wary of those who latch and follow, they are a gift and your burden. You don\u0027t get to choose your community, you only get to choose how you interact with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarrow","CreatedById":33293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T17:51:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eproviding something for public use inherently comes with its own share of responsibility\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the record - Innswerants isn\u0027t completely inactive.
