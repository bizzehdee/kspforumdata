I have very little experience with this kind of contract. I only took the one with the whole joolian system. And when I took that one I had my scansat probe scanning the last moon of Jool so it was an instant completion. So am I correct to guess the order doesn t matter at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen would it be a problem if I dock the vessel several times to different refueling stations around the system? Would it lose its status as a single vessel doing the challenge?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I modify the vessel in the middle of the challenge? For example, my first thought was to use xenon. Do the celestial bodies from moho to kerbin. Once around kerbin I would do some eva work on it to add more solar panels and maybe that radioisotope thingy. Would modifying the vessel mid course be a problem? Or as long as the probe core makes it to the end it doesn t matter if I modify the rest? If so it s not risky to dock that probe to another mission for any transfer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally it doesnt display a deadline but it doesn t display the usual \u0027Never expires\u0027 message so should I worry about a deadline that doesn t display properly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally any tips/ suggestion is more than welcome. If you did the challenge already I d like to see how you did it, your design, maybe a log of the total amount of DeltaV spent. Any help is welcome.
