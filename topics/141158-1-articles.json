Elon says numbers and things that while are not outright lies often take about twice as long as he said to happen.

During the 60s NASA got about 4.5% MAX of the federal budget (which was lower back then) (and about 2x what they currently get when adjusted to 2014 USD). \u00A0SpaceX is not totally relying on governmental money to do this (yes they have contracts with the government and got some money to make the rockets in the first place but not all that much)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Please dont bring Politics into this. what the candidates will or wont do is largely irrelevant. NASA has had HUGE effects on technology and science and thus is not likely to be totally dismantled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Rockets fail all the time. another failure will not doom SpaceX just like all the Proton Failures have not doomed that rocket. Also The government will continue to buy launches for them if they think the pricing is right for the risks they are taking. if they want a surefire launch they will go with ULA. If they accept the risks of SpaceX and want to launch on a not quite perfect vehicle at a MUCH lower cost (60 Mil vs 120 Mil for comparable Masses to orbit)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Depending on the mission you can do a LOT with a single launch. My Senior Design project (for an aerospace engineering degree) was a Mars Sample Return Mission (unmanned) we could fit absolutely everything we needed into a single Ariane V launch. \u00A0The lander and the orbiter were two totally separate spacecraft all for a low cost of 3.12 Billion dollars. (which over the ~8 year lifespan of the mission (from start of design\u00A0to landing) \u00A0is not a ton) .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. We dont know what SpaceX\u0027s mars plans really are. \u00A0We will find out in September when they announce more of the MCT and BFR architecture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. SpaceX does the (seemingly) impossible. No one thought that you could land a stage on a barge out in the middle of the Atlantic or bring it back to land with out huge costs. \u00A0No one really thought that they could build a rocket that performs as well as the falcon for less that 100 million a launch (and there are still conspiracy theorists that think SpaceX is loosing money on every launch because their rocket really costs over 100 million).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. the government can complain all it wants or try to stop them, they wont though because SpaceX is an American company and it would be a lot better for Americans to do it before the Russians or the Chinese (who are planning to get to mars by the 2030s). \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9. the first unmanned missions that SpaceX flies to Mars will be on the F9 and Falcon Heavy. any manned missions will be flown on the MCT/BFR (which has already been confirmed to be larger than the Saturn V). \u00A0And there has been a lot of advancement in materials and rocket technology since the 60s.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10. SpaceX has plenty of money sitting around and more will be forthcoming. \u00A0They have a very profitable earth launching business which they are using to subsidize the development of needed technologies. Also SpaceX breaks the current Aerospace methodology by being able to do things at a MUCH lower cost than anyone else in the industry (mainly by being well vertically integrated).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-04T19:50:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2016 07:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by B787_300\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T18:37:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222615365\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141158\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464995786\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111598\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LordFerret\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, LordFerret said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, the artist\u0027s interpretation of the NASA Space Launch System Block 1 looks \u003Cem\u003Eright out of KSP\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/0.23.5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eis a reason for this\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for whether Musk himself will go?
