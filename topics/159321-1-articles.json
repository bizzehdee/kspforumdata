The light wash shining down on the top of the station segment delivery stage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt appeared as if someone was shining a flashlight down on my\u00A0spacecraft. I looked up but there was nothing there. This could not have been another craft as the station and delivery stage did not have any lights on them. This happend to me twice. One time at night and the other time during the day. Anyone else been experiencing these lights? Any idea what these lights are? Are the kerbals alone in their universe?\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u00A0Could this be linked to the SSTV and face on duna?
