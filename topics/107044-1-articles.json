It doesn\u0027t affect my flight, but its quite annoying. I can\u0027t tell if its the craft or the camera. Can someone tell me how to fix this? Thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceTiger","CreatedById":133800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:31:02Z","Content":"In the settings under \u0022Gameplay\u0022 move the slider named \u0022Camera Wobble (External views)\u0022 all the way to the left (0.0) and it wont wobble anymore."},{"CreatedByName":"Inteous","CreatedById":140691,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:45:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In the settings under \u0022Gameplay\u0022 move the slider named \u0022Camera Wobble (External views)\u0022 all the way to the left (0.0) and it wont wobble anymore.\n\n OMG Thanks!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"WOODY01","CreatedById":129358,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:48:41Z","Content":"Really think they should remove it, I turned it off once I figured out I could.

And interior-wise (IVA), this is how the shakes also manifest in flight sims, so it makes sense why they put it in. And yes of course, you can disable it.\n\nHowever I will repost what I said in another thread about the camera wobble, considering that I feel that its implementation is wrong.\n\nI think they should change the algorithm for the cam-float/shake though. Right now, what seems to be happening is, that the camera is pointed at a specific spot on your craft, and the wobble algorithm is applied and thus the shaking occurs with this fixed point as axis/fulcrum. This doesn\u0027t make it realistic like a camcorder shot. Camcorder shots are hand-held, thus the person shooting the scene always follows the subject, and there is a DELAY in trying to center the subject. Thus, a good algorithm change would be to have this fixed axis point a moving one, and it will be followed by another point which is the axis of the camera, and there should be lag, so that it would simulate someone\u0027s hand/eye lagging behind trying to film a craft and following it so it stays in-frame. I think this is how the XPlane external camera shake is done.\n\nOnce they do this change, it will really look like someone is holding up a GOPRO3 and filming the ship, which I would really like to see."},{"CreatedByName":"WOODY01","CreatedById":129358,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:20:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Actually, the camera shake is nice if you like a cinematic external view of your ship.
