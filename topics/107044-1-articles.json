It doesn\u0027t affect my flight, but its quite annoying. I can\u0027t tell if its the craft or the camera. Can someone tell me how to fix this?

Right now, what seems to be happening is, that the camera is pointed at a specific spot on your craft, and the wobble algorithm is applied and thus the shaking occurs with this fixed point as axis/fulcrum. This doesn\u0027t make it realistic like a camcorder shot. Camcorder shots are hand-held, thus the person shooting the scene always follows the subject, and there is a DELAY in trying to center the subject. Thus, a good algorithm change would be to have this fixed axis point a moving one, and it will be followed by another point which is the axis of the camera, and there should be lag, so that it would simulate someone\u0027s hand/eye lagging behind trying to film a craft and following it so it stays in-frame. I think this is how the XPlane external camera shake is done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce they do this change, it will really look like someone is holding up a GOPRO3 and filming the ship, which I would really like to see.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WOODY01","CreatedById":129358,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:20:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, the camera shake is nice if you like a cinematic external view of your ship.
