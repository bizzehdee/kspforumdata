(I assume you did not mean it that way, but writing has no body language, facial expression, or tone of voice to act as additional cues.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t speak for the OP, but I for one am not really a Gamer and don\u0027t generally know ANY keyboard shortcuts to ANY game. If it\u0027s not in the GUI it may as well not exist for me. And there is nothing intuitively obvious about any keyboard shortcut anywhere; they all have to be acquired through rote memorization. If the OP doesn\u0027t game outside KSP, s/he won\u0027t know these things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently this is a common computer-gaming convention, that F5 and F9 are keyboard shortcuts for Save and Load in most games. That\u0027s good info to have, and I\u0027ll try to keep that in mind if/when I get seduced into some game other than Civ and KSP. So, thanks for that. I learned something new (as I suspect the OP did as well).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T04:17:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
