I\u0027ve noticed the KSP diffuse is \u003Cem\u003Eslightly \u003C/em\u003E darker in the VAB, but apart from that they seem to render identically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any performance benefits using the official KSP shaders, and should I go through every part and re-export it correctly?

KSP shaders have few extras for Opacity and Rim Color/Falloff. Rim Color/Falloff allows for a kind of cartoony look on objects. But seems that look has been abandoned by Squad.
