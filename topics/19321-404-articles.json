I\u0027ve never taken any classes on aerodynamics or fluid dynamics, but I have taken classes on Physics, I have a computer science degree, and I do web development for a living. I\u0027ve also had friends that were taking classes dealing with dynamic systems. Let me just say, I would never have tried doing what Ferram has done, and I give him massive kudos for it. I\u0027ve heard that solving problems in dynamic systems is a a bear, and I know how even a simple script can drive you mad trying to debug it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what Solar is saying, there\u0027s an acronym I think you might want to look into, GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out.) From what I\u0027ve seen of the \u0022conversation\u0022 between you and ferram, I think you may need to look at brushing up on your physics, or maybe even actually talk to a pilot. Planes can slip, slide, and move around a lot during flight, look at examples of the X-31 flying around to see the more extreme things that can happen. Beyond that, though, this is a game. FAR may not be 100% accurate, but neither is any other simulation program out there. It can\u0027t because of the limitations of translating an analog system into a digital one. You simply can\u0027t achieve that kind of fidelity. It is, however, accurate enough to be fun, and that\u0027s what matters, to be honest. If you\u0027re having trouble getting things to fly or whatever, look at what\u0027s going wrong with the design first. More than likely, you\u0027ll see something you hadn\u0027t considered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, just wanted to say Thanks to Ferram for both FAR and KJR. And to Solar, lighten up dude. It\u0027s just a game, and if things bother you that badly, download unity and crack open some C# tutorials.
