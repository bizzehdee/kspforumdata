Tried varying periapsis between 0 and 30 km; you can work out the velocity from that. Ship is a Mk I command pod, with ablative tweaked to zero, stacked on top of a Science Jr. module, which is on top of a 1.25m heat shield (full ablative of course \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E).

By one metric of balance, if there *is* ablative shielding remaining by the time you hit the ground, that means it\u0027s too easy. That was the metric of the original DRE, if I recall; FAR lessens the danger considerably, so then people I think got used to having lots left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, of course, one very much *over*-shields crewed pods for safety; Apollo, for example, they speculate could have survived 4x? 6x? the heat load and flux.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, the lower the G, the higher the heat load but the lower the peak flux. A ballistic reentry will (excepting something strange like negative-lift reentry) have the highest G load for a given entry angle, and will always have the same heat load (the integration of flux over time; flux will decrease and time increase for shallower angles). A lifting reentry will keep you in the upper atmosphere longer, lowering Gs and having a lower peak flux (because you\u0027ve slowed down more by the time you hit the it), but a higher heat load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is shallower than Earth\u0027s, and entry velocity is only about a third Earth\u0027s (for LEO/LKO), the structural and crew-health limits that prevent high-G reentries don\u0027t apply as much, and therefore you can dramatically lower how much temperature change your pod undergoes by increasing the entry angle (due to how KSP models temperature, and how DRE was written around that, if you go for a steep reentry you will spend so much less time at high flux that you won\u0027t actually increase your temperature very much, even though notionally the heat load would be the same).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;q=\u0026amp;esrc=s\u0026amp;source=web\u0026amp;cd=3\u0026amp;cad=rja\u0026amp;uact=8\u0026amp;ved=0CCwQFjAC\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.faa.gov%2Fother_visit%2Faviation_industry%2Fdesignees_delegations%2Fdesignee_types%2Fame%2Fmedia%2FSection%2520III.4.1.7%2520Returning%2520from%2520Space.pdf\u0026amp;ei=nxgzVOXQAs6wyASfkoGIAg\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNENXEAVShaEaMsbaGECfvBr_fRsmQ\u0026amp;sig2=yBB3w6AaodyBeGBjc3P3fQ\u0026amp;bvm=bv.76802529,d.aWw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHERE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E is a nice booklet on reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esmart013: apologies: the easypeasy was not a swipe directed at you, or anyone else; it was merely a comment on how in prior versions it was entirely possible to make unshielded reentries, which more or less defeated the purpose of having shielding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertainly you should *not* be able to reenter engine-first and survive; that was going to change, whether by tweaking the heating model or adjusting the maximum temperature of various items or both (the latter is still planned, I think). Consider: there is no way an antenna should be able to survive until *twice* the melting point of aluminum (which is 660C, for reference). And yet even as modified by DRE, its max temperature is 1450C, I believe. Same for fuel tanks. Engines can only survive high temperatures inside their combustion chambers and nozzles through some serious work: regenerative cooling for the hotter ones like your Mainsail or LV-T30, ablative cooling for low-chamber-pressure-and-efficiency ones like the LV-1. So once they\u0027ve finished their burn and are turned off, their maximum temperature shouldn\u0027t be much more than 8-900C tops, I\u0027d say (a good bit less, considering all the exposed machinery that\u0027s not shielded by the nozzle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, it should still be possible to reenter with spent stages for reusability, you\u0027d just need to put a heatshield on the nose of the stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, it\u0027s worth noting that KSP makes things harder in a perhaps-unanticipated way: the pods have the masses their real life equivalents do, but they create less than half the drag (.64 the width/height/depth = .64*.64 the surface area = .41). That means a much worse reentry, where speed is kept high until much lower so your heat flux (roughly density^.5 * speed) is much higher.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-06T22:44:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2014 10:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NathanKell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T22:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure, it might seem fun with 5.3.2 default settings, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) What about aerobraking?

And yet even as modified by DRE, its max temperature is 1450C, I believe. Same for fuel tanks. Engines can only survive high temperatures inside their combustion chambers and nozzles through some serious work: regenerative cooling for the hotter ones like your Mainsail or LV-T30, ablative cooling for low-chamber-pressure-and-efficiency ones like the LV-1. So once they\u0027ve finished their burn and are turned off, their maximum temperature shouldn\u0027t be much more than 8-900C tops, I\u0027d say (a good bit less, considering all the exposed machinery that\u0027s not shielded by the nozzle).\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, it should still be possible to reenter with spent stages for reusability, you\u0027d just need to put a heatshield on the nose of the stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for your response!
