Unless your rocket has insane TWR and is trailing aero flames below 28.5km, then you\u0027re not going fast enough to burn your chutes. From what I understand, the chute-burning only happens when you\u0027re going fast enough to cause flames. I could be wrong, though."},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:52:37Z","Content":"Hi\n\nThanks that a good point but i meant when decoupling a stage in say 35 km and up. It will be subjectet to reentry heat -\u003E Deployed chutes burn up -\u003E Crash. Even then boosters do have no heat shield so. Is it even practical to use chutes anymore on the not for return intended stages ?\n\nThanks"}]}
