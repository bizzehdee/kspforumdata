Unless your rocket has insane TWR and is trailing aero flames below 28.5km, then you\u0027re not going fast enough to burn your chutes. From what I understand, the chute-burning only happens when you\u0027re going fast enough to cause flames. I could be wrong, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:52:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks that a good point but i meant when decoupling a stage in say 35 km and up. It will be subjectet to reentry heat -\u0026gt; Deployed chutes burn up -\u0026gt; Crash. Even then boosters do have no heat shield so. Is it even practical to use chutes anymore on the not for return intended stages ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
