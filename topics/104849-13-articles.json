However for people who might not want to know what happens use the spoiler tags. It\u0027s easy to do and it allows people who want to see spoilers and people don\u0027t don\u0027t have to see them. I am gonna make this a rule for about 2 weeks. I think that\u0027s a fair amount of time to give people to see the movie.
