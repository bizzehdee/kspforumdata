There\u0027s specific orbital heights for polar orbits to scan each planet and moon in the fewest number of orbits, but iirc the list i found somewhere is obsolete due to changes made in the game. I do one swing around the equator first to find easy spots to land and launch from, then shift to a more inclined orbit to scan a wider stripe. A perfectly polar orbit, even at the \u0022ideal\u0022 altitude, will still miss some cells, so you\u0027ll need to shift inclination a time or two. There will still be a few cells that will take some time to get the satellite over, but there\u0027s no need to get a 100% coverage scan. You just need to find the big deposits and their overall size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see someone with kas installed make a nearly 2.5 km long cable, stick a scanner on the end of it and one on the ship, then extend the cable out and see what happens. Should try it around a small moon where the cells are smaller*, at low altitude, to have the best chance of having two active scanners over different cells at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*is there a list of cell size on each body? Any have cells smaller than 2.5 km? How about one of the \u0022ideal\u0022 scanning orbit altitudes to achieve the most complete coverage in the least number of orbits?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atoning Unifex","CreatedById":58766,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T18:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve come across some unusual behaviour in this mod. I have a kethane miner ship, half full of kethane, with a converter attached. There are 7 engines - 6 radially mounted and the 7th in the centre. If I set the ship off on an extended manouver, and have the kethane converter running to replenish the fuel on the go, then at about 1-2 minutes into the burn one of the radial engines will throttle right down to almost zero, obviously causing the ship to veer off course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s definitely related to having the converter running because if I use exactly the same ship and perform the burn without the converter running then the ship behaves as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship does have MechJeb on board, and I thought perhaps the \u0027prevent overheat\u0027 function was causing this, possibly, but tests confirm it\u0027s not!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
