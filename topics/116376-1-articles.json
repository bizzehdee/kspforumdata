If you can do this, you have most of the know-how you need to go anywhere else. But a lot of new players have trouble figuring out how to do it, and so I have made this guide.\n\nNote: This is NOT meant to be the most efficient method. Nitpickers: I KNOW the ship is bigger than it needs to be, and there are more advanced techniques which will save fuel. But my goal in creating this guide is not efficiency, but to make something that is easy to follow and understand, with a ship that has more fuel than it needs so a newbie can screw up and still get the mission done. And for the sake of simplicity, I do not use nor explain maneuver nodes during this tutorial. Anyway...\n\nThis is the **Mark 122b Moon Visitor**.\n\n![c1f3uR1.png](http://i.imgur.com/c1f3uR1.png)\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\nCraft file: [https://kerbalx.com/Vanamonde/M122b-Moon-Visitor](https://kerbalx.com/Vanamonde/M122b-Moon-Visitor)\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\nFeature: The ship has an emergency abort system. Hit the backspace key to trigger the abort sequence, and the capsule will eject itself from the rocket.\n\n![Xn1naVs.png](http://i.imgur.com/Xn1naVs.png)\n\nThen hit action group 0 to discard the expended escape rocket and open the parachutes.\n\n![kUyPptb.png](http://i.imgur.com/kUyPptb.png)\n\nWhen it\u0027s no longer needed or wanted, action 1 discards the escape rocket.\n\nHowever, the ship is well-tested and launch failures should not be a problem. This feature is included primarily to show a new player how such an emergency system can work. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI will assume you already know how to launch, fly, and reach orbit. (If you do not know how to reach orbit, try [my other tutorial](http://http//forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128519-How-to-reach-orbit-and-a-%28sandbox%29-rocket-to-do-it-with).)\n\nLaunch the rocket and fly it to Kerbin Orbit. Around 80,000m is good, but the altitude is not critical. During the ascent, the two booster stages will run out of fuel and should be discarded.\n\n![eKnWmO2.png](http://i.imgur.com/eKnWmO2.png)\n\n![FCEe04A.png](http://i.imgur.com/FCEe04A.png)\n\nYou should also hit action group 0 to discard the (hopefully unused) escape rocket.\n\n![GReXvW9.png](http://i.imgur.com/GReXvW9.png)\n\nThis leaves the transit stage to establish Kerbin orbit and carry you to the surface of the moon of your choice.\n\n![QSxTk3s.png](http://i.imgur.com/QSxTk3s.png)\n\nGo to map view and look down on the Kerbin/moon system from above. Click on Mun\u0027s orbital line and choose it as \u0022target.\u0022 Wait until the ship is about 120 degrees clockwise from Mun (we will cover Minmus later), turn ship prograde (horizontal), and fire the engine.\n\n![VyVECRf.png](http://i.imgur.com/VyVECRf.png)\n\nYou will see your apoapsis marker climb toward the Mun\u0027s orbit, and closest approach markers will appear. It may look like you are aiming too far ahead of the moon, but remember, it will be travelling just as you are, and you are setting up a meeting where the moon will be when you get there. When you see the encounter markers appear,\n\n![A46JmFU.png](http://i.imgur.com/A46JmFU.png)\n\nyou know your ship will be reaching the moon, and you can shut the engine down and coast there. Ideally, you could set your lowest Mun approach at an orbital altitude of 20-30kms during this burn, and I do in this example. However, that\u0027s an extra step for a new pilot to learn and remember, and really, just about any Mun intercept will do for the sake of this practice mission, so I will advise you not to worry about it now.\n\nWait until you have reached your closest approach to the moon, then turn the ship retrograde to fire the engine.\n\n![kGGWeGM.png](http://i.imgur.com/kGGWeGM.png)\n\nYou will see the blue projected path line lower and then wrap around the moon. When it has formed a low circle that doesn\u0027t hit the surface, turn the engine off again. You are now in Mun orbit, and can take your time looking for a good landing spot.\n\n![UVrGu0h.png](http://i.imgur.com/UVrGu0h.png)\n\nThis is a tricky step. Even places that look flat as you\u0027re flying over them can turn out to be dangerously sloped or bumpy, so be sure to quicksave (F5) before attempting a landing. And DO NOT attempt to land on the night side of the moon. This is extremely hard to do, even for experienced pilots. When you have a spot picked out, turn the ship retrograde once more and fire the engine, watching your projected path sink until it touches the spot where you want to land, then shut the engine off.\n\n![R1UTBOh.png](http://i.imgur.com/R1UTBOh.png)\n\nYou are now descending toward a landing, and should hit the G key to extend the landing legs.\n\n![MAHCBDq.png](http://i.imgur.com/MAHCBDq.png)\n\nI also like to rotate my ship so that \u0027up\u0027 on the navball is facing my direction of motion (west), as I find this perspective easier from which to fly. That is a matter of preference, but the following illustrations will assume that you have done so as well.\n\nNow it\u0027s time to kill off your orbital speed so that your ground speed will be zero when you try to land. Descend until you are at about altitude 5000m, and then turn retrograde yet again and fire the engine. This will cause the ship to fall a little faster as well, and you might come down short of your intended landing spot if you don\u0027t correct for it. So if you aim the nose of your ship slightly up from retrograde during this burn, some of your thrust will be applied to slowing your fall, helping to keep you aimed toward your original intended landing spot.\n\n![AJG4ebF.png](http://i.imgur.com/AJG4ebF.png)\n\nMake several burns, shedding speed by steps, as you watch the ground approach. (Note: this is inefficient, but easier for a new pilot to do, and I have given this ship extra fuel, so you shouldn\u0027t run out.)\n\nThis is the trickiest part of the flight. It is very hard to judge how far you are from the ground, because the altimeter at the top of the screen reads your height above an abstract \u0022sea level,\u0022 and the place you are over may be much higher. There is an instrument which indicates your true height above the current ground, but it is not easy to use because it is only visible from the ship\u0027s internal view, by hitting the C key and looking at the instrument panel.\n\n![DabQdpj.png](http://i.imgur.com/DabQdpj.png)\n\nSwitching back and forth from this view is hard to do while piloting the ship, but with some practice, you won\u0027t need to. You\u0027ll be able to guess your approximate height by watching the terrain detail. It helps if you have the optional \u0022ground scatter\u0022 graphics setting enabled, because this puts car-sized rocks on the surface which you can use as visual reference points.\n\nAs you get close to the ground, burn to shed your speed until the retrograde marker slides directly under your ship.\n\n![rbVE6Qv.png](http://i.imgur.com/rbVE6Qv.png)\n\nWhen you see this, you are coming straight down upon the surface of the moon. This is important, because if you are moving laterally at the time of contact, your ship may bounce or tumble or slide, causing damage or even destruction of the vessel.\n\nNote: This is the hardest part of the flight. Do not feel bad if you crash at this point, as everyone does. I myself slammed ships into Mun for 4 straight days before I finally got the knack for bringing the ship down gently. You will probably need to try this several times before it works, but that is why I had you quicksave while you were still in orbit. If you do have problems, just hit quickload (F9) to go back to orbit and try it again.\n\nOnce you have eliminated your horizontal speed, adjust the throttle up and down to keep your vertical speed in the safe range. The landing gear will absorb the shock of landings up to around 15m/s, but the slower the better. Try to keep your descent down to 5-10m/s. When you see yourself getting close, eject the transit stage. (Try to do it high enough, though, that you don\u0027t get hit with debris when it explodes.)\n\n![UWPasri.png](http://i.imgur.com/UWPasri.png)\n\nYou may need to do some last-second steering to keep the ship coming straight down. Again, you may crash several times. But it\u0027s worth it, because bringing a moon lander down intact for the first time is one of the most rewarding game experiences many of us have ever had.\n\n![nw8uUjt.png](http://i.imgur.com/nw8uUjt.png)\n\nEven if you do everything right, though, you can still crash. That\u0027s because Mun\u0027s terrain is VERY rough and treacherous. One thing that helps a great deal is to build the lander low and wide, as this one is. Anway, once landed, lower the ship\u0027s ladder,\n\n![s5U0ApI.png](http://i.imgur.com/s5U0ApI.png)\n\nand send the guys and gals out to play and explore.\n\n![xDlgCqu.png](http://i.imgur.com/xDlgCqu.png)\n\nWhen you are ready to return and have brought in the crew, hit quicksave, and fire the engine at full thrust and aim about 40 degrees above the horzion on an easterly (90 on the navball) bearing.\n\n![KZghVdU.png](http://i.imgur.com/KZghVdU.png)\n\nThis is different from launching from Kerbin. Firstly, you can start building up horizontal speed right away because there is no atmosphere to fight. And while there is still a benefit to flying east along with the world\u0027s rotation speed, the boost is quite small on Mun. Every little bit helps, though, so it\u0027s still a good habit. And lastly, watch to make sure you don\u0027t slam into any hills. Mun\u0027s terrain is quite rough, and this is a risk. Anyway, keep burning the engine until you have raised your periapsis to 10,000m. This is high enough to clear any Munar terrain, so coast to that height, turn horizontal, and burn the engine again to establish an orbit.\n\nZoom out until the white line of Mun\u0027s orbital path is visible, and then wait or warp until your ship is over it. This is a good place from which to make a burn to return to Kerbin. You could do this burn in any direction to leave Mun, but this particular route does 2 things. By leaving opposite of Mun\u0027s orbital motion, you are shedding Mun\u0027s orbital speed, helping your ship fall towards Kerbin. And if you leave in other directions, there is a chance of Mun just scooping you up again as it travels. So turn horizontal and fire the engine, watching your periapsis rise until it exits Mun\u0027s sphere of influence (SOI).\n\n![hrfQYQg.png](http://i.imgur.com/hrfQYQg.png)\n\nThen coast until you are free and clear of Mun. Now, turn retrograde and fire the engines once more to lower your path toward a landing on the home planet. However, now Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere will work for you rather than against you. You will fall all the way to the planet and reach quite a high speed by the time you get there, and it would cost a great deal of fuel to shed all that speed before making a gentle landing. But if you set your path to pass through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, passage through the air will eliminate this excess speed for you. (This is called \u0022aerobraking.\u0022) There are some hazards, though. If you come back too high, the air will not slow you enough, you will pass through it, and rise quite high again to make additional orbital passes. But if you try to come in too low, your ship could be destroyed by heat or even slam into the ground before it could slow enough. There is a range of altitudes that will work, but for the sake of this example. set your return periapsis for 32,000m.\n\n![PSHGyKj.png](http://i.imgur.com/PSHGyKj.png)\n\nYou may now coast until the ship hits atmosphere. At that point, you no longer need the lander stage, and its mass would cause you to fall harder anyway, so eject it.\n\n![GTJkcK7.png](http://i.imgur.com/GTJkcK7.png)\n\nWait until you reach a safe speed, open the parachutes, and float to a landing or splashdown.\n\n![g4UwEQQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/g4UwEQQ.png)\n\nYou have now completed your first moon mission. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Minmus** \n\nAs it happens, just about any ship design that can reach Mun can also reach Minmus. The process is almost exactly the same, but there may be one additional step, because the orbit of Minmus is inclined (at an angle) relative to Kerbin\u0027s equator and the orbit of Mun. That means that when you reach the height of Minmus\u0027 orbit, you may find that your ship is missing by passing north or south of the target moon.\n\n![WQm1ND1.png](http://i.imgur.com/WQm1ND1.png)\n\nIf so, wait until the halfway point of the transit, where an adjustment will require the least effort and fuel. Then turn your ship due south or north (toward Minmus\u0027 orbit) and burn gently, watching the closest approach markers until you achieve an intercept.\n\n![yITrHuv.png](http://i.imgur.com/yITrHuv.png)\n\nThis can be tricky, as Minmus is a small target. The rest of a Minmus flight will be much like a Mun flight.\n\nThis ship has two additional features. The lander is equipped with lights for night activities (thought attempting to land in the dark is still strongly discouraged).\n\n![NdHftJM.png](http://i.imgur.com/NdHftJM.png)\n\nAnd although you will not need it for moon missions, the ship comes with a port and RCS thrusters which enable it to dock with other ships. Because, why not?\n\n![IlHnXw7.png](http://i.imgur.com/IlHnXw7.png)\n\nI hope this is helpful. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T06:34:07Z","Content":"Great post!
