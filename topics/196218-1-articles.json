This would require a plugin, as you\u0027d have to disable a function of the stock game that was never meant to be disabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know of no such plugin in existence, as people who write mods generally look to add features, not remove them. Though, I don\u0027t know how hard it would be to implement - if it\u0027s quick and easy, maybe someone might humor you? Or perhaps you could look into learning C# yourself...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: a dirty workaround would be to write a Module Manager patch that clones one of the existing solar panels with a much larger base power. For example, if you wanted to go to Eeloo, you could patch yourself an \u0022Eeloo panel\u0022 that has its base generation boosted so much that, after arriving at Eeloo, the remaining generation matches that of the stock panel at Kerbin. Although, keep in mind that Eeloo\u0027s orbit is eccentric - its distance to the sun varies constantly and considerably. That means that the solar output will also change accordingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-10T08:33:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2020 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-11T01:22:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223835271\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196218\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221597048228\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: a dirty workaround would be to write a Module Manager patch\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--which exchanges the solar panel module for the generator module (as in the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.
