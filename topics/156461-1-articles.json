If one is trying to design a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E craft, one can compensate for changes in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E by adjusting the thrust of fore/aft engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn particular, I was doing this on a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E mk3 spaceplane I was using on Duna to move surface base modules. Depending on the docked module or how full the craft was with fuel, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E was different. As the lift engine only fire at the last stage of flight, I simply had to quicksave, test a thrust setting, quick load, test another, etc...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternately, I could go to the space center, load the craft design, adjust fuel levels, and then stick a saved subassembly of the payload it is carrying, then adjust thrust settings to get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E in line, then go back to the craft before it lifts off/de-orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of that is very inconvenient, and it would be nice if there were a toggle to display \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"53miner53","CreatedById":172955,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-15T19:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis would also be great for space shuttles and other rockets\u00A0with offset \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eagle92lightning","CreatedById":170551,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-15T19:46:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think is an awesome idea.
