Press \u00222\u0022 to disconnect gun from tank, then switch to it as its own ship to move/fire. You can drive the tank while the gun is detached. The gun is resting on a pivot mount so it shouldn\u0027t come out (hopefully \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing 70 tons it is frightfully hard to get off the runway. I suggest if you have hyper-edit use it to get it off. If you don\u0027t have that you can put it in the VAB folder and drive it off the gentler slope of the launchpad (EDIT: This is the only way i can get it off safely, probably because of the extremely low ground clearance). Other than that it drives like a dream, max speed 21m/s, and quick braking is possible. carries 14,500 units of Electricity and 40 RTGs so power is not a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KingPanzer Z\u0027s 50cm gun has \u002B30/-10 degrees elevation, and \u002B/-5 degrees to the sides. Range is 10-3000m (one was reported at 3.2km). It has the same x6 .5m High Velocity missiles as the ZS. Firing tests show accuracy of \u002B/- 10m at 2800m range (that\u0027s the best of any tank i have built). Shots can be very flat if target is under 1000m away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew of three is normal, however you will have to manually add the third crew member when launching. It also has a Driver\u0027s cockpit to see out of. The other two crew are gunner/loader combo in an armored cockpit underneath just under the breech of the gun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMediafire Download:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?1xr5t6ax303sv1d\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?1xr5t6ax303sv1d\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGallery:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vOdBSDn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vOdBSDn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0madL3H.png\u0022 alt=\u00220madL3H.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/88POhQW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002288POhQW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YWKIuSc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YWKIuSc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dWHDPtt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dWHDPtt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-26T03:14:33Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2013 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by zekes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T02:30:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHoly moley, how do you build these things?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T02:32:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eplaying KSP 10 hours a week for a year and a half helps.... especially since my computer is a portable potato.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FIREWORKKS","CreatedById":61067,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T01:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat mods do you have?
