Now, recently, sometimes it is 3 of the 4 selected. Sometimes 2 of the selected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeedless to say the sending tanks are now unbalanced and that causes issue. Am i doing it incorrectly? Could it be mechjeb which is now out of date but still works somewhat?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James M","CreatedById":167171,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-30T01:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould be related to the fuel transfer issues from the New Horizons update.
