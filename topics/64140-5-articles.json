The current shapes are all volumes of revolution, go look at wikipedia if you don\u0027t know what that means. The next set of shapes will be extruded shapes, which includes cubes / hexes. The coding of the geometry will take a bit of effort, but it should be ultimately straightforward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main issue I\u0027ve been thinking about really is how to manage textures. I\u0027ve had a few ideas - lets discuss the proposals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Choosing textures for each \u0027bit\u0027 of the part - eg the sides, the ends, and then other added bits like the SRB cones. This does have its pros, but an issue would be that you\u0027d end up with lots of options to go through. Also some of the combinations would be.. odd. This would also break compatibility with existing texture packs for stretchy SRBs. The other issue would be that if you\u0027ve got a hex-sided pod for example, do you choose textures for each side individually? or what? I feel that really that level of fine detailed painting is best left to a separate mod like Kerb Paint (Not that I\u0027ve actually used it, but anyhow)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The option I\u0027m liking at the moment is to stay with the \u0027texture set\u0027 scheme of things. Each bit of the part gets some identifier - like end.top and end.bottom for the ends, side for the sides (or even side.cyl for cylinders, and say side.bottom, side.top for aircraft parts), srb for the srb nozzle, ect. In the config file you have a defined name and properties for definitions for each of the available textures (is it stretched, tiled, or a circle map like the ends, ect), and then another config file that builds texture sets from those textures - eg it might map both end.top and end.bottom to one texture, and side.cyl to something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want to go and mix and match you can then just create your own mapping definition in a text editor and apply it to your model. You could even (if you got keen) create an GUI within the game to mix then and save as a preset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, this is all in the future \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Have created an issue to track this here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Swamp-Ig/ProceduralParts/issues/14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Swamp-Ig/ProceduralParts/issues/14\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-17T09:37:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2014 09:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by swamp_ig\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swamp_ig","CreatedById":97983,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T09:35:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, due to popular demand I am thinking of how to implement procedural engines.

Unlike the decouplers when you go to implement the SASTweaker class please don\u0027t limit the possible shapes. The SASTweaker class would be the base class for probes and command pods. As for tweakables we have three values for its torque (PitchTorque, YawTorque, RollTorque) which appear to always to be equal but it would be a nice option that users could make them not equal. Much like decouplers we can vary the maxTorque values based on the new shape of the object. Looking at NOVA punch SAS it appears if you double the size of the SAS the torque also doubles. Don\u0027t know what the formula would be for real life.The other thing influenced by the torque values is the electric charge. It makes sense that if the torque is doubled that the electric charge usage also would double.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swamp_ig","CreatedById":97983,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T01:23:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe decoupler tweaker class doesn\u0027t limit the shapes itself. It does determine the maximum decoupling force based on the area of the top of the part - I felt this was the most appropriate and it fitted with existing parts more or less. Given this, changing the length of decouplers didn\u0027t make a lot of sense since it would result in increased mass without any function, which is never desirable in a rocket. Altogether this leads to limited shapes for decouplers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no reason why you can\u0027t use the decoupler tweaker class and apply it to some other part, it will still determine the max decouple force based on the node it\u0027s attached to, but the other parts of the shape are free to do whatever they want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mechanical part for SAS modules are flywheels, which (obviously) can get larger and more massive the more volume that is available. In which case both the max torque (as in the sum across all axies) is proportional to the volume, mass should go up proportional to the actual torque (if it was tweaked back for instance). Given this, shape limiting makes less sense. The resource use will obviously need to be directly proportional to the maximum available torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might well have my physics wrong on this one, but I don\u0027t know that independent torques will work. For a long ship, intuitively it would seem that the roll axis would require less torque than the pitch and yaw axies - since there\u0027s going to be less angular momentum in the roll axis. The problem arises is that say your ship starts tumbling out of control end-to-end. Because of the way gyroscopic forces work, applying a torque to slow the tumble will result in the roll of the ship increasing, and since you have less torque available in the roll axis then you\u0027ve got no way to push against this and correct it. You either have to decrease the pitch torque, or deal with the excessive roll. I guess it\u0027s possible that this is counterbalanced by the decreased angular momentum in that axis.. as I said I\u0027m not so sure of the physics, maybe someone can correct me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow I have created an issue for further discussion here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Swamp-Ig/ProceduralParts/issues/15\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Swamp-Ig/ProceduralParts/issues/15\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-18T06:15:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2014 06:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by swamp_ig\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
