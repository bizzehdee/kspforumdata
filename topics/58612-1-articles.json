As you\u0027ve said, the game engine simply doesn\u0027t calculate numbers to that depth of accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it could be nice to get that wobble, take a series of measurements, calculate the minimum/maximum value and mean average value, and print something like \u0022130,000km \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B15%\u0022 or similar.

I think the \u0022fudging\u0022 concept is what the OP had in mind, and I think this is a great idea. This could also be implemented for nearly circular orbits to get rid of the wobble because for people like me who run RemoteTech and need geo-stationary sattelites, that gets pretty annoying pretty quick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any idea if this would be achievable through a mod? I\u0027m looking to get my hands dirty with a mod (I\u0027m a programmer by hobby and trade) and this would be a great one, but having not worked with any modding of KSP yet I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s exposed to our use/manipulation and what isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
