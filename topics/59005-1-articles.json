Cave Johnson here. A lot of people have been asking us \u0022Cave, how do you and your team of handsome experts acquire the moon rocks needed to make your special white portal gel?\u0022 Well, let me start off with a popular saying: \u0022When Life Gives You Lemons,\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Make Lemonade!\u0022. Although my company\u0027s special combustible lemons were taken off the market months ago, I thought I should give this saying another shot. Since we had so much steel and whatever left over from the Perpetual Testing initiative, I told my subjects from the multiverse to use the materials in a way that would be beneficial for Aperture as a whole, and after a while, one of the octopuses from the multiverse handed me blueprints for this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lm1N2ts.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lm1N2ts.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is that? Well that my friend is a rocket! How does it work? Well my expert friend here says it flies into space and releases various payloads into orbit, and it is fueled by leftover combustible lemons. It\u0027s called \u0022The Adventurer - Mark 1\u0022 This rocket was our pioneering step into space back in the 80\u0027s. We were far away from going to the moon at that point, but we needed to get better at putting these things into orbit. Anyway, before I go attend to business, here is a mission log with pictures... don\u0027t ask how we got them, or we\u0027ll have to kill you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/sMFXQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
