I am trying to make a large, heavy refueling plane that I can dispatch anywhere on Kerbin, but since I have to carry so much weight, instead of building my wings out, which is ugly and less stable, I built them UP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T20:27:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cranium\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cranium\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I built them UP.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost a snapshot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cranium","CreatedById":69153,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T20:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPost a snapshot.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t until tonight.

But make sure that the CoM does not drift behind the CoL after fuel drain when you want to re-enter and fly again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally CoL should be a bit above the CoM as well for stability, but it\u0027s not a big issue if it is not. It should not be too far above, since then the Center of Drag (CoD) will probably be higher above the CoM. This drag will pull back, from above, causing the plane to pitch up. Wings also have a little mass, so high CoL means high placed wings, so this will raise the CoM above the CoT (unless balanced with dry mass below)... so theres more pitching up from that too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cranium\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cranium\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have wondered if that could be what is causing my spaceplane to go crazy once I turn on the rocket engines?

From your images I guess that would be the module directly behind the cockpit. If a tank in front of the CoG is getting lighter the CoG will shift to the rear putting it in your case behind the CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA possible solution could be to move the wings slightly more to the rear putting the CoL a bit more behind the CoG.
