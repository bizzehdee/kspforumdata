Add a nuke and you may even gain a little speed:\n\n![gmdC1Xi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gmdC1Xi.jpg)\n\nI\u0027m getting my speed up lower than usual so that I can do a high-drag maneuver that costs speed (initiating the zoom climb) in a place where the air is still juicy enough for me to regain that lost speed before the jets lose power.\n\nThe value of that flight profile increases with the wing loading of the ship (because high-loading ships require extreme AoA in thin air). This is a very high wing-loading ship; something built like a U2 would be better off with a high, floaty profile.\n\nA Silbervogel float \u0026 bounce approach (climb to 25km, dive to 15km, climb again) might be a little more fuel efficient, but would take longer. Given that it\u0027s hitting orbit with several thousand m/s of \u0394V in the tanks, I\u0027m not overly concerned."},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T14:13:00Z","Content":"My ascent profile is quite different, but I build crafts in different way. I tend to build SpacePlanes with TWR between 0.30 and 0.80, depending on payload.  \n\nI\u0027m not always successfull, as my piloting skills sucks, but I found that optimal AoA is around 10 degree.\n\nAt 10 AoA degree, on high speeds @ mach 2 or higher, L/D ratio is near peak level while drag is reasonably low. That way you gain most from wing lift without speed/energy loss due to drag. Also at low speeds at 10 AoA you have high L/D ratio and benefit most from wings without much of speed loss.\n\nSo, I go at subsonic speeds, up to 10km, slowly accelerating on the way up. My aim is to hit 1 mach near 10km. After that, I tend to keep climbing rate and acceleration in a way to hit 3 mach near 20km. From that point, accelerate and klimb slowly to squeeze out as much as possible from engine air breathing mode. I no longer wait to switch to rocket mode when engines run out of air, usually engine thrust drops as you gain speed, so I tend to switch to rocket mode once engines does not have power to accelerate further.\n\nNeed some practice, but when done properly, there is almost no diving/climbing flight area when you loose lift if you climb too much with relatively low speed.  \n\nIt also helps to set controls in a way that plane is not capable to have more than 10 AoA that is needed. That way you will not get much drag trough SAS controls that tends to keep craft leveled regardless of high drag on too high AoA. In upper atmosphere, between 30 and 70 km, it is still possible to have higher AoA than 10 AoA, but air there is thin enough, so it have much less influence to speed loss due to drag.\n\nTrough ascent path, I try to keep eye on dynamic pressure, to keep it between 10 and 20 kPa, providing good lift from wings without putting in danger to rip them off due to too high dynamic pressure. When I\u0027m capable to not make much piloting mistakes, I can put craft in orbit with \u0022suffering\u0022 forces at only 1.5g. That way wings does not have to be strong, having much less mass, giving more dV once in space."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T17:13:37Z","Content":"One other thing to consider is that with higher dynamic pressure, which means that you have a shorter ascent, which mitigates the effect of higher drag.

I often create crafts for stable low speed landings, so dynamic pressure between 10 and 20 kPa might not be enough for level flight at 10 AoA on crafts with shorter wingspan.\n\nFor shorter wingspan you might aim for higher pressure, but there is also tradeoff for stronger(heavier) wings and more careful piloting to avoid riping off wings."},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T18:36:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, kcs123 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 mach @ 16km ?

Hold a small constant AoA (5 degrees or so) during the descent and wait for the increasing speed and thickening air to reduce the AoA required for level flight below that value. Once level flight is regained, the final ascent can be either float- or zoom-style; high-lift low-loading ships are better off with float, low-lift high-loading ships with zoom.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that it allows fairly rapid acceleration, even with very low TWR designs. The disadvantage is that the bounce is hard on the airframe, and can be difficult to escape from if you misjudge it and go too deep.\n\n\\* Float involves a steepish climb into the low drag zone above 20km, but with the climb rounded off at the top so as to keep the plane in aerodynamic lift (instead of a ballistic zoom climb). Then, keep the AoA high enough to maintain level flight above 20km while you climb as gradually as possible. You\u0027re then faced with the choice of lighting the rocketry at 25km, or keeping on jet thrust to 30km but losing a bit of speed as you do so.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that it minimises stress on the airframe and places the bulk of the ship\u0027s acceleration in the high altitude zone where drag losses are minimised. The disadvantage is that it\u0027s slow and requires a bit of piloting finesse to get right. It\u0027s particularly problematic for high-loading ships (either heavy Mk3 cargo ships or small speedsters with minimal wings), as they may struggle to maintain level flight in thin air without excessive AoA-induced drag.\n\n\\* Zoom involves a fairly shallow initial climb, levelling off below 20km in order to take advantage of the maximum-thrust zone for the jets. The idea is to build as much speed as your heat limits can tolerate, before pulling into a steep zoom climb that pushes the apoapsis over 30km. Once that is achieved, the nose is dropped back to prograde and kept there until 30km is passed and the rockets are lit.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that it minimises drag through the low-thrust 20-30km zone and maintains a large amount of horizontal speed while also maximising vertical speed at the 30km jet/rocket boundary. The downside is that it\u0027s very hard on the airframe from both a heat and aerodynamic stress POV, requiring tougher wings than otherwise. It\u0027s also less fuel efficient for the jets, as the high power output at lower altitude also means higher fuel consumption, and a lot of the fuel is wasted countering drag. However, this relatively wasteful use of the high-efficiency jet engines is balanced by the benefit it provides during the low-efficiency oxidising rocket burn (the momentum of the zoom allows for later ignition and lower AoA during the rocket burn).\n\nExactly which one is best is going to depend on the ship and the mission; low-TWR sailplanes like the U-2 prefer a float approach, micro-winged high TWR interceptors like an F-104 are more suited to the zoom style of ascent.\n\n![u2-2.jpg](http://www.aviationinsurors.com/images/u2/u2-2.jpg)\n\n![F-104-HVD-1.JPG](http://www.avonds.com/F-104-HVD-1.JPG)\n\nWhich approach is best for a \u0022typical\u0022 Kerbal SSTO spaceplane is an open question. Anyone want to take a \u0022representative\u0022 spaceplane (perhaps something with a small Mk2 cargo bay, designed for satellite runs to LKO?) up for three ascents and see which approach leaves the most in the tanks once you hit orbit?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-02T00:41:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2016 12:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T04:00:53Z","Content":"Half the thrust, still zoomy:\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/wWnXC/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nCraft file at [https://www.dropbox.com/s/m6nisqcrxsfsql4/Kerbodyne%20Solo%20R.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m6nisqcrxsfsql4/Kerbodyne%20Solo%20R.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T04:54:46Z","Content":"Heh.

It\u0027ll keep you from overcontrolling at low speed while still retaining supersonic authority.\n\nOr, if you don\u0027t use DD, crank up the max deflection but also add some AoA. That gives you strong control at low AoA (as is needed when supersonic) but throttles back the deflection if you\u0027re headed for a high-alpha stall. The only problem with this is that if you overdo it, the ship may refuse to hold a high-AoA posture when you want it to (e.g. during reentry) and may develop a tendency to pitch oscillate at full stick (i.e. surging between high and low AoA instead of climbing steadily when you hold down the S key). Just reduce the AoA settings if that happens, though.\n\nIf SAS wobble is the problem, look at stiffening your airframe (struts can do wonders when you use the translate tool to hide them inside wings) and/or tweaking your PID tuner settings."},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T13:57:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, Wanderfound said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Half the thrust, still zoomy:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/wWnXC/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Craft file at [https://www.dropbox.com/s/m6nisqcrxsfsql4/Kerbodyne%20Solo%20R.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m6nisqcrxsfsql4/Kerbodyne%20Solo%20R.craft?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\nTwo things I have to say.\n\nFirst; While that is half the thrust it is still a VERY small aircraft with a MASSIVE engine, the RAPIER puts out almost a 1:1 TWR on a craft that size if not greater at max velocity.   That craft weighs in just under 14 tons and at take off you have a 115kn thrust rating.   Which is way high for most aircraft.  Then once you reach mach 3 you have a 3:1 TWR!   That is insane.  \n\nSecond;\n\nI have to ask why such large landing gear on such a small frame?  You should only need about 13-17deg clearance to get that aircraft off the ground.   Well placed regular gear should give you that.  That craft is no bigger than my old F-119C/A Akula.
