I turn on the LV-N at about 18km and turn off the jets when they run out of air. \n\nI think I could optimize to a more efficient ascent profile, by reducing the angle of the high speed climb phase. Will wait to do that until temp gauges no longer cause a system crash ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNext experiments will be to scale it up: with two LV-Ns and three or four turbojets, will I be able to carry some cargo?\n\nAlbum below of one round trip to and from the KSC runway.

I see you get a much smaller dV in orbit... still, I have a hunch I am weighted by 0.90 experience, and perhaps the way I\u0027m doing it is not the most efficient way to carry liquid fuel... you seem to be getting higher TWR out of a single nuke than I could, I couldn\u0027t get her out of the atmosphere on a single nuke, even though I was punching out of it at \u003E1km/s on the jets.\n\nRune.
