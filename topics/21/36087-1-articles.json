At the front is four banks of prison cells, each with four cells, and each cell with space for four prisoners, for a total of 64 prisoners and currently, 9 crew. There are five main sections/rocket types, the core, with all its batteries, RTGs, lights, and RCS. There are the tanker ships, which simply deliver 1 large fuel tank and one large RCS tank, to the station, full capacity.There\u0027s the cell banks, the supertanker module, with extra lights, solar panels and batteries, and the engine module, a bank of 6 nerva engines, 2 large RCS tanks, 2 little fuel tanks, and was also the biggest bitch to get up there and dock. I\u0027ve made a total of 10 rez\u0027s to the station (one tanker to refuel the station which I\u0027ve since detached and deorbited) and due to my lack of skill in housekeeping my orbit, there\u0027s a cloud of 93 pieces of debris trailing the station, from probe cores to XL fuel tanks with mainsails attached. Yeah, I live dangerously. Station has 288 parts, weighs 193 tons, and orbits at ~150km. I did all the docking manually (what a bitch) because I downloaded something called HydroJeb but found it harder to make that work than just docking manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/L3H9eKN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/L3H9eKN\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gSivc6c\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/gSivc6c\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-06T07:04:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2013 07:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Agent86\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"firerider521","CreatedById":60860,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T05:34:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou got any screenshots?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agent86","CreatedById":73499,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T05:56:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022firerider521\u0022 data-cite=\u0022firerider521\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou got any screenshots?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I added some to my main post, but they didn\u0027t take for some reason (first time posting)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/L3H9eKN\u0022 alt=\u0022L3H9eKN\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/gSivc6c\u0022 alt=\u0022gSivc6c\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T06:20:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it uploaded on Imgur?
