Either way, the Mk1 Boat people! It\u0027s a top quality boat, capable of several trips from KSC to the Old KSC. Comes with crew transport as standard. Feel free to strap on science! It\u0027s agile design is capable of up to 110m/s on water. Note: I would recommend you use unbreakable joints and possibly no crash dmg. Unbreakable joints because it uses a slight bit of clipping and part offsetting, while you may want no crash damage, simply because it\u0027s on water, and KSP ain\u0027t made for that.\n\n![f5pplDY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/f5pplDY.jpg)\n\n![AX7V0tG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AX7V0tG.jpg)\n\nAnd would you like a craft file?\n\n[http://www./download/7m...Mk1\u002BBoat.craft](http://www./download/7mtut698v29fhsj/Mk1\u002BBoat.craft)\n\nHave fun!![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) And please give it a \u002Brep!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T16:10:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ryan234abc**"},{"CreatedByName":"mrmcp1","CreatedById":79657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T16:01:47Z","Content":"Looks good, any chance of a few pictures of it on the water?"},{"CreatedByName":"ryan234abc","CreatedById":136492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T16:08:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Looks good, any chance of a few pictures of it on the water?\n\nAdded to original post!"},{"CreatedByName":"soulreaver1981","CreatedById":38542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:12:17Z","Content":"put a tail fin on for more control"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T03:45:08Z","Content":"These aren\u0027t bad, but if you are planning to upload several ships in rapid succession, I recommend starting a thread in Spacecraft Builders rather than multiple threads in here.

Island runway. Sorry.\n\nSorry, it\u0027s a force of habit. I refer to the one you are thinking of as KSC 2 or Inland KSC, while I call this the Old KSC / Old runway due to it\u0027s old, dilapidated nature.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E put a tail fin on for more control\n\nIt\u0027s quite discreet, but I have dual flaps on the back, next to the engine on either side, to provide extra yaw alongside ASAS. Did you mean for extra yaw? Because if not, with all due respect, I see no need for pitch and roll control unless I intend to take off, which really doesn\u0027t do the boat any good. Thanks for taking an interest in improvements in design!"}]}
