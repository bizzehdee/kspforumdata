These things have very low power at sea level, but once you\u0027re at high altitude and use them, they\u0027re nice. SSTO\u0027s are now made easy. This is my first design with the new engines and I like it.

They are just to heavy, for the power you get.

They use a liquid fuel oxidizer combo and seem to have a little less power than the turbo jets, until you get to high altitude, then they open up and you get to orbit with ease. This design would need to be refueled in orbit otherwise the center mass and center lift cause problems when you return to the ground. So I\u0027ll put up an SSTO refueling station and that will solve this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
