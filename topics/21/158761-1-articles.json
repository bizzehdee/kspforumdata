In the mean time, I am going to focus on one thing: designing a replica of the Boeing Integrated Manned Interplanetary Spacecraft.

The main deviation from the Apollo hardware was the nuclear thermal rocket engines, that would\u0027ve been used to propel the spacecraft. It consisted of several modules (listed from front to rear of spacecraft):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMars Excursion Module - Mars lander based on the Apollo capsule, designed for 3 crew members\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMission Module - large habitation and lab module for 6 crew members\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEarth Entry Module - specially-designed return capsule for 6 crew members\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPropulsion Module 3 - single NTR stage used for trans-Earth injection\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPropulsion Module 2 - single NTR stage used for capture in Mars orbit\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPropulsion Module 1 - triple NTR stage used for trans-Mars injection\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe NTR stages were designed only for major engine burns; weaker chemical rockets would\u0027ve been used for minor correction burns. The MEM would also have been launched with several atmospheric probes, to be deployed once at Mars. Venus missions would\u0027ve used a similar profile, but with additional probes in place of\u00A0a crew lander since the atmosphere and surface conditions of Venus would\u0027ve made a crewed surface excursion impossible with 1970s technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vehicle would be assembled in orbit with 6 launches of an upgraded Saturn V (with the addition of 4 SRBs to increase payload capacity).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the actual purpose of this thread, my replica will be designed with the intention of paying close attention to detail, while still making it a practical spacecraft for use in KSP - though \u0022practical\u0022 does not necessarily mean \u0022efficient\u0022.
