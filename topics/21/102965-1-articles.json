Guaranteed made by the lowest bidder with no safety features to bog you down!\n\nThe Switchblade is inspired by the Northrop patent design of the same name, but make no mistake, the F/A-37 Talon is the size of a jet fighter but this one is a flying freight train with an orbital mission takeoff weight of 100 tons! \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYeBtXUbBRM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIt is a rudderless, forward swept variable geometry design that allows for dynamic shifting of center of pressure to maintain full controllability over a range of flight conditions, from overweight takeoff to hypersonic dash and even a backwards swept \u0027stability mode\u0027 for re-entry. It uses a double joint setup of docking washers to eliminate aeroelastic bending and other sorts of bending associated with IR parts.\n\nThe wing sweep is infinitely adjustable and can be used to precisely trim the craft, however wrong wing sweep position or improper flight assistance setup can cause loss of control. Which makes this design a bit of a widowmaker at first but properly fetching to look at!\n\nGrab the craft file and view the sample flight profiles at KerbalX:\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/crafts/1525](http://kerbalx.com/crafts/1525)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
