That is a nice little shuttle, and thanks for sharing it. The only recommendations I might make are: possibly replacing the skippers with quad couplers and aerospikes... though you might get heat issues there; for career mode, I would consider converting the shuttle into a spaceplane - it looks like your orbiter would be a great foundation for one - so you can bring back all the expensive parts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EagleWorks","CreatedById":138067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T08:26:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI should have mentioned that the real motivation (other than the arbitrary crew transfer one) was to learn docking with a vehicle that is a bit more complicated than your standard small orbiter.
