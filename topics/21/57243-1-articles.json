With some of the principle technologies shamelessly \u0022borrowed\u0022 from Brotoro Kerman Industries, Munstak was finally able to integrate new reactive-intelligent software into their advanced new R.A.P.I.E.R. engines, enabling this state-of-the-art piece of orbital machinery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the R.A.P.I.E.R., The COTS IV-d4M modified variant also boasts autopilot software developed by Anatid Robotics and contracted by R4m0n Industries. Although fully capable of being piloted by well-trained Kerbals, the Mechanical Jebediah (or MechJeb) unit installed is capable of reliably putting the COTS into a 100km x 100km circular orbit above Kerbin. When flying the unmodified variant (the Mk IV-d4), pilots are encouraged to refer to the COTS IV-d4 Flight Safety Manual (FSM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o1vu9qx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o1vu9qx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lk6Q9jA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lk6Q9jA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design isn\u0027t perfect. For one thing, there aren\u0027t enough parachutes to attempt a fully unpowered landing (i.e. parachutes only). In a pinch, you can hit even terrain with just parachutes and expect only to lose an engine or two. If you come down in water though... Well, let\u0027s just hope that you don\u0027t have any kerbals hiding in the hitchhiker storage unit. x_x In 9 out of 10 cases though, I\u0027m able to de-orbit over a safe area with enough fuel to bring the touchdown velocity to \u0026lt;5 m/s, which is enough. Still hard to land with any precision though. I\u0027ve pretty much just set the SOP to be to splash down in the sea just east of KSC, then recover the craft. I found that adding any more parachutes and you risk the spacecraft not being able to make orbit at all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other flaw that this design has is that it always ends up with a surplus of oxidizer though I guess in the future I could use a mod such as the TAC-9 Fuel Balancer to dump the excess oxy overboard when it gets into orbit. In the end, that only really saves a little bit of fuel for de-orbiting, but when you\u0027re cutting the margins as narrowly as this design does, every little bit helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpect an additional post with the .craft file and FSM soon!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-22T01:32:34Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2013 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tntristan12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T01:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease consult this Flight Safety Manual before attempting to fly!
