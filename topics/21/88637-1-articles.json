As I have said just now, it is experimental, and I\u0027m not sure if it works as I haven\u0027t tested it yet, so feel free to report any issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P5rYmQzt0e0/VE3brRjFdCI/AAAAAAAAAks/2QfUM1_z1cw/w346-h208/Gilly%2Blander.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Gilly%2Blander.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027m getting a little sick of this.

Starting small for now, but I\u0027ll find a way to fit in the Goo in the next probe I make. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a parachute for returning to Kerbin. On top of this, it can fit snug inside the 1.25m expanded fairings from Kw rocketry. Isn\u0027t that just cute?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I wanted to share my probe with you guys.
