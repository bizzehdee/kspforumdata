To make keep altitude the nose needs to be at 9 or 10 degrees, I want is as close to 0 as possible and since I don\\\u0027t really know anything about designing aircraft it will probably take me hours of testing to to that. The way I got that 700km number is from test flying it at full throttle at 15km then gliding to land, it will go about 790km doing this so I just rounded down. If anyone has any good ideas on how to improve this craft i would like to know so I can test it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"opticalshadow","CreatedById":31348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-25T21:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecould you post the craft file pretty please with kerbal on top?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xvdBanksbvx","CreatedById":30451,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-25T22:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere you go, If you make any improvements let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
