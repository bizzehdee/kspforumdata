I hope you all enjoy!\n\nThis design makes some compromises, in the hope that it\u0027ll be a bit easier to fly. One of those is the same shortcoming as some of the others- it\u0027s not possible to land the first stage and orbit the Dragon in the same mission. But, hopefully the looks make up for that! (My opinion is that the Dragon with trunk looks pretty damn... pretty?) ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Craft Info:** 134 tons on the pad, and 209 parts. The Dragon alone is 12.5 tons, and 57 parts.\n\n**Craft Download:** [https://www./?kgekd4o098c5ua0](https://www./?kgekd4o098c5ua0)\n\n**Flight Profile:**\n\nFirst, select the Stayputnik on top of the Dragon and click \u0022Control from here.\u0022 Fly straight up until ~13 kilometers. Drop the first stage, and if you want to land, then you\u0027re already over the KSC, so enjoy the hair-raising descent! After about a dozen tries, I managed to get it on to the pad without destroying it. If you\u0027re going for an orbital mission, then after MECO turn the second stage to halfway between vertical and 45 degrees, then coast once your apoapsis is between 70 and 80 (the design\u0027s limits for orbit). Circularize, then ditch the second stage and have fun with the v2!\n\nNow for the shiny pics:\n\n![aZW5SV3.png](http://i.imgur.com/aZW5SV3.png)\n\n![MWq5Md8.png](http://i.imgur.com/MWq5Md8.png)\n\n![OxujW8I.png](http://i.imgur.com/OxujW8I.png)\n\n![C2p1aEL.png](http://i.imgur.com/C2p1aEL.png)\n\n![M2sdd7f.png](http://i.imgur.com/M2sdd7f.png)\n\n![RFDarsb.png](http://i.imgur.com/RFDarsb.png)\n\n![57R3Flj.png](http://i.imgur.com/57R3Flj.png)\n\n![FR35Nwe.png](http://i.imgur.com/FR35Nwe.png)\n\n![Ye4AN1X.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ye4AN1X.png)\n\n![iL7PZ2c.png](http://i.imgur.com/iL7PZ2c.png)\n\nReference image:\n\n![JE5rixW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JE5rixW.jpg)\n\n **Updated: Now with Falcon Heavy!**\n\n**Craft Download:**  [https://www./?typcivtfgl9wf2o](https://www./?typcivtfgl9wf2o)\n\n**Craft Info:** 285 parts at launch, 324.1 tons.\n\n**Flight Profile:**\n\nSame as any other rocket, really. Turn at 8-10k, drop the boosters with a little but of fuel and try landing one of them if you want. The core will burn for a long time after, leaving you plenty of Dv margins. Other than that, same as the Falcon 9!\n\n![84yGaeb.png](http://i.imgur.com/84yGaeb.png)\n\nThanks for viewing, leave some rep if you enjoyed! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T01:23:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 01:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zucal**\n  \nUpdated with esinohio\u0027s fabulous render."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T18:49:52Z","Content":"Looks very nice, I really like the lights as portholes.
