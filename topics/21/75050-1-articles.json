I like both of them, but I don\u0027t like having a ton of similar designs cluttering my VAB list. So I figured I\u0027d let the jury decide. Which design seems more aesthetically pleasing to you? The A-model or the B-model. The concept is a streamlined vehicle for launch (I know the KSP drag model isn\u0027t quite accurate yet), and then deploys into mission profile for moving larger D- and E-class asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe UV-4A uses four fairing doors to shroud the nuclear engine nacelles, which are mounted on extendable pistons from Magic Smoke Industries Infernal Robotics, as are the door hinges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1356.photobucket.com/user/raptor_9000/media/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/UV-4%20Dragan/UV-4APoster_zpscf265ad9.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q737/raptor_9000/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/UV-4%20Dragan/UV-4APoster_zpscf265ad9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UV-4APoster_zpscf265ad9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe UV-4B doesn\u0027t use separate fairing doors, but mounts the fairing shroud segments directly to the nacelles themselves. The hull sort of splits apart into four pieces, the large solar arrays also extend outward away from the nacelles to allow full rotation, and the aft nozzle shields swing back to shield the rear fuselage from the nuclear engine exhaust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1356.photobucket.com/user/raptor_9000/media/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/UV-4%20Dragan/UV-4BPoster_zps6472c3ce.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q737/raptor_9000/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/UV-4%20Dragan/UV-4BPoster_zps6472c3ce.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UV-4BPoster_zps6472c3ce.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth have similar part counts and masses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you think. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-14T18:38:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2014 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Raptor9\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T19:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, those are really awesome.
