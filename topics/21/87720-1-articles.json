I felt that since I did a bit of replica aircraft, for example, the SR-71 and the XB-70, I decided to make an old favorite, the A-10 Warthog. This Warthog bears the WR suffix because it is a weather research aircraft. It is very maneuverable, and I set the throttle limit to 60% on the engines to give it a more realistic speed limit. One other thing you\u0027ll notice in the screens is that I managed to offset the front landing gear like on the real thing, in order to make room for the goo experiment, instead of the Avenger cannon. It doesn\u0027t veer off of the runway on takeoff from that offset, I made sure to address that issue I had before. Anyway, here\u0027s my replica, enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7ix71i4q68iqn8k/AABcUWKDncpUS-CKUloB7IxYa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/7ix71i4q68iqn8k/AABcUWKDncpUS-CKUloB7IxYa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/70cmr936hcuw9vl/A-10WR%20Warthog.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/70cmr936hcuw9vl/A-10WR%20Warthog.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
