They are R.A.P.I.E.R./Nerva powered SSTOs designed to be easy to fly and efficient, and, upon refueling, to be capable of interplanetary travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, some notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The R.A.P.I.E.R. engines are all set to manual, and if you change this, it is advisable to remove the \u0022Switch Mode\u0022 command from the first action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Action group configuration: 1. Toggle intakes and switch R.A.P.I.E.R. modes, 2. Toggle Nerva, 3. Toggle R.A.P.I.E.R.s, 4. Toggle other engines(when applicable). There may be some exceptions to this in upcoming models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Nerva engines should be turned on at the same time you switch to Closed Cycle mode. Doing so improves your TWR and Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. While the Nerva engine is meant to be used for orbital circularization, it can take a while (at least 0:02:11, 3 minutes for the heavier ships) to complete the burn, so it may be advisable to simply keep it burning through your injection burn into your circularization burn, or to use the R.A.P.I.E.R.s to increase the acceleration for a short time while circularizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Do not try to land models other than the Mk-3I on atmosphere-less bodies (unless you know how, which I don\u0027t).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. When performing interplanetary travel, it is advisable to empty the jet fuel tanks in order to decrease the weight of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first ship I am presenting is the Cardinal Mk-2-2, the flagship of the Cardinal series. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qtZhm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The only differences are the modified wings to allow the fitting of the engines, as well as increased lift, and the VTOL engines themselves. This is one of the \u0022Heavier\u0022 Ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/dFX1R\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

They can be a little finicky to dock with, so just pull them up right by the side docking ports, extend their gear, and then release the brakes on the plane and the ports will pull themselves towards each other and dock. It is recommended to lower the front gear on a plane when docked to allow all of the wheels on the tugs to contact the ground. The Tug is saved as a subassembly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sQ86LjN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sQ86LjN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/ugatf7q57jb6m6a/Cardinal\u002BTug.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECardinal Tug Download\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: I changed the ships because having the docking ports at the very front of them could cause physics to go whacky when docked to large space stations.
