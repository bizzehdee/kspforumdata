I found that going much higher will cause her to nose up and flip, despite the number of reaction wheels I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve squeezed in to the design. Increase that level at your own risk!\n\nUse SAS to keep her under control.\n\nLots of part clipping; extending/retracting landing gear will cause a quick jump but nothing catastrophic. Advisable to turn on SAS and retract gear before take-off. For landing, extend gear well before ground just in case the jump screws you over.\n\nHas RCS jets for fine translation.\n\nThere\u0027s a Docking Port Jnr under the tail for connecting up a refueling tanker or whatever.\n\nHave fun!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T18:10:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 06:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by whoshotdk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T18:20:49Z","Content":"Oooh,\n\nvery nice!\n\nDid you use kerbpaint?\n\n\u002Brep"},{"CreatedByName":"whoshotdk","CreatedById":115018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T18:24:21Z","Content":"Hi Mad Rocket Scientist, thanks for the rep!\n\nNo Kerbal Paint, this is completely stock!
