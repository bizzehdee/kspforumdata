The Grus III is a long-range \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E capable of Mun landings, though according to my Delta V calculations it can easily go well beyond that. It can get into orbit very easily due to its high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E while using its Rapier engines. Its (roughly) estimated Delta V in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E is about 4,270 m/s (usually a little less).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecifications:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart Count: 97\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass: 80.545t\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeight: 5.8m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWidth: 22.8m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLength: 25.6m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vASNcAz.jpg\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vASNcAz.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere it is on The Mun. It can make the trip easily as it was designed for bigger missions. It is also equipped with four science experiments, located on the belly of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022otBe8Vr.jpg\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/otBe8Vr.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere it is in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. Some (kinda) strange features are its extra pair of engines. While very helpful during the initial ascent, extra reaction wheels are needed in space to prevent the Grus III from flipping all over the place due to the weird Center of Thrust. (At least this isn\u0027t the case with the nukes, though. That would be bad.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XBrLoVF.jpg\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XBrLoVF.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Grus III completed the Mun trip with quite a bit of fuel left over. I\u0027ve also taken it to Minmus, and Duna orbit (landing it was to hard to bother).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwpycuAS_53bcXdYMDl1MEhBV2s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwpycuAS_53bcXdYMDl1MEhBV2s\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
