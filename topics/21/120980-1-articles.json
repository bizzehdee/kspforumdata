I was not too worried about drag since it was only going to launch to orbit on Kerbin one time, and would spend its mission either in vacuum (Ike) or in the thin air of Duna. The decision to use vernors rather than a conventional rocket was driven primarily by control considerations: the vernor of course runs on the RCS system which permitted me to trigger it in bursts with the \u0022K\u0022 key while independently throttling the main engine. I don\u0027t think I ever fired it for more than a few seconds in any landing or takeoff. So from my perspective the drag didn\u0027t matter too much, control was superior, and I didn\u0027t have to carry the mass of an engine pointed the wrong way which I would not use for 99% of the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat drag on that drill tho-yeah, huge vector which you can see in D,OB! when I have the aero forces overlay enabled. I did attempt to put it in a bay but was a bit afraid of clipping bugs summoning Krakens and the like. I think that in the end though, having that much drag on the tail helped the ship make a stable landing on Kerbin--very little trouble putting Hummlebee in the middle of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso very glad you like the comics!
