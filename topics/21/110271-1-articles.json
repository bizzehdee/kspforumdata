Pick and choose how much fuel you would need for specific burns. See [Ore is overpowered thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117073-Ore-is-Overpowered). That way you wouldnt have to haul around or balance tanks pending on the next burn.\n\nEDIT: I did miss the first row of that tread. But still.

Basically, holding tanks would be able to hold coal, and a modified ISRU module would burn the coal and water (which would be storable in liquid fuel tanks, all of this using fuelswitch patch), and produce steam. Steam can be used to drive turbines for electricity, power RCS thrusters, rocket engines, and directly drive steam rover wheels.\n\nEDIT: Here\u0027s my version of the steampunk aircraft, the CF-1 Windsplitter\n\n![3DG1zF3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3DG1zF3.jpg)\n\nNamed after the early name for the science of aerodynamics, then called \u0022[windsplitting.](http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/bec/bec.htm)\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T13:23:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T15:00:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Downloaded craft.
