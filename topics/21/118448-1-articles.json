Long time no post! I think it\u0027s time to release this, it already has enough miles under its belt, and I think the design is more or less frozen. Presenting the longest-ranged SSTO in the R-SUV arsenal, this one should be capable of grand-touring the whole kerbol system, landing everywhere landable, except the usual suspects, Eve and Tylo. And it looks pretty nice if I say so myself!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hdNVe77.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hdNVe77.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, it\u0027s the usual trick of carrying a full-fledged miner kit with you around. And it even has a tiny scout satellite! You totally don\u0027t need it, of course, since the narrow band scanner is what you actually use to select the landing site, but you can\u0027t deny it looks cool. Plus, it has the only RTG in the build. But, hey, feel free to rip it out and put something else in its place. Like the ore tank so its centroid is inside the bay and it stops creating drag. Or Science and/or snacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan is simple: lift like a normal SSTO... well, almost. See, the Oxidizer is pretty limited so you will just use for a short burst, and you have nukes that you should light to push you through the transonic barrier, and that should also stay lit from 20kms onwards. But nothing too difficult, as long as you make a good speed run from 15 to 20kms in altitude, to a final speed on airbreathers of around 1,300m/s or so before you kick in the RAPIERs in closed cycle mode. Also, build vertical speed before the oxidizer runs out! Vacuum TWR on the nukes is nothing to write home about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, that is the launch. To go anywhere afterwards, head to Minmus and start the mining. Simple! Well, mostly simple, mining has a few quirks and considerations. First, I heartily recommend to fly this with an engineer on board at all times, at least a lvl1. You basically need the bonus to ore production in order to produce more ore than is consumed by running the fuel cells to keep the drill running... That, or trust the solar panel, only mine by day, and take a gazillion times longer to fill up the tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, take care to balance your fuel mixes depending on your next leg of the trip. Usually, you just want to forbid all oxidizer tanks but one so they don\u0027t fill (you need one to keep the fuel cells going), that way you bring the highest delta-v to bear on the next leg of your trip. But if you are on, say, Duna or Laythe\u0027s surface, you want to fill at least \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E of the oxidizer tanks in order to use the RAPIER\u0027s closed cycle power. In particular, you need all the LFO mix you can get for Duna, and only some for Laythe (I\u0027m dubious how much, I advise to copy the kerbin launch configuration in the file to play it safe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zEkMCCl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zEkMCCl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a last note, you will see on the album that there was a version that exchanged the refinery with a laboratory, for science gathering and such, but really, you pretty much need the whole tree unlocked to build this, and if you are just interested in gathering the science for completionism sake, you can always chuck some scientific instruments in the bay instead of the surveyor sat, and take a scientist dude with you as passenger to recycle them as you move along. That\u0027s pretty much it, the rest I think you can find out for yourself, like learning the action groups, or finding out that the drill works both on vertical and horizontal landings. Or finding out I was capable of fitting all this in an even 100 parts... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E Enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Nlutz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

If not, it\u0027ll be harder to control vertical speed with the crappy stock indicator (it\u0027s on the top, to the right of the altimeter). Basically, you climb at 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA until 10kms (make sure to use the runway to get the RAPIERs some initial bite in the air, or spend some time at 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA to build speed up to 200m/s, you\u0027ll climb faster). If you feel comfortable you can go higher, but all you spend by climbing shallower is a tiny bit more liquid fuel that won\u0027t drag you down when it\u0027s time to really speed up. Then you go supersonic either manually dropping the nose slowly, or by putting the autopilot on prograde and back to standard stability assist a few times to drop the nose \u003Cem\u003Egradually\u003C/em\u003E, to zero out your vertical velocity. It\u0027s tricky to go over the Mach barrier, I usually achieve it at about 5-10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA AoA over the horizon, and going slightly down. From then on it\u0027s much easier, you start building speed quickly and the wings bite more air, so watch your vertical velocity like a hawk and every time it goes above 50-100m/s or so, you drop the nose a bit (again, on and off the prograde autopilot is a handy trick). Give yourself time to accelerate. At about 15kms, drop all vertical speed (climb rate about zero), and lock stability assist in that heading: you will speed up \u003Cem\u003Emucho mucho mucho\u003C/em\u003E, and as the planet curves below you, your AoA will slowly creep up, building vertical speed for the climb to orbit. When you notice your speed stops increasing as fast, and the RAPIERs go under 50kN thrust you can switch them to closed cycle and just ride that heading until you time to apoapsis goes over one minute or so, at which time you should lock prograde autopilot to minimize drag during the coast to circularization.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only special thing is that you can light the nukes briefly when going transonic at about 10,000m and 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA AoA, to go over the mach barrier quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENice craft, will probably unconsciously replicate it one day \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
