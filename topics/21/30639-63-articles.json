At 30 km, I stopped pitching up, then pitched down to zero, let the plane descend about 2500 meters, then pitched all the way up to 45 degrees and ran the engines in jet mode until the vertical speed stopped increasing. Result: 100 km LKO with 200 m/s remaining, which translates to a saving of 300-400 m/s on the ascent.

The same thing can be achieved with proper vertical velocity management, BTW, only the perfect run is, of course, difficult to achieve, much less get consistently. Good idea to pack a reserve in case you don\u0027t nail it. Lots of people just don\u0027t know how to milk their designs, though... as a rule of thumb, I usually do a run ascending at 10m/s or less until I can\u0027t go faster to find out just how high and fast I can get on that particular design, which depends mostly on intake ratio and secondarily on T/W ratio. Then I try to copy that ascent... only getting to the final point with \u0026gt;100m/s vertical velocity, and leveling off for the speed run as late as I can, with perhaps even a small dip get enough time for accelerating before committing to the final ascent... but my best ascent never have the dip, that usually happens when I screw up and get up too fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important thing is to manage to go pretty much horizontal very close to your maximum flight altitude for long enough to get close to steady-state condition (i.e: drag equals thrust), therefore getting the most out of the air. People usually run out of air long before that, transitioning to rocket power before they get even close to their limit because they climb too fast. Or when they learn a bit more, by the time they do reach maximum velocity they are still horizontal and have to build up vertical speed on rocket power, which is inefficient (you are curving you trajectory upwards, actually, therefore working against some of the work you did on jets). And it\u0027s pretty damn hard to balance the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and running your rocket at the same time as your jets when you start to throttle down can give you a very fast ascent speed very efficiently, so as a rule of thumb I pretty much always turn them on when flameout force me under 50% thrust, and I keep the jets on until at least 30% throttle, by which time you are usually losing vertical speed and need to turn them off to throttle up and close the intakes. So yeah, hope you are doing it that way (if you can! that is a trick that doesn\u0027t work on RAPIERS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the real world you \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E use a dip-and-pull-back maneuver to get to a higher speed than would be possible otherwise (and the maneuver is used operationally by military planes, BTW), but that relies on aerodynamic lift to convert potential energy into kinetic one, and frankly, given KSP\u0027s aerodynamic model and the fact that wings pretty much offer no lift at the altitudes we are talking about... Unless you have Ferram Aerospace, expect that maneuver to cost you delta-v, not save you anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. So basically, knowing your SSTO, and loads of practice.
