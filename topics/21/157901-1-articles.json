Whether those will be spacecraft that I release for download will depend on what parts are added by the DLC and whether they\u0027re useful for my design styles, rather than the concept of DLC itself. I already make modded craft so I know not everyone\u0027s going to be able to download and use them; in fact, I expect more people will have the DLC than the number of people who have the full set of mods that are required for my entire spacecraft portfolio\u00A0to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would anticipate that\u00A0on KerbalX there will be a category added for spacecraft which require paid DLC in order to function. There will still be spacecraft uploaded which do not require it, and players who do not have the DLC would presumably be able to narrow down their searches to exclude DLC craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-19T04:15:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2017 04:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by eloquentJane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-19T04:15:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stock Plus\u2122\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krog34","CreatedById":160084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-19T07:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222990329\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157901\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489896911\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156657\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HebaruSan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, HebaruSan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stock Plus\u2122\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a stock only builder, I will definitely be trying out the expansion parts.
