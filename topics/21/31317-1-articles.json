It also holds 6 Kerbals in seats in the belly, 2 in a lander can in front of the seats, and one in a gunner pod on each side of the ship. The final nuclear engines should hold about 3000 dv but can be refueled. Also note: The \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eascent can be very unstable during the gravity turn but can be recovered if it begins to flip. I\u0027ve tested it multiple times and was able to reach orbit with most of the fuel from the stage before the nuclear engines kick in after a bad flip in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlbum: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Pdnwk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uXEGynq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uXEGynq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload Here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/eu1w98a6klo7fv1/LAAT_(Space).craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/eu1w98a6klo7fv1/LAAT_(Space).craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy and let me know what you think as well as any bugs with the design!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-05T02:47:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2013 02:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stoddard14\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T16:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell done!
