(\u0027only\u0027 around 700 parts ^^)\n\noperations advices : \n\nfor using the elevator, once jeb took place in the elevator\u0027s seat, stage once to separate the elevator from the rest, and press \u0027S\u0027 to make the rover climb up ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) simply activate the parking brakes once you reached the platform, so the elevator remains in place. \n\nthe rocket has largely more than enough fuel to do the mission, so i\u0027ll leave to you the way to orbit (i had around 1000m/s of delta-v remaining in the upperstage after circularisation when i made the mission album ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))\n\nthe spacecraft\u0027s retrorocket has around 100m/s of delta-v with it\u0027s separatron engine, but you still have some RCS fuel if you need to ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) nevertheless, try to keep under a 100x100 orbit to be on the safe side and be sure you\u0027ll be able to deorbit the spacecraft ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nthe ejector seat works... most of the time ^^ it\u0027s generaly more reliable during ascent than on the pad ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) simply hit the abort key, and the hatch will be blown off the capsule, followed by the kerbal (even with the fairing still in place). i\u0027ve used the COM shifting of the ejector seat so it\u0027s flight makes a \u0027S\u0027 shape - as the CoM of the seat shifts from one side of the CoT to the other during the separatron burn. press 0 to deploy the parachute in case of abort ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) (or mash space through the stages ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))\n\nthe ejector seat has it\u0027s own parachute, (and the normal staging is made so jeb can eject to land separatly from the capsule)\n\ni had to keep the core stage\u0027s gimbals active on the MK-55 engines - unfortunately, the fairing creates enough lift to overcome the capabilities of control of the 24-77 engines - so using the core stage\u0027s gimbal compensate (though it makes the rocket a bit wobbly) - you can activate or desactivate the core stage\u0027s gimbals with the actiongroup 1 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) (generally, once you discared the fairing) \n\nhere are the .craft files ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) have fun ! \n\nnormal version : [http://www./download/5bqya3oufrkjup1/Vostok.craft](http://www./download/5bqya3oufrkjup1/Vostok.craft)\n\n\u0027lite\u0027 version without launch pad : [http://www./download/2w12jkyatv59xxz/Vostok_lite.craft](http://www./download/2w12jkyatv59xxz/Vostok_lite.craft)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T01:12:24Z","Content":"Wow!
