Like Rombus, KROMBUS is an uncrewed, fully reusable, one-and-a-half stage booster meant to lift heavier payloads into orbit and then return home using a mixture of parachutes and rocket power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test payload I used is around 38-40 Kerbal tons. Krombus uses fuel from 12 drop tanks which are jettisoned in the high atmosphere and parachute to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://sadpanda.us/images/1066717-IKS36J0.png\u0022 alt=\u00221066717-IKS36J0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I have with this is that on my dinky \\\u002708 MacBook, KSP runs slow as molasses on normal settings and even with a modified config the sheer number of parts involved (especially struts and fuel lines, I guess) really bogs the thing down. \u003Cstrong\u003ETo anyone out there with a better computer capable of running a KSP mission with lots and lots of parts,\u003C/strong\u003E I\\\u0027d be grateful if you would take this rocket for a spin, and maybe include some critiques and pictures if you decide to post.

However, the severe amount of lag caused by so many parts made landing difficult and I could not successfully throttle the ship for a soft touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
