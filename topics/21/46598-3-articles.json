Using up the fuel in the rover\u0027s tank causes CoM shift and will unbalance the ship. Having to bring the rover down fully fuelled means that you need to do some sort of refuelling as it doesn\u0027t have enough fuel for a one shot trip directly to the surface. Either keep the rocket stage in LKO and refuel that rocket, or refuel the lander stage in Mun orbit before going for deorbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as a rule of thumb it\u0027s a good idea to do your deorbit burn from a low orbit. If I were to bring that rover to the surface I would go for a 20-30km orbit above the Mun surface, refuel to full by sending a tanker to meet it and then perform the powered landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toggelhase","CreatedById":71569,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T05:48:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just came across this Modular bast kit - and really like it.
