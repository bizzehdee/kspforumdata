Mainly, they sucked...badly. After the 14th test pilot went down in a high-altitude flat spin of flames, Kerbalife executives sent out a procurement order for off-the-shelf systems in a competitive bid. After months of expos and airshow attendances, 12 shiny new KF-X Sparrows were purchased. At first the pilots loved them because, well, they didn\u0027t kill them outright. However, attempts to use the KF-X for delivery of small space objects sometimes left the pilots with very little delta-V for the return trip, especially with slightly larger masses or higher orbital targets. After confering with higher-ups, the engineers began tearing them apart to find out what made them tick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe requirements for the improved Sparrow, dubbed the Angry Bird, were for use of atomic engines, the ability to take at least 1 ton of cargo into 120km orbit, and use entirely oxidized fuel. Hidden parts were also stripped out, including the faulty mono-propellant tanks, and the troublesome neck-docking clamp was removed for a more conventional piece after an early model disassembled itself in orbit. The current model can put a dual-loaded cargo load into 100km orbit with about 1000 delta-V to spare, and can also refuel for a full 3200 delta-V at any LKO station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/t5jk62p43ongdue/AA-40C%20Cobra%20%28Export%29.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAA-40C Cobra\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s17.postimg.org/ha0sa4kn3/AA_40_C_Cobra.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AA_40_C_Cobra.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s13.postimg.org/a5ah33dtz/Cobra_Piggyback.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Cobra_Piggyback.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cobra is the bastard step-child of the mildly successful AA-39 Pythagorus flying triangle and the abortive AA-03 Mouser III design responsible for the deaths of 8 brave test pilots.

The conversion was conceived and performed as part of an off-handed bet between Billy-Bobias and Sidson Kerbal over whether 2-1 rocket-jet combo was more efficient than a 1-2 rocket-jet combo. The result was a powerhouse re-dubbed the Mighty Mouse. Its efficient design allowed it to take 2 kerbals into LKO with still about 2500 delta-v to spare without a refuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbalife executive board was split between putting the Mighty Mouse into full fleet production or holding out for \u0022something that didn\u0027t look like a *** ***.\u0022 The aesthetics fans wanted a rework of the Sparrow design instead. After about 2 weeks of virtual war in the boardroom, a compromise was made wherein the new engine layout would be a 2-2.

Given that 30 tons just made it into orbit without losing any stages, it suddenly found itself in the SSTO category. After some tinkering with the original retrofit, the \u0022lander can\u0022 cockpit was added, the 3-man was dropped in favor of cargo, and the engines were placed outward from the body so as to accomodate odd-sized underslung loads. The result can put up to 5 tons into LKO with just enough delta-V to de-orbit and do a controlled parachute/VTOL landing right back at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s10.postimg.org/vmoxvsix5/Confederate_Ascent_Profile.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Confederate_Ascent_Profile.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s14.postimg.org/oje82vrjl/Confederate_Landing.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Confederate_Landing.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor best results, plug in the numbers above into your favorite ascent computer, kick on the atomics at 30,000m, turn off the jets at 36,000, and you should be home free as long as you\u0027re keeping the throttle at safe jet levels. Landings do need some jet assistance, as the chutes will get it to 10 m/s or so, jets will be needed to get it down to \u0026lt; 5 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the future, we will be posting up threads of Dropships, Capital Ships, and our very own line of Space Station parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolegato Kerbal, Kerbalife Independent Designer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAddendum - Basic SSTO instructions:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for flight profile, testing these gave me some very hardcore experience (probably spent easily 100 hours getting spaceplanes into orbit). Here\u0027s the basic idea for any of them:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Don\u0027t mess with the intakes, you have enough to worry about and a few points of drag coefficient at lower altitudes isn\u0027t worth the headache.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Basic safety level for air is (Number of Jets) x (Approximate throttle by points)/10 so if the air level is showing .03 and you have two engines, you can run them at 15% throttle. One turbojet is good enough for anything at altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) At around 30,000m you can kick on the LV-Ns and keep your throttle low and run everything. Keep tapping the throttle lower as you climb. Mechjeb 2 is ok at doing this if you set it to \u0022prevent flameout with safety 20%\u0022. A flameout at 5% throttle isn\u0027t going to kill you with the LV-Ns going also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The real trick - when the jets cut out, make sure you\u0027re still gaining altitude. Its very hard to change your velocity upwards again if you\u0027re altitude is dropping. This is the key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) When the jets cut out, turn them off, crank the LVN\u0027s to full, and pitch up hard. You should have about 60-75 degree AoA and your prograde (yellow circle) should be just above the horizon or more. Your altitude should still be gaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) If your altitude hits 40km, you\u0027re golden. My way of monitoring is to watch your \u0022Time to Apoapsis\u0022 number. If it goes below zero, you\u0027re screwed, if it gets close to zero and creeps back up, you\u0027re good. Any number above zero is good until it goes to a BIG number below zero. With LVNs your climb can sometimes be another 5-10 knuckle biting minutes. You have a lot of dV though so don\u0027t sweat too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Your Apoapsis will start to rapidly out-pace your altitude, when it hits the desired orbit then cut the engines or drop them back down and just run them in tiny bursts until you\u0027re out of the 69,000 altitude range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) With LVNs, you don\u0027t burn much fuel, so if your numbers above don\u0027t look good, cut engines until you get back down to 20-25km and then try again. Each try you\u0027ll be a hair lighter so its that much easier. You should get at least 3 good tries on most of these craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this becomes very second nature after a while. Using Mechjeb 1 or 2 can also be a good time saver - turn on \u0022Ascent\u0022 about step 5 - though you do need to heavily babysit and adjust numbers for each craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-22T03:54:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2013 03:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PolecatEZ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tallinu","CreatedById":57810,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T08:00:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s10.postimg.org/vmoxvsix5/Confederate_Ascent_Profile.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Confederate_Ascent_Profile.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s14.postimg.org/oje82vrjl/Confederate_Landing.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Confederate_Landing.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor best results, plug in the numbers above into your favorite ascent computer\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m afraid \u0022the numbers above\u0022 in that image are unreadable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bunch of these ships look really nice though!
