On the first two attempts the ship landed beautifully but on touching the munar surface it suddenly began to roll uncontrolably, resulting in a toppeled over lander. On the third attempt i replaced the folding solar panels with the smaller solar panels and i changed the landinglegs.\n\nThe voyage wasn\\\u0027t very fortunate. After the munar injection burn, the ship was on a direct collision course with the mun. It took quite a lot of fuel to get into orbit, which was almost polar. It cost a large amount of fuel to get to orbit over the base.\n\nThe ship landed safely without damage but with tanks almost dry. The ship can return to earth (after the inflatable habitat is jettisoned), provided the tank is filled again by a resupply ship. For the time being an inflatable habitat has been added to the base (for those who are unable to room in the space hotel).\n\n![2dl9fte.png](http://i47.tinypic.com/2dl9fte.png)\n\n![nf1mk5.png](http://i48.tinypic.com/nf1mk5.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"khyron42","CreatedById":8551,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T14:02:20Z","Content":"Wow - that tall and narrow, I expect it will topple eventually from the jolt everything seems to suffer when another craft comes within 200 meters - but good landing!\n\nWas that using your sfs analyzer to produce a limited part set bundle still, or have you done something else?\n\n**Speedollama, it\\\u0027s your turn!**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCardinal","CreatedById":22874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T16:03:07Z","Content":"I didn\\\u0027t have to use the analyzer.
