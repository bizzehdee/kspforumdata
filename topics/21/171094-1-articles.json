It won\u0027t go to orbit, but then why would you want to go to orbit with a boat? It\u0027s fun to fly, is fully amphibious, ditches and takes off water easily, and has a handy ladder in case the pilot wants to take a dip and get back on-board, and a cargo bay with a ramp in case she wants to pack a lunch, or a rover, or something else that can be rolled on, or off. Passenger variants with Mk 3 passenger modules are also feasible, I tried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WD9OBkO.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WD9OBkO.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo ditch, slow down to 100 m/s at 50 m altitude, then hold wings and nose level\u00A0until you notice that you\u0027ve stopped. Completely no-drama and very forgiving, it doesn\u0027t mind if you plop it down a bit nose-first, or fly it down a bit fast; I\u0027ve made touchdowns at well over 100 m/s without any issues whatsoever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo take off, hit full power, waggle your wings to get the floats out of the water, hold attitude horizontal until you\u0027re going at 50 m/s or so, then pull up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf somebody flies a practical mission for this, I\u0027d be curious to know what it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Brikoleur/Long-Umpire\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Brikoleur/Long-Umpire\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Named after the most iconic flying boat of all, the Short Empire, although the looks are more Caspian Sea Monster.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KOCOUR","CreatedById":37749,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-20T12:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo Ugly, i like it.
