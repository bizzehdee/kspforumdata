The formula one of the Kerbin skies now boasts increased range and operational capability while losing none of it\u0027s signature maneuverability, with perfectly balanced aero for maximum performance and SAS-free flying. This unique design achieves a ridiculous low-G turning circle with high yaw-assisted, roll rates. Orbit is a breeze with enough dV at LKO to grab Mun or Minmus for transfers and refueling.\n\n![nts1ZRg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nts1ZRg.jpg)\n\n![qD8uGYT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qD8uGYT.jpg)\n\n![XpKse6X.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XpKse6X.jpg)\n\n![tslJBc8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tslJBc8.jpg)\n\n![evv98ug.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/evv98ug.jpg)\n\n![6CFe0lw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6CFe0lw.jpg)\n\nThis is definitely a craft all spaceplane fans should have in their hanger.
