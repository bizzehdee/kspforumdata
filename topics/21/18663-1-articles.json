His ideas, so radical, pushed the current technology of duck tape and old aircraft components. The aircraft he built from these parts went on to be the AS2 - A radical assemetrical aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RqCg8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RqCg8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design, which is quite under powered, was just something that I have tried to do for a while. The main parts of the design was a long left hand fuel tank, with the cabin and second fuel tanks on the right. The wing was formed in the middle and the design altered for drag reasons (inculiding the addition of vortex generators on the right fuselage). The engine was then placed and configured from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft is quite annoying to take off with, owing to the lack of thrust from the single engine. But once its in the air, it flies amazingly for a design that looks like it should blow up before the engine is started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W3aKZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W3aKZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe AS3 was a development of the AS2 design. It has 3 fuel pods, powering two of the after burning jets. This design is just as hard to take off with, but just as rewording to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T08:30:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome craft \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E, I am a big fan of asymmetric designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TalonX273","CreatedById":43698,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T08:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwww gawd....
