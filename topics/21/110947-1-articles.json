Those rockets are designed to be a cost efficient way to orbit payload (from 15 tons to 300 tons) to LKO. Their mass efficiency ranges from 15% to 19%. Then you can deorbit them, reenter Kerbin atmosphere and make a slightly powered landing as near as KSC as possible to maximize cost return. You can easily get around 95% of the dry cost of the launcher.\n\n[![418d2eb5-ebec-4ae4-994c-9ac6f7925492.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview2/418d2eb5-ebec-4ae4-994c-9ac6f7925492.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/418d2eb5-ebec-4ae4-994c-9ac6f7925492.jpg)\n\n(all picture are clickable)\n\n**Cygnus Package**\n\nDownload package : [Test crafts and sub-assemblies (160kB)](http://n.lejeune.free.fr/ksp/cygnus_rrg.zip)\n\nThis file contains:\n\n- 11 launch stage sub-assemblies\n- 11 test rockets craft\n\n**General flying** (1.0.4)\n\nAscent profile\n\n- Don\u0027t activate SAS at take-off.\n- Start gravity turn when speed is 40m/s. You should get to 45\u00B0 at 8km.\n- You may experience sliding during ascent : try to compensate or activate SAS.\n- Orbit insertion burn should be from 300 to 600m/s.\n- Wobbling payloads can wreck ascent. I suggest you use the \u0022Kerbal Joints Reinforcement\u0022 mod created by Ferram4.\n\nIn space\n\n- You should have 100 to 200m/s left before detaching the payload\n- When on stable orbit, detach payload and stay on the SSTO stage.\n- You should have a comfortable 200 to 500m/s of dV left for reentry.\n- As the stage doesn\u0027t have any power generation, it will run out of power in few orbits.\n\nReentry\n\n- I suggest a 60m/s deorbit on the west border of the crater (90\u00B0 west of KSC). This means you would slighly overshoot KSC (70km)\n- Follow retrograge if you want.\n- Deploy airbrakes as soon as possible. If you forget, you\u0027ll destroy your chutes later and crash.\n- Drogue chutes and regular chutes are configured to autodeploy at safe altitude (if you deploy airbrakes). Stage them as soon as possible (even in space)\n- If you overshoot a lot, you can burn fuel, but keep at least 100m/s for powered landing. If you\u0027re too short, you can close airbrakes, but that\u0027s dangerous : you may not slow down enough to open you chutes safely.\n- Drogues should deploy at 8km/5km (500m/s) and regular should open at 3km/800m (250m/s)\n- At 100m, enable SAS to reduce rocket flip in water.\n- Landing are powered : under 75m, tap \u0022shift\u0022 once or twice to slow down around 5m/s.\n- On touchdown or splashdown, keep SAS on and recover the stage as soon as possible. Don\u0027t let the rocket flip in water or fall on ground, that will break some expensive parts.\n\n**Specifics**\n\n- Cygnus RR-015 can be landed without firing the engine. Beware of flipping though\n- Cygnus RR-032 and RR-100 don\u0027t have double symmetry. If you want to use them on a non eastward ascent, rotate the rocket.\n- Cygnus RR-015, RR-032 and RR-100 will probably flip when landed, Don\u0027t delay the vessel recovery.\n- Cygnus RR-075 has an additional skipper which is used only during the first ascent. It shuts down quickly by design.\n- Cygnus RR-125 don\u0027t use fuel conduits. The lateral engines will shutdown quicker than the central one. Beware of loosing power at landing\n\n[![3f085756-93e7-4916-adda-532e5935fa0a.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/3f085756-93e7-4916-adda-532e5935fa0a.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/3f085756-93e7-4916-adda-532e5935fa0a.jpg) [![bb0726a5-5e13-4d6b-9bb0-fc4ea55a0f30.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/bb0726a5-5e13-4d6b-9bb0-fc4ea55a0f30.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/bb0726a5-5e13-4d6b-9bb0-fc4ea55a0f30.jpg) [![d0883fc2-be46-402f-bc21-8e4a8e16cd54.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/d0883fc2-be46-402f-bc21-8e4a8e16cd54.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/d0883fc2-be46-402f-bc21-8e4a8e16cd54.jpg)\n\n[![ff9c0f7d-1132-410a-9cf6-b491289c1279.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/ff9c0f7d-1132-410a-9cf6-b491289c1279.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/ff9c0f7d-1132-410a-9cf6-b491289c1279.jpg) [![40e9d24b-422b-4d43-92c7-9ee12dc5d448.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/40e9d24b-422b-4d43-92c7-9ee12dc5d448.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/40e9d24b-422b-4d43-92c7-9ee12dc5d448.jpg) [![edab5e2b-e997-4dbb-ba85-ed24174f446a.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/edab5e2b-e997-4dbb-ba85-ed24174f446a.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/edab5e2b-e997-4dbb-ba85-ed24174f446a.jpg)\n\n**Design usage**\n\n- All Cygnus SSTO stages come with a test craft and sub-assembly. The test crafts have a dead payload of the max weight of each stage.\n- Rocket designation : Cygnus RR rocket identification is it\u0027s maximum payload\n- Techlevel is quite high, especially because of large probe core and battery.\n- Don\u0027t hesitate to remove the adapter and decoupler to use a bigger one. Also, add the fairing to the SSTO stage if needed.\n- Heat shield is designed for LKO reentry, it\u0027s half full on purpose.\n- If you have a lighter weight, I suggest reducing the engine thrust to match rocket TWR. To reduce cost, you can remove some fuel tanks. As a rule of thumb 3400m/s is sufficient to ascent properly with some comfortable margin to deorbit and partially powered landing with a TWR from 1.35 to 1.5 (tested).\n- If payload makes your rocket flip, change bottom wings to bigger ones. Also, try reducing speed between 5km and 20km.\n- No part clipping.\n- 4 winglets can be added somewhere under parachutes, but I\u0027ve noticed they aren\u0027t that useful. They will probably blow during reentry.\n\n[![625a194f-d191-444a-a93f-c131e6bfcf9d.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/625a194f-d191-444a-a93f-c131e6bfcf9d.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/625a194f-d191-444a-a93f-c131e6bfcf9d.jpg) [![66b79898-79a2-439f-a3cb-4e017e506954.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/66b79898-79a2-439f-a3cb-4e017e506954.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/66b79898-79a2-439f-a3cb-4e017e506954.jpg) [![27fcbd8b-bef2-4dae-aff7-3d207d0d6c32.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/27fcbd8b-bef2-4dae-aff7-3d207d0d6c32.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/27fcbd8b-bef2-4dae-aff7-3d207d0d6c32.jpg)\n\n**Specifications** \n\n![cygnus_g.png](http://n.lejeune.free.fr/ksp/cygnus_g.png)\n\n[![586f4718-5b30-49f6-8e30-d89a7e17e887.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/586f4718-5b30-49f6-8e30-d89a7e17e887.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/586f4718-5b30-49f6-8e30-d89a7e17e887.jpg) [![fa433945-da86-496c-b06a-d2f7989941d3.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/fa433945-da86-496c-b06a-d2f7989941d3.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/fa433945-da86-496c-b06a-d2f7989941d3.jpg) [![44fff91a-fb0b-45c8-b1ed-7beec6167593.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/44fff91a-fb0b-45c8-b1ed-7beec6167593.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/44fff91a-fb0b-45c8-b1ed-7beec6167593.jpg)  \nRR-015, RR-032 and RR-050\n\n[![16d337e1-9bae-4e00-ba05-67e7d4ad7975.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/16d337e1-9bae-4e00-ba05-67e7d4ad7975.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/16d337e1-9bae-4e00-ba05-67e7d4ad7975.jpg) [![78c96672-5a30-4ecf-a5b9-9b0d5b21b49d.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/78c96672-5a30-4ecf-a5b9-9b0d5b21b49d.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/78c96672-5a30-4ecf-a5b9-9b0d5b21b49d.jpg) [![f34e5a10-04e0-4a4d-bce0-5098524c23cc.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/f34e5a10-04e0-4a4d-bce0-5098524c23cc.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/f34e5a10-04e0-4a4d-bce0-5098524c23cc.jpg)  \nRR-075, RR-100 and RR-125\n\n[![1129468c-03ea-4b82-b966-d0c5d9dfecdc.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/1129468c-03ea-4b82-b966-d0c5d9dfecdc.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/1129468c-03ea-4b82-b966-d0c5d9dfecdc.jpg) [![0f411c8f-cf57-406f-a06a-97d8ea7ab96e.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/0f411c8f-cf57-406f-a06a-97d8ea7ab96e.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/0f411c8f-cf57-406f-a06a-97d8ea7ab96e.jpg) [![2ac0ad75-20b5-44ef-8571-ddfa525e1121.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/2ac0ad75-20b5-44ef-8571-ddfa525e1121.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/2ac0ad75-20b5-44ef-8571-ddfa525e1121.jpg)  \nRR-150, RR-200 and RR-300\n\n[![e34dbb4a-9aaa-46c6-aeec-9bb738db21ef.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/e34dbb4a-9aaa-46c6-aeec-9bb738db21ef.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/e34dbb4a-9aaa-46c6-aeec-9bb738db21ef.jpg) [![b1caa6cd-d7fb-4919-9624-66a4b55e2759.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/b1caa6cd-d7fb-4919-9624-66a4b55e2759.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/b1caa6cd-d7fb-4919-9624-66a4b55e2759.jpg)  \nRR-400, RR-600\n\nFeedback appreciated.![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-02T08:49:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2015 08:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz**"},{"CreatedByName":"oversoul","CreatedById":66822,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:44:26Z","Content":"Wow man, I wish I had more rep to give.\n\nImpressive work."},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:56:33Z","Content":"You know?

The 5mT one launches small orbiters for recovering kerbals and stuff in orbit, and the 2.5 lightest one can launch satellites *very* cheaply for mucho profit. Note they were built in a career save with minimal tech (basically, just after unlocking the Skipper, Boar, and orange tank), and part count is ridiculously low (like, around 30 parts).\n\nOh, and I also forgot: a good way to make rocket stable, even long thin ones, is to mess with fuel flow so the lower tanks empty first: empty, they act like a nice stabilizer in the back, instead of making you unstable when emptying from the top down.\n\nRune.

Do you think airbrakes orientation have some effect on generated drag ?\n\nProbably not since this is KSP, but you know, they look much better when they open the right way. And yeah, as long as you land withing about 500km of KSC (which is a sizeable fraction of the planet) you get above 90% of the cost. Plus, water is much more forgiving now to tipping over!\n\nA few other things I found you might like for v2.0:\n\n-To use cheap, low tech probes, put them on the other side of the fairing, or inside a service bay. EE\u0027s \u0022activate surface attachment\u0022 helps, but you can also place them on a cubic strut to put them next to the decoupler (or inside it) without them messing with the structural integrity of your rocket on account of their weak tiny nodes. On the way down, the engines will shield them from reentry effects anyway.\n\n-The new small fins burn up real quick. That is a plus on a design that has to be aerodynamically stable on two opposite directions at different times, you lose them high and regain stability when flying tail-first. Just in case fuel routing is not enough to keep it stable on ascent, like with my small one up there that only has one tank.\n\n-The really awesome engine for (very) light chemical SSTOs would be the aerospike. High tech, but it has *both* high sea level and vacuum isp, while having a respectable TWR. But I have a feeling doing clusters of them the old way is a good way to generate a lot of drag (all those unconnected nodes and such). I want an eight-coupler!\n\nI have been working on my end a bit, BTW. My current RLV family is 5,10,15,20,and 30mT to LKO. I think for the VAB section in R-SUV, they will be half of the new booster line, picking up with expendables at 50mT and 75, 100, and beyond. Just because you have the really heavy RLV\u0027s covered, and the part count jumps a lot when you have to go so big (currently the light ones are around 30-50 parts each).\n\nRune. The really nice part about airbrakes is how they cushion the impact when your booster tips over because you landed on mountains. That, and the chutes not cutting! I love that."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T11:40:33Z","Content":"@Rune,\n\nAbout the lower tech probe core : older version had a service bay with a small battery and a small probcore in it. It was fixed at the bottom, just under the heatshield (with another heatshield on it). But that seems badly designed, I removed it as soon as I could. I even tried to add a rockamax adapter to make the rocket bottom look better, but that adapter exploded during renetry...\n\nAdding a bigger bay on top of the stage looked better, but it usually crumbled and wobble under the payload weight.\n\nAbout fins : small fins are too weak to help the rocket ascent straight. My first rocket had event bigger wings. Further more, all rockets are stable during reentry (bottom first). Only the smaller one goes sideways went chutes are mid-open, but end straight when fully-open.\n\nAbout airbrakes : I didn\u0027t notices they helped when the rocket is falling down. Mayby I could try inverting them.\n\nAs for water, laying down is still dangerous. but usually you don\u0027t loose really much. You only have to recover mutiple parts.\n\nI was also thinking about removing the reaction wheels and adding 4 vernor at the bottom of the rocket (can be hard depending on the design). As the rocket has quite some fuel left, it could be efficient. I could even reduce the battery size.

I\u0027ve tried SSTO spaceplanes, but they just take so damn long to get to orbit and don\u0027t have near the fuel left that these do, plus they also take so damn long to get back to the surface.

My 240 tons was even easier to create than my 12 tons.\n\nI can\u0027t imagine how hard a plane SSTO capable to lift off 240T.\n\nAn other advatage of rocket SSTO over regular staged rockets : they grossly keep the same aero profile. They don\u0027t loose wings or have high TWR variations. I find them easier to fly.\n\nI must admit I played beta 0.9 in science gamemode.

I\u0027ve usually 750m/s left after releasing payload (that\u0027s around 300 to 400m/s). I could remove half of it, and looking at the size of some rockets, it\u0027s not a negligeable fuel tank... (one biggest fuel tank)\n\nAs the objective of those launchers is to send payload to LKO (75km) for a very cheap price, they don\u0027t need so much fuel. 200m/s is enough to deorbit and for powered landing.\n\nMy usual dV is 3650m/S. I could target 3500m/s at optimal payload. Of course, in real usage, you\u0027re usually below the optimal payload and then, your dV is higher.\n\nFurther more, removing fuel means that TWR will rise : and when TWR rises, I add payload. In other words. I\u0027ll transfert unused fuel from the SSTO to the payload. The heaviest payload could rise to near 300T.\n\nMy clean scale of paload could be messed up...\n\nMuch testing to do"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:34:04Z","Content":"OK I\u0027m refitting launchers (I\u0027ve done the 3 heaviest).
