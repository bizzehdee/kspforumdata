First in orbit, using its service module to boost into a 150km orbit from a 100km orbit before returning to Kerbin. Next, it was used to do 2 orbits around the mun and return. All is looking well for this craft, and I believe its injection stage has PLENTY of fuel to make the burn to intercept Martian orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, any names will be helpful.

The injection stage circularizes a 100km orbit and then makes the burn to intercept Mars\\\u0027s patch. Then the panels fall off and the service module flights toward Mars. It uses its SPS engine to drop into Martian orbit and then return. At 110,000 meters from Kerbin, the command module separates from the service stage and at 68,000 meters, it activates its heat shield and makes a dramatic reentry towards Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-14T20:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks a little small to me.. are you sure it would have enough fuel to get to Mars and back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the name of it..

I launched my first Martian Module into Kerbin orbit about 20 minutes ago where it used its service stage to make two altitude corrections (224x200 --\u0026gt; 220x220km). The Descent stage was used to descend the lander into an orbit of 100km circular with plenty of fuel to spare. The Ascent stage deorbited the spacecraft and it reentered the atmosphere and splashed down off the western coast near KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a highly successful flight and has only one more test to go. This is to put the rocket into an initial orbit of 100KM and then use its injection stage to boost its apokee to an orbit of 100x1200km. The SM, the descent stage and the ascent stage will be used to make various corrections. If it can reenter with the launch to orbit of 100km and the Hohmann transfer successful, it will be qualified for the first Martian mission when the planet is released. I decided I will NOT take it to the Mun. This is a Martian program and will be treated as such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it seems Grissom II was a highly successful test of the Martian Module in Kerbin orbit. If Grissom II goes well, the Module will make its first flight to Mars when it is released on Grissom IV.
