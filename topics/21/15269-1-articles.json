It\\\u0027s a three-stage rocket, with the first being four parallel boosters, the second the core booster, and the third the upper booster. No solid rocket boosters are used on the entire vehicle. The capsule returns with two side-mounted parachutes, since the ASAS and RCS tank are mounted above the capsule, as an orbital science and equipment module, with the front of the ASAS acting as a dummy docking ring. That dummy ring needs to be exposed, so an ejectable cap is placed on top of it. The service module has a one-depth large tank, with three radial engines for propulsion in orbit. The entire craft has eight RCS thruster blocks, and there are plenty of ladders around the ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDemo album: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/F7MSO#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/F7MSO#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft is attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: The Leo is the capsule/service/orbital modules, the Baker is the launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ToadDude","CreatedById":26053,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T11:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was your 666th post \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, great rocket!
