Therefore vertical flight has to be conducted with the aircraft at a 25 degree pitch.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBuilding this craft took a couple of days, with the hinge being the hardest part. Flying the aircraft however - that\u0027s another thing entirely.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is a video showing some of my flight testing adventures with this unwieldily beast:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/U7ZP_NEWlFY?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dropbear67","CreatedById":195798,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-15T02:25:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nentertaining video! thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-15T07:16:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a very cool craft, but I\u0027m eager to see what sort of craft people can make with stock single part hinges and rotors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be great if rotor speed could be adjusted smoothly, as with throttle, instead of clicking menus to alter deployment state of control surfaces....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
