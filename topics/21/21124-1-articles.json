It takes off at about 100 m/s and is like the Virgin Galactic in a way because the main plane gets the aircraft to about 15-17 thousand meters then you detach and fly the plane around, very good at landing with the plane on top. I also have another plane without it on top, just the main body it\u0027s called the Triton Lander, Hope you guys enjoy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETriton II \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?wigh5xcabjgx5ux\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?wigh5xcabjgx5ux\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETriton Lander \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?qxv9exhyhj3c89a\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?qxv9exhyhj3c89a\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eX7Dx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eX7Dx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2O1qv.png\u0022 alt=\u00222O1qv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComment what you think of them and thanks for looking at these.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pikmin2faner","CreatedById":33592,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T15:59:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks nice, and maybe youshould move on to the next stage and make a spaceplane that can orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
