It\\\u0027s a re-usable space plane that uses a chunk of parts from the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=7178.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKosmos pack\u003C/a\u003E.

It wasn\\\u0027t until Kerbin\\\u0027s elite team (Jeb, Bob and Bill) flew it that scientists began to fully understand it. Jeb had noticed that the reason it didn\\\u0027t fly too well at times is because it was very heavy with space fuel, he pointed out to the scientists that for testing the atmospheric flight part of a re-usable plane that it is often a good plan to test with the amount of fuel you\\\u0027ll have by that point!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFollowing this it was quickly realised that this machine could take off horizontally with a rocket burn and fly vertically straight into an orbit. By the time it came back in for landing all the heavy rocket fuel was burnt and it could be landed by a mere mortal Kerbal.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the runway initially use the jets, light the rockets (second stage) towards the end of the runway - pull up as you go off the end and you\\\u0027ll take off cleanly. I could have changed the plane for a bit more front lift but it didn\\\u0027t look as nice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here you can burn vertically or any other angle you could chose to get into an orbit you want (it\\\u0027ll get into a orbit around the Mun no problems, not tried Minmus yet) - you\\\u0027ll ideally need to keep the rockets lit most of the time, it handles like a brick without the rockets lit as the jet engines don\\\u0027t have enough thrust to keep a full tank of fuel\\\u0027s weight in the air well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn your return trip to Kerbin you\\\u0027ll be low or empty on Rocket fuel leaving just the jet tanks in the middle hopefully (note that both engines can use both tanks, the big side tanks are used first) and will find it a much more manageable beast. It can even land and take off without falling off the end of the runway with rocket engines lit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid a quick flight this morning, straight into an orbit around Kerbin, dropped back into atmo above the Space Centre. Judged it near perfectly and only had to fly for about a minute on jet engines to come in and land on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll point out that I fly this on a gamepad, so have the benefit of analog control. There is no ASAS as it\\\u0027s really quite stable once you are moving. For burning out of atmo leaving it on precision control mode and using the keyboard should be more than enough. Imagine landing will be a pain though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny feedback would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJay\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PianoBasher","CreatedById":29041,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T20:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust tried it out, I think it needs a bit of tweaking as it seems a bit easy to lose control completely.
