It\u0027s totally reusable and might be able to send 40-45 tons to LKO with some adjustments. It costs around 45k per launch, which is the fuel cost.\n\n![lNJZScf.png](http://i.imgur.com/lNJZScf.png)![tk0vurN.png](http://i.imgur.com/tk0vurN.png)\n\n![IYm3pnj.png](http://i.imgur.com/IYm3pnj.png)![c7dPMPJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/c7dPMPJ.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"manek22","CreatedById":99501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T04:02:32Z","Content":"Nice. I\u0027ve been doing some similar work myself. \n\nI also have been working with ssto lifters. I\u0027ve got a refuel station at minmus, so as long as I can get a ship there it keeps going. Most have around 4200d/v at the start. Downside is they need big engines to get off, so the fuel efficiency isn\u0027t that great.\n\nThis one is completing a few contracts for orbital stations at once, with a bunch of kerbals to earn XP (need engineers leveled up for gas mining and gas stops)\n\n![IwgT7PE.png](http://i.imgur.com/IwgT7PE.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeanjvs","CreatedById":147147,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T17:09:47Z","Content":"Thanks! I actually made that little Duna shuttle to earn XP for my engineers and scientists after failing miserably to build a Duna SSTO. For some reason, i can\u0027t make an SSTO with enough d/v to go any further than LKO:(. But i did make a plane that could lift a full orange tank to orbit. \n\nNice ship, BTW."}]}
