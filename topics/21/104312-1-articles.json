Updated with a new wing and less parts!","CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T14:18:04Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T14:18:04Z","Content":"So, new day, new wing, new SSTO. This one is a handsome fellow!\n\n![crKqT1q.png](http://i.imgur.com/crKqT1q.png)\n\nAnd not only handsome, but useful! Plenty of crew space allows you to do crew transfers on the same flight you bring stuff up, and a spacious payload bay, specifically sized for low density payloads (sample payload is half full so it is around 20mT). It was designed actually to supplant the Dao because I was always running out of room before I run out of weight. Plus, it has somewhat of a margin in there, and it handles sweetly. And best of all, it does all things, plus the good looking part, in a modest 170 parts. It is not up to my usual ridiculous standards, I know (I have shuttles that use less parts), but all the intakes to feed those turboRAPIERs take their toll, and if you want to go big, you have to provide enough oommph. This one turned out more awesome than usual. Enjoy the flights! \n\nA look at some statistics and stuff, so you know what you are getting into:\n\n![L3HdXuE.png](http://i.imgur.com/L3HdXuE.png)\n\nAnd now the flight manual! My usual building tricks are used, and I took the time to write up the action groups in the file:\n\nThe flight profile is, again, standard SSTO with the turboRAPIER twist. You know... \u0022as fast as possible to 20kms, keep vertical speed under 100m/ds until 25kms, level there for a speed run, when you go over ~1,500m/s start building vertical speed for the rocket takeover\u0022. The twist being you will have **two** flameouts, first when the RAPIERs switch modes, and then a second one when one of the turbojets actually goes. Or not, because the last time I did it I got a 80 km apoapsis without turning off the jets... the air is routed so the spool down without asymmetric flameouts, so you can milk every last air atom.\n\nAnd speaking about routing, I also did some magic and managed put both tanks so they drain evenly, so keep that in mind when refuelling, put the same amount in both tanks and that way the CoM won\u0027t move at all. The CoM, of course, being smack in the middle of the payload bay. Ditto for filling it up for maximum rocket delta-v, or to put only liquid fuel for atmospheric flights, just fill both tanks to the same level and the ship will be balanced. Simple, right?\n\n*Edit: Update of the update! After a few not-really-prods form people using FAR, and realizing I had more potential wing area, I switched the wing to a more legit single-layer one, which might even give this some hope of surviving the aerodynamic revamp coming next week with some further modifications. The imgur album is a mix of two, I think you can differentiate them by wing (the old one joins the rear body in a different spot) and because I have put the shots of the new one right after the pic showing the (considerable) difference in wing area while retaining the shape. I\u0027ll probably do a new thread if I come up with a 1.0 compatible version, but for a week, I think that\u0027ll work. As such, I offer both versions now. In the nice news category, the resulting version,* ***Daring****, is even more economical in parts, clocking in at an even 150. As not-so-good-news, wing loading is substantially higher, so takeoff speed is about 90m/s and lading on full tanks is a certainly not for the faint of heart.

For high efficiency transfers (say, you want one of these to self-deploy to Laythe), you could always put one of my Drive Pods on the payload bay and dock it to the nose port once in space: it\u0027ll draw fuel perfectly fine, and give you high isp thrust for in-space propulsion. Or use some other transfer stage docked to the rear Sr. port, if going backwards looks weird to you.\n\nRune.

You can also do it by hand in the config files, of course.\n\nAlso, turns out I could cram quite a bit more wing area without losing the form, and it can actually fly on a single layer of wing:\n\n![uZ6BxpO.png](http://i.imgur.com/uZ6BxpO.png)\n\n![YfvgaAe.png](http://i.imgur.com/YfvgaAe.png)\n\n![9dXcUNH.png](http://i.imgur.com/9dXcUNH.png)\n\n![gPuNYfX.png](http://i.imgur.com/gPuNYfX.png)\n\nSo you know, in FAR all you would have to do is put the hidden canards out in the open (ruining the looks of course). Or you know, it may even get enough control authority on the rear surfaces, and you can just move the wing forwards. Since I\u0027ve never used FAR, it\u0027s just educated guesses I\u0027m making, of course. \n\nAlso, true structural rigidity on the landing gear assembly still eludes me. Might do a MkII before uploading on R-SUV, though it actually handles quite worse, and takeoff is... well you have to exploit the elasticity of landing gear ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif).

Probably why it weers off on a runway. And the wing is not grown from one part. So I dont need any struts. \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/LNuKEiD.png](http://i.imgur.com/LNuKEiD.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Wing comparison, left are yours. Right one is mine, with red line being an outline of your bigger one. 165m2 of wing area in FAR seems to be enough to get to orbit with full cargo. If It doesnt dissasemble on the runway.\n\nWow, I\u0027m loving how I got you inspired to do this in a completely different way. And next week we shall see which one is closer to work on the new stock model! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) In the meantime, I think I will post the new one, if only to give people something to play with until it dies the quickest death of any of my SSTOs (Most likely. I still haven\u0027t given up on actually tweaking a couple of things and still having it work!).\n\nSo, after performing the most demanding landing test of all, an immediate abort a RTLS without burning any propellant (other than the one neccessary to keep horizontal speed), I can say it handles *good enough* on stock. And I got the part count to be a nice and round 150!\n\n![KL7ke5h.png](http://i.imgur.com/KL7ke5h.png)\n\nThe landing gear still sags a little, but having the whole wing rooted on the tip is incredibly useful (you can, for example, use the wing as a subassembly, or move it with a couple clicks), so I don\u0027t think I will give that up. Besides, as long as you don\u0027t have the breaks engaged on touchdown (doing that gave me quite the scare until I disengaged them), the bounce actually makes it easier on the tail leg, which is the one that protects the engines from tailstriking and you from having a really bad day. I have set her down (on stock) with about 8m/s of vertical speed safely at full takeoff load!\n\nRune.
