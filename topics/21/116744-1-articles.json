It\u0027s not that! Really! It actually means \u0022Skyfaller\u0022 in some language I don\u0027t quite know. This is a 2 wave, 1 plane fighter. It means, that it is capable of delivering 2 types of attack on its own. The first set of missiles fire straight down for a bombing run. The second set of missiles go to either side (see screenshot) to attack multiple buildings and lets face it, your not going to be shooting much else than the buildings without Mods. Anyway, without further ado, I give you SKYFALLER!\n\n![N7Xxz36.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/N7Xxz36.jpg)\n\nAnd your craft file!\n\n[http://www./download/5a...5/Mahpee.craft](http://www./download/5aw4eqlktlmo4j5/Mahpee.craft)\n\nGive it some \u002Brep for more like it!![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
