First you just make a Heli however you want, there are a few designs out there, the place a propellor at the front. To take off, turn ASAS on then throttle up. Turn only the Heli unit on. Get to a hover then turn the propellor on, and you will go remarkably fast. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroPelican","CreatedById":28509,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T14:56:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any input?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T15:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AeroPelican\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AeroPelican\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any input?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESort of difficult without any available visual measure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pebble_garden","CreatedById":30150,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T15:12:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing a very hands-on, visual person, I\\\u0027d first need to see some images and maybe test-fly it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroPelican","CreatedById":28509,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-01T04:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I have a couple of designs on my home computer, but I\\\u0027ve been crossing continents for about five weeks.
