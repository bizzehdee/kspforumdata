I got the different modules on the lander in the way I wanted them first and then looked at sorting the balance, it was terribly balanced to start with, much heavier on the side and end with the rover so it tipped back and left. So I added extra fuel tanks to one side, if you look closely at the lander on the side opposite to the lander there are some extra fuel tanks, stuck over the main ones (you can see them in the vid at the point where the rover is hinged away, grey kw ones). It took quite a few attempts of; move tank left a bit, test, crap, move right, re-test, until I got something that could lift off vertically without SAS or MJ. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Katamari\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Katamari\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just want to say that your little Utility rover is the coolest thing ever, especially with the mountain climbing attachment!\u003Cp\u003EJust built my own copy of it in 0.21, and Jeb is currently trying to drive it up the side of the Space Plane Hanger.

If you can remove parts from it, I\u0027d suggest basically cut it in half, remove the lower section and save and then try and load that. If that still doesn\u0027t work rip some more bits off and save and reload and keep doing that till it works. Then you will know which section has the problem part and I might be able to help some more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry its not working and that I can\u0027t give more help atm, I\u0027ve just not seen that issue ever before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Razorcane\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Razorcane\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny chance we could get a version without RemoteTech? It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t like the mod, it\u0027s just that it\u0027s never worked properly for me. No matter what I do, all satellites can point directly to KSC, even going through planets. The range also doesn\u0027t seem to matter, I can put a 5Mm antenna on it, send it to Jool, and it still gets signal from KSC. Also I have to hack everything with a RemoteTech satellite into space because during launch the game randomly moves my crafts to different locations.\u003Cp\u003ENot asking for help, just wondering if we could get a version without RemoteTech.

I was a fan of the way Katateochi clipped his VTOL engines into one of the tanks to hide them really well, yours sort of stick out a bit more obviously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my own testing I can suggest the LF-A30 engines from I believe KW Rocketry. Actually it might be from NovaPunch. In any case it has 285 thrust with a 375/380 ISP in air/vacuum, which is insanely good for the pile of power the engine provides. 4 of those, 2 on each end of a VTOL craft can lift almost anything. Lot better than the 120 thrust 290 ISP crappy radial stock engines you\u0027ve got there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI REALLY love the way you used tricouplers. I think I\u0027m gonna have to play with them a bit more in my designs. I know that Katateochi used NovaPunch adapter plates, which are the same thing, except much more compact. The stock couplers look really good though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still having issues with a reusable rover -\u0026gt; lander docking mechanism. At this point it\u0027s just trying to compact it enough to make it fit inside the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ Katateochi - Yeah I do have the KAS winch with the arm and such, my problem was, if I attempt to reuse the lander docking port to connect the rover back up for liftoff, eventually I have to use the docked mode, and then the DR hinges flip out. I had one attempt on the KSC runway where the hinges glitched so badly upon docking that they tore the lander in two and flung the rover 300m into the air to explode on landing. Pity I didn\u0027t take a screenshot though, cause my sides hurt from laughing so hard when it happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, your grand tour videos: Sure I\u0027d love to see it continued, but it\u0027d also be really cool to redo them with current KSP. I wanna see your take on reusable landers / rovers, cause mine are almost always overbuilt. In any case, keep making KSP videos, they\u0027re great entertainment and give me some good ideas. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay own grand tour ship, somewhat inspired by yours, finally in orbit.
