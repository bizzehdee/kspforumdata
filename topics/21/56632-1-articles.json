The SABRE which is what the RAPIER is modeled off of, is almost 6 times as long and when used as a complete unit with the nonfunctional precooler and intake you have a unit that is almost 7.5m long! The RAPIER I can slap a .5m long tank between it and the RAM intake and it total be about 1.5m in length and weigh less than the previously mentioned combo, and it has fuel as opposed to the SABRE which does not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey do have some drawbacks but not many. They don\u0027t generate the power of the turbojet, but who cares when they keep producing power well past mach 5.5. Not only this but they also can operate at 100% throttle well after the air intake flow has dropped to 50% of the required air to keep it running on jet mode. In some applications that can be as much as 6km in altitude or 500m/s d/v. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen B9 gets fixed I will compare the two on one of my test craft (the X series).
