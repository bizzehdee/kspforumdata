It has successfully proved capable of delivering a \u003Cem\u003EStarlab\u003C/em\u003E research station to an orbit of Apoapsis 1460 Km, Periapsis 1314 Km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lk6lz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lk6lz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Sunbird, with all stages bar takeoff SRBs, beginning orbital burn.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RNKKl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RNKKl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe\u003C/em\u003E Starlab \u003Cem\u003Ein orbit, a few minutes following the capsule detachment.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, VA made another highly problematic design flaw, though this time perhaps not wholly their fault. The specifications provided asked that the \u003Cem\u003EStarlab\u003C/em\u003E be manned. As such, the Capsule would remain attached, though with a decoupler fitted so the the capsule might act as a lifeboat. However, it had not been fitted with thrusters or RCS, and during a testing drill it was detatched, and drifted away, leaving the \u003Cem\u003ESunbird\u003C/em\u003E crew stranded on the \u003Cem\u003EStarlab\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Squeal","CreatedById":11814,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-30T00:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting design, however because it is not re-usable; I don\\\u0027t see much advantage over the regular rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-30T00:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Squeal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Squeal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting design, however because it is not re-usable; I don\\\u0027t see much advantage over the regular rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess stages required.
