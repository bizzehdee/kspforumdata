Have you ever driven a rover faster than 25 m/s? Hit a bump and your trip comes to a rapid end. And it just takes so LONG to get anywhere. The Artemis I rover solves this by getting rid of the wheels altogether. Why drive when you can fly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis rover allows you to travel rapidly across low-gravity moon landscapes like Minmus, Bop or Pol without having to deal with a low maximum speed, or hitting bumps and tumbling ass over teakettle, pardon the sailor language. The low gravity worlds are a particularly challenging environent, because a lightweight rover is difficult to drive there. It is powered entirely by RCS, and it has no wheels. Perfect for traveling to a couple of biomes and collecting science. Includes all reusable science modules, and a handy seat for your favorite Kerbal astronaut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/artemis_i/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/artemis_i/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2sT3DED.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222sT3DED.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Artemis I in Action!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/6j21IYD2FRw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/6j21IYD2FRw\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-30T19:22:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2014 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TripleStaff","CreatedById":59812,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T10:10:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust a small tip, add pictures. most people doesn\u0027t bother to click the spaceport link, and the pic there is kinda small. just saying that som pics of it \u0022in action\u0022 would help. anyway, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s an amazing craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPs. rovers are \u0022cars\u0022, aka, they have wheels, otherwise it\u0027s a LGTV (Low Gravity Transport Veichle)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T10:25:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your advice, I appreciate it.
