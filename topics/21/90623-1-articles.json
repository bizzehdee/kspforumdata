At any rate, there were some issues which can be fixed to make flying it more pleasant. To avoid being too wordy, let me throw a pic at you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://ls785w-sn3301.files.1drv.com/y2pnH-UomQUlHziCgCVl385CXFpgtYRBVVgGIprXUyjVRCwP6wMcwYc2k2xfrprymMB00jDw8p3Hgdh-VBSqmKxGCLmvzohrld4zXWEnKFIoWI/Turtle.png?psid=1\u0022 alt=\u0022Turtle.png?psid=1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just going to make a bit of a list here, in no particular order. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing I did was remove all of the fuel from the fuselage, except for the MonoPro. Using just the fuel in the wing tanks, I was able to get into an 80 x 80 orbit with over 2000 dV left over, with no payload in the cargobay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tanks were configured to hold a huge excess of liquid fuel, which would take you hours and hours of atmospheric flying to burn through. If you want to travel far, it\u0027s better to set them for an LFO mix, and refuel in orbit, if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust behind the cockpit, were five separate fuselage tanks, which flexed like a slinky during some parts of the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding wings from many smaller parts is a bit of an art, and I think you\u0027ll find it easier to mount them all to the fuselage. From there, you can mount engines and tanks to the trailing edge of the wings. Different parts of the wings were flexing a great deal during flight, and also made tanking off and landing difficult, due to the wheel wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, insomuch as FAR is concerned, you had more than enough lift, and could easily reduce the overall wing area, to make building easier, and to reduce weight. FAR also greatly increases wing strength \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E weight, by default, so I set the weight/strength values of all wing sections and control surfaces to 30%, which reduced the ships overall weight from 212 tons, to 106. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the control surfaces were set to control roll, pitch, and yaw, simultaneously, which stock KSP doesn\u0027t mind, but causes grief under a more realistic flight model. Ailerons were set to roll, elevators to pitch, and rudder to yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of slinging my slack jaw even further, let me throw one more \u0022inspirational\u0022 pic at ya, to illustrate some of the design mumbo jumbo I was going on about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://ls785w-sn3301.files.1drv.com/y2pnS5rpXQlz-VrItc_nEVo7LPn1rFxRPIQz7rmSAEvBAsXt9Zzk5UuEVirtxBjntE98lQYIjfMmRz-74-Uty6v0gkh86CnI_ZzTmUmdiy3Z-E/Monarch%20Print.png?psid=1\u0022 alt=\u0022Monarch%20Print.png?psid=1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s certainly not perfect, and FAR gives me a bunch of guff about sideslip, but whatever! It\u0027s capable enough, and I\u0027ve only crashed it a few times. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all that said, if you do decide to give FAR a whirl, you\u0027ll find some pleasing and also some jarring differences than what you\u0027re used to. Mashing down the S key, or pulling full back on the stick at high speeds = dead bird. Smooth and steady = carry 20, 50, or many more tons than that into orbit with some awesome spaceplanes. I recently started a career game, and went into full-on spaceplane mode as soon as I could. If you spend a lot of time with winged craft, I think you\u0027ll really enjoy using it. Don\u0027t let all of the graphs and numbers throw you off. It\u0027s daunting at first, but you\u0027ll find that if you pay attention to your CoM/CoL relationships, and more or less build your planes in a sensible manner, you don\u0027t even need to worry about the numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also don\u0027t have to all look like jumbo jets. Big delta wings in the rear with canards up front are also plenty viable and a lot of fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I hope that was helpful. If there\u0027s anything else I can help with, just ask! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Planes that cruise fast under FAR also don\u0027t slow down for anything, so the speed brakes included with B9 are essential to - well - every plane you build! Realchutes is another fantastic mod to help slow down on the runway, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-19T15:36:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2014 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Voculus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Secuas","CreatedById":126000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T15:41:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the explanation.
