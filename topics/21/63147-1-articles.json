As you might guess this craft still has ties to the airplane domonated me. I have seen a few dream chasers on the forums lately. I though \u0022So what the heck?\u0022. I made one and I like it, now I know why there is a few on the forums. Unlike the real \u0022one\u0022 this has a RAPIER first stage, and two LV-T45\u0027s next. The plane part acualy flys pretty darn well if I do say so myself. The pictures usualy say alot so I will just shutup and let you see the acual thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gjnT8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The first stage has liquid fuel left over and the second stage can be in orbit with half its fuel. And yes it is more like a kliper, it was the only way i could easily get the crew. I didn\u0027t realize that until after i posted it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
