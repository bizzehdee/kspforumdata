As a qualifier however, though it was \u003Cem\u003Eassembled\u003C/em\u003E in orbit, it was a \u0027one-launch kit\u0027 since orbital rendezvous are still a bit sketchy. I have to start somewhere, eh? The goal was to make something that is sufficient by itself, can be disassembled, added to or rebuilt and could eventually be used for refueling ops. Here\u0027s what I came up with, (by the way, thanks to everyone who has ever posted screenshots. you encourage me to try harder). I made about a dozen mistakes on this device, but I think I definitely learned something from it. If you want to give it a try, I won\u0027t stop you but I really don\u0027t expect anyone to want to.

Pressing 1 disables the outer thrusters.

It\u0027s nice to have that anti-rotation without it flipping out with my RCS. Anyways, I succeeded in adding fuel to the station as well as two tugs. One of them is a \u0027mobile charger\u0027 for probes that go dead for whatever reason but serves as a tug for micro-sized fixtures as well. Then the two tugs, one with ASAS and double RCS for big drags, and the smaller one for same sized pieces but smaller weights or as an auxiliary control tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n48/Hyomoto/screenshot475_zpsacd17b4d.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot475_zpsacd17b4d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n48/Hyomoto/screenshot476_zps76dfd67e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot476_zps76dfd67e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n48/Hyomoto/screenshot480_zps9621246b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot480_zps9621246b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
