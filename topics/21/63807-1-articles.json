This removes the need for ridiculous gimbals (which is one of the main reasons why NASA\u0027s Space Shuttle met it\u0027s day-one-predicted demise), and so reduces fuel waste, and so reduces cost. The unique thing about this shuttle is it has a mini cargo-bay up front which stores RCS units, which attach to the payload in the main cargo-bay, and guide it to docking to a space-station/other vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the vehicle with bays open on the pad ready for launch.

However, using fuel from the \u0022jumbo orange tank\u0022 payload increases this to something like 3000\u002B m/s of delta-v to spare after getting into 120km orbit. It can ultimately deliver one jumbo orange tank to lunar orbit and return, which I think is pretty cool for a half space-plane half-rocket thingy! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
