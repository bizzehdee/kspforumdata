I actually still have an updated version of it laying around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first ever plane that flew (an SR-71 style thing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first ever replica craft (a Mig-21 with far too much weight on it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first ever plane that i was able to land and take-off safely (a 707\u0027ish quad engined plane).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first truly successful aircraft (this).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom all of those early creations, the X-100 comes to mind the best as it was the first ever craft that felt it could do something more than just fly around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first i didn\u0027t really have success with it, but after quite a lot of tweaking and adding of \u0022hidden\u0022 canards later, i noticed the thing had transformed into quite a powerhouse of a plane. I of-course wanted to test this by installing a couple \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E missiles witch it carried no problems at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow after all the many changes, tweaks and fixes later, it still flies, actually even better than ever before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmazingly enough, this one actually is the original craft, not some rebuild of it, tough it did take some rebuilding regardless as the craft looked like this when i opened it after all that time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223uZ6fgh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3uZ6fgh.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the help of the KerbalHistoricalInstitute mod i was able to open the thing, but unfortunately the part\u0027s that had changed model over the years all used those new models, so a lot of rebuilding was ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make the rebuilding process as authentic as possible, i didn\u0027t use any of the \u0022new\u0022 rotation and offset tools, not even the Q\u002BWASD (didn\u0027t know about that at the time). I also took that screenshot as a sort of part-list to help me get the rebuilt one to be exactly like the original, tough because of all the aerodynamic tweaks and changes, some of the \u0022hidden\u0022 canards where left out to make the thing look a little cleaner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, it may be a little how you doing by modern standards, but i still love the old girl and i feel like i should do it justice properly and do a complete rebuild like i did with the Fouglas FC-8.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are some few more picks showing the plane and it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E missiles in action\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002244UT8Ds.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/44UT8Ds.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMissile away!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022U91venc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/U91venc.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDirect hit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227aV3uQ1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7aV3uQ1.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ran out of fuel and had to do an emergency ditch into the ocean, turns out this plane is even more amazing than i ever imagined.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETechnical specs:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTop speed: 373 m/s (without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E missiles in low altitude)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStall speed: 55 m/s (without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E missiles)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLength: 33.6m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWingspan: 35.5m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeight: 9.1m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParts: 156\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass: 84.7 tons (with over 30 tons of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E missiles)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Superbird is very fast, very smooth, but could propably use some more pitch authority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there it is for you, a small look into the kinds of creations i started out with nearly 5 years ago.
