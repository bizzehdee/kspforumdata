Hope yo take them as the friendly advice they are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-First, holy mother of clipping batman. How many of those 83 parts are clipped fuel lines? And why would you ever need so much RCS propellant? I\u0027m not surprised you got the fuel routing to behave in the end, but you should really look mine to see what I did: only two fuel lines placed individually, and careful attention to the fuel flows (i.e: the numbers of parts between the engine and the fuel tank counts), and I still get one engine to pull fuel from the front tank while the other pulls from the rear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-While you were throwing fuel lines left and right, you could have put a couple of struts in there to stiffen things. It feels like a ripe banana when taking off, and I couldn\u0027t get it to lift most times because the torque form the clipped control surfaces at the rear was causing the tail to bend to a fiery kiss with the runway all the time. I could really have used a \u0022tailstrike avoidance device\u0022, just sayin\u0027...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Why not a bigger cargo bay? Very little stuff you can put in there, and testing it empty won\u0027t give any idea of what its payload capabilities are. In case you are interested, if you copy the \u0022RCS\u002BProbe\u002BDocking port\u0022 end of my test 5mT payload, you can make a double dock that secures it firmly to the bay. You can\u0027t attach it in the SPH, but as soon as you load the other port will dock and keep your payload from moving all over the place. In any case, it is always better to secure payload from the front, so it experiences tensile and not compressive forces, otherwise it will fall through the bay in flight, and make landings dangerous-er.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-And while we are at it, you have waaay too much fuel in there. Especially to lift an empty cargo bay. I know I am a bit tight with the test payload (it is intended to be maximum payload anyway), but yours is downright luxurious in that regard.

Hope yo take them as the friendly advice they are:\u003Cp\u003E-First, holy mother of clipping batman. How many of those 83 parts are clipped fuel lines? And why would you ever need so much RCS propellant? I\u0027m not surprised you got the fuel routing to behave in the end, but you should really look mine to see what I did: only two fuel lines placed individually, and careful attention to the fuel flows (i.e: the numbers of parts between the engine and the fuel tank counts), and I still get one engine to pull fuel from the front tank while the other pulls from the rear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-While you were throwing fuel lines left and right, you could have put a couple of struts in there to stiffen things. It feels like a ripe banana when taking off, and I couldn\u0027t get it to lift most times because the torque form the clipped control surfaces at the rear was causing the tail to bend to a fiery kiss with the runway all the time. I could really have used a \u0022tailstrike avoidance device\u0022, just sayin\u0027...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Why not a bigger cargo bay? Very little stuff you can put in there, and testing it empty won\u0027t give any idea of what its payload capabilities are. In case you are interested, if you copy the \u0022RCS\u002BProbe\u002BDocking port\u0022 end of my test 5mT payload, you can make a double dock that secures it firmly to the bay. You can\u0027t attach it in the SPH, but as soon as you load the other port will dock and keep your payload from moving all over the place.

Takeoff procedure is to put full power and press \u0022S\u0022: it will rotate on its own when its ready, and take off as soon as you go over 100m/s, and well before the end of the runway. SAS totally optional until you try to get a stable climb, and I know that because I just tried again. I also pull both fuel and oxidizer from the body, the trick is to count parts so the tank you want to draw first from is the one furthest away in the line, and not to clip anything in the nodes. This is why I do with four tanks what you take eight to accomplish (arguably more since mine actually takes a bigger payload up). Plus, don\u0027t ever trust wings to handle fuel transfer unless you absolutely have to, and keep the route as short as possible: that\u0027s an advice every kerbal should take to heart IMHO. Which is why in the posted version I have to have the lines coming from so far forwards, so the paths had an equal number of nodes between the engine and the tank. I\u0027ve been actually finagling a bit with it. Well, with that and with kronal vessel viewer, and I figured out a different arrangement that leaves the fuel lines under the wings... it was bugging me too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JNlJQ90.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JNlJQ90.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RfbvED6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RfbvED6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZL3XXJB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZL3XXJB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing gear, I was looking for clearance mostly, hence why it\u0027s as low as it\u0027ll go, plus I didn\u0027t want to clip anymore than necessary. I will probably sink a bit further the front one (can be done without any additional parts or very special techniques, just good use of ED tools, so not sure what you talk about). Solar panels are both a weight and funds decision, and will work just fine without batteries or anything. Plus, I don\u0027t have to clip them, though they are slightly to be more flush with the tank. Did you notice that? RCS placement, tough, is not bad in yours. Might even work better than mine considering the yaw momentum the configuration gives when empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also put a OMS engine in there for fidelity, \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E I took away from your build. In total, the C2 has an even 60 parts (7 more than the original \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E), 19.5mT on the runway, of which 5.2mT is payload, it will set you back 38.6k funds, and it has grand total of two struts, two fuel lines, four clipped parts, four intakes and 7 control surfaces. I did give up and put a couple other intakes and angled down the others, and set them up so they draw fuel at the same rate. Though I suspect the rules of airhogging have changed somewhat, I have to test that out some more. It is accurate down to not only shape (the reason that tailcone is where it is), but also range (just barely orbital, with orbital maneuvering best done on RCS) and takeoff speed, and it is extremely stable and able to maneuver in all regimes, holding \u0026gt;45 AoA under ASAS at high altitudes with no problem.
