The ascent profile is as follows\n\n45 degree ascent to 10km\n\n-Configure orbital computer\n\n10 degree acceleration to 500m/s (will be at 12km after pitch over complete)\n\n15 degree acceleration to TEC (Turbine Engine Cutoff)\n\n-20km LES (Liquid Engine Startup)\n\n-25km TEC\n\n-Ascending without horizon (allow the horizon to fall beneath you)\n\n35km 10 degree ascent Ascending with horizon (compensate for curvature of Kerbin)\n\n-Thrust to 85km apoapse\n\n-Coast along curve\n\n55km apply correction burn to 85km Apoapse\n\nCircularize and enjoy the show!\n\n![screenshot8_zpsydzj6nsx.png](http://i1370.photobucket.com/albums/ag251/alexandercampbell1/screenshot8_zpsydzj6nsx.png)\n\n![screenshot39_zpsqrzq7uvv.png](http://i1370.photobucket.com/albums/ag251/alexandercampbell1/screenshot39_zpsqrzq7uvv.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yellowburn10","CreatedById":107558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:50:05Z","Content":"Heh, and they say that Turbojet SSTOs are dead.

After running the numbers from the last pick through Tsiolkovsky I got 150 m/s. Not a huge amount but I could play with some orbital maneuvers. Not to mention the overabundance of liquid fuel for atmospheric fun. Or more likely flat-spin recovery."}]}
