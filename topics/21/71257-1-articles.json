And am a bit of a bragger. And maybe go off on unneeded tangents too often. At least I have a good atten... ooh look, a squirrel! (Might\u0027ve taken that one too far)) It is entirely built of stock parts, the only mod being used is Kerbpaint to recolor the cockpit and \u0022guns,\u0022 and maybe in the future the engine section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImgur album:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/sB1eL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

It is made of Ibeams, so it can handle collisions while speeding up, but I make no promises to its survival at higher speeds which may be obtained while taking off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it is best to pull up slightly at over 60 m/s. The nose may raise, but it may take a few moments for the rear landing gear to leave the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterwards, raise the gear and fly it like any other aircraft in KSP, though I have found it pitches up slightly while one is rolling the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ELanding Procedure:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane is heavy, so landing should be done carefully. The engine should be slightly powered up until the aircraft is just over the runway, where it can be shut off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mig does land hard, but should be able to take it without suffering part loss. Land it at a roughly horizontal angle, or with the nose slightly pushed up to avoid tailstrikes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/13bkazrrty8fshc/Mig%2019%20_Farmer_.crafthttp://\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EDownload Here\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you all like it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laughing Man","CreatedById":67907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T22:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is one fine looking plane.
