I\u0027m sure it\u0027s enough you could get a Jool encounter from LKO with a full tank. It\u0027s just over 13T fully fueled, 10T empty and has around 850 units of liquid fuel if that helps.\n\nEdit: according to [http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html](http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html) it\u0027s got just over 2000 d/v if fueled up in orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T19:05:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by trevize1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T19:11:03Z","Content":"That\u0027s very decent indeed.

To have a highly complex laythe base.\n\n Post pics when you fly the mission.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T20:19:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 08:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Majorjim**"}]}
