You have to tweak the jet engines a lot on the way to orbit, this is not beginner friendly. Turning rate is surprisingly good, but one moment of carelessness and it will spin out of control. Reentry with empty tanks is a problem too, but possible. Just be **realy** carefull. Fortunately the landing characteristics aren\u0027t that bad, but it tends to tip over the nose on braking when there is no cargo but lots of fuel in it. As you can see in the video, you have to \u0022sail\u0022 cross like the real sailing ships, if you want some power.\n\nIn the video, you can see the start of a journey to Laythe with 10t of cargo. I do not know yet, if it is laythe capable. There is more than enough delta v in it, but its ion powered and that means i can\u0027t go the most efficient way. However, i will record the trip and post it, when i am back on Kerbin.\n\nSome additional Heavy Metal:\n\n![xdoi8jY.png](http://i.imgur.com/xdoi8jY.png)\n\nThis working dump truck is currently in the stomach of The Flying Dutchmann and will hopefully be delivered to Laythe.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T19:46:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Adester**"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexanderTeaH","CreatedById":111209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T19:48:50Z","Content":"Wait, wait, this thing ***WORKS?!*** Damn.

I used a lot of the TR-2V Stack Decoupler. They have not much stability and allow parts to move around without breaking. I stacked them by connecting the upper points. The next one allowed me to use the lower connection points, then the upper again, and so on (my english is probably not good enough to explain this pictorially). The force to turn the load area comes from 4 O-10 MonoPropellant Engines. The 2 Mk1 Lander Cans provide the counter weight. There are 2 Stratus-V Cylindrified Monopropellant Tanks which will eventually deplete. But to be honest... there is no practically use for it and if there is one, the monopropellant will suffice for 30 - 50 dumps."},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T22:18:39Z","Content":"This is wonderful!
