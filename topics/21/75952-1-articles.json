The Ranger-1UKE is armored with 2 layers of structural panels. Tests have confirmed that 2 layers of armor is impenetrable in space, even if hit by an asteroid(used a mod to spawn the asteroid because of version before asteroid update) at 4000 m/s. The best shot at taking out this ship is as it is being launched from the KSP center on Kerban, or landing in a medium-high gravity planet. The 2 layers of armor have a small distance inbetween them, filled with struts, 650 Ibeams, and Modular Girder Segments to suppress the explosions from enemy weaponry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EArmor Design(Detailed)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThe inner shell of the frigate has a 3 Modular Girder Segment space between the initial core and the inner shell of armor. This space has very little suppressive power on it at the moment. I intend to make the space filled with some sort of strong structures once the inside design is finished. Between the inner and outer armor shells, each 2x2 panel is separated by a Modular Girder Segment, then framed with 650 Ibeams. Inside the frame, many struts are placed inside to make sure it doesn\u0027t wobble. It basically looks like 4-6 spiderwebs all intertwined. The outer shell only has a couple openings. The openings are very small, and very hard to get something inside of, but easy to get things out of. The openings will be armed with weapons ranging from small turret missiles to ICBMs depending on the location of the opening and the size. If the command tower is taken out, there are many inner command stations inside in where kerbals will take over. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EWhy it was created\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EIf you don\u0027t like RP stories, skip it.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThe ranger-1UKE is created to initially defend the Mun colony after aliens space planes were dropped from a massive flagship. Losses were devastating, but the alien planes weren\u0027t accustomed to the Our satellite station orbiting the Mun was armed with 4 large ICBMs. Each ICBM hit the carrier at 400-500 m/s at the supposed bridge. The Carrier seemed disabled, and we sent a pod from the satellite to go and explore the Carrier. As we went inside, Kerbals in Green suits (opposed of our red suits) came out and took over the pod, captured it and captured the men. One of our men eventually escaped the carrier just before it was about to fly off back to a planet. The kerbal used the remaining monopropellant he had to land back at the wrecked mun base, and revealed to us that the kerbals were descendants of kerbals 100s of years back who crash landed into laythe and were presumed dead on impact. One man and one woman survived, and they populated the planet to oppose the UKE. Their nation isnt yet known, their language is similar however their radio chatter is so discrete, our technology can\u0027t read it.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou can become apart of this conflict!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you support this and would like to create your own nations and ships, and command your nation, Please let me know and I will get to it!
