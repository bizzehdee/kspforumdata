You may wish to re-assign them to your preferences. Then to fly...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Open the Resources tab. You will need to monitor the IntakeAir.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Disable the gimbals on the LT-Ns. You will not need them, and gimbals only work against you when in front of the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Activate all jets and throttle up, accelerate. Pull up and ascend vertically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Start leveling off past 10Km. Start watching the IntakeAir\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Written down, I have \u003Cstrong\u003E0.14\u003C/strong\u003E units on the resources tab for flameout threshold on 5 engines, so stay under that and pick up speed until you don\u0027t seem to gaining much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Active ALL rocket engines, then shut down 2 jet engines, pitch up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Again, written down, I have \u003Cstrong\u003E0.11\u003C/strong\u003E units on the resources tab for flameout threshold on 3 engines. Once you hit that, shut down the other 2 outer engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Once the center engine flames out... shut that down too, and close all air intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Keep climbing on all rockets, then when you are in the higher atmo, and don\u0027t think you need all the thrust, shut down the aerospikes, and keep using the more efficient LT-Ns to finish. The rest you should know \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may wish to check the flameout thresholds again in test flights. Also note that I have not used this craft in .20, so it performance may have changed a little since .19.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are planning a trip to Duna and back, this craft can do it. However, you have to do it carefully. There margin for error, but it is not big. I suggest getting familiar using it, then launch several to LKO to practice maximising delta-V. Measure this by oxidizer volume. Vent any excess fuel before departing for Duna, and use up the RCS to help with maneuvers too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
