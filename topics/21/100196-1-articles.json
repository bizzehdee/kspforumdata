It\u0027s a VTOL aircraft that can go just about anywhere! The engines it\u0027s using from the Interstellar mod allows it to fly efficiently in atmospheres, reach orbit, and cruise efficiently around in space using the non-oxidizer fuel mode.\n\nOne important feature is the atmospheric scoop on its belly. The craft is loaded with very little oxidizer, and if you intend leaving the atmosphere of Kerbin, you should be scooping oxygen and using the LFO-mode for extra thrust. Carrying little oxidizer enables it to carry tons of liquid fuel!\n\nJust to clarify, it won\u0027t take off vertically fully loaded from Kerbin. But you could dump some fuel if you just want to try it out.\n\nTo easily switch fuel modes while in flight, I\u0027ve bound it to action group 3.\n\n**Required mods**\n\n[Adjustable Landing Gear](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99660-0-25-Adjustable-Landing-Gear-v1-0-4%28doors-fixed%29-Nov-14)\n\n[Infernal Robotics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-25-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Infernal-Robotics-0-19-2), you would need the robotics pack from the [part rework](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65365-WIP-MSI-s-Infernal-Robotics-Model-Rework-%28Structural-Pre-Release%29) (I never bothered with tweakscale).\n\n[KSP Interstellar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-25-KSP-Interstellar-%28Magnetic-Nozzles-ISRU-Revamp%29-Version-0-13)\n\n[Throttle Controlled Avionics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107802-Throttle-Controlled-Avionics-2-1-0-0-90-Continued) - If you intend maintaining control\n\n[Ferram Aerospace Research](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-25-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-14-4-11-24-14) - Never tried flying it without FAR.\n\n**Download**\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/0xivap9d6qubb1o/Omnibird.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0xivap9d6qubb1o/Omnibird.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-20T12:18:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2015 12:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kniben**"}]}
