Named for the famed Finnish sniper, this craft was designed as an omni-purpose single stage craft, both able to be flown on Kerbin and out into the Kerbolar system. I\u0027ve managed to successfully get this thing to the M\u00FCn and back (Not without refuelling itself on the M\u00FCn, mind you) and with the ISRU converter onboard, it can get into M\u00FCnar orbit with around 4500 dV left after landing and refuelling, which should be enough to get pretty much anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere may be more efficient flyers out there, there may be more efficient resource gatherers with a better payload capacity, but my goal was to have what amounted to a relatively small jet aircraft that could be used to shuttle Kerbals pretty much anywhere I wanted to put them. This being the purpose behind the design, it lacks any real science gathering gear, but any of the Science gathering craft parts could be added to the cargo bay. In the atmosphere, it can feel a bit sluggish when it\u0027s full of fuel, but the hidden Nuclear engines can both give a boost of pep and burn off excess fuel if you\u0027re not going into orbit. (Or you can remove fuel in the SPH, I guess, if you think simply not carrying fuel is better than using rockets.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: There is a PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator located right where the drill attaches to the ISRU Converter, so if you don\u0027t have it unlocked in your save, you may want to remove it so you can use the craft sooner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can find the craft file \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Caligari/Slightly-Dangerous---Hayha\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EUpdate:\u003C/span\u003E Since posting this, I\u0027ve managed to get the Hayha to hop from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/LtjfA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMinmus\u003C/a\u003E to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/XEPwn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIke\u003C/a\u003E then to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Ehi8U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDuna\u003C/a\u003E and\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/fVQt3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E land back on Kerbin in one piece\u003C/a\u003E!

This rover was designed once I noticed that the Modular Girder Segment had an absurd crash tolerance compared to other parts. Much like the Hayha, my goal was to put as much as I could in a small package, so it contains practically all the scientific gathering parts, the exception being the SC-9001 Science Jr. It even includes a drill and hidden radiators, along with a small docking port, meant to be used to gather ore to be converted by a base with ISRU (Or, La Caravane below). The majority of the surfaces of the rover are covered in solar panels protected by a roll-cage built out of the Girder Segments, giving this thing amazing electrical gathering potential. Two separate probe cores present on the rover allow it to control the rocket launching it while also being able to view the angles of driving as though it was an aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile mainly designed as an unmanned rover, it does have a single seat hidden inside it. Additionally, it boasts two protected landing gear on the roof, allowing it to self right in case of rollover, even if the landing gear would be destroyed at the speed in normal conditions. Despite the protective girder segments, solar panel and wheel destruction are still a very real danger in high speed rollovers, so don\u0027t be too reckless in your driving or else you may end up just rolling the thing end over end to get around!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet your very own right \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Caligari/Slightly-Dangerous---Grey-Ghost\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EUpdate\u003C/span\u003E: With the 1.1 update wrecking how the wheels clip into the body, the rover no longer works as-is in 1.1.x, so you\u0027ll either have to drag the wheels out of the body or use a different rover \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E (Sure, it got broken right after it gets a shout-out from \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/101668-castille7/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022101668\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/101668-castille7/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@castille7\u003C/a\u003E in a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/137036-04152016-spacecraft-fridays-live-on/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ESpacecraft Friday\u003C/a\u003E post...Thanks for the shout out, by the way!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003ELa Caravane Rover\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/rQBrc/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNamed for the fact that it looks like a caravan, a song by the band Caravan Palace, and since it was designed to be attached to the back of the Grey Ghost, La Caravane acts as a supplemental craft, providing additional battery life, drills, a full sized Convert-o-tron and personnel storage (Including a mobile processing lab), allowing the craft to perform as a mobile base of operations. Of note are the two grabbing units attached to the craft, which are located at different heights. This was done to allow the large supply of ore it carries and the full sized ISRU unit to be used to refuel craft that either lack a method of refuelling or to speed up the refuelling process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the original iteration of La Caravane was made up of girders like the Grey Ghost, it left much to be desired in the looks department and made the part count skyrocket, due to the size of it and the subsequent number of girders.

While it\u0027s admittedly slow and heavy, I think it came out absolutely GORGEOUS! And the rocket boosters bring it close to 40m/s on Kerbin, so it\u0027s only really slow in turns.

I keep coming up with ideas, but I don\u0027t want to have my framerate drop to around 2fps when I stare at its majesty. So, while trying to come up with a station, I designed this nifty little MMU to attach to it! Honestly, it was just a test to see if it could be done in a way I found aesthetically pleasing, but after seeing it give Jeb a halo like he\u0027s in some Eastern Orthodox iconography, I just HAD to make it work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s got a good deal of dV, decent battery life, a mini docking port on top and a Dawn engine on the bottom!

They come two in a pack and are ready to be attached to a 2.5m rocket of your choice to take them up out of the atmosphere!

I wanted to see if I could get an alien/sci-fi looking design not only in the air, but into orbit and back a la K-Prize. I had to stick science gathering stuff in the clamp-o-tron\u0027s compartment just so that I didn\u0027t feel like it did nothing. This being said, it\u0027s relatively easy to fly; you can follow the ascent path that the Hayha has laid out on the download page, just switching out the 400m/s mark for 425m/s and you\u0027ve gotta make sure it doesn\u0027t flip when you tilt up to escape the atmosphere. Yeah, I managed to get such a weird looking design to work pretty decently well, I\u0027m kind of impressed! Mind you, the thing doesn\u0027t like being pitched upwards too quickly at low speeds and doesn\u0027t play nice with physics warp, so just keep that in mind if you\u0027re flying around in it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the most unique thing about this craft is after a few re-entries with it, I figured out that while it really wants to go in aft-first, I could use it to my advantage.

Mind you, I wouldn\u0027t need downforce, so I switched out the rear spoiler and front fin for some I-Beam bumpers to protect the wheels from front end collisions and flips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only real problem is has is a slightly lower top speed than the Grey ghost; only at about 29.5m/s as opposed to 33.1m/s, but the degree of control this rover affords makes up for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to changes in the landing gear, the flipping mechanism does explode from time to time in both this rover and the Grey Ghost because it somehow ends up \u0022overstressed\u0022.

Something that could incorporate two full size Mk III bays in it. Something that could act as its own interplanetary ecosystem, launching MMUs and drones to fill itself with the nearly 500 tons of oxidizer and liquid fuel it can hold. Something loaded with so many reaction wheels and RCS thrusters that it\u0027d feel nimble in space, despite weighing in at 350 tons after getting into orbit.

I\u0027d recommend against doing any real landing with it, though. Those fins/wings are mostly for show/fuel storage and I\u0027m sure it\u0027d drop like a rock if you tried gliding with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReady to fly an interplanetary spacecraft that\u0027s nearly 50 metres long?

While I\u0027m usually hesitant to include a\u00A0 I\u0027ve developed smaller ones and cheaper ones, but the main benefit of this one is that it looks a lot cleaner than the other ones, has static solar panels hidden inside the chassis so it won\u0027t run out of power if the larger panels are retracted, and can be refuelled more easily due to how the hidden fuel tanks are stacked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it harvest time in space?

I also wanted a rover that could incorporate a cupola, science lab and full sized ISRU converter and a claw. I even threw in some RCS and aerospike rockets so that you can biome-hop with it and land the rover itself.
