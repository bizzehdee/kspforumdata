Shes stable, vanilla (though Mechjeb is useful) and will get you where you want to go. Designed with as a heavy lifter and interplanetary travel in mind. Still experimenting with it, possibly removing tail fins and adding an extra 3 boosters (4 tanks 1 LFE each). The landing gear on the bottom is just to prevent the annoying engine damages on the pad due to time warp, they are set to jettison the next stage right after liftoff.
