The name is somewhat serendipitous, a previous version of the plane had an advanced canard placed right on the nose. While I was trimming fat from the design I ended up removing it. It was inspired by the F-15 and SasquatchM\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/17526-Shovel-Nose-II\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShovel Nose II\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen SAS is turned on the Rhino flies almost dead straight, with a tiny tendency to drift upwards. The the SAS force drops to almost zero when flying straight. This makes the control over its height very precise (my hobby, flying 1-5 metres above the ground/water). It can launch from the runway at just under 50 metres per second, and much lower speed when launching from height. It has two small parachutes for emergencies and landing. The combination of it being a steady flier and the parachutes means that it can land very precisely (my other hobby, landing on top of the Vehicle Assembly Building). It reaches up to 10 g forces when pulling up, it flies fine upside down, and can easily do loop-de-loops without stalling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/XKG0A\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImgur Gallery\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?z8yddtct8tgfn18\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECRAFT File\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T03:33:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, nice plane, just not very fast, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been maneuverable trainer plane, and you can probably guess what happened to that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, nice piloting skills.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
