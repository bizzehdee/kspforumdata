Exceptionally maneuverable, especially at low throttle. \n\nSupports hovering and high-speed low-altitude cruising (Top speed \u003C1 km: 257 m/s). Rotors tilt to give additional forward speed.\n\nLanded: \n\n\u003E ![oQi7Y.png](http://i.imgur.com/oQi7Y.png)\n\nIn horizonal flight mode.

However, if you run out of fuel mid-flight, it can still glide down for a horizontal landing.\n\nTo counteract that, we added **more fuel**. \n\n![Tuoyq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Tuoyq.jpg)\n\nThe Manta Heavy has a top speed of ~210 m/s. It\\\u0027s slower and less maneuverable than its lite counterpart, but can go the distance.\n\nHovering\n\n\u003E ![vgaSw.png](http://i.imgur.com/vgaSw.png)\n\nBack to hover mode\n\n\u003E ![HyAun.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HyAun.jpg)\n\nRequires Damned Aerospace and Damned Robotics"},{"CreatedByName":"sproginator","CreatedById":11290,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T22:46:00Z","Content":"Most amazing VTOL i have seen so far, managed to arm it as well ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshmo","CreatedById":10280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T06:05:21Z","Content":"Really nice work."}]}
