Under extreme duress, this shuttle was not only successful in rescuing the stranded expedition, but also able to complete the original mission and return home with both crews. Doing this earned the vessel the Kerbalian expression of being the Steely-Eyed Banana Express. Tested and passed by the Kerbal Institute of Science and Snacks.

In fact, these are small to medium size for me. I tried making larger vessels, but the game has some complications with too many moving parts, and it seems that really unusual things happen. I had one vessel started moving in very peculiar ways, and looks like a bird flapping wings, then exploded.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy small ship is the Tumble-Bee Orbit Express. I have a version of it that can launch to any planet from Kerbal, and become an orbital for any planet and moon in the known Kerbal space. However, I end up either having to strand a pilot, or find a better way to increase my range of communication for pilotless travel. This is problematic, but also explains why I sometimes will have over twenty missions going on and forget which one was supposed to do what.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as well, as Adam Savage said from Mythbusters, \u0022If it is worth doing, it is worth over doing.\u0022 I am a firm believer in that philosophy.
