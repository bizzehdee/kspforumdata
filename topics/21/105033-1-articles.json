And that is necessary, because the lander alone weighs almost 400 tons. The entire ship is around 1100 tons or something like that.\n\nLander is in the back, on the front we have a cargo bay with a rover inside.\n\nMission profile: Get to Eve, drop the lander close to the coast of a big landmass, drop the rover on that landmass. Release the Ion bike, ride it to the shore, explore Eve with the rover, gather all the science you can gather, get back to the bike, ride it to the lander, get back up to space, rendezvous with the mothership, get back to Kerbin, land the lander capsule (preferably on water), profit!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/QcvolTKPdRQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
