RCS is centered around average center of mass, docks okey tough\n\n**Cargo**\n\nlong \u002B short cargo bay with docking ports on each end.\n\nComes loaded with RCS powered space tug that is great for recovering, and deorbiting debris.\n\nI decided to include docking for this variant as well, RCS is centered on when cargo bay is empty.\n\nAs long as load has its own RCS system, and its enabled, docking should be fine with cargo on board.\n\nNot as good performance as the other variants due to added weight.\n\n* * *\n\nOn a good ascent you should have at least 700 m/s dv with these on a 80k orbit. On a great run might have around 800 m/s dv left.\n\nRCS runs from vernor engines, so you will be burning little bit of rocket fuel when docking.\n\n**Action groups**\n\n1 - toggle R.A.P.I.E.R mode, and toggle intakes\n\n2 - toggle flaps, really useful for re-entry, no need for air brakes\n\n3 - toggle docking bay, and docking lights (inside the bay doors)\n\n4 - toggle Cargo bay doors and lights\n\n0 - toggle engines\n\nG - also toggles landing lights.\n\n**Downloads** - [http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/231151-mk-2-arrow-ssto-series-stock-spaceplane/files](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/231151-mk-2-arrow-ssto-series-stock-spaceplane/files)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T22:12:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Whippler**"},{"CreatedByName":"nfpinto","CreatedById":143049,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T17:55:39Z","Content":"looks nice. gonna try it\n\nthanks"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T03:01:46Z","Content":"Very effective ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Mind if I feature this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Whippler","CreatedById":143730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T06:40:03Z","Content":"BTW, if you guys can find a nice flight profile for the planes to have even more dv left, let me know =)"},{"CreatedByName":"Whippler","CreatedById":143730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T22:09:27Z","Content":"[TABLE=width: 1000, align: center]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]**Cargo variant added, crew carrier updated!**\n\nBig-S tail wing used for the cargo variant, mostly to get a light up there to illuminate the cargo bay\n\nComes with a space tug!\n\nAnd yeah, Solar eclipse happened while testing it =)\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]![cargoplane.png](http://media-elerium.cursecdn.com/attachments/22/927/cargoplane.png)\n\n![solar-eclipse.png](http://media-elerium.cursecdn.com/attachments/22/925/solar-eclipse.png)\n\n![cargo-bay-lighting.png](http://media-elerium.cursecdn.com/attachments/22/922/cargo-bay-lighting.png)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T22:11:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 10:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Whippler**"}]}
