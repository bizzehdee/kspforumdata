It takes under 2 minutes to build. Stick a small satellite (with RCS in a place it can propel the satellite forward the thruster blocks are best) on top, a hexagonal probe core with the wee little solar panels wrapped around it, some comunitrons too. The sat should way more or les 0.3 tons.(with RCS fuel) Put a decoupler on the bottom with a S1 SRB-KD5k underneath. Don\u0027t bother with SAS or fins, you don\u0027t need them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Fly: Launch straight up. When the SRB runs out of feul, drop it. Now rotate to face the direction you want your orbit to go around Kerbin, and perform the Orbital insersion. All up, with a 7-8k satellite, the whole thing should cost $10k.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T00:26:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it is simple, some pictures might be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
