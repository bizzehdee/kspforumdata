I don\u0027t think I am pro, like I mentioned in the original post, this was my first SSTO and I have only had the game for a short while... On the runway, it gets to 120m/s before getting lift (as opposed to the 50m/s it had before the alterations began for space flight... It is light, all things considered, but I designed it to have slight natural downforce so that it is easier to control at high speeds. On re-entry this natural downforce means that pulling the nose up is a bit of a task, so throttling up to 2/3 is needed to pull the nose above the horizon, which makes it feel heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
