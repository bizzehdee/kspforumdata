With some throttle discipline in the beginning, it\u0027ll easily get you to the Mun with fuel to spare, and back even easier. It\u0027s a bit of a hog to steer before you jettison the Munar insertion stage, though, since I left RCS off for weight reasons. It also experiences some \u0027ghost torque\u0027, but so does every other rocket in 0.16 as far as I can tell, no matter how symmetrical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstructions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Turn on ASAS, launch straight up. Stay below 150m/s until you hit 10,000m, where you begin your gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The first stage is four fuel tanks. Jettison them when they run out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The second stage will run out before you reach orbit, jettison it and let it fall to Kerbin - no trash!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Try to accelerate at just above 1G until you reach 25,000m or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When your apoapsis hits 80,000m or so, coast up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. When 30-40 seconds from apoapsis, circularize the orbit using the third stage. Since there is no RCS, you can help steer by tapping shift very quickly, so the engine barely burns. The gimballing engine will help you turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Use the third stage for Munar insertion, which should leave about half a tank of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Use the third stage to slow down and enter Munar orbit. If you don\u0027t want to litter, burn until your path intersects the Munar surface, then stage and use the landers engines to raise your orbit, letting the third stage hit the Mun and destroy itself. Once you lose the third stage, steering is no longer a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Extend the legs, land, have some fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Use all five lander engines to take off. You can dump the four external engines and let them fall to the Mun, or keep them and try to make them fall to Kerbin. Or just leave them in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. You should have plenty of fuel in the final stage to make it back to Kerbin and reenter. Then drop it, and let the capsule coast down under the parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axe08","CreatedById":40416,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-14T15:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, just registered, relativity new to ksp and this is my first attempt at a moon landing.

This means I might be able to put a bigger engine on the lander... those burns to get back from the Mun do take a little time with that tiny, tiny engine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-15T09:05:04Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2012 09:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Rickenbacker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
