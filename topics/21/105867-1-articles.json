Today here, I have a new idea, so you know how the fairings came out in 1.0? Well, I was thinking we could use fairings in an artistic form! And that is what I have for you Bruhs and Bras today!\n\nFirst off, these are not whole craft files, these are subassemblies. Although, you can put these in your ship folder, and load then, then add liquid engines to them, but where\u0027s the fun in that!?\n\nSecond off, most of the subassemblies I will make, will be posted here on the front page. Also, I need your help! Go ahead and message below what Engine, Cockpit, SAS module, you desire, I am NOT make whole entire crafts, only subassemblies.\n\nAnd without further ado, the subassemblies!:\n\n(I know the below looks like a giant mess, help me, PM me on how to make a spoiler so this doesn\u0027t look like a giant mess)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Mk3 \u0027Aether\u0027 Jet Cockpit\n\u003E Mass: 13.9\n\u003E \n\u003E Crew Capacity: 8\n\u003E \n\u003E Parts: 16\n\u003E \n\u003E Special: 6 Generators\n\u003E \n\u003E Manufacturer:\n\u003E \n\u003E Lazarus Aerospace Engineers\n\u003E \n\u003E --------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003E \n\u003E High performance MK3 Jet cockpit, has 3 nodes for attaching on, and easy mobility.
