It flies surprisingly well for it\u0027s size and when in hover mode, it\u0027s even more surprising how easy it is to maneuver. No, it does not like to hover completely stationary, but small adjustments to the flight controls do get it to settle where you want it to go.\n\nIt has plenty of fuel to make a trip too the island airfield, slow down and make a vertical landing, then take off again and fly back too the space center. All with it\u0027s full payload of a single quad core \u0022nuke\u0022 bomb. Once the bomb is dropped, it becomes a lot quicker and requires much less thrust to hover and fly.\n\nThings too note about this bomber\n\n1: The hover engines are just enough to lift it off the runway with the bomb in its bomb bay and its current fuel load.\n\n2: It has more thrust in the 4 turbo ramjet engines then it really needs, going full throttle for too long, when not hovering, is not recommended.\n\n3: The lift and thrust engines are toggled using action groups.\n\n3a: Action group [1] turns on just the lift engines and makes sure the thrust engines are off.\n\n3b: Action group [2] turns on both the lift and thrust engines for making short take offs or for transitioning from hover too horizontal flight.\n\n3c: Action group [3] turns off the lift engines and turns on the thrust engines for conventional horizontal flight.\n\n4: Action group [0] opens the bomb bay doors\n\n5: Action group [9] releases the bomb from the bomb bay\n\n6: It is nearly easier to land vertically then it is to land conventionally. Odd how that works.\n\n7: This craft has a fairly low structural speed limit of around 300m/s, pushing this limit is only for the bravest of pilots. Or those looking for a nice explosion. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n![tacticalbomber1_zps9prktbiv.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/tacticalbomber1_zps9prktbiv.jpg)\n\n\\*Note: Picture is not up to date.
