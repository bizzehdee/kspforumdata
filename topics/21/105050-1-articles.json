The predecessor to the T-14 Armata.\n\nInstead, it turned into a weird IFV/light tank combat vehicle. I\u0027ll make a true armata replica later, as I now have the hull and bearing.\n\nThanks to panzer1b\u0027s suggestion, I studied his bearing and made my own. It\u0027s much more durable than my old bearings, and the new side armor is chobam armor.\n\nIt proves effective at defeating standard tank rounds.\n\nI\u0027m lowering the part count for the T-14 Armata.\n\nHere\u0027s a download to it.
