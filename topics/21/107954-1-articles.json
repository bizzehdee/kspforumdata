I\u0027m UpsilonAerospace.\n\nRecently, I discovered a very nice feature in KSP 1.0 that allows various craft to \u0027hover\u0027 above the ground. I\u0027m dreaming up a lot of ways to abuse this effect. Come and join me!\n\nThe Grand \u0027Making Things Hover\u0027 Thread!\n\n~~~\n\nIn KSP 0.90, various types of rover wheel did strange stuff when they had parts placed between them and the ground. This peculiar setup resulted in an eerie effect where the rover appeared to hover a few inches in the air. I always wanted to exploit this effect, but I feared it wouldn\u0027t work when 1.0 dropped.\n\nIn 1.0, wheel mechanics were changed, but they didn\u0027t fix the hover effect! As a matter of fact, 1.0 made craft even *better*. **The small steerable landing gear, in particular, can make any sufficiently light craft \u0022hover\u0022 if another part is clipped into it.** This hover effect occurs even when it looks as if the wheels should be touching the ground, adding another layer of spookiness to the mix.\n\nCraft utilizing this cute little bug feature appear to have an almost magnetic repulsion to the ground. They merrily bob about, up to half a meter in the air. The effect is even better with the help of some small engines on the bottom (to \u0022lighten\u0022 the craft, not to actually cause it to lift off).\n\nHere\u0027s a video of my first hovering craft in action. The fun starts at about 1:15. Note the impressive ground clearance, which actually gets better throughout the video as the craft burns off fuel. When I first flew this thing (intending for it to be a VTOL), I could have sworn that it was flying, and that it merely had a low thrust-to-weight ratio. The reality was a bit more amusing. \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfzX1Hb13-0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n~~~\n\nOf course, this effect has the tremendous potential for abuse. I\u0027m imagining Star-Wars-style podracers, \u0022hovercraft,\u0022 and similar glorious abuses in the near future. I\u0027m sure the possibilities here are limitless.\n\nSo, are you ready to have some good old-fashioned fun with this interesting effect? \n\nGood. Let\u0027s get started.\n\n~~~\n\n**Please post your craft utilizing this effect here!** If you have a craft that utilizes a mod to hover, that\u0027s okay to post too as an inspiration.\n\nGood luck! Have fun! Let me know what you come up with. \n\nThis will be *great.* ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:44:55Z","Content":"So how is this different from what we had before man?"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:53:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So how is this different from what we had before man?\n\nWell, for one thing, the landing gear suspend your craft higher in the air than the old rover wheels. They also offer a bit more suspension, which makes the hovering effect seem more realistic. They can \u0027look\u0027 as if they\u0027re on the ground and not glitched out, like the previous rover wheels kinda did \u0027way back when. Finally, they work in 1.0, and I wasn\u0027t expecting them to.\n\nI suppose there aren\u0027t all *that* many differences, but at any rate, no one has created a showcase for hovering craft in any version (I think). Why not try one out now?\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T21:41:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Why not try one out now?\n\u003E -Upsilon\n\nAgreed!
