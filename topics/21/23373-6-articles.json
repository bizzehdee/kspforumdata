While endurance and acceleration do not differ greatly from the 305, we consider the larger ship to be superior in fleet maneuvers than the 305 and the extreme precision that went into designing the propulsion system allows for maneuvering without the need for RCS even while at 100% throttle.

Adding wing parts in the back will help it maintain attitude. The metal plats also extend all the way down the middle on the underside of the ship whereas on top the center truss is exposed between the two top docking ports, may change that.. I may also put a fueltank between those 2 docking ports to balance out its side profile a little. Needless to say the XC-701 will be refined.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
