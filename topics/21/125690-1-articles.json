I abused the new ramp parts to create a sort of giant MK3 air intake and close it when approaching supersonic speeds to prevent it from melting. The goliath has just enough power to take off without any other engines but needs them when surpassing 700m. The goliath reverse thrust came real handy when landing after descending from orbit.

Possibly longer[/SIZE].[/FONT](that\u0026#39;s an incorrect statement... after some testing at full throttle, it\u0026#39;s closer to 45\u002B minutes.) The goliaths may be monsters, but they are beautifully efficient. And no, it can not grill meat. The goliaths produce little heat on their own due to being high bypass engines. And they pretty much just blow the meat around instead of cooking it...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ll try using less radiators and see if I can clean up the aerodynamics a bit, on the single engine speeder. But the radiators seem to produce a bit of drag so I doubt it\u0026#39;ll break 500m/s with any on the craft, unless I can hide them from the aerodynamics behind something else, like the engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n:edit: Even placing the radiators behind the engine, out of the aerodynamics, the craft still can\u0026#39;t push past 380m/s. Guess the mass has more to do with it then the drag. Also, past 350m/s even 8 large radiator panels are not enough to cool the goliath.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027Red Dwarf\u0027]Aww man, is that how many Goliaths it took to get that craft off the ground?

But I was making the clusters for something a lot bigger and wanted to test them.... So built the upsized Sky Hopper. With the 9 engines, it accelerates quite quickly and can move pretty fast. Ok, fast is a bit misleading. around 200m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n:edit: confirmed. replacing the 3 triple goliath clusters with just 3 single engines and it still flies. So yeah, it\u0026#39;s doable with far less engines. it\u0026#39;s speed is dropped from 200m/s to a more stately 50m/s. but it\u0026#39;s mass is also dropped from just shy of 100tons to a more respectable 68 tons.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-22T16:58:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2015 04:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
