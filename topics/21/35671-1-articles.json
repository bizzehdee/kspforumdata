Slow down descent at chute deployment altitude using rockets, to prevent the craft from being shredded by the stress of a near-instantaneous 50-60 m/s deceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Use whatever fuel is left in the tanks to attempt to soft-land on the ground (the chutes alone were insufficient, and these are the HOME 3M chutes, which produce 5 times as much drag as the stock units - even at zero altitude, my vertical velocity was about -10 m/s, which is far too high for this thing to survive. Not only that, but as soon as they cut when any part of the vehicle touched the ground, the rest of it would go smashing into the ground at a good deal more than 1 m/s (my maximum \u0022safe\u0022 landing speed)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Inevitably fail, due to slight but noticeable forward motion caused by incredibly powerful rockets straining against their structural reinforcements, as well as chutes being automatically cut at an inopportune moment (i.e. as soon as the slightest bit of the vehicle touched the ground). When your object is 50 meters long and weighs almost 700 tons, having 3/4 of it slam down to the ground at a speed well above 1 m/s because the chutes were cut automatically is beyond fatal, especially given that the landing envelope (in terms of performance) is very small - the TWR only rises above 1 on Eve for the last 350 m/s of dV or so, out of about 1200 m/s carried by the skycrane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I installed the airship components mostly out of sheer frustration, and a desire to move on to other projects without marking this one as a failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, if it makes any difference, the fuel tanks were almost empty during the descent into Eve\u0027s atmosphere, which means what landed on the surface clocked in at a good deal less than 1200 tons. And this thing could NOT have flown on Kerbin (I don\u0027t think, anyways), even with the envelopes fully inflated - Eve\u0027s atmosphere at sea level is 5 times as thick as Kerbin\u0027s, and I landed no more than 150 meters ASL. If I\u0027d tried a stunt like this on Kerbin (or, God forbid, Duna), I would very likely have gone smashing into the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hooligan Labs","CreatedById":45359,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T01:33:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, I love the design!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00221096bimu\u0022 data-cite=\u00221096bimu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMore like a quantum leap in over powered air buoyancy parts.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, sorry but those baloons really killed it for me.

Orbital assembly of the base was deemed impractical, as it is designed to operate under gravity, and might have broken apart upon landing if it were not designed monolithically. While this vehicle is fully operational and flight-ready, experiments with deep-space refuelling (to reach more distant destinations) are ongoing (but have thus far been impractical due to the extraordinarily large fuel capacity of the transfer tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlbum:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKER New Home, the first of the \u003Cem\u003EFar Wanderer\u003C/em\u003E class, lifting off from the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gEEDbu9h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gEEDbu9h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDropping the last lifter stage before circularization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KXMXorBh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KXMXorBh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn LKO, with a nice view of the crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LKfsfqLh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LKfsfqLh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing in towards Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wwiME4nh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wwiME4nh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpside-down aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wqAMWnIh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wqAMWnIh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing in for a landing.
