I am planning to illuminate a large area with these Light Systems for a future Mun Base. I had no idea how hard it would be to land this one. The lower lab is to close to the surface and it requires a very soft landing. Future plans are to tweak the design a little to lose the tanks and engines after the installs. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/594779512734327287/703880531AABB7E31C8839E50194224512857B4B/\u0022 alt=\u0022703880531AABB7E31C8839E50194224512857B4B\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-19T02:31:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2014 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by castille7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hachouma","CreatedById":104016,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T18:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope it recharges electricity faster than it consumes\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castille7","CreatedById":101668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T18:23:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll buy Bill Kerman some night vision goggles just in case!.....lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DisarmingBaton5","CreatedById":68576,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T00:16:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a limit in KSP of the number of light sources.

It is the \u0022pixel light count\u0022 slider under graphics. Try setting it very low and you will see how excess lights are handled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you have 4 lamps on your spacecraft, and the pixel light count is set to 3. Then unity will render the first 3 lights as you expect, with a nice cone of light spreading out of your lamp. However, the fourth one doesnt. Unity cant render the light of that lamp because you set the maximum amount of lights to 3. So, unity does a little trick: It just makes the whole area of the excess light brighter. Try it on the launchpad. You can change the pixel light count on the fly (settings in the escape menu). Then turn the lights on one by one and you will see the dramatic difference when you turn on the first excess light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, a high pixel light count makes a lot of lights look amazing. On the other hand, one might try to exploit unity\u0027s trick to light up a large area using very few lamps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castille7","CreatedById":101668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T00:59:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is so cool, thanks for sharing that information, this game just amazed me again! ...Luv KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
