Not only does it look like a butterfly, but it\u0027s so docile in its handling that it is a great training VTOL craft. In fact its so docile that you don\u0027t need to use SAS (\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENote: VTOL thrust optimised for Dry CoM - some pitch trim will get you going just fine though if you\u0027re a keyboard user\u003C/span\u003E) naturally life is easier with SAS engaged.

As it stands, all of the [visible] control surfaces are locked because I went for aesthetics in the wing setup. There are some roll only elevons tucked away on the CoM. Tried with hidden pitch elevons, but couldn\u0027t position them well enough. Through 99.9% of the flight envelope the torque wheels are adequate. However using the rearmost\u0027s wings for controlling pitch provides a lot of extra pitch authority (that isn\u0027t really needed) if you struggle a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeedwise, I\u0027ve not managed more than about 190m/s, in a dive, at full power.
