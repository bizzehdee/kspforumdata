While I love going into space and exploring what I can reach (which isn\u0026#39;t far, yet), I equally enjoy soaring through Kerbal\u0026#39;s blue skies in craft I design...such as this one I made tonight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]CRAFT FILES\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/B][URL=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzHQIMX2N5hoNTl0NXpVNHFhOUk/view?usp=sharing\u0022]A-10C (No Payload)[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzHQIMX2N5hocm5UZF9FMENaVlU/view?usp=sharing\u0022]A-10C (2x Missiles*)[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPress 1 to toggle reverse thrusters. This helps slow down the craft when landing. The A-10C is certainly not the most acrobatic aircraft, especially not in KSP. Keep this in mind when trying to perform feats, dives, etc. Because of the engine design, sometimes I found it easier to pull the nose up when the engine throttle is less than 1/2 or by cutting the engines completely (X).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n*[I]The missiles are staged. Press the spacebar once to activate the missile\u0026#39;s thrusters, then again to release them. Works best when throttle is at full.[/I]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/WHbU20A.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/IeFjPqa.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wp4ipVx.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/C7oCWBO.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FuzUWUP.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/E2XyOJw.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/DxqgeB2.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/enHfVvw.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/63xCnh9.jpg[/IMG]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T14:24:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PerfectH\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"X9Squared","CreatedById":149583,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T05:02:33Z","Content":"\nHow about a craft file?
