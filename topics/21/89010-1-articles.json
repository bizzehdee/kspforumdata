Once I got to Duna I would plan to aerobrake in its atmosphere and bring myself to a circular orbit 1,000km above the surface on an orbit with next to no inclination. The aerobraking didn\u0027t go too well, as afterwards, if it hadn\u0027t been for a 500m/s burn I would\u0027ve just flown straight past Duna, which would\u0027ve been a bit of a disappointment. Once around Duna, I decided to have a little mess around with the Kerbals and their expressions and the capsule windows (see album for details). Then after a few hours in orbit I decided to get back home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had originally planned to aerobrake (if necessary) around Kerbin and bring myself into orbit, then I would launch another few rockets to bring the Kerbals back and refuel Deep Space I without launching a new one. Essentially making the spacecraft reusable in some respect. But the Mun decided it would thwart my plans and use its gravity to mess my trajectory up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E so in the end I just ejected the crew escape module and let the rest of the Deep Space I spacecraft fall to its death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if the crew module is ejected, Deep Space I has a large probe core to allow unmanned operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload Links:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Launcher: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/4eizsrnjsrl2z9p/Deep%20Space%20I%20%28With%20Launcher%29.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/4eizsrnjsrl2z9p/Deep%20Space%20I%20%28With%20Launcher%29.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout Launcher: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/rhm1jiwvyrsx7pt/Deep%20Space%20I.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rhm1jiwvyrsx7pt/Deep%20Space%20I.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave Fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReconXPanzer\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-31T12:43:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2014 12:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ReconXPanzer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nickel AP","CreatedById":170218,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-21T18:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is a very old post (3 years, wow) but I have a few questions. Before I get to that though, my motivation is that I am currently trying to build an interplanetary tug to carry my landers, rovers, whatever. I Have made it to duna and back using a ship with single orange and 8x LV-N engines. However, I feel like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E is poor and despite it being one of the most efficient ways of getting to other planets, I am having a hard time loving the burn times due to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E. So because of this I have been working on bigger, faster, stronger tugs (MORE ENGINES!!!!) to give it oomph, but still having poor \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E no matter how naked I make the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to my questions. What was the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on this ship? You mentioned using oxidizer so I am assuming this older version of ksp had lv-n require ox? with this new ksp 8 lv-n seem like they wouldn\u0027t have enough push to get that much payload anywhere in a decent time. I am sure you could get to duna (Obviously) but what was your burn time? Was it incredibly long?.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new tug design I have come up with is essentially engines and fuel with some ports for docking (28xLVN, 2x2.5 mono tanks, 2.5 storage, science storage, probe core, 7xbatteries, 8x \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E and each engine has 2x 400 liquid fuel tanks) Essentially the ship is a giant engine and fuel tanks. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E is still \u0026lt; 1.0 with a burn time of 8 minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could probably make it to some outer planets with this but seriously, bare bones build with 28 engines and still less than 1.0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E?
