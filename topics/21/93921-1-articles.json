The bigger fuel bay was absolutely necessary, I\u0027m glad SQUAD listens to the fanbase on that one. We can now start making more legit stock shuttles in KSP. Has anyone made any practical space planes so far, though?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my shuttle concept. I wanted something that could be used for grabbing things like asteroids as well as possible landings on near-Kerbin objects like Minmus and the Mun. On the back, it uses two Mark 55 radial engines, followed by one of KW Rocketry\u0027s engines that uses only RCS fuel. Then on the sides (because of the awesome new parts editor), I was able to place four of the rockomax 24-77 engines for descent! A little complicated to land, I have to use the rear engines to come to a near stop above the surface and then slowly decelerate with the rockomax engines.
