But when it\u0027s done it will enable KerbalX to have much better mod info (things like B9 procedural parts, the various Umbra Space industries mods and other mods which share a common GameData folder will be properly detected) and it will make downloading CKAN meta-files possible. It also means the site will be less reliant on users uploading part maps as it will know about everything that CKAN knows. When that\u0027s done then I\u0027ll be able to focus on other things like the users profile page.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T15:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBug report for the PartMapper: it doesn\u0027t appear to like HotRockets?

(0.10.0 released)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a big change to the knowledge base and the process that is used to discover mods, in order to take advantage of CKAN\u0027s extensive knowledge of mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKX can now get information about mods from CKAN as well as the existing PartMapper approach (getting the two to play nice together has been.....interesting). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary advantage of this is better resolution on the mods. The PartMapper cannot distinguish between mods that install to the same folder inside GameData so up till now some mods have been lumped together. For example B9 procedural parts was considered part of B9 as they both install to the same folder. By getting the info from CKAN, KX is able to get more specific info for each mod so these mods are now correctly identified as separate mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother advantage is more accurate naming and download urls for mods. The PartMapper assumed that a mod\u0027s name was the same as it\u0027s root folder in GameData and while this is true for the majority it\u0027s not always the case. With the CKAN info KX can get the name that the mod author specifies in the ckan repo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also means that all the mods available via CKAN now have up-to-date download urls without needing to rely on users suggesting download urls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E.ckan meta-package files for mod craft\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can now download a .ckan meta-package file for modded craft and then give that file to your CKAN mod manager and have it automatically install the mods required for that craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe link to download that is on the \u0022download\u0022 and \u0022mods\u0022 tab in the header section of a craft page. Or you can just add .ckan to the end of a craft\u0027s url; for example for this craft \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/inigma/STS-Service-Module\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/inigma/STS-Service-Module\u003C/a\u003E just change the url to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/inigma/STS-Service-Module.ckan\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/inigma/STS-Service-Module.ckan\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome craft may use mods that aren\u0027t available via CKAN so their .ckan files will be incomplete. If you download the .ckan file by clicking the download link then KX will tell you which mods you need to get manually and, where possible, it will suggest a download link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you can download a mod-craft and put it in your game, download the .ckan file and give it to CKAN and you\u0027re good to go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a code and database point of view this has been a big change, but it doesn\u0027t appear to change that much from a users point of view. Infact, if I\u0027ve done things right you should hardly notice! Aside from having .ckan files for craft there aren\u0027t any new features, but it does a lot to improve KX\u0027s ability to correctly identify mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis change greatly reduces the need for users to run the PartMapper tool, but that is still the way KX can discover mods that aren\u0027t on CKAN. If you upload a craft and find that KX hasn\u0027t identified all the parts then run the PartMapper and then click the \u0022Check for updated Parts\u0022 link (on the edit page for the craft). If you know you are using mods that aren\u0027t available via CKAN then it would also be a help if you run it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to say a big thanks to everyone who has run the PartMapper tool, without you guys doing that KX would not have worked as well. I really thought that I\u0027d need to periodically download lots of mods and run the PartMapper myself, but since the initial release I\u0027ve only run it a few times (just after KSP releases). It\u0027s been an interesting experiment in crowd-sourcing this info and it\u0027s worked much better than I expected!
