Can be ejected when it runs out of fuel or to increase performance if youre just flying around KSP. Also its very difficult to land so I recommend using the parachutes.\n\nEvolution of design:\n\nMK1 Exosuit (capable of space flight only, single ion engine and RCS)\n\n![exosuit_zpsa8e8c0ef.jpg](http://i508.photobucket.com/albums/s321/Khobai/exosuit_zpsa8e8c0ef.jpg)\n\nMK2 Exosuit (capable of space flight only, dual ion engines and RCS)\n\n![exosuit2_zps6a659316.jpg](http://i508.photobucket.com/albums/s321/Khobai/exosuit2_zps6a659316.jpg)\n\nMK3 Exosuit (first atmospheric flight capable Exosuit, jet engine, dual ion engines, and RCS)\n\n![exosuitmk3_zpsf550390f.jpg](http://i508.photobucket.com/albums/s321/Khobai/exosuitmk3_zpsf550390f.jpg)\n\nMK4 Exosuit (not pictured, but was basically just the MK3 with a detachable jetpack for SSTO)\n\nMK5 Exosuit (pictured above, SSTO capable, x2 turbojets, x1 nuke engine, dual ion engines, dual RCS engines, and RCS thrusters.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-24T19:52:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2015 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Khobai**"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T20:57:21Z","Content":"OMG dude, the second one is hilariously awesome!
