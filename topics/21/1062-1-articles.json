So I said, lets see if we can get the Satellite up with them, and if possible only SRBs.\n\nMy first try used a single medium SRB plus 2 Shuttles and it got up there but I couldn\u0027t make the insertion before the time ran out. Tried a couple different variations, but I was successful with this, though I had to use a medium LFR to do it once the SRBs burned out. \n\nAs you can see I let it run for almost 2 hours and it\u0027s in a 319.8-322.1 altitude orbit"},{"CreatedByName":"Douglasdtlltd","CreatedById":4099,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-26T14:07:41Z","Content":"We need better balancing configurations. \u003E\\_\u003E"}]}
