This was my first mission with the lander \u0022below\u0022 the capsule. The only mod used is procedural fairings to hide the lander, as I placed a strong emphasis on a rocket that \u0022looked nice\u0022 - without too many boosters hanging off the side, etc. The mission uses a profile somewhere between the US Apollo mission, and the Soviet Soyuz/LK mission. Multi-stage rocket to the Mun, one kerbal EVA transfers from the Athena capsule to the Aegis lander, which uses the Mun orbit retroburn engine as it\u0027s main descent engine and uses RCS for the final landing approach. The Aegis lander launches from the Munar surface, leaving it\u0027s base and instruments behind to save weight, meets up with the Athena in Munar orbit where the Kerbal EVA\u0027s back to Athena carrying the science experiments with him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Athena capsule, the (hidden) Aegis lander, and Zeus booster, on the pad ready for launch: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sUgPdkp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sUgPdkp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetup the launch with 3 Kerbals in the Athena pod, leaving the Aegis lander empty. Launch on SAS only (don\u0027t use any RCS until reaching Munar orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solids burn out around 8000 meters, around 250 m/s - after jettisoning the solids, speed will drop to around 200 m/s , don\u0027t worry, this is fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBegin your gravity turn at about 18000 meters, only dipping 20 degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2ry5WtT.png\u0022 alt=\u00222ry5WtT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to keep your angle of attack steady, but the rocket is huge/long so it\u0027ll dip a bit - no huge worry, the mission has plenty of spare fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt about 50000 meters, the first stage will burn out - space to the next stage and hit 1 to deploy the Athena\u0027s solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3s3mRPz.png\u0022 alt=\u00223s3mRPz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHold your angle of ascent steady between 30 and 40 degrees, stage 2 will burn out right around 100,000 meters. Space to stage 3, the Skipper engine will take you all the way to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lCzR35Q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lCzR35Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t go over the minor details of navigating to the Mun, but stage 3 has a decent amount of fuel so if you have to make a few adjustment burns don\u0027t worry. If you run out and have to hit stage 4 en-route it\u0027s not a panic, stage 4 has lots of fuel to go around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in the Mun\u0027s SOI, establish a circular orbit around 110,000 meters. In my sample launch, I spaced to stage 4 after slowing for orbit but before circularizing. Stage 4 has lots of fuel, so circularize your orbit and relax for a few - you\u0027ll want to make sure your EVA kerbal transfer is on the \u0022light side\u0022 of the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L5NKoty.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L5NKoty.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re ready, space to stage-off the procedural fairings panels hiding the Aegis lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zB2IOYs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zB2IOYs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA a Kerbal over to the Aegis, in my test mission it was Bill.

Use RCS to carefully control your descent, and touchdown on the Munar surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6JrWBti.png\u0022 alt=\u00226JrWBti.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve landed, do your science and plant the flag. I created this mission in career mode, so the frame of the Aegis has a science experiment or two attached. If you\u0027re going to use this in career mode, you\u0027ll want to change up the science experiments to match your own progression. Press 2 to extend the ladder before you exit out of the Aegis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f8UdL84.png\u0022 alt=\u0022f8UdL84.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re ready to return, wait for the Athena to be in a good orbital position for a link up, throttle up then space stage into your engines. This will detach the Aegis crew pod from it\u0027s frame. At this point, the Aegis has VERY little weight to it, so small throttle adjustments will have a big impact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2kaWSLm.png\u0022 alt=\u00222kaWSLm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy typical, but admittedly not 100% optimal, profile is to launch mostly vertical until my Apoapsis intersects the orbit of the Athena waiting above, fast forward up, then circularize my orbit using the Aegis\u0027 engines. I usually use the engines in the Aegis to perform the rendevouz, but if it proves troublesome don\u0027t hesitate to switch back to the Athena for the rendevouz, it\u0027s got plenty of fuel to spare. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mEpLm6Q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mEpLm6Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t normally bother to link up for a docking - it takes too long, but if you want to the Athena has plenty of monopropellent so if you would like to retrieve the Aegis from Munar orbit feel free. I ususally just get close, then EVA over (don\u0027t forget to take your science!) but this has the disadvantage of leaving the Aegis in Munar orbit as spacejunk. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qJLZKrz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qJLZKrz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your Kerbal is safely aboard the Athena capsule, you\u0027ll want to stage into your return engine if you haven\u0027t already. This will ditch the leftover reaction wheel, and give you the oomph to get back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C8gjnaW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022C8gjnaW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get back to Kerbin, land normally and pop your chutes around 2000 meters to be safe. Of course, if you\u0027re landing above the mountains or something you\u0027ll need to hit the silk sooner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FtdHEYj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FtdHEYj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the Athena capsule (and everything above the Aegis) as the standard \u0022cookie cutter\u0022 capsule in my Career save, which is why it\u0027s got some of the design features that aren\u0027t required for this particular mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull mission album here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Yfw3A/embed#1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Yfw3A/embed#1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can download the .craft file here, from curse:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/shareables/kerbal/223205-athena-and-aegis\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.curse.com/shareables/kerbal/223205-athena-and-aegis\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr from Dropbox (the curse link seems to be having issues): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/fca60fhbc6e4eab/Athena\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fca60fhbc6e4eab/Athena Mk I Capsule With Aegis Lander.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-12T15:27:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2014 03:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tjsnh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed download link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Billyk88","CreatedById":102725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T04:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat size is that fairing base mine isnt that big how did u get that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Billyk88","CreatedById":102725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T05:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk i figured out the size thing but now i cant figure out how to get my panels to eject.
