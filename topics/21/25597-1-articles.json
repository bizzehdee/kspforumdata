This Mostly came about when trying to figure out how to bring a Kerbal Driven Rover to Mun/Minmus and back. I\u0027m sure that you could go to Eve or Duna with these as well. I have only tested the Rover on Kerbal, Mun and Minmus. You can use the X1 Ascender to pretty much take the Rover anywhere on Kerbal. Ive tested the parachute only in the Kerbal atmosphere, so have no idea how it will preform in other conditions. All was done without mods. I will post some pictures in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun and let me know what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX1 Explorer on Minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/fWeWAAo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/fWeWAAo\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX1 Ship Series.rar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/x1shipseries\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.filedropper.com/x1shipseries\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest not flying the X1 Mun Habitat.
