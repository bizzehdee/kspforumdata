The lander is required to make it back to The space program base, have to be able to get science, has to carry three people (please no more Kerbals), must have a parachute to make it to the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have any small space station lifters that can make it to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and put one into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso if you have a crew capsule that can dock with the small space station that would be awesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a small space station that is a crew cabin, science area, docking port x3, solar panels, batteries, ladders, deep space comms relay, and a fuel tank to transfer fuel to a craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you could please add pictures and a parts list, as I play on Xbox and thus I cannot download the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-05T16:45:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2019 04:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Mikenike\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-03T17:39:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndefine heavy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-03T18:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n45\u002B tons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-03T20:28:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nany part constraints? like only 1.25 meter\u00A0wide parts, or only level 4 tech?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nany style constraints? like it has \u0022look like a standard lifter\u0022, or does the game engine allow it to happen and not explode?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-04T18:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo part constraints no style constraints but would rather it be an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E or a tsto rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-05T01:24:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick sketch gives me a lifter that can get ~50 tons to a 100x100 orbit with five\u00A0mainsails and ten and a half rockomax 64s using a 4,1 asparagus staging arrangement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-05T12:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nok can you add some pictures please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-06T14:46:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to turn my monitor sideways to get this shot of it.
