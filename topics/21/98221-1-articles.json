This allows me to use the next largest size of launch vehicle from my Kerbooster family. I\u0027ve built and flown larger versions, but I need to upgrade the R\u0026amp;D building to unlock the parts they use. The Kerbooster Medium is simply an up-scaled version of the Kerbooster Light. It can throw modest sized crewed spacecraft, as well as interplanetary probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my first test flight of 0.90, I\u0027m going to use the Kerbooster to deploy my Kestrel lander. The Kestrel was born out of my earliest experiments with \u0022stack shuttle\u0022 configurations. The idea was to make a vehicle that worked more like the original \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nss.org:8080/resources/library/shuttledecision/index.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpace Shuttle\u003C/a\u003E concept, incorporating a re-useable booster and re-useable orbiter. I was also influenced by Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Starbooster concept, which he used in his novel \u003Cem\u003EEncounter With Tiber\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JK7zfe8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JK7zfe8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbooster uses an all-solid first stage. It\u0027s not recoverable, but it\u0027s cheap. I looked at the value of the solids when empty of fuel and discovered that they are worth so little when empty, that their recovery value is dwarfed by the cost of the parachutes needed to land them safely. This is before the performance penalties of carrying the extra weight and drag of the parachutes are accounted for. The parachutes themselves would be recovered downrange at a percentage of their original value, all to recover a bunch of \u0022trash bins empty of boom\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/71K7AWy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002271K7AWy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ElVuRkO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ElVuRkO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solids are thrust limited to 70%, which ensures that they burn long enough to lift the stack clear of the dense portion of the atmosphere. The solids are giving their best thrust to weight ratio when the stack is at a high enough altitude not to be hindered by terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LSS6ROD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LSS6ROD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VMfPEdh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VMfPEdh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter first stage separation, the stack already has an apoapsis above 70km, so the fly-back stage is used to finish the job of accelerating to orbital velocity and circularising. The payload is deployed into an eccentric orbit, minimising the amount of fuel that must be expended by the payload spacecraft to reach it\u0027s destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vaEaRfs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vaEaRfs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wWPIHFc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wWPIHFc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, I\u0027m throwing the Kestrel to the Mun, so I use the Kerbooster to perform the departure burn, taking care to leave the Kerbooster on a trajectory that returns it to Kerbin. I don\u0027t usually deplete the Kerbooster\u0027s fuel tanks this much, but I\u0027m performing a test flight, so I want to see how far I can push the design. The Kestrel is delivered to the Mun with a near full fuel load. The Kerbooster has an adequate, although marginal, reserve of fuel for orbit change manoeuvres for the return trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W2sbQLe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022W2sbQLe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rzAQUXO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rzAQUXO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0hVVpGc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220hVVpGc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ImVb7j9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ImVb7j9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI perform an aerobraking pass, noting that I should actually have performed a course correction burn when I left the Mun, my orbit is slightly inclined, instead of equatorial as I intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f9Ejh37.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f9Ejh37.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith marginal fuel remaining, I bring the Kerbooster in for re-entry. Through sheer trial and error, I\u0027ve figured out how to perform reasonably accurate re-entries, which place me within gliding distance of the KSC. I\u0027m conscious as I do this that the new aerodynamic and re-entry heating in 1.0 are going to have a big effect on my designs. Whether my shuttles are still flyable in 1.0 remains to be seen. Worst case, I\u0027ll come up with a new design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RMKJEDA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RMKJEDA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy approach brings me down from space within reasonable distance of the KSC.
