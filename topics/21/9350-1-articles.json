I\\\u0027ve flown them both a bunch. I\\\u0027ve given the Enterprise the most attention and have taken her to the moon and back. I haven\\\u0027t made a booster system for the Reliant yet so she consumes most of her fuel on the way up. Getting them close enough to each other to fire their salvos is tricky enough but will be well worth it. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StelarCF","CreatedById":13985,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-12T15:25:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow you just need someone to make a nebula part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
