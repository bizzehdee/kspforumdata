One of the buttons in the bottom left of the SPH/VAB lets you see it, in case you were unaware. Second, make sure there are some control surfaces on the front.

The issue is often caused by the plane getting lifted, just not enough, and in asymetrical places. This causes uneven-ness in load to the landing gear, causing a cornering effect. As this continues, the lift surfaces naturally curve the spaceplane into a roll and kersplat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick fix to this is to have the front gear slightly higher than the rear gear. This makes the entire spacecraft point down a few degrees. Since KSP uses angle of attack to simulate lift, this creates downforce and lots of contact and stability with the ground. Also in my experience angled landing gear (like an upside down V) can do this, so maybe keep them upright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to what NAF says, front canards aren\u0027t always necessary and IMO lead to more flip-outs then they\u0027re worth. A streamlined design with all control surfaces at the back likes to weather-vane into the direction of travel. They do provide alot of lift during take-off tho, so its a trade-off. If you\u0027re having trouble lifting off, try moving the control surfaces as far back from the gear as possible, and moving the gear to right behind the COM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rdivine","CreatedById":66317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T12:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always had this irritating problem too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
