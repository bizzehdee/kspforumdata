So you first need to place engines and fuel tanks somewhere, and then build wing around so CoL will be where you need.

RS-25), in fact responsible for much of its awesome performance, and as such it stays attached to the shuttle, but yeah, refurbishing costs did in fact make the shuttle MUCH more expensive to fly than an expendable rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt had to do with manpower, though. Not only were the SRBs a stupid thing to reuse (as you have pointed out, reusing a SRB means basically rebuilding it), the heat protection system for example took a lot of man-hours to inspect and replace after every flight. Costly, aerospace engineer-grade man-hours. Ditto for the inspections of the incredibly complex SSMEs with their thousands of parts. In all documents during shuttle design, you can see that NASA consistently underestimated the amount of work it would take to process one shuttle stack after flight. They were talking about 15 days between flights right up to a few years before the first flight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, \u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E the Shuttle had been flown often enough (something impossible in the end due to the constrains introduced early in the design like SRBs and the fragile composite thermal tile heatshield), those costs (salaries, infrastructures,...) would have spread somewhat and the cost per flight would have ended up being much, much lower. As the Shuttle engineers put it, the first shuttle flight each year costs six billion, all the others after that one are free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
