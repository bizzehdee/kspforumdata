After browsing the spaceship exchange forums and seeing no large-scale aircraft, I decided to build a replica of the renowned B-52 heavy bomber.\n\nThis aircraft is an absolute pleasure to fly, extremely stable (can even be flown at 2x time safely). It carries 4 bombs which double as external fuel tanks) that are dropped in pairs, and are quite easy to aim (see video for demonstration). Stats:\n\nCruise Altitude: 14,000m - 15,000m\n\nCruise Speed: 500 - 550 m/s\n\nRange: approx. 400km\n\nFlight instructions:\n\n- set precision controls (caps lock)\n\n- full throttle\n\n- ignite engines\n\n- hold wheel brakes (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) for several seconds\n\n- release brakes\n\n- hold pitch up. Should take off right at the end of the runway\n\n- SPACE to release first set of bombs\n\n- SPACE again to release second set of bombs\n\n- SPACE to open deceleration parachute after touchdown\n\nWatch the video for a full demonstration of takeoff, reaching cruise altitude/speed, bombing, and landing (on runway).\n\nThis has been another quality Chronic release.

The slideshow might have something to do with that problem, it not being able to respond to controls fast enough. Maybe reduce quality/AA to pick up the framerate for better responsiveness? Also, make sure you have precision controls turned on.\n\n@MrMadGameplay: once you get it off the ground, it\\\u0027s actually incredibly easy to fly. I was flying at 2x time warp WITHOUT ASAS at some points. So much momentum that it just doesn\\\u0027t roll around much.\n\n@Forge: to get to orbit I\\\u0027d need to use the toroidal rocket engines, and they burn fuel so fast that I don\\\u0027t think it would ever get there.

This is partially due to how much torque is on the wings because of the engines being placed so far forward (a necessity for replicating the B-52, which was the point of this exercise). Every wing component gives 1 \u0027unit\u0027 of lift to the aircraft, so removing those makes it impossible to get off the ground.\n\nSuggestions on how to improve this would be welcomed."},{"CreatedByName":"antbin","CreatedById":22389,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T19:49:01Z","Content":"**Dat wing** ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Seanoog","CreatedById":8599,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T17:49:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Dat wing** ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)\n\nYOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!\n\nThis is a picture showing the result of an over agressive landing!\n\nAN it was perfectly flyable, with a fine touch! ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png) 8)\n\n@ChronicSilence.\n\nPlease find a new craft file, for a slightly edited version!\n\nStripped the redundent wheels, too save on weight, an removed 3 sets of struts from the top section of the wing\n\nMay be 32 Parts stripped from the craft!\n\nWill try editting it further!

I too have spent some time trying to lighten it up. I found that by moving the engine mount pylons back a little I could reduce the torque on the wing, and so reduce the number of struts needed to support it. I\\\u0027m still having trouble making it fully reliable, wings like to snap if you try some aerobatics and so on. Hopefully, they\\\u0027ll maybe increase the connection strength of wing segments in an upcoming patch.\n\nI also removed the redundant sets, and while take-off/flight worked fine, I found it to be extremely difficult to land this beast without breaking stuff. Having the doubles seems to help with cushioning the landing."},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T01:05:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is a phenominal aircraft!\n\u003E \n\u003E Large, Immensly Powerful, Strong, Well Equiped, BOMB\\\u0027s included...\n\u003E \n\u003E This is Kerbal Engineering at its best!\n\u003E \n\u003E But even on my system, its crippling!
