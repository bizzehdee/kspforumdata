I\u0027m coming at you with a new craft. All stock this time, and it should be pretty much perfect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it\u0027s been bothering me about the lack of proper Soyuz craft out there. There are some great /looking/ ones, but there just aren\u0027t any that satisfy the \u0022Workalike\u0022 part of it all. Of course there are mods, but I wanted a stock one so that everyone can use it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goals for the craft were as follows: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Has to work like a Soyuz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-3 man reentry module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-3 man orbital module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Unmanned service module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Pointy liquid fueled boosters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-2-stage core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Escape tower system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Beautiful, gorgeous basket type decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Engine clustering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Make it LOOK like a Soyuz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Has to fly well (and boy does it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Has to be usable if I want to actually do things in orbit with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Has to be stock so that everyone can access it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pics: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LeMsz3v.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LeMsz3v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uofESiZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uofESiZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V2N9exV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V2N9exV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qDHDbqQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qDHDbqQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jScdj3j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jScdj3j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/jml8P\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFull imgur album here.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that picture of the capsule being released from the orbital core, the core had about 80-90% fuel left after attaining a 125Km circular orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EACTION GROUPS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Toggle all CENTRAL gimballed engines.
