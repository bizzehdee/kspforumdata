The final version uses part clipping simply to stack intakes. It works and is orbital without it, but it makes it much easier.

All else is completely stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollows normal SSTO plane liftoff profile: Take off as a regular plane, climb to 10k, level off some, increase velocity to beyond 1700m/s while increasing altitude beyond 23km, drop the space-ship, use rocket to climb to space.

Spaceplanes are fairly easy if you use enough air intakes (8 per engine seems to work for me.) Its just a matter of getting them above 2Km/s and up as high as you can (i normally go for 36Km minimum) before switching to the rocket engine of your choice. Once you have that kind of speed and altitude it only a bit of fuel to make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree tho its a great concept, all i need is $200000 to try it for real! hurry up lottery win \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T13:16:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI went back and played with my mother-plane, and I\u0027ve not got her to where she can land as well.
