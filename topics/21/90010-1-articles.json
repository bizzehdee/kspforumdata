For those that don\u0027t know about The Rover Experts, read down to the last section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis new and improved Aerospike is their first attempt at a recasing of an engine using engine debris found lying on the ground after failed launches. After recovered, it is brought into the lab for rebuilding, and then the team decides what to do with it. Various small modifications have been made, such as the material it is made of, and the contents and mechanics of the combustion chamber. This allows for a lighter engine with higher ISP, therefore more Delta-V. These aren\u0027t huge improvements, however, and the team found it insignificant to send to market. Though, after a bit of an... accident, the Advanced Aerospike was marketed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the CFG file if you want it for yourself: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/vls5721yd7d23zg/liquidEngineAdvancedAerospike.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/vls5721yd7d23zg/liquidEngineAdvancedAerospike.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKeep reading\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do not know how to install this properly, here is what you do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen the folder where KSP.exe is located. In the folder with it, there should be a subfolder named GameData. In the GameData, there is another subfolder named Squad. This is the folder where your parts are stored. You want the folders Parts, then Engine. Inside, there should be a folder named liquidEngineAerospike. Go in there and move the CFG file already in there to a different location. After it\u0027s gone, move the new CFG file in and start up the game.

The Rover Experts salvage the broken parts from failed launch attempts, or from pure tomfoolery at the space program. Yup. Your fooling around is good for their business. Anyway, the team fixes up these parts, makes improvements, and markets them for profit. The KSC has even asked for some parts, but the team has declined... until now! They started doing business with the space program, and the profits shot through the roof. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the space program asks for more, the team might have the budget to recase some more parts in the future. You can contribute to their cause in 2 ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake non-flyable spacecraft, which in turn crashes and provides parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust purchase the parts to do your part in making the space center a better place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore rockets soon to come!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-26T16:44:12Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2014 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T17:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t it a bit of cheating if you just lower the weight and increase the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T17:24:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna have to agree with kerdinand\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T17:43:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerdinand\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerdinand\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIsn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t it a bit of cheating if you just lower the weight and increase the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Commander Jebidiah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Commander Jebidiah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m gonna have to agree with kerdinand\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat, exactly, is happening here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T19:55:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess you could consider it cheating, but I believe these engines need a boost.
