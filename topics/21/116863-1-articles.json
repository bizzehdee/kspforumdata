It was decommissioned from service and retired in 2003 after an Air France Concorde crashed at Gonnesse, France.\n\n![lwQekrK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lwQekrK.jpg)\n\n![Q5h0WFH.png](http://i.imgur.com/Q5h0WFH.png)\n\n![jZmPz9j.png](http://i.imgur.com/jZmPz9j.png)\n\n![Ib5rGJq.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ib5rGJq.png)\n\n![k7UjYiz.png](http://i.imgur.com/k7UjYiz.png)\n\nRender credited to Starwhip ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSpecifications: \n\nPart Count: 238\n\nMass: 144.1 t\n\nHeight: 11.3m\n\nWidth: 30.6 m\n\nLength: 45.3m\n\nMaximum (tested) speed: 728 m/s (supersonic!), although you can go higher (at the risk of breaking up.)\n\n[Craft File - Mediafire](http://www./download/9gwjp4tg4veojiu/Aerospatiale-BAC_Concorde.craft)\n\nThank you for viewing, and leave some rep or a comment if you liked the ship! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T11:49:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 11:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Columbia**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T14:29:46Z","Content":"It\u0027s very beautiful!\n\nBut some kind of a visible cockpit would be very nice :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T15:26:41Z","Content":"Was going to say the same thing as Azimech.

I felt that using an actual cockpit with windows and all that would ruin the shape, so I decided to stick to the blank nose, but I will find a way.

I think I still need a bit of work on the joints - Too little strut connecting, and the wings would bend far too much (and possibly break), too much and it may increase part count to an unplayable. I\u0027ll try my best to revise it, though. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Glad someone could make one out of the mk3 parts!

Yes, attempting to get an Mk3-Sized plane to go supersonic was probably the most troubling part that I had when building it. I myself am surprised that it went beyond the sound barrier. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
