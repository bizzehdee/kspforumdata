I just would like some input and design tips. You can see a decoupler below the fancy part, and it\u0027s there for obvious reasons. However, I \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E don\u0027t like having the boxy Science Lab as the bottom once I\u0027m where I need to be. I need some input on how the design can look a bit easier on the eyes, but not collapse from pressure as I get off the ground. I\u0027d also like tips to make it a bit spicier on the frame.

You shouldn\u0027t have enough mass there to crush it, unless you\u0027re over-powering the launch at 2Gs or more.

I want to make it seem a bit more massive without being \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E unstable. I built a ship a while back with NovaPunch that had 6 mini-satellites that broke off in orbits, so the rover idea kinda comes to mind. The extra solar panels are a sort of placeholder, I know it\u0027ll look stupid. When I get to them, I can replace them. I was originally thinking aboot using it as a fuel station, and docking the external fuel tanks onto it, maybe transferring the rovers/satellites to other ships instead of trying to build them together. I\u0027ll have a look at the docking clamp bottom and see if it works out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for fixing the image, too.
