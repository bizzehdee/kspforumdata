In my experience aircraft works best if the center of lift is slightly behind the center of mass, it makes the aircraft more stable in high G turns and easier to recover during stalls. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I recently on accident made an infiniglider when trying to rebuild the Fi 156 \u0022Fieseler Storch\u0022, a WWII german STOL plane. First I did use a jet engine with nothing but a radiator flap intake with its 40 units of fuel to rely on. The STOL performance was outstanding. at 4 tons takeoff weight it took off at less than 20 meters per second and at low altitude was the faster and more maneuverable than any other aircraft thus far. I later discovered the fact that once airborne pointing the nose 15 degrees up at zero thrust caused the plane to hold a speed of 17-18 m/s and gain half a meter of altitude every second. Goodbye physics. I think Ill make a more detailed post later on with pictures and stuff, since thats not my only plane that I rebuilt from that era.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
