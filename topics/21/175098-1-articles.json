The real life analogue would be the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gee_Bee_Model_R\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGeeBee\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot \u003C/strong\u003Ea place for aircraft that are just plain bad, poorly designed or structurally unsound (that would cover 80% of what I have ever built), but rather planes that are difficult, twitchy, cranky and yet\u00A0compelling.

I got it down to 6.\u00A0 Takeoff is reasonably easy.\u00A0 I DID succeed in landing this (once) with very precise use of the reverse thrust on the Wheesely. This is important since the exits are blocked and you cannot EVA. I tried unblocking them and that little bit of change made it unusable.\u00A0\u00A0 There is also an after-burning variant that requires bailing out of it since its stall speed is way higher than what the landing gear can handle. Fortunately, you can EVA out of that one. The increased thrust of the Panther seems to compensate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this one, which was in response to this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173973-high-speed-stock-aircraft-challenge/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Echallenge \u003C/a\u003E\u00A0to go as fast as possible below 1000 meters. It is a total deathtrap, but it went 1700 meters per second at 1335 altitude. It was not the winner, but it gave a respectable showing.\u00A0 I think takeoff speed was over 400 meters per second.\u00A0 Oh, what we sacrifice for glory!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LB9hUhi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022655\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/LB9hUhi.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-19T23:50:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2018 11:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Klapaucius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
