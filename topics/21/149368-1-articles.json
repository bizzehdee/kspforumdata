Sorry if it\u0027s a little long, I recently built a craft that I just had to share and I didn\u0027t think a few sentences would do it justice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI set out to build a high capacity cargo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane.\u00A0Originally my design goals included 3 full length Mk3 cargo bays, with one being ramp loading. I encountered some design issues along the way (some technical, some aesthetic). I was forced to revise my previous plan. I decided to go with 4 full length Mk3 cargo bays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI give you the Czar Galactica Mk 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n705 parts (including the mining module in the cargo bay) Built in 1.2 pre-release (which I am thoroughly enjoying btw).

Fuel must be balanced with payload. With\u00A0the\u00A0configuration in the craft file, I was able to make a circular 100km orbit with \u0026gt;33000 units of liquid fuel and ~5000 units of oxidizer left in the tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022X1IuqKA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X1IuqKA.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n34 Rapiers, 14 Turbo Ramjets, 14 NERV\u0027s. I tried to avoid spamming engine pods all over the fuselage. The bicoupler pods connecting the wingtip pods feel a little contrived for my liking, but I think they\u0027ll stay. They resolve a number of design issues from previous variants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A3hSuOi.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A3hSuOi.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above image is of a previous variant. Note the absence of the bicoupler engine pods connecting the wingtips.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Z8iy7yv.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z8iy7yv.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn orbit, dorsal bay open, solar panels deployed. The solar panels are housed in what I call \u0022blister bays\u0022 (Mk2 cargo bays clipped into the flat surfaces of a Mk3 fuel tank, leaving just enough room for the Gigantor solar panels). These protect the solar panels during atmospheric ascent and re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess that brings us to ascent and re-entry. Ascent is straight-forward enough, in fact it\u0027s pretty much all straight forward. pull back off the runway\u00A0until you get level flight\u00A0and maintain that heading, maybe hitting the \u0022F\u0022 key now and again to drop the nose, until you hit the requisite 400m/s for the rapiers to become effective. From there, don\u0027t touch anything. The craft will accelerate and climb on its own. If you try to pull up at this point, the canards will shear off. Toggle the NERV\u0027s at around 19-20km (you should be going around 1240m/s at this point). Switch modes on the Rapiers around 21-22km. Still maintain the craft\u0027s natural heading until around 26km, then pitch up to 35-40 degrees.\u00A0Continue to burn the Rapiers until you have an apoapsis around 3 to\u00A03 1/2 minutes out and 100km (you may need to pitch back down during this burn).\u00A0Circularize on NERV\u0027s alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously not a very efficient ascent profile, but a craft this heavy faces some unique challenges. I welcome you to play around with it and post any revisions/improvements here. It would be greatly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft survives re-entry from reasonable orbits well enough (as long as you baby it), but don\u0027t plan any aggressive aerobraking or aerocapture maneuvers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAtmospheric flight with empty or nearly empty tanks is surprisingly good for a craft weighing over 310 tons completely empty. Landing without parachutes requires a little finesse, but is totally doable. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is slightly forward of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E when the craft is completely empty (very slightly). So don\u0027t forget to move any\u00A0remaining fuel forward before re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI included a module I call \u0022Mandible\u0022 in the dorsal bay of the craft file. It\u0027s meant to dock to the front of the craft to allow it to refuel in flight via asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess that\u0027s about it, I invite you to play around with it, post revisions and or improvements here, along with any missions you fly with it. I would very much appreciate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few more pictures for the road:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dpyLi5Y.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dpyLi5Y.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanded at Minmus.
