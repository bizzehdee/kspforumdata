Why not a Shuttle replica? Mind you, this is either a craft for seasoned kerbals... or for kerbals that want to learn their stuff the hard way. I salute those who try! Just like the real thing, this is a very demanding ship with little room for error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/TkUMTg3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TkUMTg3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TkUMTg3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven among the throng of STS replicas out there, I\u0027m still quite pleased with how this turned out. It is moderately useful, and it looks totally like the real thing. And it works like a charm, too! I might write up a couple of flight indications, but really, if you have gotten any other shuttle to orbit, you should manage this one without issues just by remembering to toggle the RCS on on launch. Oh, and it is my usual ridiculously low number of pars, 155 on the pad with the reference 11 part payload, plus it brings half the orbiter\u0027s weight up, 20mT (not down, though, it has severe mass limitations for a safe landing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/0Tc79lk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0Tc79lk.png\u0022 alt=\u00220Tc79lk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the little details that make it an extremely accurate replica:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Obviously, it has the same stack as the real thing: an engine-less Extrenal Tank, surrounded by two SRBs (no liquid boosters!) and the Orbiter with the three main engines feeding off the ET.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A thrust profile for the SRBs. You can tweak it further if you vary the payload, but right now the SRBs vary the thrust during flight, halving it once before the final cutoff. It works just enough to keep the torque in check, forcing the gravity turn actually. Just try to keep it upright facing the right way, and if you panic in the end when you start tilting anyway, just let the SRBs go, you have the margin and it\u0027s safe, besides looking pretty. You \u003Cem\u003Ecan \u003C/em\u003E ride them until they run out, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Payload is a low-density twenty tons, in this case that half-full orange tank. This is not only accurate to the original, it means this is my first \u003Cem\u003Euseful\u003C/em\u003E shuttle replica. Well that was unexpected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A OMS system that runs on different fuel mixture (monopropellant in this case). I know it doesn\u0027t look like it, but those Mk55\u0027s are there for looks only, they hide the true monoprop engines and simulate their mass. Remember to un-forbid the rear monoprop tank when you turn them on, it\u0027s cut off initially so the RCS subsystem doesn\u0027t use it during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-No power generation on the orbiter other than the SSME\u0027s alternators (useless in space), so the mission time is constrained by that unless you dock to a station. That is an intentional feature, yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It glides just like the real thing: not very well. Though you have adequate crossrange to line up the runway, you\u0027d better come out of reentry with KSC in sight, and the stable gliding speed is just not survivable on touchdown: you \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to save some energy and flare up at the last second to bring the descent speed under a safe 5m/s for the touchdown. And careful with high angles of attack, you can perfectly fine stall it to death on the final approach (ok, I know it\u0027s not a true stall because KSP aerodynamics, but it looks like one).

It\u0027s very difficult to explain because I mostly do it by gut feeling and practice, but it involves a lot of roll control while bringing the nose close to prograde. You can maintain about 20-30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA degrees of angle of attack over your velocity vector before you loose it completely (emptying all fuel tanks except the one on the cockpit helps). That behaviour, BTW, is inherent from the configuration of the shuttle, that low wing with no dihedral is just unstable by nature, and the big stabilizer can only help so much without creating its own issues, being so far back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe really interesting thing comes after you are on a steep and stable glide slope: there\u0027s not really enough wing to glide, so at most you fall with style (the prograde vector will be in the brown the whole way down). And if you arrest your vertical speed to under 10m/s, something only possible at about sea level BTW, the horizontal speed drops and you start falling again. So the flare the real shuttle has to do to touch down at a safe vertical speed after saving some kinetic energy to pull that off? That is \u003Cem\u003Erequired\u003C/em\u003E, besides a sea level landing to get the highest atmospheric density possible. Basically, keep her falling at about 70m/s, and pull up at the last second to turn some of that energy into vertical deceleration and bring vertical speed to just below 5m/s just before landing. Takes a bit of practice, but it\u0027s totally doable, and a good learning experience.

That one will do the same thing, with only 30 more parts (lots of intakes!), a third of GLOW, and 100% recovery and much less hassle the whole way. \u003Cem\u003EThis is not meant to be practical\u003C/em\u003E. It took a lot of trial and error to get a glider that could be landed, but only just. In case you want to try things again, initial height shouldn\u0027t have much to do with it: with empty tanks and no payload, let her fall with the nose 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA below the horizon. The slope will progressively become less steep as the wings bite into denser air, and you will end up at about 70-80m/s (surface) with a vertical speed of about 20-30m/s by the time you reach sea level. As I said, totally not survivable. But during the last tens of meters (the window to do that is about a couple seconds long), you can pull up like there is no tomorrow (ok, if you go much over 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA you will lose control, but as much as you dare), and you will exchange about 10m/s in forwards velocity for the energy required to get vertical speed under 10m/s. Note that if you do that 5 seconds or more before you hit the ground, your speed will fall too much, and you will again increase your vertical speed and pancake on the runway. But thanks for the suggestions anyway! It seems I will have to do that \u0022easy mode version\u0022 after all. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
