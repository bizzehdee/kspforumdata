You can find the screenshots in your Kerbal Space Program/Screenshots folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo post pics, you have to have it uploaded. I recommend Imgur, which is free and awesome! \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have it uploaded, you can post it to the forums by copying the \u003Cstrong\u003Edirect link\u003C/strong\u003E, then when creating a thread, or a reply, look at the tools at the top of the typing box. You should see a picture icon.

It took me a minute to work out how you were even going to get all the wheels oriented in a sane manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first difficulty you\u0027re going to have is getting it on a rocket without making the assembly unbalanced. This is just a matter of finding a place where you can attach a stack decoupler and have it lined up perfectly with the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next problem is going to be lowering it to the surface of the Mun. Since there\u0027s no good place to add fuel tanks and rockets to the rover itself, you might consider using a skycrane. (I see you already have some fuel and rockets, but it doesn\u0027t look like enough to land with, even if they were oriented correctly.) Of course you would have to find a spot to attach a docking node or stack decoupler, and again, it would have to be lined up with the center of mass. You could conceivably launch it with the skycrane already attached by attaching the top of the skycrane to a rocket. That way you only have to balance it around one coupling point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option would be to attach it to the side of another lander of whatever sort you like, with either another of the same rover, or some other payload on the other side to act as a counterweight - the whole thing still has to be balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly though, I would try designing a new rover, keeping these constraints in mind from the beginning. Having a rover that\u0027s symmetrical makes it much easier to find attachment points for both lifting from Kerbin and dropping on the Mun. Integrating landing rockets into the rover itself is optional, but in my experience makes things much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cayote","CreatedById":80011,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T04:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the ideas Wolverine. I\u0027m not sure what the whole \u0022Troll\u0022 comment was about. Just got the game and am playing around, looking for ideas etc. This rover is just my first try. I see what you mean by balance and landing etc. My idea is to have a rover to refuel the few landers I have stranded at various points on the Mun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E This one is very steady (at least on Kerbin) once the wheels are extended into position. I even had it where the whole rover folded in half, making it more compact and easier to balance but it looked wrong (clipping) and there was no room for docking ports or anything. Anyway, thanks again. I\u0027ll keep trying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
