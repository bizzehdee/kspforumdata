The rocket is very simple: an SAS atop the pod, with 8 RCS modules on it; below the pod, a standard RCS tank (better fuel to weight ratio than the service module) with four lander legs on it. To fly, simply toggle SAS on, toggle RCS on, and use the translational controls. The SAS counteracts any torque from the RCS, so you can basically fly wherever. Tilt your camera down a bit and it becomes very easy to land on any of the objects around the launchpad. There is just enough gas to reach the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy stacking RCS tanks and adding more RCS modules below the command pod, you can greatly increase the range.
