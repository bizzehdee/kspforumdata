are included out of the box and it cannot reach stable orbit with all 10 pods and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E system is extremely weak (and useless on anything with heavier gravity then the Mun).\u00A0 It is designed purely for deploying vehicles as it will allow the craft to maintain a certain altitude when flying below orbital velocity.\u00A0 While its possible to deploy makos out of it without the system, using it creates acceleration that gives the wheels traction (so the vehicle just drives right out of the bay).\u00A0 Im going to make a new mako since the one i used initially sucked (placeholder just to show proof of concept), will have that uploaded soon (and if i can get it to work a version of the SR-1 that can \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E with a mako loaded inside it since the thing barely makes orbit as is).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft uses a trick with cargo bays to disable drag on the entire interior.\u00A0 This blocks access to the interior (and will often spagettify kerbals if it isnt opened and you try to EVA one inside of the ship), so you have been warned, make sure to hit [4] after reaching orbit and before you start interacting with the ship in any way (close this whenever you are in atmo).\u00A0 It also makes the top look better (more rounded as the actual SR-1 had).\u00A0 Also, the craft features \u0022windows\u0022 on the front and back in the form of elevators that block the view when they are deployed as flaps.\u00A0 This is bound to brakes (and doubles up as a airbrake that cannot be used while in flight but works on the ground very well) so toggle that if you want open or closed windows.\u00A0 Its not 100% authentic that the briefing room had windows at all (placed there for aerodynamic purposes), but if you want to go ahead and open them for a nice view to the rear (may help spot collectors before they start shooting).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeapons are fairly lousy and are mostly there just because the original craft had weapons, and they are actually located in a similar spot the original ship had its guns.\u00A0 Fired via stage and can be aimed manually using the weapons control room (cockpit in there that gives you a forward view past the guns so just have the target ship directly in front of you while you fire).\u00A0 If you want to use this for combat i suggest adding some sort of small guided missiles into the escape pod bays (plenty of 0.6m hardpoints and you can still carry a few escape pods).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Elhiz5J.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/Elhiz5J.png\u0022
