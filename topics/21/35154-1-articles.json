Christened the Defiance MK I, it is capable of reaching Low Kerbin Orbit (LKO) without jettisoning expensive engines or fuel tanks. The entire craft is reusable, and is capable of gliding back to KSC. Further development will be done to ensure that the Mark II is capable of docking with a refuelling station. The space program has finally achieved SSTO flight after several months of development. Test pilot, Jebediah Kerman is well and healthy. We congratulate him on bringing the Defiance back home. Well done, men!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b7xwn2N.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/b7xwn2N.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor more pictures, I have a page here photos of previous missions: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.facebook.com/kerbalspaceprogramfanpage?fref=ts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.facebook.com/kerbalspaceprogramfanpage?fref=ts\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI forgot how to use the forums after I stopped frequenting the forums since the forum wipe...
