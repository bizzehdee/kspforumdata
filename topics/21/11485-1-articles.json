The [previous version](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9656.0) only had Mun bases, but with the addition of Minmus and aircraft engines, it makes sense to have bases on all three landable bodies. Please read the rules and the how to request a flight section!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1. All flights must be flown with the latest KSP build, Presently KSP 0.15.2, and all current required mods. If your computer can\\\u0027t handle the full set of mods, TheCardinal has offered to help build limited mod sets to let you still fly - PM him when your turn comes up.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. All flights must be requested in advance, to be added to the upcoming flight List. You need to specify landing site details:\n\u003E \n\u003E  - If you plan to add to a craft one of the existing bases, specify which base your flight is planned for.\n\u003E \n\u003E  - If there is no base yet on your target planet/moon, or if the existing base already has at least 5 craft landed there, you can specify \u0027new \u003Cplanet moon=\u0022\u0022\u003E base.\u0027 Land at a location of your choice, and provide the name for the new base when you post your save. Exceptions to the 5 craft rule can be made if a landing site is too hard or too laggy before there 5 craft there.\u003C/planet\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  - Instead of launching a new craft you can plan to move one of your existing ones from one base to another. Specify \u0027\u003Cbase name=\u0022\u0022\u003E to \u003Cbase name=\u0022\u0022\u003E transfer\u0027 on your flight request.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. I\\\u0027ll send you a PM and post in the thread when it\\\u0027s your turn to go. If you see that the person before you in the queue has posted their save file and I haven\\\u0027t gotten the notice out to you yet, definitely go ahead and start your mission!\n\u003E \n\u003E 4. At the end of your flight please post your persistent.sfs file as well a picture of the base.\n\u003E \n\u003E 5. Each person can add one mod on their turn, but doesn\\\u0027t have to. If you added one, post the name of the mod and a link to the forum thread for it in your after-flight post.\n\u003E \n\u003E 6. If you do not post a file within 48 hours, you are removed from the list and must request a new entry.\n\u003E \n\u003E 6a. If you warn me ahead of time and ask to put your turn on hold for up to 48 hours if it comes up, I\\\u0027ll just keep bumping you down instead of waiting for you to fly when you\\\u0027re not available.\n\u003E \n\u003E 7. If you screw up, you can try again in the same turn.\n\u003E \n\u003E 8. Have Fun!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sign me up for a flight.\n\u003E \n\u003E Destination base: Base name from the list below.\n\u003E \n\u003E Planned additional mod: Optional, doesn\\\u0027t have to be announced, but it has to be a SINGLE mod that you will add, in addition to being able to use the mods that were added before your flight.\n\u003E \n\u003E Current allowed bases:\n\u003E \n\u003E Lake of Broken Landers (Minmus)\n\u003E \n\u003E Thrionian Cloria I Base (Mun)\n\u003E \n\u003E Aluminium Oxide Base (Mun)\n\u003E \n\u003E Lake Kostok Base (Kerbin)\n\u003E \n\u003E Thrionian Cloria 1a, Planitia Livens (Minmus)\n\u003E \n\u003E Aspiration Base (Mun)\n\nThe goal isn\\\u0027t to have everyone put things where ever they like and just have a shared save file. You can do that with the Kessler software, or in another thread, not here.\n\nThe goal isn\\\u0027t for everyone to set up their own Mun or Minmus base with twenty of their own rovers, a sauna, and a jukebox. You can do that without anyone else around.\n\nThe goal is to build a set of Community Bases. Where there\\\u0027s only a few bases, and each player adds their own special something to one of the bases one at a time. It ends up being a glorious mess of player A\\\u0027s little lander because he just wants to add something, player B\\\u0027s big fuel depot, player C\\\u0027s entire french cathedral made entirely out of wing parts, player D\\\u0027s rocket-propelled fighter plane, etc. When player E comes in for a landing he should be having to find a place to land among or just outside stuff added gradually over time by other players.\n\nI\\\u0027m kicking things off with a first base on Minmus, and Carts for the first plugin.

If you get any message about a vessel not being loaded because of missing parts, you\\\u0027re missing one of the previously used mods.\n\n- make sure your craft doesn\\\u0027t use any parts other than the ones in those mods and the one you\\\u0027re adding. (The simplest way to do this is to use a separate install of KSP for the community flights, with only the appropriate mods installed.)\n\n- fly your flight.\n\n- if you\\\u0027re landing a rover, put on the handbrakes to keep it from rolling away when someone else lands (B key). If you\\\u0027re landing a plane you may have to retract the landing gear, or just accept the fact that it will roll away during future landings by others.\n\n- Make a post in this thread with the persistence file as an attachment, a link to the forum thread for the mod you\\\u0027ve added, and a screenshot showing all craft that have landed at the current base, not just yours.\n\nIf you are defining a new landing site on your turn, after landing I recommend that you submit it as a place name to the [Kerbin Geographic Society](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=11388.0) thread over in General Discussion.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Carts 1.32](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8431.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E [NovaPunch 1.2beta](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=4180.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E [BACE 3.1](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13912.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E [MechJeb 1.8.4](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8021.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E [SUNBEAM Laser 2.1](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=6452.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Thunderbird 3](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9068.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Probodobyne DIY kit v0.5](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13912.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E [BigTrak v.23](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9404.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Mobile Spaceport v1.1](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13837.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E [ExPI v0.3.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=6729.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E [IFE v1.4.2](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=3684.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E [C7\\\u0027s old mod pack](https://www47.zippyshare.com/v/68572965/file.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T06:52:41Z","Content":"I wouldn\\\u0027t mind putting something at the 2nd KSC, maybe something with wings, but I won\\\u0027t have much time over the next few days, so if it\\\u0027s ok can you place me in slot 3 on the flight list?"},{"CreatedByName":"Candre","CreatedById":15181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T07:10:18Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ll try to get some rovers down on the Lake of Broken Landers on Minmus.
