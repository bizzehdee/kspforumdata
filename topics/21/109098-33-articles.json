However that\u0027s the \\*science\\* of it.  What you really need to know is the \\*engineering\\* perspective of it.  Here\u0027s the quick guide to FAR plane design:  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Go into the FAR menu in SPH and open the static analysis.  Click \u0027run analysis\u0027 and make sure there are no red numbers at 0.35 and 1.35 mach.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2. Lower the 0.35 until red numbers appear.  Never go below this mach # when flying.  (make sure to have the FAR window open in flight - also set your airspeed indication to indicated knots EAS.   This is what real aircraft use and is critical to knowing how much lift you\u0027re getting.  Your surface speed is pretty much irrelevant when you want to know your V speeds and stall speeds).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Now open the transonic design.  click the middle radio button for the yellow line.  The flatter it is the less mach buffeting you will get in the transonic zone (0.80 to 1.20 mach), and the less likely you are to have serious aerodynamic issues at high speed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4. Are you using adjustable landing gear?  If not get it immediately.  This part isn\u0027t really FAR related but if you can\u0027t get the plane off the runway, FAR doesn\u0027t matter.  Use adjustable landing gear and never touch stock gear again.  ALG gives you an alignment indicator.  Make sure your wheels are not aligned to point away from the craft centerline.  If they are, use the rotation tool to fix that - about 1 degree of \u0022toe in\u0022 towards the centerline will make the craft stable on the runway.  This does not apply to the nose gear.  Leave that alone as far as rotational alignment, but make sure it\u0027s shorter than the mains - you want 1 to 5 degrees of pitch down when sitting on the runway.  Set your spring and dampers to almost max on all gear.  Set main gear brake torque to between 60-100 depending on craft weight, and set the brake torque on the nose wheel to half of what you\u0027ve set on the mains.  Turn shielding on for all gear.  Now FAR is relevant because you won\u0027t crash on takeoff or on your landing rollout ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E 5. Use the FAR yaw stability helper when flying in atmosphere, even if you\u0027re using an autopilot.  This is like the yaw damper on real jets.  It helps.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6. Mechjeb even with the FAR helper module is not that great.  Kramax autopilot is a million times better than mechjeb for flying within atmosphere.  It is however completely useless in space, so I use both MJ2 and Kramax.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7. Kramax likes triangle shaped planes.  It can\u0027t follow a glideslope worth a \\*\\*\\*\\* if you have a plane with horizontal stabilizers and wings placed like on a commercial airliner.  Especially if you 1. have flaps and 2. use the flaps.  So you may need to control pitch yourself unless you have a triangle shaped plane (like the US space shuttle, with no independent elevators).  \n\u003E   \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Follow the above tips and you too can have a fun and stable SSTO spaceplane that can land safely back on the KSC runway.  I also recommend KSP Interstellar Extended, because who \\*doesn\u0027t\\* like antimatter-powered thermonuclear hybrid turbojet/rocket engines giving you 80k dV in a Mark3 spaceplane?  I know I do ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s a picture of one of my most successful designs.  This shape works well, and at about 25% fuel has a stall speed well under 200kts EAS, making it easy to land.  It\u0027s also got ATILLA arcjet VTOL engines with enough thrust to do a VTOL landing \\*anywhere\\*, even Eve.  The engines are also from KSPIE.  If you make a spaceplane using this layout (modify to suit), you\u0027ll have good results aerodynamically.\n\u003E \n\n1. I\u0027ve run into problems at different speeds in the past. One layout for my planes would reliably cause significantly lower stability at exactly 0.9M (\u002B-0.05M or so). So I calculate at stall-speed (see 2.) and just above, 0.9M, and in 0.1 steps to about 1.5M, and/or whatever top speed it\u0027s designed for.\n\n2. That\u0027s stall speed - don\u0027t check when red numbers appear, but check when the AoA is *exactly* 0 (or \u003E0 or something, no longer XX.whatever AoA). If red numbers appear earlier check which numbers are red - some make the plane unflyable, some hard to fly, some don\u0027t seem to do much at all. Having the plane get unstable just below intendet landing speed can ruin your day pretty good, so avoid that.\n\n4. You can set rotation mode to absolute (some key like \u0022F\u0022, I forgot), and with angle snap can be used to help aligning. Also, nose down when on the runway depends on how the plane is intendet to take off. I usually aim for just barely above 0 AoA (yes, for spaceplanes as well). Also test if you can use full breaks at the highest speed on the runway (may cause significant craft wobble, although I haven\u0027t tried the 1\u00B0 toe-in yet). And I can usually set nose gear break torque a good bit higher than half the main gear\u0027s torque.\n\n5. Needs to be set-up properly though. Ran into problems with it in the past. Works great for artificial stability though."},{"CreatedByName":"Paul_Sawyer","CreatedById":152646,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T11:34:35Z","Content":"I think this is the most beautiful spaceplane I\u0027ve built so far  \n![urX5or9.png](http://i.imgur.com/urX5or9.png)\n\n![BdDMFrQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/BdDMFrQ.png)\n\n![xkfx5DZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/xkfx5DZ.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T01:38:49Z","Content":"The Beluga.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/JBAbx/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIts 800 tons and it flies. Amazingly. Landing however is impossibly difficult. Apprach and landing speeds are too high and I cannot bring the plane to a stop after touchdown. I need to be able to fly at slower speeds here. So flaps and spoilers I imagine are the key. The ones I have now just either rip off the plane or just act more as airbrakes then anything. So as far as placement and size goes whats a good place to start? I notice in real pictures most flaps are placed on the rear of the wings. I cannot do this because If I put flaps so far behind my CoM the craft just dive bombs. So I need to put them onto the CoM or atleast I think.\n\nThe tail pitch control is also an issue. That is an all-moving B9proc part. I cannot make a regular aileron large enough. That thing works, but it flexes hard which I cant imagine helps with controllability. So if anyone knows any larger ( like really large ) ailerons I can get that\u0027d help. Other then that... is there anything here that is just a big red flag?
