Launching this torus was way more finicky that it needed to be. It was way too top-heavy, and as you can see, most of the drag was up there too.\n\nNormally, for a payload like this, I would have stuck the boosters to the sides instead of underneath.

The key, I figured, was to design a launcher that carried the torus nearer the bottom than the top, so it acted to stabilize the whole thing rather than destabilize it. There were other keys, as it turned out, such as getting the boosters to not collide with the core on separation, making sure each stage had ample TWR, making sure the whole thing had enough delta-v to get to orbit, and adding enough struts so it didn\u0027t fall apart on the launch pad. \n\n![DpipSzh.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/DpipSzh.jpg?1)\n\nThis one is the Mark IVB.
