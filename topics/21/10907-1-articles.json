Don\\\u0027t pull too hard on the stick. And save the third stage for landing.)"},{"CreatedByName":"dafrandle","CreatedById":13663,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T14:24:32Z","Content":"how did you swich engines"},{"CreatedByName":"Klopchuck","CreatedById":13421,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T19:27:26Z","Content":"I\\\u0027m away from the computer for the weekend, but I recall from memory that once an engine is activated via staging, you can right-click on the engine (center of screen, not the icon in the staging diagram) to make appear a small control-window. There is a green rectangle in the window that can be left-clicked to deactivate (or re-activate) the engine. If the engine is part of a group within a stage, this toggle affects all of the same engines. In other words, you only have to do this one one side of the dropship, not both sides. \n\nBTW, I forgot where I found this feature documented; I do recall thinking, \u0027the should do a better job of communicating changes to the interface\u0027."},{"CreatedByName":"anyname121","CreatedById":42022,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-18T20:06:37Z","Content":"please could you put a screenshot or two showing how to build this?
