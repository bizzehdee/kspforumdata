Here are the pictures that I snapped of the flight. Took another flight to test out the profile and it worked once more, this craft is Capable of reaching Mun without refueling, BUT CAN NOT make the return trip as it will run out of fuel before getting close to Kerban. Did not attempt landing on mun due to lack of VTOL capabilities and skill at landing space plane based craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/wxlwg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I did have to move fuel from the larger tank into the smaller two mid-climb. But any fuel balance mod can do that for you, or can add in fuel lines to do for you, but be careful as the fuel in the rear tanks only will unbalance the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace port link, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/ssi-midget-beta-i-type-1-shuttlecraft-11/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/ssi-midget-beta-i-type-1-shuttlecraft-11/\u003C/a\u003E Both craft are downloadable via zip file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://sdrv.ms/1dlpWch\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMiget Beta 1 100% stock version\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://sdrv.ms/1dlpOto\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMiget Beta 1 (mechjeb version)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T21:45:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it can go to the Mun, can it roundtrip Minmus?
