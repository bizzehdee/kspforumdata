The whole reason KSP lags so much is that it only ever uses a fraction of your CPU. Now with the upgrade KSP\u0027s performance will be based more on your computer\u0027s power than the code of the game itself. You really can\u0027t do all that much with only 300 parts in KSP.\u003Cp\u003EUnity 5\u0027s ability to have your CPU work at it\u0027s real potential is why everyone is so excited about it.
