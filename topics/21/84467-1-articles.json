I\u0027M BACK!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always loved toying around with Eve missions, because Eve presents one of the most difficult places to send a Kerbal, and get him home safely. It\u0027s not all that difficult to build large asparagus-staged Landers that can land anywhere and get back into orbit, but with the cost of them often being REALLY large, and REALLY heavy. I thought I would try for a very lightweight vehicle, that I could land at Eve\u0027s highest peak (7,540m) where the Delta-V required to achieve orbit is about 30% less than when launching from sea level. This 30% difference makes a HUGE difference, as I\u0027m able to cut down the size and mass of the lander by over 80%, especially when using a command seat for the kerbal instead of a lander can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difficulty of this mission is quite clearly actually managing to put the lander down on Eve\u0027s highest peak. I first considered using a Rover/Lander, similar to Scott Manley\u0027s \u0022Eve or Bust\u0022 vehicle that could be landed in the vicinity of the mountian from orbit, and then driven up the mountian to the peak. I decided to rule this out, because I wanted to do something different, and perhaps more interesting. I decided to go with a glider with the lander built in, that could be dropped in from orbit, flown to the peak of the mountian, and then the lander could be dropped away to make the final landing with parachutes. This idea worked out quite well, as the initial trajectory into Eve\u0027s atmosphere could be off target by as far as 50 Km, because the Glider/Lander has sufficient range to reach the mountian by gliding alone. The only advantage to using the Rover/Lander concept is that you could land practically anywhere, but who really wants to spend an eternity driving over purple dunes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m obviously using some mods, mostly visual enhancements, but the only part related mod is Kerbal Engineer, so I still consider this to be Stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here is the full mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/DOssV#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
