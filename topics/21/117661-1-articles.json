Now that I look at it, i wish i had moved the airbrakes into the tanks a bit, but it works well nonetheless. It\u0027s a bit hard to keep the nose up at low speeds, but otherwise it doesn\u0027t fly too bad. 3 rapiers, and that top fuel tank on the back is liquid fuel only.\n\nHere\u0027s a vid of 2 versions, the first being overly simplified (and much cheaper to build), the second being pictured above. the last part of the video shows some important details for building the viper, mainly down to engine placement (geting them so COT aligns with COM) and use of building tools:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/LHheEVTW_Qk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAnd now, i have craft files available! [http://kerbalx.com/wecangameifwewantto/Viper-complex](http://kerbalx.com/wecangameifwewantto/Viper-complex) only the more complex, cool looking one, though.\n\nThe next one will be an X-wing that also functions as an SSTO with functional weapons, i also have a request for a starfury from Babylon 5, though that one probably won\u0027t be an SSTO.\n\nI hope you enjoy ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-15T20:37:49Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2015 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rufledt**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rufledt","CreatedById":115067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T17:45:32Z","Content":"New ship! this time it\u0027s an X-Wing! it works as an SSTO and has functional weapons, made using small decouplers and the seperatrons! see video below for more details and some shots of me flying/shooting things/crashing and dying! \n\nAt the end of the video i show how to make it using the advanced building tools.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/APadQnBwmGM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n![Untitled.jpg](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YMp8hz-sFws/VcObvqSanGI/AAAAAAAADa8/zOcjtmIRzs8/s813-Ic42/Untitled.jpg)\n\nThis one has less delta V when it gets into orbit than the Viper above, in part because this one doesn\u0027t have liquid tanks, only rocket fuel. you could easily replace the long front tank with a short LFO tank and a liquid fuel tank, but i like the stripe ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nyou could also probably stack more than 8 \u0027shots\u0027 on the ends of the wings and stage them to your liking.\n\nHere\u0027s the .craft file: [http://kerbalx.com/wecangameifwewantto/Xwing](http://kerbalx.com/wecangameifwewantto/Xwing)\n\nLet me know what you think and if you have any other suggestions ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Starfury is probably next, then i might start going through more star wars fighters since those look so cool! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T23:58:49Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rufledt**"},{"CreatedByName":"mrmcp1","CreatedById":79657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T17:58:52Z","Content":"Both ships look good and it good that they look good but are also functional SSTO\u0027s.
