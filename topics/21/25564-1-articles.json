So i wasted a good evening fiddling about to make a module that could disconnect from the main station, be able to spin. But still be constrained to the station by using the new rover wheels. The suspension on them really helps to dampen the oscillation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter i managed to not get it to either clip into the support frame and jam , wobble so much it exploded or just refused to budge and actually move like a centrifuge. I made it so that you can redock the spinning sections so that you dont get the time warp shennanigans where it\u0027ll move out of sync.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I was tasked to make the Space Oddessy ring. Although in the movie it is a solid station i wanted to use the centrifuge engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3bZqbrsh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223bZqbrsh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xl19V8oh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xl19V8oh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres a video of the Oddessy station spinning in both directions. You\u0027ll notice the launch clamps still attached as I cfg edited into orbit just to test if it worked. I\u0027ll be building a launcher down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has ant engines on one side and in line rcs on the other so both rings can move in either direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJQMacGbivw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis video is my initial centrifuge tester to make sure it would spin while bolted to a larger station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3aBz55kCpo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the next step would be to build an interplanetary ship with one of these rings in the centre. But the Oddessy ran up to about 850 parts alone. So it taxed my computer somewhat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my first spacecraft i\u0027ve really showcased so some feedback would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T20:10:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell done! I love it when people build cool stuff like this.

Not to comfortable for the kerbals i expect ^^.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as a cosmetic having a shielded docking port where the probe body would be would look nicer than it is currently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it isn\u0027t much trouble to copy the centrifuge mechanism to the other side too so that the ring could be central to a station or ship\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-05T22:55:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2013 10:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Echo419\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
