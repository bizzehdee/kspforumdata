Sometimes it is tricky on Kerbin, but rolling \u002B steering usually is more than enough. Solar panels on roof is rather safe option, just lose some if I flip the rover but not every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is my main rover I decided to make a VTOL dropship - Grasshopper for transporting the rover over great distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem with transporting the Foxhound was getting it to sit firmly in cargo bay. Brakes are enough for short distance, but you must be extra careful not to lose it then doing turns or pitching. Tried using landing gear it works at some degree but it is not a safe option. Sometimes the rover tries to get out the cargo bay and it might end in losing few engines or it can just tear dropship apart. Docking wasn\u0027t working good enough, plus using docking ports you use customization options for the rover. So the last thing left was Grabbing Unit and it worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To properly connect via Grabbing Unit rover must go at speed into cargo hold. The tactic I use is: Park a rover at about 50m away from dropship, aim the rover, get some speed then switch to dropship and deploy the Grabbing Unit. It doesn\u0027t work every time, but sometimes it works flawlessly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if it doesn\u0027t connect properly, try to close the Grabbing Unit and then deploy it. It gets firm grip and combined with rover brakes it is rather safe to transport the rover, ofc the best and safest way is to properly connect it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForgot to add. You must lover rear landing gear to load the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more hint if you drive the rover from high cliff and the drop is high it is better to flip the rover, so it lands on the roof. Much safer option than landing on the wheels. It works a treat on low gravity moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know Foxhound and Grasshopper have some issues, but the ones I found so far are fixed. Of course there will be more, but as it is my main rover I will upgrade it from time to time to fix the issues. I am not sure if I will release those versions unless there will be some fundamental changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the pics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/5u1SH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
