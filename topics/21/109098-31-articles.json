That last one I have since modified the design that is an old picture.  I am not even sure I still use that craft anymore, I like it but I dont use it. It was an early SSTO Fighter/Attack craft, with an internal weapons bay.   But had a limited payload in the bay, I think a max of 6 500lb bombs, or 3 CBUs.  Which isnt a great deal, so I have since retired the design and moved on to others.  I am still working on refining them but they are a secondary project at this time.

I have an Ion powered long range exploration vessel in orbit now that is waiting for a window to head out to Dres as a shake down run.  \n\nAs for the roll and sideslip problems on the cranked arrow wings, those are easily overcome by doing the V tail designs or going with a twin tail setup.  \n\n![zNGUx0j.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zNGUx0j.jpg)\n\nThe next two are my XF-149A design, which was a STOVL/VTOL fighter with a super cruise ability\n\n![pQeHdzK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pQeHdzK.jpg)\n\n![C2UO9Kk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/C2UO9Kk.jpg)\n\nThe tail went through a few redesigns over the time of its development...\n\n![9r2aFPh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9r2aFPh.jpg)\n\nThis was the final configuration for the fighter. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-20T09:59:18Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2016 09:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T16:03:02Z","Content":"\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/LS3_cJZBGj4?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/jbRx8/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nTweaked it a bit, I didnt know that the close coupled canard actually arent elevator but big lerx..\n\nDownload on kerbalX, need a couple of mods ."},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T03:19:11Z","Content":"All I did was deploy my newer.... mostly, PV-7 VTOL rescue and science aircraft.\n\n![poX8Nd0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/poX8Nd0.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T14:59:20Z","Content":"A few more tweaks later....\n\ncraft : [https://kerbalx.com/crafts/6835](https://kerbalx.com/crafts/6835)\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/2MjoeCpPyCc?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-21T15:00:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2016 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RevanCorana**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rodhern","CreatedById":144074,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T02:25:29Z","Content":"As you can probably tell I am still new to FAR.\n\nI have this simple craft.

To me they appear to be \u0027the wrong way around\u0027 in the current version.\n\nSo first thing first. Let me \u0027explain\u0027 how I see Xq (for a simple craft) and you can tell me where my chain brakes.\n\n- The initial situation is a stable forward flying craft at a positive AoA (fixed positive pitch).\n- The pitch moment is initially zero (i.e. pitch kept constant).\n- At the initial situation the craft experiences some rearward force (negative X acceleration, **X0**) from drag.\n- To calculate the derivative we must determine the X acceleration in a situation similar to the initial situation, but this time assuming the craft is subject to a small pitch up rotation motion (a persistent positive pitch rate, **q1**).\n- The new X direction acceleration, **X1**, is probably still negative, but we are only interested in the relative change anyway. That is, we want to know Xq = (**X1** - **X0**) / (**q1** - 0).\n- We might for technical reasons consider using an initial situation with a negative **q0** instead of a straight zero, but that should not interfere with any of the arguments (i.e. Xq = (**X1** - **X0**) / (**q1** - **q0**)).\n- If the pitch up rotation movement is propelling the craft forward (i.e. if the isolated effect of the rotation is fighting the drag) then Xq should show a positive number.\n- By reasons of symmetry I get the below table.\n\n| dir. of rotation vs effect | propelled forward | increased drag |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| pitch up rotation | positive Xq (\u002B) | negative Xq (-) |\n| --- | :---: | :---: |\n| pitch down rotation | negative Xq (-) | positive Xq (\u002B) |\n| --- | :---: | :---: |\n\nFirst question then is: Do the bullet points make sense, or maybe some of them are plain wrong?\n\nSecond question (in case the bullet points are valid): Does your FAR stability derivatives correspond to the above table? I don\u0027t feel mine does.\n\nB.t.w. I was wondering if there is a more comprehensive explanation of the FAR formulas than the few Wiki pages. I don\u0027t think I will be able to understand the source code. How did you, the more experienced players, learn the FAR \u0027rules\u0027?\n\nAnd just one more question.

Increases max AoA, and makes stalls less severe, but increases drag at high AoA a hell of a lot.

To reach high AoAs without stalling you need vortex lift afaIk (maybe slats would work though), which means alot of drag at high AoAs. And if you\u0027re not turning tight at 30\u00B0 AoA and high-ish speed, your wingloading definitly is high.\n\nTry increasing power to weight if your plane slows down too much, or decrease induced drag. Either way, increasing wing size almost always helps with turning.\n\nAbout the wobble: Do you have FAR pitch assist enabled? If set up wrong it can lead to problems, if set up right it might be able to prevent that.\n\nEDIT: On a related note: [5th Generation Fighter Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113795-the-5th-generation-fighter-challenge-far/).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-28T20:28:55Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2016 08:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FourGreenFields**"}]}
