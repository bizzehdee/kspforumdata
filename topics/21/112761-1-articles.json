Although mostly sidelined due to priorities of Project Raven and Project Blackbird, the Jumper Project became an another active program that required the expenses of dozens of kerbal engineers and testees, being that Blackbird Aviation at that time, was very all-new with the concept of a VTOL. This may or may not be the main reason why Blackbird Aviation started adopting foreign models again and developing it as their own.\n\nProject Jumper saw a jump with the adopted Joint Strike Fighter, from unknown origins, such that development was kickstarted after some time in the closet. Perhaps the reason why Project Jumper was given less priority is because of its origins, where Blackbird Aviation CEO did not approve of a project coming from foreign origins (despite the fact that Blackbird Aviation started in the exact same method). Nonetheless, supporters of Project Jumper continued development behind executive eyes until they were able to whip out the B-X07 Joint Strike Fighter, which when revealed to Blackbird Head Office, was instantly disapproved. \n\nIt was only that Project Jumper supporters were able to sneak the B-X07 JSF into the catalog and got a whopping success in sellouts, did the Blackbird CEO became forced to recognize the project, although half-heartedly. And when the B-X08 Joint Strike Harrier was whipped out, origins coming from an adopted model named the Joint Strike Fighter II, Blackbird Heads Office forcefully shutdown the project to prevent further hassles. But Project Jumper already made their case, the B-X07 JSF and B-X08 JSH were out, and they were surprisingly doing well for marketing demands.\n\nProject Status : **** **Rebelliously** **Active** **(Dang supporters)**\n\nProject Budget : **[uNALLOCATED]**\n\nProject Spending : ---\n\nProject Earnings : ---\n\nProject Head : **Some should-be-fired engineer**\n\nProject Priority : **NOT PRIORITIZED**\n\n* * *\n**PARTICIPATING COMPANIES**\n**Companies Collaborating**\n\n[![xNQ7yEx.png](http://i.imgur.com/xNQ7yEx.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123653-Blackbird-Aviation-LEGACY-LINEUP-PREVIEW)\n\n[![Raptor%20Aerospace%20Black%20Logo%20amp%20Letters%20TITLE%20THREAD_zps8upz3kb5.jpg](http://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q737/raptor_9000/Placeholder%20Photos/Raptor%20Aerospace%20Black%20Logo%20amp%20Letters%20TITLE%20THREAD_zps8upz3kb5.jpg)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101559-Raptor-Aerospace-SPH-Concepts-Solutions)\n\n**PARTICIPATING USERS**\n\n**Individuals Participating**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **USERNAMES**\n\u003E \n\u003E **Green** **-** **Permission Granted**\n\u003E \n\u003E **Yellow - Permission Pending**\n\u003E \n\u003E **Red - Permission Denied**\n\u003E \n\u003E **CRAFTS**\n\u003E \n\u003E **Green** **-** **Post Finished**\n\u003E \n\u003E **Yellow - Post In progress**\n\u003E \n\u003E **Red - Post Canceled**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**[NONE]**\n\n* * *\n\n**THE BLACKBOARD**\n\n**Announcements \u0026 Notices**\n\n**ARMED VERSIONS FOR PROJECT JUMPER BY KME!**\n\n(CLICK ON THE BANNER)\n\n[![GU6BQlP.png](http://i.imgur.com/GU6BQlP.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114591-Kerbal-Military-Engineering-BD-Armory?p=2019328\u0026viewfull=1#post2019328)\n\n**BY**\n\n**KERBAL MILITARY ENGINEERING**\n\n[![4Q7Y14H.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/4Q7Y14H.png?1)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114591-Kerbal-Military-Engineering-BD-Armory)\n\n* * *\n\n**THE BLACKLIST**\n\n**Model listing from**\n\n**[APEX]** **-\u003E** **[CONTENDER]** **-\u003E** **[LEGACY]**\n\n**(CLICK ON THE BANNER FOR DOWNLOADS!)**\n\n**[APEX]**\n\n**Top birds of the Niche**\n\n[!\\[LIuWqy8.png\\](http://i.imgur.com/LIuWqy8.png)!\\[GU6BQlP.png\\](http://i.imgur.com/GU6BQlP.png)](http://www./download/ay4162pc6dyk8af/PJ_-_APEX_BUNDLE.rar)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E * * *\n\u003E [![LIuWqy8.png](http://i.imgur.com/LIuWqy8.png)](http://www./download/ay4162pc6dyk8af/PJ_-_APEX_BUNDLE.rar)\n\u003E The Blackbird B-X28 Halo King is the latest in Project Jumper\u0027s lineup, and what is it? Well, what would you think of a, modular helicopter? Because that\u0027s essentially the B-X28. Capable of having modules swapped in and out from demand seems to be the new trend of engineering, and what better way to integrate such an engineering feat than with STOL/VTOLs? Not only would it look super sick, it\u0027ll also have the ability to become whatever you want it to be.\n\u003E \n\u003E The B-X28 Halo King is not the intended successor to the B-X07b and the B-X08b, for its size is quite far from the two initial models. Notably, the B-X28 Halo King is more effective for long range operations rather than ferry-distance flights, and luckily it would come with the best of crew comfort modules for those kinds of endeavors, depending on the one responsible for swapping the modules.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Intended as a long range STOL/VTOL to be used for reconnaissance and, *other things*, the B-X25 Hawker gets the job done with its fast, easy, and reliable flight \u0026 control profile. Serving as the replacement for all previous, *controversial*, legacy models, the B-X25 is capable of landing in uneven surfaces with its hepta-point landing gear set-up, and maintains air superiority at high altitudes with its super kickback turbojets. \n\nAnd the most notable of the B-X25 of course, is its aerodynamic frame. Aside from, the signature jump jet, having cues from Project Infinity brings the B-X25 with a full 360\\* wide visor for maximum visibility (that comes in handy for most VTOLs) as well as streamlined light plating around its body, for withstanding things. The easy-peasy controls of the B-X25 are also a main feature, so you can go grab a Hawker and show off to your friends your mad VTOL skills. Blackbird Aviation does not have responsibility over any damages done under this aircraft.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I see some of your designs have the J-X4 \u0022Whiplash\u0022 engine for lift. I considered them, but nothing I\u0027ve built so far needed that much \u0022oomph\u0022, lol ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nWell, the B-X07b \u0026 the B-X08b don\u0027t really need that much \u0022oomph\u0022, the airbrakes are just for stability comfort ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) It can very well land safety without the use of the brakes, but the B-X28? Well, that\u0027s where the airbrakes become quite necessary ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:55:12Z","Content":"**DOWNLOADS**\n\n**CLICK ON THE LABELS FOR DOWNLOADS**\n\n* * *\n\n**PROJECT JUMPER**\n\n[**APEX BUNDLE**](http://www./download/ay4162pc6dyk8af/PJ_-_APEX_BUNDLE.rar)\n\n**What you get:**\n\n![LIuWqy8.png](http://i.imgur.com/LIuWqy8.png)\n\n![GU6BQlP.png](http://i.imgur.com/GU6BQlP.png)\n\n* * *\n\n**PROJECT JUMPER**\n\n[**CONTENDER BUNDLE**](http://www./download/2zretnto3rr0rur/PJ_-_CONTENDER_BUNDLE.rar)\n\n**What you get:**\n\n![1xi7hyX.png](http://i.imgur.com/1xi7hyX.png)\n\n![T2Kcuim.png](http://i.imgur.com/T2Kcuim.png)\n\n* * *\n\n**PROJECT JUMPER**\n\n[**LEGACY BUNDLE**](http://www./download/arr325rf954l7pd/PJ_-_LEGACY_BUNDLE.zip)\n\n**What you get:**\n\n![UTUnnFu.png](http://i.imgur.com/UTUnnFu.png)\n\n![dgivWXl.png](http://i.imgur.com/dgivWXl.png)\n\n* * *"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T14:22:13Z","Content":"NEW ARMED VERSIONS FOR PROJECT JUMPER!\n\n(CLICK ON THE BANNER)\n\n[![GU6BQlP.png](http://i.imgur.com/GU6BQlP.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114591-Kerbal-Military-Engineering-BD-Armory?p=2019328\u0026viewfull=1#post2019328)\n\n**BY**\n\n**KERBAL MILITARY ENGINEERING**\n\n[![4Q7Y14H.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/4Q7Y14H.png?1)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114591-Kerbal-Military-Engineering-BD-Armory)"}]}
