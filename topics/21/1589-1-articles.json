Having to use solid motors instead of the nice inline-three couplers added SO MUCH extra weight, and so much pointless extra thrust when you need it the least. But I made it, because it makes deorbiting much simpler -- two engines on either side of a center core means you can deploy the middle something without leaving your engines in orbit too, and maybe even have fuel left over to deorbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://burningsmell.org/images/dualfork1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dualfork1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://burningsmell.org/images/dualfork2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dualfork2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re probably noticing the lack of a satellite.

The bottom solids get it high enough above ground that the main engines can actually lift it. Don\u0027t let the main engines push it faster than 120m/s until you exceed 12,000m, then accelerate as fast as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fins are not decorative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://burningsmell.org/images/dualfork3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dualfork3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://burningsmell.org/images/dualfork4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dualfork4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to make your gravity turn well inside the atmosphere, 20,000m or so, still burning the main engines. Don\u0027t bother being gentle about the turn, you don\u0027t have time, thrust at a right-angle to your current path and use all three SASes to hold yourself roughly there. You\u0027ll be out of the atmosphere quickly enough anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the second stage burns out, reduce the engines a bit, aim a little higher than a perfect right angle, and run until you\u0027ve achieved orbital velocity (2,300-ish at 42,000-ish.) You\u0027ll probably have to adjust the angle of thrust a lot to keep the velocity meter near zero. Once you\u0027ve reached orbital velocity, kill your thrust. You should have enough fuel left over to make minor adjustments into a near-circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve done so, aim yourself opposite the direction of orbit and switch stages once. The full SRB will be deployed into orbit. Then ramp up your engines again to deorbit. Once fuel runs out, switch stages again and the last remaining SRB\u0027s will deorbit you something fearsome, from \u0026gt;2000m/s to \u0026lt;900m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Asaman","CreatedById":2315,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-13T23:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDear god WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE GROUND\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-14T00:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy video card is crap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
