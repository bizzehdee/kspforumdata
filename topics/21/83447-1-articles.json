And now, here it is in KSP form!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile almost purely for show, the SPOON REST does function as a data transmission station, as well as a quality set-piece which looks impressive set up in proximity to your launch pad. The SPOON REST is the first piece in a series I\u0027ll be creating on the SA-2 GUIDELINE air defense system. Still to come will be the FAN SONG target acquisition radar, and the S-75 Dvina rocket itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA challenge I see moving forward include a way to hinge the rocket upwards for launch from its semi-fixed launch vehicle, so if you have any input I\u0027d be much obliged. Thank you for your time, I\u0027ll have a .craft save of this radar if anybody likes here in the next day or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N5syDnL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N5syDnL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sa1vi","CreatedById":112827,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T13:15:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, looks prety good!
