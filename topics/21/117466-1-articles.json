But, logic and common sense so far had dictated to me conventional aircraft wisdom was good to follow for most of my KSP career path. Until today.\n\nI\u0027m involved with a couple of major Facebook KSP groups and I often poke at mods and models in progress and see if I can lend a hand to testing them, particularly if it\u0027s someone learning to model for the first time. \n\nIt so happened the modeller I\u0027m testing parts for right now shares a common interest in \u0022planes that never flew\u0022 so I decided to screw common sense and construct a circular-winged spaceplane. Oh wait, I\u0027m up to my usual sheninigans again after dreaming about intergalactic sheep, right? \n\nWell, there actually is some sense behind wanting to use a closed wing design (i.e., annular or circular wing). You see, A Mark 3 spaceplane is not small. A normal delta planform usually has large issues with CoM shifting on the ascent phase due to fuel burn, mach effects, whatever. It also tends to have a very long takeoff roll. It\u0027s probably solvable by just throwing more control authority, thrust and wing area at the problem but I thought, why not halve the wingspan and double the wing area using a circular wing? \n\n**The result:**\n\n![FDHKmkm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FDHKmkm.jpg)\n\n**HX-1 \u0022Artemis\u0022 hypersonic airliner concept**\n\nThe HX-1 flew on its first try, and exceeded the sound barrier by several times. While CoM shifts are still present, they can be easily compensated for using manual flaps and/or trim. Insane as it sounds, it\u0027s possible to turn off SAS and let physics do its thing, as the circular wing proved to be extremely stable at both subsonic, and supersonic speeds. \n\nInitially intending to construct something like the Normandy SR-1, I was soon dissuaded from the task by issues related to its extreme dihedral and the obvious thrust issues from placing the engines so far under the fuselage. It would also require actual mass effect drives for safe landings.\n\n![yMDIOYa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yMDIOYa.jpg)\n\nTo solve the problem I just chopped off the back end of the ship and mated it with what looks like a Corellian Corvette style engine array of 8 turboramjets and 4 LVT-45s for maximum industrial light and sound effects. You know, I could also use 12x Rapiers but decided against it for the premise of gratitous afterburning effects. \n\nShe certainly would look good in Pan Am livery!\n\n![G1I609N.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/G1I609N.jpg)\n\n**Future Plans:**\n\nThe circular wings were constructed out of B9 Procedural Parts, as I didn\u0027t want to mess with multitudes of relatively small stock wing sections and having to strut them all up together. By the time I\u0027m done with tying it up to corset levels of tightness, a lot of mass would be wasted on struts. Wheras with B9 PP I could focus on designing the plane first, and keep part count and strutting at a minimum. \n\nStrutting about can be fun at certain social events, but not when there\u0027s mod parts to test! But if anyone\u0027s interested in seeing how circular wings work on a spaceplane, I\u0027d gladly replace the custom cockpit with a standard Mk3 \u0027space shuttle\u0027 unit and send a craft file your way. \n\n![TQpGHWE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TQpGHWE.jpg)\n\n**Where does the cockpit come from?**\n\nIt\u0027s from a parts mod in development, Mk3 Hypersonic by Nestor de Buen. Over the next few days he\u0027s working on texture issues, detail issues and developing an unmanned drone version of the Mk3 Hypersonic cockpit, as it will match the craft\u0027s aesthetics better. The B-36 style greenhouse cockpit is indeed inspired by the B-36. \n\nAlso, take heed, Romulans, you\u0027ll be building Warbirds this way in a few centuries!\n\n![g7VhAwL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/g7VhAwL.jpg)\n\n**Update 3 Aug:**\n\nDownload the craft file from KerbalX!

Like the real world Space Shuttle, the wing area is somewhat excessive for a craft of this size. I would have the option of making the airfoils smaller for a stock-ified build, or I could make the airframe larger and add some additional fuel and maybe even an externally-mounted payload to it.\n\nI am thinking the circular wings lends for an interesting opportunity to see if HX-1 can accomodate a dorsally mounted second stage right above its center of mass, carry that stage and payload into a sub-orbital trajectory, launch it into a higher orbit, and then recover the plane at an airbase halfway around Kerbin. It may even be possible study those very interesting [piggyback concepts](http://i.imgur.com/tyZyRKD.jpg) studied in the early days of the Shuttle program.\n\nStarting small, I will next attempt to mount one or two of my [X-1 Micro Shuttles](http://i.imgur.com/BD886th.jpg) onto the HX-1 in various \u0027parasite\u0027 configurations. I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s possible to attach them above the propulsion section above the main fuel tank. Since the X-1s can be configured to be \u0027self flying\u0027 payloads that produce their own lift, it should be quite practical once I design a streamlined \u0027docking station\u0027 for such payloads.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T16:55:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 04:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"B-STRK","CreatedById":126119,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T17:10:41Z","Content":"I think I\u0027m in love with your ship.

What kind of payload capacity does it have?\n\nCurrently, I only did airframe proofing for the craft, which involved expanding the flight envelope gradually from supersonic, hypersonic, sub-orbital and then aiming for space. Currently I managed to attain orbit with a few hundred units of spare oxidizer and enough rocket fuel to last for LKO insertion plus a short supersonic flight to the nearest airport after re-entry. \n\nHowever, I did that without carrying any RCS fuel or thrusters. \n\nAs mentioned in a previous post, it would appear the wing size for this craft is absurdly large especially considering the circular wing has doubled the effective wing area - this gives a lot of room to further develop the craft into an SSTO with a useful payload. I can develop in two areas - \n\nOne, I can simply make the main hull larger and add a Mk3 cargo bay, with more fuel (possibly extend the ramjet nacelles, add more \u0027wet\u0027 wing sections) and see how much she can bring into orbit. A larger (and possibly fatter, with conformal fuel tanks) ship of course wouldn\u0027t look as sleek but she will be more useful.\n\nTwo, I can retain the present hull configuration to serve as a baseline, 32 passenger tourist craft. I have the option of replacing the passenger modules with a cargo bay, or I can develop an aeroydnamic \u0027mission pod\u0027 to piggyback on top of the airframe, taking hints from the historical B-58 Hustler supersonic bomber which carried fuel and ordnance in an external pod.\n\n![b58_08.jpg](http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/bomber/b58/b58_08.jpg)\n\nThe piggyback method is interesting as I can use the craft to loft a payload assist module into orbit or send a parasite spacecraft or two into space. Oversized payload can easily extend into the empty space within the circular airfoil.\n\nSo the projected payload for this design is yet to be determined - considering in the video I managed to takeoff with a \u0022full\u0022 160 ton configuration with barely 1/3 of the KSC runway, I believe this design has ample room to evolve.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T18:27:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T19:50:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*gives a PM to the famous Mad Rocket Scientist to request stockification\\*\n\n![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif) Thanks!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nProblems: B9 Wings aren\u0027t generating lift.
