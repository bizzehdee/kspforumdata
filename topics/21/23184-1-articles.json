I like to play without looking up info on planets. 2)Practice aerobraking. The HOME 3m heatshield was an ideal base for this and made the overall design easy to stack atop each other with decouplers until you run out of payload. A pair of parachutes provide the possibility for this impactor to survive it\u0027s atmospheric dive and the large heatshield provides a good base for such a landing...as well as the illusion of the whole thing being it\u0027s own antennae with the extendable whip antennae.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously requires HOME and Telemachus Telemetry.
