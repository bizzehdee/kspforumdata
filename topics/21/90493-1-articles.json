I started by building the rover itself then the sky-crane then the rest of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have made one of these in the past but it was very basic, and as most people seem to do it was made from a rover body, which wasn\u0027t good enough for this replica.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to come up with a way to create a thin white part for the slim body of the real rover. I managed it with the trusty cubic strut and mirrored hard-points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to cram in a few other details like the rear antenna, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E, sample probe and camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I wanted to make the rover and sky-crane as compact as possible I had to turn part of the camera to accommodate the sky-crane arms. You will see that in the pics below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, it is a very compact unit now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that I spent many hours on testing various aeroshell fairings for the rover. I tried ailerons, they tumble in dunas atmos..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made one from backwards solar panels but the part count was too high. So I used structural panels and managed to get a shape not unlike the real version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the rocket came together nicely but the launcher was drifting. I have no idea why and anything I tried didn\u0027t work. I have largely fixed the issue now with some fiddling and swearing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find the rocket easy to fly, but as Rune said recently its tough to know if others will find it as easy. As I have launched this thing many times before its complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe landing of the Sky-crane is a bit tricky but nothing major.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo anyway, on to the pics and vid!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHere is a sequence of KVV shots showing each part of the craft.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd some shots during the mission.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI also made a video of a flown mission, nothing fancy just some dramatic music, beautiful scenes and a rover delivered to Duna.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCsEfh3RGzI?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you dont want to fly it you can DL to see how it was made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-23T01:25:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2016 01:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Majorjim\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nik_601","CreatedById":104747,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T22:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s just awesome, Majorjim!
