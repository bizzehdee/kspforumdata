It is also one of the easiest to land on the airstrip thanks to its high lift wings. And if you really want the easiest landing possible for planes in KSP, the flying wing comes with a pair of parachutes that allows the craft to practically hover in place while retaining full controls over the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/lvvzb5do2ixffgt/Flying_Wing_v2.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/lvvzb5do2ixffgt/Flying_Wing_v2.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to install:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnzip and copy the .craft file to your SPH folder (not VAB). Go to your spaceplane hangar (and not Vehicle Assembly Building) to load the plane and to take off from the airstrip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo take off, just start off the two jet engines at max throttle, and keep the flying wing running straight down the run way. Don\u0027t worry if you can\u0027t take off before you run out of the run way, as long as you are pressing down on your button to \u0027pull up\u0027 (S key for me), the plane will take off into the air just after it runs out of runway. Gears up, and let the flying begin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enote: The LV-T45 rocket engine is there for those that want speed boost or orbital flights. You will have to add a couple of parts to get it into orbit first. I\u0027ve done orbital flights by adding a decoupler to the LV-T45 engine and then building a bottom stage that can get the entire craft to orbit. I\u0027d recommend that you do this in VAB instead of SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry into atmosphere seems to make the flying wing to spin. Let the altitude drop to 10~km then start your jet engines and use controls (not SAS) to counteract the spin and you\u0027ll regain control of the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft comes with two pairs of parachutes. The stage 0 parachutes are for one of those \u0022O CRAP\u0022 moments, to save the poor pilot. The stage 1 parachutes are for hover-landing. To do hover-landing, align your plane with the airstrip, approach it at 300~500m altitude. When you are about to land, reduce throttle to 50%, deploy the two parachutes. It\u0027ll bring the plane to near stop (17~20 m/s), but you are still flying and you still have full control over the flight, so use throttles and controls accordingly to make one of the easiest plane landing ever in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESPH view:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img856/5023/9q07.png\u0022 alt=\u00229q07.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking off at night (in external command seat):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img836/7177/7wh.png\u0022 alt=\u00227wh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBarrel roll right after take off:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img268/7889/ic4i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ic4i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParachute assisted landing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img690/4695/x61i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022x61i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img836/3818/yzd8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yzd8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img341/4742/754.png\u0022 alt=\u0022754.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy launching/flying!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazurkri","CreatedById":16624,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T04:42:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome! can this be armed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stoicastronomy","CreatedById":64925,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T17:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe you can attach the smaller SRBs (not separatrons) to the delta-wing tips (decoupler \u002B SRB) and still maintain good flying characteristics.
