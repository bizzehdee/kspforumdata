Jetstream, the VTOL car of the future! (Or how it was imagined in the 70\u0027s-80\u0027s) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/jrdvlj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jrdvlj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a nimble, fairly fast, and fairly easy to control (once you get the hang of it) VTOL make with just stock parts, and several hours of trial and error, getting this thing to be balanced out just right, making sure it is controllable enough, and that it is of course, a fun thing to play with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has four standard jet engines for vertical propulsion, usually best set at 30% capacity, and a rear turbojet engine. I originally had it set at 60%, but it works fine at 100% with the addition of a second ring of reaction wheels. It also has landing legs, seven parachutes deployed with an emergency cutout by pressing 5, and utility ladders on each side. On top of that, it has a probe for remote control. It also has plenty of fuel to make good trips, I flew to the island runway and had quite a lot of fuel left over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also looks stylish with it\u0027s ram air intake at the front \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a video, somewhat long, showing it working, it was made during the process of building it, so you won\u0027t see some things on it.
