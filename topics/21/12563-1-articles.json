The initial launch begins with nine engines, and you\\\u0027ll be out of the atmosphere in 120 (smooth and stable) seconds flat. It is, in fact, possible for experienced kerbalnauts to reach Minmus with the 2 meter stage. I, not being one of them, have included two additional one meter stages as a reserve and because the rocket simply looks better that way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing has plenty of fuel if you discard your liquids when their external tanks run dry, so getting to Minmus isn\\\u0027t dependent on its (or your) location! Indeed, I have landed on it on my very first attempt after launching on an escape velocity from the opposite side of the planet. Subsequently I made two more successful landings from different orbital scenarios. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you\\\u0027re having difficulties reaching Minmus, give the MAC-II a go. Soon enough you\\\u0027ll be admiring the view like me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KSuKE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSuKE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: no RCS units are supplied with this craft. This may make orbital maneuvering frustrating for the less patient. Feel free to discard the two meter stage if this bothers you; the one meter stages will still be sufficient, and they \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E maneuverable without RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-12T09:53:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can clearly see the Down Under fairings in that.
