You\u0027ve only got 4 large batteries and solar panels are retracted. I guess you get significantly more speed from the \u0027infini-glide\u0027 bug that you get from your ion engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosarium","CreatedById":51628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T13:04:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe craft have 5 large batteries (one under the seat). i guess yes too, but i remind you that every craft are flying with the same laws so the \u0022infini-glide\u0022 is always active in the KSP physic engine even if it is not much effective on heavier craft, so... why bother?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BJ Quest","CreatedById":58716,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T19:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery Nice ultralight aircraft.

As a kid I helped my grandpa make the prop version in his garage, but he sold it engineless when we did a test and our 6\u00276\u0022 heights couldn\u0027t fit in the thing. He managed to get an RV-8 Extended fully operational and licensed before his heart attack/stroke. The 5J version would be awesome, just not much room in those designs for us tall guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosarium","CreatedById":51628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T21:56:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BJ Quest\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BJ Quest\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVery Nice ultralight aircraft.
