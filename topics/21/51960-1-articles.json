Now the geek question: wouldn\u0027t it be better to exploit Jool\u0027s gravity well for Oberth effect than Tylo for a gravity assist? Then again, even though I\u0027ve proven mathematically gravity assists, I still don\u0027t \u0022get\u0022 them, the way I intuitively get some other parts of orbital mechanics. I do know in kerbin, you are better off by not touching the moon and instead hugging the ground, but mostly because Scott proved it. Perhaps in the Joolian system the ratios work out differently?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t know, because I don\u0027t run the clock like crazy in my games (personally imposed limitation), so I\u0027ve never gotten much past a few months in my saves. Not much opportunity for interplanetary maneuvers there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

Tylo is also much more massive than the Mun. A couple of dozen m/s spent on a good Tylo intercept is all that is needed to get your solar periapsis all the way back down to the altitude of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did, in the end, fly the updated craft as linked in the OP.
