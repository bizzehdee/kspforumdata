Procedural wings is just... well, it should be stock, basically. There should be no mods that ever have to add wings, and the number in stock should be exactly 1. Probably saved me another 20-30 parts, which is kind of important given how laggy it is already at ~150.

The plane itself weighs in at about 200 tons and can readily loft about 100 tons of cargo to the station. This was a basic supply mission, to stock up all the MKS/TAC-LS raw materials. It can get a bit squirrely under power but, overall, flies pretty decently. I\u0027m looking forward to creating a new version with 0.90\u0027s better VAB/SPH tools. The real problem, I ran into here was not paying close enough attention to part count on the plane and station. When successfully docked it has to then be undocked before you leave the scene. Doing anything that would cause it to be unloaded from memory while docked would lead to it basically shattering when I switched back to it.

Assuming you\u0027re using FAR (and if you aren\u0027t, just forget the whole idea of spaceplanes), you can use its simulation window to get stability calculations for how your plane will fly at a range of speeds and altitudes. I suggest aiming for stability at 25km and mach 3.5, as this is (relatively) easy to achieve cruising altitude. If you can be stable at 25km and mach 3 or less, you are a god of design. My flight checkpoints tend to be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- mach 1 or more by 10km \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- mach 2.2 or more by 20km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- mach 3.5 or more by 25km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- hold at 25km until mach 5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- turn the nose up as sharply as is safe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- edge the throttle down, try to max out the available air until you\u0027re on the verge of losing speed again\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- kick to rockets, pull the nose up; watch for pitch/yaw/roll instability, as a lot of planes wobble at this altitude\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- at 50km (very little drag left now), point prograde and coast.
