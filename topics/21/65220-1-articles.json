Well this is a first, and after lots of tweaking it and not very hard work otherwise, this is the final product. All stock, easy to outfit with mods. It\u0027s got everything you need, and on top of requiring almost 0 fuel to get to \u0026gt;100km orbit (my minimum is typically 130) it even flies great as a plane. It has tons of RCS too. My only (slight) problem is that the center of mass is slightly below the rapiers, so when you\u0027re maneuvering in space you have to pull up a little (tapping is enough). I could probably fix it somehow but... meh. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuper maneuverable, with FAR I tweaked the control surfaces to max so it IS possible to put yourself into a flatspin if you pull back or forward too hard. But it has lots of torque and RCS power so that\u0027s easy to fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/fco529b7ap353mu/JSF-7V%28OC%29%20the%20%20Pederson.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fco529b7ap353mu/JSF-7V%28OC%29%20the%20%20Pederson.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone wants, I have many more crafts like this.
