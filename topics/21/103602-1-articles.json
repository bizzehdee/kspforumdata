If you really need to, putting infinity fuel on will allow you to abuse the RATL feature as much as you want. A hint for using this craft; make sure you make use of the interesting behavior of shutting and reactivating engines. Jet engines normally take a while to spool down, but by pressing 1 you can kill all thrust immediately. However, the engines continue to spool down in the background, meaning you can quickly reactivate it for almost the same thrust level as where you left off, meaning no spool up time! This is very helpful with landing; you can set it to full throttle and repetitively toggle the engines on and off in order to slow down your landing without the hassle of throttle lag. Also, don\u0027t forget your RATL!\n\nAction Groups: \n\n[1] Toggle the 4 jet engines. \n\n[2] Toggle the 4 rocket engines.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Incredible Maneuverability \n\n- Can carry up to 10 tons to the old run way.\n\n- Unshifting COM\n\n- High TWR (IIRC, the engines have the thrust limit on 28.... Set it on 100 and I have no doubt that you\u0027ll be easily able to fly 20 ton payloads.)\n\n- Incorporates RATL (Thanks Cupcake!!)\n\n- Great training craft \n\n- Capable of flying to the old runway and back with ease (possibly multiple times in a row, haven\u0027t really tested it.)\n\n- High Impact Tolerance \n\n- Low Part Count: 31 Parts.\n\nIt does have a little bit of part clipping, but hardly any (Two clipped in reaction wheels at the front, but the mk2 adapters have undervalued fuel storage so technically there should be some \u0027free space\u0027 in there). Nothing that uses the debug menu. This thing is also a little different from traditional VTOL Trainers; it also includes the capacity for sky-crane training and cargo transportation; the unshifting COM allows the addition of a docking port located at the bottom, and the exceptionally high TWR of the jet engines means this thing has payload capacity to boot. Up to 10 tons to the old run way, in fact! \n\nGot to admit I\u0027m pretty happy with this little thing. If you guys want I\u0027ll link in a download, last craft I uploaded got no interest so I\u0027ll only post a download if there is interest this time. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T22:07:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CitizenAerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T14:00:58Z","Content":"Delete the spaces in the imgur code, then it will work a lot better!"},{"CreatedByName":"CitizenAerospace","CreatedById":107486,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T14:03:13Z","Content":"Haha thanks, got it working now!"},{"CreatedByName":"CitizenAerospace","CreatedById":107486,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T14:49:14Z","Content":"Updated the craft, now includes better ground clearance and sky crane capabilities...."},{"CreatedByName":"CitizenAerospace","CreatedById":107486,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T05:46:12Z","Content":"Bump.

Good job on the rocket assist BTW, it does make things easier doesn\u0027t it? ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) It may be worth spacing them out a bit more though as at the moment they\u0027re going to burn holes in whatever you\u0027re hauling from the cargo port.\n\nLastly it may be worth attaching the engines to the end fuel tank, that way you can just copy the part across for the other side and you\u0027ll know it\u0027ll be perfectly balanced. Hope this helps. \n\nCupcake...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T07:32:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 07:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cupcake...**"}]}
