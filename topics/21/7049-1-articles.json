(Stock)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built this because I wanted something like the flying bedstead, or like those vtol rocket powered craft they play with in the Mojave desert, it started out with add-on parts but a stock version is better as anyone can try it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s deliberately heavy and underpowered, the idea is you\\\u0027d fly this with ASAS on, manage your thrust, tilt slightly with WASD, and practice hovering and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027ll get lighter as it\\\u0027s fuel is burned away, so you will have to keep an eye on that, and if you build up too much speed it\\\u0027ll get away from you, just take it easy and the skills you learn flying this can be taken to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, if you fly your lander like the Hopper, you can easily travel around the Mun, and with the lower gravity your fuel will last ages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe version pictured has a slightly different strut arrangement to the final craft, as I thought it might be stronger, but weighs exactly the same, also it doesn\\\u0027t have RCS, party because the gimballed engine is more than enough both on Kerbin and on the Mun, and secondly because RCS is very ineffective on Kerbin, it\\\u0027s better on the Mun but is still far weaker than the vectoring main engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying Bedstead at Wikipedia: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Bedstead\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Bedstead\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGENIE vtol rocket:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo \u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cT0GFYexSHg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Imgur gallery of the Hopper, click here to save KSP bandwidth: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/uBtPg#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/uBtPg#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded an RCS version for RCS practice, it\\\u0027s slightly heavier so either wait for some of the fuel to burn off or use the RCS to help get off the pad, as I said though, RCS is not really suitable, it may be due to a combination of atmospheric pressure and drag acting on the rig.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS controls: Use H and N for vertical thrust, and I J K L for lateral thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I have reinforced it a bit as in 0.14x4 it had a tendency to collapse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z6Dpk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Z6Dpk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hopper on the pad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsStyle_spoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022 tabindex=\u00220\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4xVZK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224xVZK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClimbing slowly, you need almost full thrust just to lift off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fWbXx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fWbXx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst stop, on the the launch tower\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UeWSk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UeWSk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI overshot the VAB and had to double back\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FUsoL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FUsoL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStop number two, landed on the VAB roof\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fLgKo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fLgKo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowering back to the launchpad, lighter now I have less fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0ReQA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220ReQA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStop number three, back on the tower as dawn breaks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/svNpy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022svNpy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust about to touchdown\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Eenaa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Eenaa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStop number four, back where I started\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exovian","CreatedById":17094,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-27T02:59:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice ship.
