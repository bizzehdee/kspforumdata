The problem is getting around the track more quickly.\n\nAcceleration helps, but we\u0027ve already got ample power and a fairly slick airframe (wave drag of 0.57 from a 3.8 cross section on the twin-engine ship). It\u0027s mostly about cornering; how do I get the tightest, fastest turns? The single-engine one can safely hold the g-meter pegged at anything up to Mach 2; the twin-engine delta is tending to peak at 10g or so, but I can probably increase that by upping the deflection on the canards a bit. Even with the g-meter pegged, the corners on the track tend to hold me to a little above Mach 1 if I don\u0027t want to run wide, with bursts of Mach 2-3 at the ends of the straights.\n\nWhat else? I\u0027m open to all suggestions, no matter how left-field. Airbrake-driven handbrake turns have been tried, but tend to lead to rapid explosive disassembly when deployed at Mach 2 in thick air. I\u0027m open to rocketry, but keep in mind that ships will reliably overheat shortly after hitting Mach 3 at this altitude (the gates must be passed below 200m).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T07:37:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"Traches","CreatedById":79229,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T15:23:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How do I make it faster?\n\nHave you trimmed as much mass as possible?

No idea how to add an album the normal way :/"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtual Flyboy","CreatedById":145842,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T17:10:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Design question: In the below craft, above Mach 1 I get a red derivative in Fwd Vel Zu saying \u0022Change in Z-direction acceleration with respect to X-direction velocity; should be negative\u0022. I\u0027ve been sliding wing parts around but haven\u0027t found any correlation that makes the number go in the right direction, and I\u0027m not even quite sure what it means. The number goes green at higher altitudes, but I\u0027m wondering what this particular derivative actually indicates behaviour-wise.\n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/i73sB](http://imgur.com/a/i73sB)\n\nThat actually sounds a bit like inertia coupling. I don\u0027t know if FAR even takes that into account.\n\nProbably not though, you have decent sized wings and your COM is pretty far up, but in any case the first thing I would try is to increase your vertical tail area. When one axis is overriding another, it\u0027s usually a good sign there is an imbalance of control between them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T18:47:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Virtual Flyboy**"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T01:54:09Z","Content":"Hi guys, I got a question about spaceplane engine choice\n\nI am wondering if 4 RAPIER are the best choice for 70-80T spaceplane under FAR.\n\nHere is mine: [http://kerbalx.com/gilflo/FAR-Avenger-3](http://kerbalx.com/gilflo/FAR-Avenger-3)\n\nI am trying to find a combination giving the best DV option with enough TWR for orbit.\n\nI need 4 turbo to be able to take off from runway, so 4 turbojets \u002B another combination of Closed cycle engine will add more weight and I need more than 0.5 TWR to make orbit from 20.000m where turbojets become inefficient.\n\nA combination of 2 turbo, 2 rapier and 2 nuclear or 2 other engines.... i am not sure that the weight added gives me more DV on final.\n\nThen once in vacuum if you want to transit on Mun you can light 2 or 4 engines, you don\u0027t get more DV, you just do it faster or lower....."}]}
