The neck will wobble like fury until there\u0027s enough air going over the front winglets to give some stability but there\u0027s some wobble every time you correct the course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you open the door you\u0027ll need to click on the tanks, front and rear, on the roof and allow fuel flow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo open the cargo bay, bring the throttle up to about the third \u0027click\u0027 and hit 9. Then quickly switch to the roof and kill the throttle. It might not go first time and this will mess with your orbit a little. If it doesn\u0027t work try tapping 9 while playing (gently) with the throttle. It should slide and lock into place fairly easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage once the door is open and the cargo is pushed out of the bay by the solid fuel motors mounted in the wing pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo close repeat the process in reverse.
