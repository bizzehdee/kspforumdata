You can do that with the Kessler software, or in another thread, not here.\n\nThe goal isn\\\u0027t for everyone to set up their own Mun or Minmus base with twenty of their own rovers, a sauna, and a jukebox. You can do that without anyone else around.\n\nThe goal is to build a set of Community Bases. Where there\\\u0027s only a few bases, and each player adds their own special something to one of the bases one at a time. It ends up being a glorious mess of player A\\\u0027s little lander because he just wants to add something, player B\\\u0027s big fuel depot, player C\\\u0027s entire french cathedral made entirely out of wing parts, player D\\\u0027s rocket-propelled fighter plane, etc. When player E comes in for a landing he should be having to find a place to land among or just outside stuff added gradually over time by other players.\n\nBecause of that goal, everyone lands one thing on their turn, at one base. Everyone lands at bases where there are already people, so that you\\\u0027re building that community - until those eixsting bases are big enough to leave some people unable to participate (lag on slower computers keeps them from ever landing near that many craft) and then we open a new one.\n\nIf it wasn\\\u0027t for the lag issue we\\\u0027d only have one base per planet.\n\nIf that\\\u0027s not what you want to participate in, I\\\u0027ve outlined above how to do what you seem to want to do.\n\nSo, Tim, you want to land at which of the bases this turn? In spite of repeatedly being asked to pick one you picked two. You might want to pick lucien\\\u0027s if you want a shared landing site with Zekes, but keep in mind his turn is well before yours since you\\\u0027re still not on the list yet.\n\nTwinky, do you want to add to lucien\\\u0027s base instead so that it will grow enough to eventually add a third mun base?\n\nHopefully this makes the concept more clear.
