I have not launched anything for awhile and trying to reuse and repurpose what I have floating in space.\n\nKlaw is an easy option to connect stuff just to refuel, but to actually use it as a joint - well, you have to me even more precise than docking aligning your angles, because ... you know ... the Kraken.\n\nI am waiting for the KAS update, because I like the fuel lines, winches and other stuff. But for Stock Klaw is the way.\n\nI will post more funny situations when I come to them. I hope you enjoyed it and had some laugh.\n\nP.S.: Is there a way to make those solid ?
