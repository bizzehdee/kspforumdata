How can anything get to orbit without a serious amount of rocket thrust? SUPER SPEED! It can easily achieve 2300ms and a altitude of 100km on Turbojets alone! Once above 70km use the LV-N Atomic Rocket Motor to circularize the orbit and do orbital maneuvers. You don\u0027t even need the 8 Rockomax 48-7s\u0027s in most cases.
