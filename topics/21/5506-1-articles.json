It is a ship that will fly 100% on rcs and only requires the jet engine to be firing to take off or if you want to travel faster over land. Pretty much with this you need precision control on and then just tilt in the direction you want to go and thrust down with rcs, careful though when you have low horizontal speed she likes to tilt her nose up. This ship is capable of dropping down from a high orbit, maintaining control the whole way and then landing softly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe AT7 is a carrier for dropship and is capable of flying at low thrust at 5k altitude all the way to kersica, and sometimes further (depending on how much fuel is burnt on take off) this ship needs care when flying and is very tail heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen releasing the dropship you need to put the carrier verticle, then put asas and rcs on, thrust down with rcs and release to the next stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/LmQQDJXi-8I?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequired packs: C7 flight pack, KW Challenger Pack, Tiberdyne aerospace shuttle asas and rcs nose modules, Novapunch pack, C7 hardlines\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-14T17:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven though it is ugly, slow, and not re-useable, it sure it kerbal!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-14T17:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt first I was like \u0027What is that?
