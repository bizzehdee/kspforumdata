This is what they came up with!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/baTnx8U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/baTnx8U.png\u0022 alt=\u0022baTnx8U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the same elegant wingform as it big cousin, the Spatha has, however, slightly worse aerodynamics qualities when unloaded (i.e: since all the fuel is in the back, it\u0027ll want to fall like a lawndart), which get negated somewhat by the interesting main engine arrangement. The central RAPIER is positioned under the centerline, offering an upwards torque that makes the vehicle behave perfectly fine while under thrust. To compensate, the Spatha has much higher fuel margins all around than the Broadsword, making it capable of accessing most medium orbits with ease, while still being able to perform a safe return to launch site under power. It is recommended to fool around with switching the central engine on and off, and into and out of airbreathing mode, to milk the most performance out of it, but by default the RAPIERS are toggled on automatic mode in case you don\u0027t want to mess with that. I usually switch the central one to manual toggle, just so it keeps on when the others go into rocket mode. Then I have them staggered, and pressing 2 to switch modes will get me the two lateral ones in airbreathing mode and the central in rocket mode. Then when I get the second flameout, two again changes it around, allowing me to milk air a bit further, then I just let the central engine flame out and switch it off because the thrust is not on the center of mass and you don\u0027t really need the extra thrust by then.... That sounds much more complicated than it actually is. Anyhow, it\u0027ll work without those shenanigans, too! And then you won\u0027t even get asymmetric thrust at any point, just a smooth if a bit less efficient climb to orbit.
