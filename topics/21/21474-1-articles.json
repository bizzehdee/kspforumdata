WAYFARE AE\u0026amp;KA is proud of its product - it laughs at the Mun, makes funny faces at Minmus, banters amicably with Duna and has a functional love-hate relationship with Jool.

It was the V-VII models of this series that first carried Kerbals to the Mun and Minmus, while the IX model (the first to be coupled with the ITG) brought Jebediah and his crew to Duna and back. After that epic achievement, the IX model served as the workhorse of the KSP fleet, later allowing that same intrepid crew to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/22683-Writing-Finally-Vall-and-Back%21-A-story\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eundertake a successful mission to Jool\u0027s moon Vall\u003C/a\u003E.
