Until now our good friends at KIRP have had to rely on our ineffectual DSHL(Dumb SHL) to do the lifting for us, and this is finally about to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was during the Development of Mun base MCEsher that project HIVE(Hyper Injection, Velocity \u0026amp; Efficiency) was initiated, after it became clear that we were pushing the limits of our DSHL, and redesigning it once more was out of the question, we were seeking to produce a lifter that could take a payload of 200 units of mass out to a distance of 200kms, we have smashed that with a payload capacity of over 300 units of mass moved out to over 200kms! (#1) or over 120 units of mass taken to Muna orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompare the 230 tanks of fuel used by our ASHL, to the 270 tanks in our DSHL, and realise that the ASHL can take double the payload further, and you can see why we have developed this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing an advanced symmetrical designed drop system, we are able to shed the weight of tanks in eight stages, with 18 tanks on the outside ring in each of the four stages and 24 tanks on the internal ring in each of four stages, whilst keeping all 61 engines firing continuously we are able to fly large payloads though the Kerbin atmosphere in as quick a time as possible, saving fuel by reducing atmospheric drag time and increasing the chance of free fireworks for all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn time for the 61 engines is an approximately 240 seconds, with 18 gimbal engines and 43 main sized ones and with a thrust out put of 11750 units, that\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s a lot of payload shifting! With winglets, plenty of SAS and RCS thrusters, this baby flies almost dead straight on a test run with out any payload, so long as your payload is symmetrical it should not impact Melissa\\\u0027s flying abilities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould you need more stability or RCS fuel(we have allowed for between 6 and 8 tanks of spare fuel to power what is on the payload) than we have room for a mix of another 24 SAS/RCS fule tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe modular design means that if the over 300 units of payload mass(120 full tanks!) that we can shift is not enough, you can remove the outer layers one group at a time for an additional 45 units of payload each time, or taking single tanks off a group of stacks for 15 units , we do however suggest you do not modify the internal ring, as it is also for structural support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperational tips are included below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStuart Kerman, President of SKRAM - bringing you tomorrows engineering problems today!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther projects from SKRAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SSLV (Super Stupid Lifting Vehicle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8354.msg121554#msg121554\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8354.msg121554#msg121554\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Faraday super light Mun return craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9729.msg144170#msg144170\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9729.msg144170#msg144170\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun Base MCEsher using DSHL(Dumb Super Heavy Lifter)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9947.msg147832#msg147832\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9947.msg147832#msg147832\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpcoming projects from SKRAM include Space station Delta and a Mun base for the community Mun base project 2.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 \u00E2\u20AC\u201C The winglets were removed from the standard model for this test, RCS thruster where fired for the full trip prograde using all RCS fuel, bringing the total distance to 206kms carrying 121 full fuel tanks and return vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperations guide for ASHL Melissa, you don\\\u0027t have to follow any of this, but be warned random bits may just fall of this ship or its payload at any point if you don\\\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) After copying the .craft file into your ships directory(please keep a raw un-alterd backup copy), please start a new session of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When building your payload onto the lifter, please do so in one session, with only saving at the end, as saving and loading seems to creep bugs into the larger ships. I always keep my master .craft file and replace the one in the ships directory for each build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Once your build is finished and saved, please restart KSP, as a note, always over strut your payload and strut it to the fuel tanks and RCS/SAS, but not to the outer two layers of tanks that get dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) It is always recommended that each flight is proceeded by a small one tank test ship, to prepare the physics engine in KSP, please take that ship out to the pad, wait for for the dials to even out, look around(enjoy the FPS you wont be seeing those again) then end the flight and return to the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) You should now be able to load and launch your ship, I always tap on the SAS and RCS and the throttle as soon as the ship loads, one tap on the throttle is enough to take it to 100% due to the lag, please wait a few seconds, you will first see the throttle move, then the SAS/RCS and its fine to start the first stage.. that can take a few seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Flight instructions: Fly dead straight up, no course alterations, no pitching no nothing, 100% throttle all the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) What if I want to alter my course?
