Read up on how delta-v is calculated and what it means, there is good stuff on the wiki, just so you understand what factors play a role. Then download the Kerbal engineer mod if you don\u0027t feel like doing the math on your own every time. it will calculate your delta-v for you as you build. Knowing how it is calculated will mean you will have a good idea of how to change the results that the engineer mod is giving you without a bunch of blind trial and error. pay attention to your thrust to weight ratio too. If your lift stage has a TWR of right around 1 that means it can barely lift itself and will struggle to get off the pad even at full throttle, shoot for 1.5 to 2. The lander above has a TWR of 7 with change, in the Mun\u0027s gravity anyway. I overdid it there because I wanted to be able to stop its deceleration quickly. It worked out well but there might be a better way to do it, I\u0027m no expert.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dyflinn432","CreatedById":32201,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T12:41:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny chance of some craft files, that habitation section looks cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wbcundiff","CreatedById":59031,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T14:02:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok, I\u0027ll see what I can do.
