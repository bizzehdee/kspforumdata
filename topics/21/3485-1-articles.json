Once you have a fairly good orbit, (make sure it\\\u0027s East, the planet\\\u0027s rotation helps this way), go around until you see the moon rise, then burn. I don\\\u0027t have a set distance or speed I bring my transer orbit up to, but if Apoapsis is atleast crossing the Mun\\\u0027s orbit a bit, you should be good. Now you have two choices: Orbit or fall to the surface. For orbit insertion at the mun, just do retrograde burns until the orbit is not so eccentric. For falling to the Mun... well, fall. This is only easily done if your orbit already goes through the mun without correction burns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor de-orbit if you made an orbit: If you want to look cool, make the orbit REALLY low, around a km, or even less. Then burn a little bit up and opposite your vector, so you\\\u0027re scrubbing horizontal velocity while at the same time making sure you don\\\u0027t crash while doing so. This is a difficult maneuver, but it\\\u0027s fun. I recommend doing this in one of the huge craters where it\\\u0027s flat and so there is more room for error. If you\\\u0027re playing it safe, just get in any old non-elliptical orbit and then burn yourself down, gradually scrubbing horizontal velocity and then slowing your descent. If you\\\u0027re using a wing leg lander, they\\\u0027re pretty tough so no need to slow to .1 m/s, but try to be atleast a bit below 10m/s. For take off, just gently throttle up, you don\\\u0027t need much to take off on the Mun. Aim your ship so that your orbital plane will be pretty close to Kerbin\\\u0027s. Get into any orbit that doesn\\\u0027t hit the ground, but don\\\u0027t worry about making it big. Go around the orbit and burn prograde so that your orbit will go roughly opposite the direction the Mun orbits Kerbin, a bit inwards towards Kerbin. Do not aim your orbit at Kerbin. Since the moon orbits, your orbit will follow that path (But will not rotate), so if you aim at Kerbin, when you get closer your trajectory will be way off and will get farther and farther off. Then just de-orbit Kerbin if your orbit is not already going into the atmosphere and then just make sure you pull the chute. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s a picture of the mun escape orbit if it\\\u0027s confusing. The arrows represent the direction your new orbit of the Mun takes you in and how they change over time, and the green is just an approximated orbit around Kerbin. As you can see it flies into the ground. If your Mun-escape orbit points right at Kerbin after the orbit moves, you\\\u0027ll be on track for hitting your target. \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
