It\u0027s weird to see how it\u0027s changed over time, as my piloting and modding skills have changed. So I\u0027ll post my thoughts here and reattach the ships the forum move ate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMark I\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mark I was built when I felt I just \u003Cstrong\u003Ehad\u003C/strong\u003E to use solids somewhere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://burningsmell.org/images/mark1-onpad.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mark1-onpad.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeither pretty, nor efficient, nor all that flyable; look at how many SAS it has. But it orbited. If I\u0027d thought about it at the time, I probably could have saved more than enough fuel to deorbit by NOT carrying a deorbiter! Observe the Y-shaped upper stage -- the upper stage does shrink and change but the basic arrangement stays the same, since there\u0027s a sweet-spot in thrust versus time for two-engine arrangements. Also observe the SAS on the upper stage. I wasn\u0027t too confident in my flying then. The middle and outer \u0027slices\u0027 of inline solids fired at different times to avoid overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMark II\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://burningsmell.org/images/mark2-invab.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mark2-invab.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReplacing the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eliquids with solids\u003C/span\u003E solids with liquids made it almost respectable-looking, and much easier to control. The upper stage is still way bigger than sensible -- everything but the three inside engines -- but if you wanted to learn how to orbit, you could do worse than the Mark II. Plenty of room for error. Also the SAS moves from the upper stage to the lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMark III\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://burningsmell.org/images/mark3-invab.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mark3-invab.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I decided to add payload to the equation and it became a behemoth again. Though the top stage diminishes, if only to make room for the satellite... See the three SASes -- it needed manual input to stay stable too. And it had a tendency to reduce the satellite to ionized particles if you weren\u0027t careful when switching stages. But it orbited, and put payload in orbit, with plenty of delta-v to spare. If you wanted something that made putting a sat in orbit simple, you could do worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is about the time I created the MTS tuned sas mod pack. So there\u0027s also a variant that substitutes the three stock SAS\u0027s for one \u0027big red\u0027 SAS. You had to add extra couplers on top of the left and right legs in place of SASes or else they\u0027d flail like a dying bug until they flew apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMark IV\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://burningsmell.org/images/mark4-invab.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mark4-invab.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I realized I could use the fork-shape to hold the satellite so you could drop the satellite without ditching the upper stage, and so not hit it by exhaust all the time. Otherwise the arrangement is unchanged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMark V\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://burningsmell.org/images/mark5-invab.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mark5-invab.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a lot of delta-V left over, so the deorbiter was redundant. Cutting it out saved a bit of weight, which let me shrink \u003Cstrong\u003Eeverything\u003C/strong\u003E and replace one liquid engine with a solid, just so it can leave the pad. The SAS moves to the upper stage again, since I\u0027m not used to flying the smaller arrangement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMark VI\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://burningsmell.org/images/mark6-invab.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mark6-invab.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solid turned out to be unnecessary given all the reduced weight. Still, the extra delta-V it gave was nice, so I wondered if there was a way to squeeze out just a little more:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMark VII\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://burningsmell.org/images/mark7-invab.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mark7-invab.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich was accomplished by moving the SAS down to the first stage again so the second doesn\u0027t have to lift it into orbit.
