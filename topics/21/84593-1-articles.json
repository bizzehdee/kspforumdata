This station has space for 29, is equipped with a single point defence laser cannon at the thin end (next to the nuclear power plant and situated so it is impossible for it to shoot any part of the station), has a redundant power plant (solar \u002B nuclear), several and expandable docking options, and full emergency deorbit/landing and recovery system (basically a pair of retro rockets on standby, currently attached to the two tugs, and chutes on all habitable modules). The second station, imaginatively dubbed \u0022Donut X3\u0022 has space for nearly 150 Kerbals, solar power and 18 shielded docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/87ePC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The one you leave on should be the one nearest the point of convergence of all three rotational axes. RCS should be OFF or, if possible, don\u0027t have any RCS installed on the station at all. The Minaret doesn\u0027t have any built-in RCS thrusters, and it\u0027s solid as a rock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"montyben101","CreatedById":74173,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T19:34:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool but the lighting makes it look like something out of a fairground \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ihtoit","CreatedById":78942,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T22:32:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah I wanted to avoid white light because my monitor has unbelievable contrast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T23:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought it was because you realized that Disco is not dead\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
