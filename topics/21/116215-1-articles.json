New Horizons is the first spacecraft to fly by Pluto. I\u0027ve put lots of detail into the replica, and while I originally had overheat problems, I was able to fix them. I believe this replica has about 1.98 TWR (Not as much as the 2.13 of the irl version!), so feel free to tweak thrust on them. The spacecraft has all the instruments. The replica is 100% scaled, which is why it is not fully fueled. While I have 99Kns of thrust on the Centaur, you should go full thrust, because it ***greatly*** reduces gravity losses.\n\nMods Required!\n\nProcedural Fairings, Procedural Parts, and tweakscale. I also have JebediahKerman42\u0027s FreedomTex texture pack. I recommend Stock Clamshell fairings for the fairings.\n\nAlbum\n\nSome KVV shots: The first stage one has the SRB\u0027s messed up, but it doesn\u0027t happen on the pad.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
