The only weird trick I did is to attach the small intakes for the Junos with surface attachment, courtesy of Ed Tools, and fiddle a bit with the oxidizer levels on the forward tank. The trickier thing is to fly it, you have to put-put the spike up to 10,000m because it\u0026#39;s too heavy for the Junos on their own, but not too much to save dV because it only has 3.3km/s or so, then pitch up to 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA and engage the RAPIER to go the rest of the way like it was a rocket.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027More Boosters\u0027]Is that a pure rocket SSTO?
