Loaded an old design, looked at it with one year extra experience. Started over and had a working helicopter in 2 hours that was easy to control and flew ten times better than all my previous designs! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirty days later the things are pretty reliable and very powerful. I\u0027ve had engines running for hours without jamming, RUD or explosions so bad they ripped half the wing off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat new editor is fantastic!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen comes 1.0 ... first thing I\u0027m gonna do is do things with those fairings and other new parts no-one else thinks about - you\u0027ll see what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion: does anyone want piston engines? I know how to build them, we just need one little piece of software, then everyone can build them and let them run on their own power!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf your answer is yes, then look in the Proximity Sensor topic in my sig and leave a post in there, please.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have designs ready for the following: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7 cylinder radial, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV6 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV8 both crossplane and flatplane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlat 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlat 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlat 6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a big one.
