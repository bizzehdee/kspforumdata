I don\u0027t think it will come to that though. Also, some parts have enough heat resistance to make it through the atmosphere. And also again, some modules will keep their farings for Laythe landing.\n\nYes, part count is a major concern, and that\u0027s why we might need to make 3 or 4 ships.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Basic Habitation section.

I depends on whether you consider the ship re-usable or just a bunch of massive components that make a shake and bake colony setup.\n\nThe fairing is exactly what I had in mind, and also, these craft are not reusable. This is a CSV (Colony Set-up Vehicle) so it\u0027s not coming back.\n\nIf we tried, it could be, but it might be way to hard and have to many parts.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E i can give advices / help for animating stuff and various constructions tricks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) (i have various ideas to make deployable huge solar arrays (using my stock hinges ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)) so they can be folded into a fairing for the launch. \n\u003E now, solar panels are not going to be very useful on jool ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) (gigantor\u0027s mass versus electricity /s is worse than RTGs...)\n\u003E \n\u003E though, this kind of ship will need to be space built ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) the biggest fairings won\u0027t be able to enclose that thing for a single launch ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) (still, we\u0027ll need various reliable launch vehicle to ferry the various parts (some heavy, some oversized ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))\n\nOk, construction tricks are the best!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ok so i\u0027m proud to present my base pack! it has several modules- A living quarters module, A science lab module, A cargo module, A science rover (cargo variant) module, A science bus (cargo variant) module, A base manager module and last but not least a fully independent mining and production module. \n\u003E each module sports 4 \u0022Thud\u0022 engines (Thrust limit is 37.5 OOTB). \n\u003E \n\u003E The Kit also comes with a 2 part aeroshell (shell and nose which come with RCS and RCS thrusters) for beautiful descent through atmospheres and and a base end part for compatible builds and expansions (please make the provided probe core the root part after attaching). \n\u003E \n\u003E Please consult the craft file for specifics but AG 1 is Landing Legs, AG 2 is Gears, AG 3-4 variable and AG 5 is the engines. \n\u003E \n\u003E Assembling the base is done with the base manager module on rover wheels alone OR with gear extended(dosnt matter) and all other modules with extended wheels. \n\u003E \n\u003E [**DropBox Folder**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/be8ihjiidiu6cno/AAD0KKLB01L-fWoD_yeZE4Yba?dl=0)(feel free to add to it).\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/UWNrj](http://imgur.com/a/UWNrj)\n\nGoing through this and editing it now!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E we\u0027ll need to design a common adapter for the ship\u0027s spine - to have something capable of transmitting the thrust of the engines without having a noodly ship when we\u0027ll dock the various sections together.\n\u003E especially if we use Vernor engines (as they need a fuel source - unlike the monopropellant) - we\u0027ll need to be able to transmit the fuel along the whole spine, or have small fuel tanks at various sections of the ship.\n\u003E \n\u003E edit : here\u0027s a possibility for a engine section (with an engineer \u0027room\u0027 ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)) - the thing in the middle is a possibility for a \u0027spine\u0027 adapter design. - currently 89 parts - because of the struts needed. (also an \u0027example\u0027 of a \u0027spine\u0027 adapter - but this is bound to change - a bit too much part for such a part)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/EfwXXukl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EfwXXukl.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E note, this is the largest single section that can fit into a stock fairing for launch (and i have rebuilt my Chaos Star LV for V1.0 - it will have no problem lifting the fueled 758 tons of this engine section. - i added a central Kerbodyne S3 14400 tank for either - refuelling docked systems, or to be used as additionnal fuel for the main engines also includes 3x 2.5m RCS fuel tanks. (note, this engine block can still be stretched a bit if we need additionnal fuel tanks - my Chaos Star can lift 1000 tons in one go to LKO.)\n\u003E \n\u003E i\u0027ll try to design something for the solar arrays ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAgain, this is a great stage!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAlright, that\u0027s it, read through it and I am working on stuff now!\n\nI\u0027m so happy to see how many people are contributing!\n\nAlso guys, not to be picky, but, it\u0027s D**MS**p, not D**SM**p.\n\nAlso, no need to worry because so many people call me that ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:00:41Z","Content":"ok, i just copied badly the link ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) should work now ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)[http://www./download/rvwghk3oa841t1k/Chaos\u002BStar\u002BMK2.craft](http://www./download/rvwghk3oa841t1k/Chaos\u002BStar\u002BMK2.craft)\n\nsuprisingly, the \u0027lite\u0027 version of the Chaos star (without the most external boosters) is a pain ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) - as the first decoupling occurs at a lower altitude, the aero keeps smashing the boosters into the rocket ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) (but i wannaaa build it ! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) the \u0027lite\u0027 version is still capable of launching half the payload of the standard one...)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T19:03:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 07:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sgt\\_flyer**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:06:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ok, i just copied badly the link ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) should work now ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)[http://www./download/rvwghk3oa841t1k/Chaos\u002BStar\u002BMK2.craft](http://www./download/rvwghk3oa841t1k/Chaos\u002BStar\u002BMK2.craft)\n\nThank you!\n\nI made a giant fairing and now I need a crew habitat to go inside.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWell, I\u0027ll need a habitat with space for 100 kerbals, and under 30 parts.
