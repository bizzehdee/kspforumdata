I stripped out the old turbojets and aerospikes and installed 6 Rapier engines which have given it a much better TWR throughout the entire climb. I\u0027ve also had to wire in batteries, reaction wheels and an RTG due to the fact that electricity wasn\u0027t required back then! I also decided I wasn\u0027t at all happy with the cockpit and so ripped off the front of a Bat\u0027leth Shuttlecraft I nicked from Rune which IMO has provided a much more consistent look considering its size. Though its quite short ranged the Condor can take 3 kerbals up to a 400km orbit to dock with a station and then return them back to the KSC with a bit of liquid fuel left for the final approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you fancy you can drain the oxidiser and end up with a fast and high altitude aircraft capable of a full circumnavigation round Kerbin or Laythe which is surprisingly manoeuvrable considering its sheer size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a few changes and updated the craft file.

That\u0027s because you are looking at it from a completely different perspective! You are basically saying to treat SSTO\u0027s like rockets, not planes. And I\u0027m more of the idea that planes are planes, and rockets are rockets, and you can SSTO both of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me explain further: you can\u0027t fly on four engines (or however many), because you don\u0027t have enough wing. But you could always fly on thrust, of course, if you add more engines. That is perfectly valid, and the logical extreme is forgetting about the SPH and moving your SSTO business to the VAB. Perfectly doable, and very easy as you say, just make it get off the pad with enough rocket delta-v. But that way you are building rockets, not planes. And there\u0027s also the fact that engines have considerable weight, especially airbreathers, and wings you could consider free, mass-wise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what happens if you build a proper plane, with T/W considerably lower than 1? You need lots of wings. That makes it big. But it has much less engines than a T/W\u0026gt;1... which makes it lighter! Much, much lighter. Basically what that means is that you will always get a bigger mass fraction in a SSTO if you spam wings, not engines. Now that extra payload to space could be extra fuel (so, more range), or plain payload (so a smaller SSTO for the same job). Always consider that while the climb might be long, the extra aviation fuel you consume is probably peanuts compared to the total mass of the SSTO. And even my slowest ascents never take more than 15minutes, 10 of which I spend websurfing while I climb over 10,000,.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the other thing is rocket takeover speed. But I won\u0027t get more into that, because basically it is a function of intakes, the more you have, the faster you go, and the less rocket delta-v you need. As simple as that. So considering these points, my requirements for a winged SSTO that aspires to do more than a VTOL SSTO ever could (be it range or payload) would be about balancing these two factors: as little engines and as much wing as I can, while still being able to climb at 10,000m, and on the other hand, as many intakes as I need to get fast enough for my rocket delta-v to get me to orbit. As you can see, the less engines you take because you can use wings, and the less rocket fuel you use because of intakes, the lighter you vehicle becomes. And that means payload fraction to orbit, ultimately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, that also means that by the time you get to orbit, if you can refuel, all that airbreathing equipment becomes useless and a dead weight. But a smaller dead weight that if it was composed of engines!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should also mention how the faster you transition to rocket power the less rocket T/W you need, that is another weight saving, but it is a little besides this particular point, and I\u0027ve said it enough times. Bottom line: fast climbs to orbit come at a price, and a heavy one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
