I call it Warp speed and surprisingly it flies pretty well if you slowly power up the liquid engines on launch.\n\nParts:\n\n15 SAS modules(yes all 15 are needed)\n\n2 tri-lateral couplers \n\nquad coupler\n\n4 decouplers\n\n4 warp nacelle fuel tanks\n\n4 nacelle engines\n\n4 QS-91 stack decouplers\n\n4 FL-S200 fuel tanks\n\n4 E-600 liquid engines\n\nimages (1280x720)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/xM9sx.png](http://i.imgur.com/xM9sx.png)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/T12Oz.png](http://i.imgur.com/T12Oz.png)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/942gn.png](http://i.imgur.com/942gn.png)\n\ncraft file is below (warp speed)\n\nheres another one i came up with. though it has no name and i can\u0027t post the craft file since the game corrupted it some how. it will only load the capsule and SAS modules.. everything from the second decoupler down is missing.\n\nimages(1280x720):\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/JXez9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JXez9.jpg)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/hbLPp.png](http://i.imgur.com/hbLPp.png)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/X5c70.png](http://i.imgur.com/X5c70.png)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/jAxcC.png](http://i.imgur.com/jAxcC.png)\n\nupdate 7/29\n\nMeet, the flying surfboard.. total pain in the arse to take off with because it instantly wants to fall over, so you have to launch immediately when the count down starts. through the flight i realized that the Necelles tri coupler is broken though. the center point will always stay attached, but the second you release the first stage the outside couplers disconnect. happens with each stage release but the ship stays in one piece luckily. also the warp nacelles dual pylon\u0027s break the ability to save the ship so again there will be no craft file for this one.\n\nParts:\n\n3 warp nacelles dual pylon couplers\n\na ton of SAS modules\n\n6 nacelles fuel tank\u0027s\n\n6 nacelles engines\n\n6 QS-91 stack decouplers\n\n3 FL-S200 fuel tanks\n\n3 E-600 liquid engines\n\nImages(1280x720)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/3wyDZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3wyDZ.jpg)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/sb8kd.png](http://i.imgur.com/sb8kd.png)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/Xvn6x.png](http://i.imgur.com/Xvn6x.png)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/liJRd.png](http://i.imgur.com/liJRd.png)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/Edgri.png](http://i.imgur.com/Edgri.png)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/4kR1I.png](http://i.imgur.com/4kR1I.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"sirmonkey","CreatedById":3119,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-29T19:00:34Z","Content":"added a couple more ships.."}]}
