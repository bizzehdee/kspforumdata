This thing has been on the development track for a while, but it hasn\u0027t been until 0.23.5 that I have decided ity\u0027s enough of an improvement over the MkI that I have to release it. And with the new 3.75m parts, it looks great! It is very tight on margins (fidelity to the original and all that), and it has all the bells and whistles to perform a J-class mission, with the small rover and RTG-powered science package included! Also, it runs entirely on batteries, has an independent interstage between the S-I, S-II, and S-IVb stages, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ehas the correct number of engines for each stage, hollow service module with bays, hullage engines for stage separation, the correct number of chutes... \u003C/span\u003E ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/VqNqqZi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VqNqqZi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VqNqqZi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I went big on fidelity. The only thing I am a little irritated at not having is the CM hanging off the top of the lander and not the fairing, but doing it any other way would have jumped the part count beyond \u0022playable by potato computers\u0022, and that has always been the design philosophy behind the Phoebus series.

You will land on Mun on fumes or with an empty tank, you will have to use RCS to finish orbit insertion of the LEM upper stage, and it is heavily recommended to use the RCS to start the return burn and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E use the main tanks to increase efficiency, otherwise you might not make it. Oh, and break and park in a \u0026lt;10km orbit... easy, right?

I blame it completely on the 3.75m decoupler, that thing is buggy! I tried to stabilize it in ten different ways, and it is much better than it once was. Panels moving weirdly, gaps appearing, definitely not the way it is intended to work, as it is, the 2.5m decoupler is much more rigid. Consider the rest of the rocket has a grand total of two struts... And thinking about it, I think I can make do without it, I might try the slight redesign when I get back home this afternoon, see if it rigidizes things.
