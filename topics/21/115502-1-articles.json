I am having a very difficult time getting this spacecraft into orbit. My plan is to get it orbital, refuel it in orbit, fly to laythe land a refuel there, then fly back to kerbin with all the science! I am assuming if it can get orbital on kerbin it should be able to get orbital on Laythe. Currently I am trying to get it into orbit without a full load of fuel, since it will be refueled there. My question is, is there something I can do to reduce the drag? did I do the \u0022rapier-spike\u0022 correctly? Is it just horribly underpowered? pics as well.\n\n ![UN3IY](https://imgur.com/a/UN3IY)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/zqhpfgzz06fduuj/Aquarius%20MkIIIa.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zqhpfgzz06fduuj/Aquarius%20MkIIIa.craft?dl=0)\n\nThank you in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"BaneOfPilots","CreatedById":61884,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T21:36:34Z","Content":"Edit: Hm, I can\u0027t seem to make the album for imgur.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T21:38:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 09:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BaneOfPilots**"},{"CreatedByName":"renevatio","CreatedById":147770,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T21:42:02Z","Content":"Hopefully this workshttp://imgur.com/a/UN3IY\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/UN3IY"},{"CreatedByName":"soulreaver1981","CreatedById":38542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T23:08:31Z","Content":"pro tip go to 1.0.4 and start over."},{"CreatedByName":"renevatio","CreatedById":147770,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T04:34:19Z","Content":"Went to 1.0.4 and got within 250 m/s of orbit. Surely someone with better piloting skills should be able to make this thing orbital. Its payload isn\u0027t that much. The science, mining equipment, and utility stuff, is only about 7.5 tons; everything else is fuel, wings, rapiers, and cockpit........ \n\nAnyone up for the challenge?"}]}
