This one is stable and maneuverable, but thats expected with all the wings. The special thing about this one is, it has a hidden cargo bay, and in that cargo bay there is a big droppable bomb. Its completely hidden. No need to fuss around with clipping or parts looking through parts. What you see in the pictures is the replica with closed bays. you can toggle the bays with 1 and then drop the bomb via staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://download1503./vfk21msasrlg/qa04xdwgcv0z3bg/Sr-71\u002BBlackbird.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://download1503./vfk21msasrlg/qa04xdwgcv0z3bg/Sr-71\u002BBlackbird.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hLdDr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
