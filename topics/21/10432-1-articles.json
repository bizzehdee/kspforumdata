Allow me to present a few tried and true Mun-capable spacecraft. My design philosophy has been to create simple, stable, effective rockets with plenty of fuel margin without being terribly massive. In this, I believe I have been successful. It is my hope that these will provide newer pilots with a forgiving and controllable platform while giving the \u0027advanced beginner\u0027 a design or two to hone their skills with. Constructive criticism from the expert crowd is always welcome, too.\n\nWithout further ado, let me start with the two rockets compatible with the Demo version (0.13.3): Odin and Icarus\n\nOdin is designed around a light Lander and is therefore the smaller overall rocket. I tend to begin a slow pitchover starting at roughly 8000m, aiming to be at 45deg aroung 25000m and 25-30deg by 40000m, maintaining that pitch until desired Apoapsis is achieved. I usually follow this ascent profile for every rocket I fly. Because Odin uses it\\\u0027s lifting stage for most of the ascent, it can be a little sluggish to maneuver, putting it behind the Icarus in ease-of-use.\n\n\u003E ![OdinonLaunchpad.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Odin/OdinonLaunchpad.png)\n\n\u003E ![EstablishingOrbit.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Odin/EstablishingOrbit.png)\n\n\u003E ![Circularization.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Odin/Circularization.png)\n\n\u003E ![Landedroughly.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Odin/Landedroughly.png)\n\nIcarus is designed around a larger Lander, but is not that much bigger than Odin and even features an emergency Abort Stage that will get you home from at least Munar orbit. Surprisingly, despite being larger it\\\u0027s easier to handle. This is because the main lifting stage is separated around 14000 or 15000m, where pitch is still around 65-70deg.\n\n\u003E ![IcarusonLaunchpad.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Icarus/IcarusonLaunchpad.png)\n\n\u003E ![StageSeparation.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Icarus/StageSeparation.png)\n\n\u003E ![OrbitCircularization.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Icarus/OrbitCircularization.png)\n\n\u003E ![AlmostLanded.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Icarus/AlmostLanded.png)\n\nThe last of my rockets is only compatible with version 0.14.4\n\nMy most recent rocket design, Demeter features a relatively small lander (four half-tanks and two RCS tanks). Incorporating an Asparagus-stalk lifting Stage, it is efficient but can be difficult to handle if not oriented properly during pitchover. In order to prevent space junk, the last radial stacks should be separated before completing the circularization burn (likely with some fuel left). This will leave the central stack for finalizing the orbit, burning to Munar intercept, capture and some or most of the descent (or all if you\\\u0027re a better pilot than I am).\n\n\u003E ![OnLaunchpad.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Demeter/OnLaunchpad.png)\n\n\u003E ![OrbitalStage.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Demeter/OrbitalStage.png)\n\n\u003E ![Landed.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Demeter/Landed.png)\n\n\u003E ![ReturnedHome.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Demeter/ReturnedHome.png)\n\nFinally, I\\\u0027d like to present a spaceplane following the same design principles as that of the rockets. Using the standard C7 pack, the Peregrine Mk2 is Mun-capable and glides like a dream at any fuel level. Simply activate the ASAS at \u002B10deg when full and \u002B5deg when empty for best results. With plenty of RCS fuel and thrusters, it is even capable of VTOL with at least one full main-engine tank. I have yet to test VTOL capability under a full fuel load, though I suspect that even when full it is capable of STOL. [Edit]: I should clarify that although it glides well with a full fuel load, I wouldn\\\u0027t recommend a landing attempt with more than half. Otherwise, you\\\u0027ll have too much forward speed on touchdown for the landing gear to handle.\n\n\u003E ![InVAB.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Peregrin%20Mk2/InVAB.png)\n\n\u003E ![Ascending.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Peregrin%20Mk2/Ascending.png)\n\n\u003E ![Landed.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Peregrin%20Mk2/Landed.png)\n\n\u003E ![KerbolriseoverKSC.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Peregrin%20Mk2/KerbolriseoverKSC.png)\n\n\u003E ![FinalApproach.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Peregrin%20Mk2/FinalApproach.png)\n\n\u003E ![AllStop.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Peregrin%20Mk2/AllStop.png)\n\nAnd there you have it, folks. A huge thank you to any who took the time to read this, to Squad for making such a deep yet accessible game, and to the various board users who are the experts at orbital mechanics, maneuvers and rocketry.

As for the Peregrine, great design, but the C7 pack is horribly over-powered in space, and basically cheat parts over 30km, so that is basically the limit I set for myself with Spaceplanes. I will admit, however, that my first Mun landing was using those \u0027cheat parts\u0027 :-[. As for constructive criticism, I do see a minor flaw with the Demeter, in that the regular SAS seems a bit unnecessary, but I haven\\\u0027t flow it yet, so it might actually be necessary.

I don\\\u0027t imagine the designs are terribly unique, but KSP isn\\\u0027t exactly known for it\\\u0027s \u0027practical\u0027 approach to rocketry, except in the case of minimalist designs. ;D So, I figured it might be a good idea to have some less-extreme examples floating around. I\\\u0027ve seen a lot of different designs on the boards, so I\\\u0027m sure these bear the influence of those who are better at this than I am. \n\nThe C7 parts definitely make getting to the Mun easier, but it was interesting to descend tail first then flip over at the last minute. At first, I wasn\\\u0027t sure the RCS would be enough to the land with. As for the extra SAS unit on the Demeter, I put it there as a spacer to prevent fuel flow through the stack decoupler. First time I took her up, the tanks in the Lander Stage were dry before I realized what was happening. I thought \u0027Gee, shouldn\\\u0027t the first pair of stacks be ready to ditch by now? ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png) Oh, crap\u0027"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarmenius","CreatedById":16990,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T19:35:28Z","Content":"I have updated the Rockets for .15 (and named them \u0027Mk15\u0027 to distinguish them from ones compatible with the demo), but can\\\u0027t get an updated version of the Peregrine to work as well as I\\\u0027d like so she may need to be scrapped ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif).

It\\\u0027s the same Lander, with 7 fewer fuel tanks in the lifting stage. It will still get to the Mun and back, but the fuel margin is (obviously) a bit tighter. Even so, I dumped the final two radial stacks with a little fuel left to avoid space junk, so the margin is still comfortable.\n\n\u003E ![Anteres15onlaunchpad.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Anteres%2015/Anteres15onlaunchpad.png)\n\u003E ![Anteres15ArrivalatMun.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Anteres%2015/Anteres15ArrivalatMun.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Anteres15atArch.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Anteres%2015/Anteres15atArch.png)\n\nEnjoy"},{"CreatedByName":"Kymlaar","CreatedById":24642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T19:47:56Z","Content":"Good work. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\\\u0027ll have to give them a try when I\\\u0027m off of work today (the .15 versions).\n\nFor the Peregrine you might want to consider making some adjustments to give it an aerospike for space travel, as it\\\u0027s able to run in space it seems.

I\\\u0027ve come close to successfully converting the Peregrine, but wasn\\\u0027t quite able to achieve orbit.

It\\\u0027s no longer Mun-capable, but once in a 72km orbit, there will be at least half a tank of fuel for maneuvers plus RCS. It also glides just as well as the old version (if not better) and if I launch vertically with a SRB stage, I might be able to manage a Mun trip. Of course, I\\\u0027m not the best pilot so others will likely be able to get even more out of it without adding extra stages and whatnot.\n\n\u003E ![PostDe-OrbitBurn.png](http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/Peregrine%20Mk15b/PostDe-OrbitBurn.png)"}]}
