For the 2nd stage why only 1 engine? this is your orbital stage it needs to either finish getting you into orbit and then make your TMI for you. you want this stage to be a powerhouse as well, no need for overkill but more then 1 engine would definatly help. and if you are able to keep enough fuel past TMI this stage also saves you fuel on lunar descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good way to see if your doing it right or not is; by the time u are trying to burn into your orbit, u want to be going at least 1500m/s, minimum of at least 1k. however it is duable at slower speeds but requires more fuel to finish the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027You\\\u0027re problem is that your rocket is gigantic\u0027- haha this rocket is small on the scale that i attempt to launch, even with .16 i still make my desktop cry. but if u dont build big then why build at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purple100","CreatedById":10989,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-01T23:11:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETip: Don\\\u0027t use more than 3 tanks of fuel per engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-02T00:33:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022purple100\u0022 data-cite=\u0022purple100\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip: Don\\\u0027t use more than 3 tanks of fuel per engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, the heavier the rocket, the harder it is to take of and get into orbit.
