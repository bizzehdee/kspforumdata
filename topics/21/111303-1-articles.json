An integrated dual deck body allows for a detailed and clean look that replicates all the SU-50\u0027s defining features with less than 100 parts. This replica matches the SU-50 almost perfectly in terms of shape, capturing and recreating the swept wings and diffused cockpit.\n\n![TtLvNQT.png](http://i.imgur.com/TtLvNQT.png)\n\n![ek6DKba.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ek6DKba.jpg)\n\nif any of this interests you then [\\[](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0vnjk1on7dvd2nu/SU%2050.craft?dl=0)url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/odcpcgh1wug8ezh/SU%2050.craft?dl=0]download here\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T11:05:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 11:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by landfish2**"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:35:14Z","Content":"Looks low-part, yet accurate and eye-pleasing.\n\nGr8 b8 m8, I r8 8/8."},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:38:44Z","Content":"Nice!\n\nYou can now be called \u0022Aviator\u0022. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:05:44Z","Content":"Wow.

They end in small ore tanks followed by clipped in turbojets. The whole thing is rotated slightly so that it comes out of the fuselage like in the real plane and a tail section type A is clipped in at the top to make the joint of engine and fuselage look more like the real SU-50"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:33:03Z","Content":"I never would have thought of that.
