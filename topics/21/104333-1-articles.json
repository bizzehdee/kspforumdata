Took me 40 minutes to build, test, and fly successfully. Now, how to use this tin can.\n\n1. Use RCS on launch if you wish to rotate your shuttle\n\n2. When the SRBs run out, engage RCS and separate. The SRBs will hit each other and explode, but they do not touch the shuttle.\n\n3. When you hit the point where you start rotating forwards (around 26km) use RCS and control the shuttle with it.\n\n4. You will separate the External Tank at around 2019 m/s, and the OMS have enough fuel to circularize and de-orbit.\n\n5. When you are coming in for landing, don\u0027t pull up too hard, you WILL stall and crash (CoM drifts a little, but not too much that it\u0027s impossible to fly)\n\n6. Modify as you wish, I never was able to fit a payload in the cargo bay, but I estimate it can carry 5 tons.\n\nNOTE: If you wish to dock with a station, make sure you can get there, and refuel at the station so you can de-orbit.\n\nNo pics, no clicks\n\n [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427002322](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427002322)\n\nStill trying to figure out Imgur.\n\nEnjoy, and notify me if you experience problems."},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T20:18:51Z","Content":"Kudos on making a shuttle man!\n\n Unfortunately it is let down by that monstrosity of a nose..
