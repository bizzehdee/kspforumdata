That completely didn\u0027t work out the way I wanted it so I switched to ion engines and that ended up working surprisingly well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the Sunglider, my first Spacecraft Exchange aircraft. I\u0027m sure someone else has posted something pretty similar before, but I don\u0027t care: If/when they did, I didn\u0027t see it, and built it all by myself and it can turn 180 degrees in an astonishingly short (from my perception) distance. I can sort of keep it in a continuous loop if I start out with enough altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d intended to post the craft file, but...erm...how exactly do I do that?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/de/8d/ab/de8dab50633b207d18f5aad9fe21e558.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022de8dab50633b207d18f5aad9fe21e558.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDonby was rather happy with the thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/62/43/48/6243482577f910c2a6a354f30f1d2a4c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226243482577f910c2a6a354f30f1d2a4c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad to do the girder assembly off the back like that to keep it from tipping over when it spawned in.
