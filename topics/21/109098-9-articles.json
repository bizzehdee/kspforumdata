But as a general theme...you don\u0027t need a lot of engine if you keep your drag and mass under control.\n\nSome examples...\n\nOne jet:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

A slight stall during takeoff (particularly on canards) is fairly normal. So long as your airframe design is stable, you can generally hold a minor stall for quite a while (e.g. long enough to gain sufficient altitude that you can afford to drop the nose and clear the stall) without it being much of a problem.\n\nMaximising fuel in orbit is as much about flight profile as shipbuilding; what speed and altitude are you hitting before lighting the rockets?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, thing is, I have KJR...

Minimising your weight by removing engines and keeping same wing surface is not necessarily minimising runway length as you will get better wingload and lower take off speed but also lower TWR.....\n\nYup. The point I was getting at wasn\u0027t about reducing your takeoff run per se; it was about reducing post-takeoff (and especially post-atmospheric) mass in order to maximise fuel efficiency.\n\nReducing the number of engines will reduce your runway top speed, but it should also reduce the speed required for takeoff (by reducing wing loading). So even a seemingly large reduction of thrust often does not have as much of a negative effect on takeoff ability as might be expected.\n\nThere\u0027s nothing inherently wrong with having lots of jet thrust (look up the ***Kerbodyne Goblin*** sometime...), but I did want to make the point that it\u0027s often counterproductive, and is also much less necessary than it may appear.\n\nAs with rockets, you can go with brute force and strap on moar boosters, or you can shave your payload down, streamline and try for efficiency. They\u0027re both valid approaches. But I do realise that I\u0027m banging on about this a bit, so I\u0027ll try to leave it there.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So what is the maximum weight you can send on orbit on one Rapier and what make the difference between 2 Rapier and 2 Rapier plus one nuke?

A particularly low TWR ship (e.g. a big Mk3 with only one nuke) may require a bit of extra RAPIER thrust during circularisation, but you still want to do as much as possible of the burn on the hyper-efficient LV-N. Nukes are unnecessary and counterproductive for LKO lifters, but if you\u0027re having to do 1,000m/s\u002B \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV transfer burns after you hit orbit the isp advantage pays off heavily.\n\nMaximum weight? No idea. But the single-engine ship shown in my earlier post is comfortably within the limits; notice how much runway it has to spare. If you want to push the limits and don\u0027t care about elegance, you can always just ski-jump off the end of the runway; so long as you start climbing before you crash into the ocean, you\u0027re all good.\n\nThe top speed of an aircraft is the point at which thrust is balanced by drag; mass is irrelevant in that calculation, except for the fairly minor factor that more mass -\u003E higher wing loading -\u003E higher AoA -\u003E slightly more drag. Higher jet TWR has relatively little effect on top speed; what you gain from extra engines is primarily acceleration rather than speed. Acceleration is fun, and you need enough to enable takeoff, but if you\u0027re going for range you want to be focussing on top speed rather than acceleration.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T17:16:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 05:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T08:17:56Z","Content":"A long-range demonstrator:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It is certainly not impossible but not sane either.\n\u003E \n\u003E The question is that in theory a plane of such design would just tuck nose down without a stabilizer.\n\u003E \n\u003E In game however it has a balance point at a particular angle of attack and there is a stable slope on the line.\n\u003E \n\u003E It would not be that much of a problem actually but adding a proper stabilizer just increases the slope of the yellow line further and the pitch up authority becomes insufficient.\n\u003E \n\u003E Any way to figure out where the mid air chord is located to check against that?\n\u003E \n\u003E It feels like the center of gravity is way far forward. The trick is that it does not look very forward relative to the wing position at all.\n\u003E \n\u003E So that is what seems unrealistic.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thank you!\n\nIt is all about how far is peak or majority of pressure from center of mass. Latest dev build of FAR gives you in transonic design just that.\n\nNew blue line in area ruling graph represents preasure on each length point of graph.\n\nSorry, I didn\u0027t have time to edit pictures and upload them that could gives more info about it.\n\nBut, yes, plane with swept wing without additional vertical stabilizers on tail is possible to create.\n\nRecently I wass messing around with some small Rescue drone craft that is without tail but still stable, maneuverable by design.\n\nIt is not SSTO, need Shutlle style placement to orbit, but have plenty of dV for those orbital randevous with stranded Kerbals in orbit.\n\nQuite possible to land this on Mun or Minimus too. But main purpose is to have more recoverable pieces when you get from orbit.\n\n50% of rocket parts that was used to place it in orbit is recoverable too, I will post some pictures as soon as I optimize design some more, to give you better clue about it."},{"CreatedByName":"FourGreenFields","CreatedById":139309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T08:10:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It feels like the center of gravity is way far forward.

Swept wings (as said in my last post) produce more lift on their wingtips -\u003E CoL moves back -\u003E stable.\n\nSo you are adding tail wings to a plane that is already stable -\u003E possibly more stability than you\u0027d want.\n\nTry using a canard \u002B normal elevator design, or move your swept wings further forward (or add weight to your tail)."},{"CreatedByName":"Kitspace","CreatedById":109786,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T08:39:16Z","Content":"So with the airliners the center of mass range is not behind the wing root?\n\nThen where is it located lengthwise actually?\n\nIt would be nice to visually understand where the mid aerodynamic chord of the wing actually begins to compare its relative position to the center of mass to the real life airplanes numbers?\n\nAlso what kind of wing profile shape the mod actually uses for the physics calculations?\n\nIs it symmetric and how thick is it actually?"},{"CreatedByName":"Titov","CreatedById":145611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T20:52:00Z","Content":"Hi all.\n\nI have serious problems to design a MK3 shuttle with FAR :\n\nFor now, it could climb to orbit without too much problems, but the re-entry is a big mess.\n\nWhen the pitch is a bit over the prograde vector, it goes frontside rear, upside down, etc.\n\nAs far as I know, the space shuttle was rentering with a rather high pitch up, wasn\u0027t it ?\n\nHere is my shuttle, not that FAR from a known working design :\n\n![7CTpS8y.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7CTpS8y.jpg)\n\n![huxyeWB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/huxyeWB.jpg)\n\nMight you please help me to understand what I do wrong ?\n\nShall I add more weight to the nose ?\n\nHow to proceed in that case ?\n\nThanks !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T20:55:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 08:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Titov**"}]}
