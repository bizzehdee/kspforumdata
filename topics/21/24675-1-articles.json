It is a high altitude plane that boasts 2 turbojet engines and a bunch of intakes. It can glide very nicely for its size a cuts smoothly through the air at high and low altitudes. This is mostly used for spotting enemy bases at high altitude and then reporting back to HQ because of its fast intercontinental speeds.
