It doesn\u0027t function exactly the same, but looks pretty close to the original. [(compare to this)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Energia_buran.jpg/319px-Energia_buran.jpg)\n\nPlus, it\u0027s perfectly [orbit-capable](http://img600.imageshack.us/img600/4497/kerbalspaceprogram20110.jpg).\n\nI can\u0027t upload the ship file yet however.

Yours is looking pretty awesome there.\n\nHere\u0027s what I would do, though: Use a larger fuel tank (since Energia is comparable in size to the STS), and use (or design if one doesn\u0027t yet exist) a 1x3m-4x2m coupler so you can attach four of your engines to it.\n\nAlso I really like the solids in your pack, but is there any way to make them liquid engines? Maybe make the solid booster three parts; one whole solid for when you want to use that, one liquid tank based on the upper portion of the solid, and one liquid engine based on its lower portion.\n\nNo real reason for having you do all that work other than I LOVE throttling ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnd now that I see what your parts were originally intended for, I think I\u0027m going to take a crack at making an Energia in Vulcan-Hercules configuration.\n\n![vOW91Mg](http://ompldr.org/vOW91Mg)\n\nAlso now that I think about it, the configuration you\u0027ve designed with the single engine is actually more correct to the Energia-M, which had two Zenits and a single engine on the core stage, rather than four Zenits and four engines on the core stage like the Energia configurations used for Polyus and Buran:\n\n![vOW91NQ](http://ompldr.org/vOW91NQ)"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-30T18:27:22Z","Content":"There\u0027s actually four boosters on the side, you just can\u0027t see them in the picture I gave =p"}]}
