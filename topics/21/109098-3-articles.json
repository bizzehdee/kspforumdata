Partly show off, partly tutorial thread, we all can learn something from other crafts designs.\n\nNew voxel FAR offers new chalanges along with new stock behaviour. Once again you need to find out optimal ascent path for your plane, at what altitude you need to go supersonic where your craft is still stable to control and where plane will not going to be melted down due to too much overheat.\n\nAlso engines behaves differently, at high altitudes you will loose thrust due to low air pressure but you have more thrust when you are able to go faster, at the same time.\n\nI have re-created my SpacePlane Mk2 B9PW plane. Stable at all altitudes, two Mk2 cargo bays provide enough room for all kind of space probes or small equipments needed to maintain your space stations.\n\nStill have to made some new pictures and upload it, but craft is available in my craft exchange thread for anyone curious to try it.

Hella lot of fiddling to get the wave drag down to a relatively low 2.8 when the wheels are up, and that turns out to be good enough to allow a pair of rapiers to kick her up to extreme speeds on air. Stable to the point of almost too stable; doesn\u0027t actually like to turn, but very definitely won\u0027t veer off course or have yaw or roll wobbles during flight. Some pitch-bounce man occur during re-entry, but nothing dangerous.\n\nAs you\u0027d expect for 1.0.2, she carries an oversized cargo bay to allow for an M700 survey satellite (itself with upwards of 2k delta-v), or a large can of fuel, or she can swap out the half-bay for a crew cabin. Docking port and RCS thrusters roughly balanced for a near-dry. And believe it or not, the illuminators actually reduce the wave drag slightly xD\n\nOnly thing I don\u0027t like is the pitch authority is really bad below mach 0.5. As in there isn\u0027t any. Below that speed she\u0027s gonna lawn dart, so you have to come in fast and low and hit the airbrakes when you\u0027re only a few metres above the runway.

This causes some weird handling- the plane tries to roll right in turns and if you sweep the wings all the way back the ailerons will actually reverse at high speed and low altitude. Also the landing gear layout sucks, making touchdown a little hairy. The craft does have flaps, but FAR seems to have a thing against flaps on high aspect ratio wings, so they\u0027re set to only extend 9 degrees- if you extend them more the flaps stall, causing you to go into a spin and crash on landing...\n\nCraft file:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/auggjfnp4bph84e/KiG-23%20%27Flogger%27.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/auggjfnp4bph84e/KiG-23%20%27Flogger%27.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T06:37:37Z","Content":"How do the wave-drag numbers look with wings forward vs back?"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T09:15:55Z","Content":"Exploring some different airframe options:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
