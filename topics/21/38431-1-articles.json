Using B9, and DR, I was able to make a rough launch pad and tower. The launch pad is still going through changes as it looks pretty crappy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried to do the best i could in less than 3 hours. It looks pretty bad, but hey, it works!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/EaVww07.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EaVww07.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt even has light for night launches!(But you better wear sunglasses!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/6h1BLG1.png\u0022 alt=\u00226h1BLG1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a ladder so kerbals can enjoy themselves on the launch pad!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/fL2y8zR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fL2y8zR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also uses Damned Robotics so you can move the crew bridge and that launch clamp thing on the EFT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/wcRC67J.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wcRC67J.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s pretty much it, it can take off quite nicely. Though one of the wing clamps moves out of place and looks weird, but you\u0027ll be taking off so the smoke will most likely cover it up. Be sure to tell me anything i can do to make it better \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E If you guys would like a download link for it, just say so! I\u0027ll add a download link for it if you guys would like to have one! I also plan to add flavors of the shuttle! Such as Atlantis Flavored, Discovery Flavored, ect. Thanks to the makers of these mods for being so dang awesome at doing their thing! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blubbermonkeys","CreatedById":61719,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T10:04:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhoa..
