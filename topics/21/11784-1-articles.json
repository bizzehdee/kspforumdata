No RCS as yet, so not really usefull for crew rotations, etc (whenever those come around). The mothership is amazingly nice to fly, the orbiter on the other hand is a bit squirrely, treat her gently and she\\\u0027ll get you home though. \n\nOperational Instructions Loose Suggestions\n\nTake-off: Set MJ to Surf, heading 90 pitch 15. Throttle up and go. Has an amazingly short take off run. Have ascent ap set up with you\\\u0027re profile of choice, but don\\\u0027t engage yet. \n\nClimb/Cruise: Climb to ~10-12km, then level off and accelerate to ~500m/s.\n\nSeparation: Engage ascent ap at ~12km and ~500m/s. Mothership should pitch up dramatically. At ~15km separate. You may want to set some up trim before separating, of give a brief push forward on the stick immediately after, to reduce the chances of kerbalstrophic recontact. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Engage rocket when clear. You may need to assist ascent ap in regaining nose up attitude after separation.\n\nOrbit: Let ascent ap take you the rest of the way into orbit. Make a sandwich. \n\nReentry/landing: I like to use the landing ap, set to a point a few km west of KSC, to do the deorbit burn. Once you\\\u0027re in the atmosphere land like any other space plane."},{"CreatedByName":"Joshmo","CreatedById":10280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T04:56:42Z","Content":"This is a much more elegant version of something I made back in .11 or something.
