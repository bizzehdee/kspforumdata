KSPX is my first downloaded mod, and it adds so much to the game that really should have been in already. Those new compact parts (tiny RCS tank, ASAS, heavy duty probe engine etc.) have allowed me to set new personal records in weight and part count. So far, I have only a few satellites and the mercury analogue above, but I want to see your ships that have been graced by KSPX\u0027s presence. It might give me a few ideas. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
