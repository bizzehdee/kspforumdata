Shortly after this the SRB\u0027s will burn out. Once they are released pitch to 45 degrees and throttle up to about 80%. Once the AP is at 30km I pitch to 35, when the AP is at 40km pitch to 25, when AP is at 60km pitch to 15. When your Ap is 70-75km pitch to 5 and stay on that pitch till the AP is at 100km. That should result in a wide ascent path with the PE somewhere around -200 to -150km, so not much effort is needed to complete the orbit.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/xKeNEY5\u0022\u003EThey are meant to be launched unmanned (I use the CrewManifest mod to remove the crew) and are joined by LV-T45 transfer stages that will take them unmanned to Duna. They use RemoteTech so you need to have a satellite network in place for it to work without a crew. In the nose cone of each module there is a 50Gm dish so they can remain in contact with ground control all the way to Duna. I recommend having a RemoteTech command station at Duna otherwise landing the cargo module will be very hard. The 50Gm dishes are activated once in orbit with action group 4.

I recommend deploying the cargo modules before landing the Hab module because once both craft have landed it can get a bit laggy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cargo module has an extra step before landing. After its de-orbited and on course to the landing site the next stage will release the rear engine section (@4:50 in the vid). This is done to help it\u0027s balance, the hab hangs onto its engines as it has more SAS and can correct the imbalance. Once the modules are on a descent course you need to change the control point. Inside the Cargo lander there is small docking port, zoom inside the fairings and select \u0022control from here\u0022 on that port (@5:00 in the vid). The hab landers control needs to be set to the 3 man pod on its ascent module (you can select it thou the fairings if you click in the right place). As you approach the landing site hit stage to release the upper two fairings and deploy chutes. The next stage will drop the other fairing, fairing mount, fire the 50Gm dish off the nose and start the landing engines. You must get the landers under 100m/s before the parachutes open or the force will rip them to bits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/AA1cCqx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AA1cCqxm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AA1cCqxm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/HDtHncF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HDtHncFm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HDtHncFm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/QZSH5ih\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QZSH5ihm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QZSH5ihm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/PnrDtw3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PnrDtw3m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PnrDtw3m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen landing the cargo lander you \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Emust not use G to lower the legs\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E, there are a lot more legs on all its modules and hitting G causes a spaghetti of legs and problems, instead hit action group 5 to lower its legs.

To deploy it from the cargo lander hold down 9 until it has rotated and moved into position, then press 0 to release it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt uses DamnedRobotics, KAS and docking ports to connect to the modules and move them. If you put a docking port on the end of a DR hinged arm, when you dock the hinges stop working and some parts get misaligned (save/reloading gets the hinges working but parts remain misaligned). In this rover there is a KAS winch on the DR arm and the docking port is connected to the winch, when the rover is deployed you need to first release the winch (tap numpad 1) and wind it back in again (numpad 3), then you need to change the KAS mode from docked to undocked via the KAS menu (or with action group 0) You can only change the mode once the winch has been released and retracted again. This makes the docking port on the end of the arm a separate \u0027craft\u0027 to the rover so when you dock it doesn\u0027t affect the DR hinges. You also need to change the control point as initially the nav ball will be on its side, select \u0022control from here\u0022 on the front command pod and switch to docking mode for driving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe arm controls use action groups 1-7. 1 \u0026amp; 2 raise and lower the main arm, 3 \u0026amp; 4 changes the angle of the connector. 5 \u0026amp; 6 rotate the connector. 7 will undock the arms docking port, but because of the above setup you need to switch to whatever the rover is holding and then hit 7 to release it. The other advantage of the docking port being a separate \u0027craft\u0027 from the rover is the action groups for controlling the arms won\u0027t interfere with any action groups on whatever its holding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover has 3 other attachments that is can wield. The two standard KAS ones (grappling hook and magnet) are held on the side of the rover. The 3rd one is a command chair attachment that also has a lazor built in (for good measure). That is found ontop of the cargo lander and once released should just fall down and then a kerbal can connect it to the winch (@19:17 in the vid).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI modified the .cfg for the winch to give it 200m of cable instead of the standard 100m. This is to help speed things up when using the grapple hook attachment to climb hill (see vid @20:50 for change over and climbing process).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe modules are sections of a Kethane mining system and they need to be connected together with KAS lines in order to work. The power generator module has 3 winches and the other two modules and the cargo lander have connectors to plug the KAS lines into. Once connected together they form a fully functional mining setup and the cargo lander acts and the fuel depot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/YCoL81n\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YCoL81nl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YCoL81nl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kethane drill has two small Kethane tanks and the converter has one, once connected together all these tanks will fill at the same rate. When converting kethane (which you can start with action group 8) RCS will automatically fill the RCS tanks on the cargo lander. But Liquid and Oxidizer fuels need to be pumped. The converter has an oscarB tank which it will fill as it converts, attached to the tank is a TAC fuel balancer device (which I call the fuel pump). You can set it to constantly pump fuel out of the oscarB tank to the tanks on the lander and it will continue pumping fuel even when you switch to another craft.

It has a total crew capacity of 13 but is intended for a crew of 6. 3 lander cans make up the main crew quarters and they are joined by a crew tunnel that can hold a single kerbal. It also has a 6 man landing/escape pod that is used to return the crew to Kerbin on return and can be used as an emergency escape module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is intended to be launched unmanned and then joined by its LV-N transfer stage.

Once its clear of the ship, hit abort (or backspace) to fire its short burn engines (obv. once your facing the right way!).

It has a set of engines and with 2/3 fuel it can make it back to kerbin. It also has the capacity to land if it was already low on fuel and it make it back to orbit on 1/3 of its fuel. If you need to land and refuel it you need to leave the escape pods behind, but (which I forgot to explain in the vid) one of the crew will need to get in the ascent (/descent) module and come down too, in order to connect the KAS lines to refuel it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines of this emergency return module can be toggled with 5 and 7 will deploy its solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce returned to orbit around Kerbin, Kopernicus can be refitted with a new transfer stage and the landing/escape pods and emergency return module can be brought up and docked to it.

The problem with radial attachment is its ok connecting things to the fuel tank and working away from it, but then at the other end it was impossible to attach the fuel tank with the same join so it was alway unbalanced. So I changed to have all the connections as stack connections. The little cube parts are used to join the large structural struts (where as before I\u0027d used small struts to enable a radial attachment). One of the cubes is inside the downward large strut so the other strut connects higher up. The central bit is one of those long I beam parts which has attachment points at either end and in the middle so that helped a lot. And obviously a healthy dose of struts in key places. You may be able to see in that the docking port where the ascent module connects is actually two docking ports on top of each other, this was just to raise the height a little. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if I\u0027m not making much sense, its quite late and not easy to describe in words what\u0027s going on! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with the ascent module back in place\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/P1dIcoB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P1dIcoBl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P1dIcoBl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small white structural \u0027tanks\u0027 are there to support the ascent module when it is undocked. *\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cradle section on Kopernicus was much easier to make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis first pic shows the top of the cradle which is a bulkhead section from NovaPunch.

First on kerbin, where I\u0027d just lift of from the hab module, hover a little and then drop back in again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I did most of the practicing for that on Mun, left the hab on the surface and put the ascent module in orbit (and refuelled it). Then did the deorbit and (attempt) landing again and again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used MechJebs SURF function to set the crafts pitch to 90 so it stays level, the engines should not be exerting any horizontal force, only vertical. With the old MJ you can then manually roll the craft to get the right orientation with the hab, but the new MJ I think you have to enter the value for roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it\u0027s all about the navball, in the vid I was hardly looking at the craft, just a bit on approach to see that it was rolled the right way to line up with the hab and in the very last few seconds. The rest of the time I was pretty much glued to the navball. As you come in for approach, select the hab and set the docking port on it as the target (that\u0027s important otherwise the navball marker is for the front of the hab module). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need to look at where the navball markers are. because you set the craft to pitch 90 the crosshairs will be perfectly in the center, your goal is to get the pink and green markers perfectly aligned with the cross hair using the RCS thrusters. If the pink target marker is above the crosshair, you need to move the green marker above the pink marker by about twice as much, if the pink marker is off to the left, then move the green marker left by about twice as much. In other words keep the pink marker directly in-between the crosshair and the green marker and so the three points form a straight line. That will push the pink marker towards the crosshair, once its there you need the green marker directly on top of it too and then you know you are perfectly lined up and descending straight down directly ontop of the docking port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI practiced doing that on Mun because it is easier and you can get a feel of what you need to do with the navball. On Duna with the atmo its a bit harder. I practiced with a crew in the ascent module, but when I came to do it in the mission I was landing without a crew. Because its a remote tech craft, even with no signal delay it is more wobbly than when it is crewed and mechjeb makes that worse. So once I set the pitch to 90 and got it rolled the right way I switched the SAS on which overrides MJ and makes it more steady. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoodLuck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you run low of fuel, you can land the ascent module on the ground near the hab module and still be able to refuel it. There is a movable KAS connector underneath the KAS winch on the hab module, get a Kerbal to pick it up and bolt it to the ascent module and then you can plug the KAS line from the hab module into it for refuelling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xzabath","CreatedById":66393,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T02:18:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGonna fly to the Mun, do some practicing there, maybe ill get to Duna this weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
