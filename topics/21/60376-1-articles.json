I put together a little craft that demo\u0027s this design feature. Not too sure how putting them all over a space station will work yet but I do have plans on it. Just need to figure out what the total design will be for each launch and docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5052189/Flywheel%20Test%20Bed.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5052189/Flywheel%20Test%20Bed.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzerknoef","CreatedById":90599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T10:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you...
