But I have done other SSTO\u0027s that can go to Mun, land, and then get back, so you can definitely get over 6.5km/s (specifically, the Grasshopper, a VTOL, but the great crash ate it and I haven\u0027t put it back up yet, it should come back soon). The trick is to max out the airbreathing engines (get to at least 2,000m/s on atmo), and then using nukes for circularization and in-space propulsion. Of course, all the fuel you can take while still being able to climb. So basically, spam intakes to get there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking with you kethane equipment means quite a huge SSTO, though, all of that counts as payload, and it is quite heavy, so maintaining the mass ratio is challenging. Perfectly doable still, or at least math tells you so (the rocket equation with 800s isp says mass ratio ~2.5 to get 7.2 km/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
