Also I\u0027ve got an idea in my head for a craft that could launch several rovers from orbit. Basically, the whole ship aerobrakes in the admosphere of a planet, drops rover/s from it\u0027s apoapsis, then burns to circularize it\u0027s own orbit. The rovers hit the atmosphere and parachute in. Pretty simple, they each way under half a ton I think.
