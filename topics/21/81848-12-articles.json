Unfortunately I\u0027m limited to RAM intakes at the mo, which makes my engines choke at ~20km altitude with one intake each. They\u0027ll make 25km with two each, but then the drag keeps my speed down and it\u0027s even harder to get anywhere. Rapidly turns into a race of engines vs intakes, but the best balance I can find for this size of craft is a pair of each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever... basing my design on one of Wanderfound\u0027s more compact models, running with 2x RAMs, 2x regular turbojets from Karbonite, and 1x nerva, I actually managed to get the little beast into orbit, rendezvous with the lost kerbal, and bring him home. Despite having cannily covered the crew hatch with a radial parachute. Misjudged the final approach and landed about 200m from the runway via those emergency parachutes, but the exploding nerva triggered a nearby seismometer and gave me science, and I was able to taxi onto the runway for nearly full recovery costs anyway. In kerbal terms, that\u0027s a 110% success! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://foxwoodstudios.co.uk/kerbal/spaceplane-crossbow.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022spaceplane-crossbow.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHandled pretty well throughout; as long as the AoA stayed under ~15 degrees, she was happy to bring herself back to prograde and just descend gently.
