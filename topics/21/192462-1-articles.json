The C\u0026amp;C remasters are available for pre-purchase. And so far it seems to be pretty fantastic, remastered soundtrack, updated graphics and only minor additions/tweaks to gameplay/ui, basically the original Tiberian Dawn and Read Alert 1, but better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe C\u0026amp;C games is one of the biggest parts of my childhood and are something i play pretty frequently even today and their soundtracks are something i listen to even more often than that (doing that right now).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what better to celebrate these news, than...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Behold, the Shogun Battleship\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rfHwQuJ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rfHwQuJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy vision of it anyways. I decided to take the Shogun Battleship and make it more \u0022realistic\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy original plan was to make one of the staples of the series, the mighty Mammoth Tank, but i taught this occasion needed something a bit bigger and more impressive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike i mentioned, i wanted to make the Shogun Battleship a little more \u0022realistic\u0022, this meant adding stuff like Anti-Air guns/missiles, lifeboats, doors, radars, and other small details, and downsizing the main battery guns to a more realistic size. The guns are still like 500mm guns, witch is a bit ridiculous, but at-least it\u0027s a little more sane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Shogun Battleship is one of my favorite units out of all the C\u0026amp;C games and Red alert 3 is one of the ones i play the most. Say what you want about the amount of cheesecake, but other than the recourse system, i think it\u0027s pretty great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have actually been meaning to do a replica of the Shogun Battleship a long time ago, but never got around to doing it. I dunno why, but i guess i never had a full picture of what the model looks like up close, and how to transfer it into something functional, well detailed and properly sized (compared to real-life or KNS ship).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think i nailed the other two parts pretty well, but functionality tough, let\u0027s just say there\u0027s a reason there isn\u0027t a shot of it in the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YmCxQEm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YmCxQEm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis build ended up being one of my biggest builds so far. It\u0027s about 180m in length, 50m wide and near 35m tall and has near 1900 parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t remember even a single build from the top of my head that would have had that many, i think the closets ive ever gotten was around 1500 parts with the 1:1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E-225 and the Kerbinprise (1:1 Enterprise).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided that since this is such a special occasion for me personally, i should go all out with the build and put in all the details and make it BIG.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022h1qKVcQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/h1qKVcQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022y1kbRBW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/y1kbRBW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was with cheats on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen again, im kinda surprised i got the thing to stay together in the first place, as the construction is very complex and fragile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm not gonna be putting a download link or any further details, as there is a high chance im gonna redo this in more KNS style and upload it there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the main reason is pretty obvious, but it\u0027s not the only one. For one, the main battery guns are just for looks and don\u0027t work, and it has a slight corruption on it as a result of a game crash (it\u0027s a very small part, but it likes to destroy quite a big part of the rear hull. You can actually see the damage on the shot where im approaching the water).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and there\u0027s also the huge lag that i have not experienced that bad since the test flight of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E-225.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall im still pretty happy, as i think the Shogun Battleship just looks awesome, witch i think still makes this worthy of a proper post. I believe you could probably get this to work if you used vessel mover or something similar to teleport it to the water, but i like to do all my ship launches legit (or at-least semi-legit, basically with no-crash damage and unbrekable joints on), so it\u0027s just guess work at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there it is for you, one of my giant builds that didn\u0027t work out so well.
