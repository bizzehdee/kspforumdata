Apparently, someone thought that, if a fast way to drop someone by is what\u0027s needed, they rather not have those slow \u0022fasten your seatbelts\u0022 and just give them something to hang on to while the drone drives around. \n\nThe RV-Hitcher proves that \u0022Just hang in there\u0022 can be as much as reliable as it is risky. The deployment of the RV-Hitcher did coincidentally happen with the increase in visits to the Kerbal Medical Center, most notably kerbals with reported broken bones and fractured skulls.\n\n[![IiouuPI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IiouuPI.jpg)](http://www./download/c8kxlk35rvjyynl/SHA_Transport_RV-Hitcher.craft)\n\nClick on the image above for download!\n\nCost : 50, 636\n\nPart Count : 25\n\nMass : 1.2 tons\n\nDimensions \n\nH : 1.1m\n\nL : 2.5m\n\nW : 4.2m\n\nPowerplant : \n\n4 PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoeletric Generators\n\n* * *\n\n![7ufg06A.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7ufg06A.jpg)\n\nSHA\u0027s Transport RV-Dropper is a quick solution to quick and easy personnel transport. Having an open seat configuration means that you can basically hitch with the RV-Dropper, and drop yourself anytime. Having a passenger capacity of 12, the RV-Dropper is a staple for point A-to-B rides, mainly used to move around between facilities much faster.\n\nSafety is one thing, SHA recommends Kerbals to stay fit and healthy so as not to rip off the seats when bearing weight, and always fasten their seat belts at all times when hitching a ride.\n\n[![zskSRP6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zskSRP6.jpg)](http://www./download/rziynrnqmv6peb7/SHA_Transport_RV-Dropper.craft)\n\nClick on the image above for download!\n\nCost : 55, 512\n\nPart Count : 70\n\nMass : 3.8 tons\n\nDimensions \n\nH : 1.7m\n\nL : 2.6m\n\nW : 7.4m\n\nPowerplant : \n\n2 PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoeletric Generators\n\n8 OX-STAT Photovoltaic Panels\n\n* * *\n\n![FRq5pND.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FRq5pND.jpg)\n\nSHA\u0027s Transport RV-Rancher is an alternative solution to SHA\u0027s RV-Dropper. Much heavier, the RV-Rancher can house up to 24 passengers with its double deck configuration, and features the open-seat configuration for fast and easy deployment of passengers.\n\nA thing is that, unlike the RV-Dropper, the RV-Rancher has a tendency to topple over to its side when turning to fast at some speeds, pick a good driver and you\u0027re safe.\n\n[![SxlIPAy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SxlIPAy.jpg)](http://www./download/7vw2qxnd95s1573/SHA_Transport_RV-Rancher.craft)\n\nClick on the image above for download!\n\nCost : $63, 648\n\nPart Count : 120\n\nMass : 6.0 tons\n\nDimensions \n\nH : 2.2m\n\nL : 3.0m\n\nW : 7.5m\n\nPowerplant : \n\n2 PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoeletric Generators\n\n8 OX-STAT Photovoltaic Panels\n\n* * *\nCheck out more of Sparrowhawk\u0027s Products at :\n[![wyv8VDw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wyv8VDw.jpg)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81506-SparrowHawk-Aeronautics-HIRING%21-JOIN-NOW%21)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T15:01:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 03:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SHiftER2O**"}]}
