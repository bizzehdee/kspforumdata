So far tested to destruction many, many times. Top speed of 28m/s with engines and parachutes for any landing necessary\\*. The chassis has limited suspension and a wheel configuration that allows the weight of the craft to be loaded onto different wheels depending on climb angle, which helps in hilly environments such as \u0027the area around KSP\u0027 and \u0027the Mun crater I meant to land next to but sort of landed in it\u0027. It has a full science array containing every instrument avaliable in Stock and DMagic Orbital Science. Cupola module allows for maximal visibilty and an increased concern that the front is perhaps too low. Jeb says its fine. \n\n![77AkAtv.png](http://i.imgur.com/77AkAtv.png)\n\n![RAqxrmX.png](http://i.imgur.com/RAqxrmX.png)![3byDqHn.png](http://i.imgur.com/3byDqHn.png)\n\nThere we have it! Thoughts? Opinions? Postulations?\n\n\\*Landing on Tylo, Eeloo, Vall and Moho are not \u0027necessary\u0027 - attempts to do so will void warrenty\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T18:18:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BrainiacBlue**"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T13:09:33Z","Content":"Considering you like mobile bases you may be interested in the Command beetle mk4\n\n![TAmNssF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TAmNssF.jpg)\n\n![O6ZSgh5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/O6ZSgh5.jpg)\n\n![XuWz8ff.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XuWz8ff.jpg)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Voq5oKo5p8g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nthere are download links to it in the youtube video description, also a version that comes with a launch rocket."},{"CreatedByName":"Djslime6764","CreatedById":140412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T21:30:04Z","Content":"Where can i Download the Hammerhead rover base???"}]}
