We at Argus develop and provide automated crafts and vehicles for use on terrestrial bodies as well as in space. Founded in 2015, the Foundry is a fully automated factory that uses a unique production and design algorithm that designs, develops, and creates crafts for a variety of uses without the need for Kerbal engineers or workers. This approach is also utilized in our Drone craft design, with no need for crew or life support in our vehicles and ships, our Drones are able to do what a manned crafts cannot. If any Drones are lost in the line of duty, no Kerbals are lost in the process. We at Argus work for Kerban, so that Kerbals may live. \n\nThank You,\n\nA.I. CORE D1-B (Management Variant)\n\n[DEVILVERY PROTOCOLS COMPLETE]\n\n[RELEASE DRONE BUILDS]\n\n**Argus Drone** \n\n**AP-1 Hornet (Prototype Variant)**\n\n![tlagsn9.png](http://i.imgur.com/tlagsn9.png)\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/hZt9H](http://imgur.com/a/hZt9H) - Imgur has been giving us problems. We apologize if you do not see all of the photos. \n\n[Craft File](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ylq05mns5v7nase/Argus%20AP-1%20Hornet.craft?dl=0)\n\nThe AP-1 Hornet is the first prototype to be released by Argus Drone Foundry, an air-breathing dropship based on crafts created by Cupcake Landers. \n\nA central MK-1 Core provides near perfect balance while two Turbojet Engines create an enormous amount of thrust. \n\nThe AP-1 Hornet is still in the development stages and parts of the design are subject to change. \n\nWe are releasing this prototype for field testing at this time and hope it will perform to Kerbal expectations. \n\nControls\n\n1 - Toggle Turbojets\n\n2 - Intake Sync\n\n3 - Decouples Side Docking Ports\n\nAbort - Turns Off Engines. Closes Intakes. Turns off SAS. Lowers Landing Gear. Opens Emergency Parachutes\n\nT - SAS for Maneuvering\n\nNote: If landing gear is already lowered when the abort sequence is initiated then landing gear will raise!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T08:18:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 08:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Argus Drone Foundry**"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T14:59:53Z","Content":"I was just going to write, it looks like a cupcake craft. Seeing as he has disappeared, you can take over his mantle. So you know the tricks it seems. Instantly cutting thrust by mapping the air intakes to an action group. Good job man."}]}
