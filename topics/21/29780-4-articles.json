And the LLL parts allow you to make Eagle Mission pods of various types quite nicely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I\u0027ve thought the Eagle could do quite handily is construct a base made out of mission pods it carries up under it\u0027s main truss if I could be patient enough and careful enough with the docking and link up. On Minmus it\u0027s relatively easy. RCS is capable of helping lift up an Eagle\u0027s weight just enough to allow you to \u0022Scoot\u0022 it along the ice flats in order to bring the docking ports into alignment. After that it\u0027s just a matter of multiple deliveries. I used a total of 5 Eagles to construct the main base and delivered some extras with 3 more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe base has life support and recycling (the Greenhouse pod helps support that) and Minmus Base Alpha sits on top of a Kethane node so it\u0027s able to refuel ships that come in. Though I\u0027m getting close to depleting the node. But that\u0027s okay! The modular nature of the base means the whole thing can be easily picked up and moved to the next node. And in my save, there\u0027s another Kethane node under another part of the same ice flat in the same hemisphere. So a single Eagle could make multiple trips and move the whole base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s much easier to make all the parts of a base fit together smoothly on perfectly flat terrain like the ice flats. But I know eventually I\u0027ll have to put some modules together on imperfect terrain. I may not be able to locate a base on certain Kethane fields that are too steep. Then I\u0027ll have to send out rovers and/or ships to deliver kethane to the base instead.

As it does mine. For some reason the way lighting works right now (as also shading) it casts light in odd ways. Very odd. So it causes some kind of terrain change almost. It\u0027s complicated and I don\u0027t really understand HOW it works. However, I would recommend NOT using lights near land as they just act as part buildup. Also, you have 4 very heavy texture models from the CO2 and O2 mod. Can\u0027t remember the name. But they are very texture saturated and are big files. I would recommend down sizing on those. but it\u0027s up to you. Also, KAS links load only on contact and are not permanent parts on save. Only the destination for the part like, ... a weight or cord. Then upon load, the cord, wire, pipe, what have you, is loaded based on where it was previously. it can be aggravating but that can slow your load time. Not to mention your vast amount of parts. Currently I am running on an i7 with a 635GT 2gig graphics card but it doesn\u0027t matter HOW good of an OS you have, or how good your software is because KSP runs on older versions of programs until recently, and the cache for memory is only allotted a certain amount of memory. So there is that too. I think it\u0027s something like 3.12 gigs. but I cant remember. Seeing as I have 8 gigs of Ram and my game lags with a Space station of 230 parts, down to about 25 fps, i could understand that happening with your base there. Not to mention the fact that my laptop never goes over 60% usage in game with KSP.
