I ended up with something that may tax some of your computers to the breaking point but only for the first couple of stages. depending on what you are trying to launch with it. enjoy. this is completely stock craft. although I do have mechjeb on the return capsule. can start your turn at 10km or even 9, I have yet to really break it. other than just having too many parts on the top of it to break the game lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/6v2ldb7hxfkd2un/BIG%20lift%20lots%20of%20DV.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6v2ldb7hxfkd2un/BIG%20lift%20lots%20of%20DV.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E put this in your sub assembly under the save you wish to use it in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/3bngxo9tb7uc6yd/screenshot16.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/3bngxo9tb7uc6yd/screenshot16.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E pic\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-08T05:24:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2015 05:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by raidersc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Euploading pics\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T21:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a download?
