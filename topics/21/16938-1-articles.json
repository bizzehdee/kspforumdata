Since the engineers were not very creative, they named the craft after our sole tester, Sherdorf Kerman. He bravely survived controlled experiments of being thrown into the ocean and into the VAB. This aircraft has two engines, four fuel tanks, and a whole bunch of wings thrown on in pretty shapes. It had a max speed of 744.2 m/s at a cruising altitude of 17.5 kilometers above sea level. That speed is just above Mach 2. This craft zipped across the northern skies as the enemies trailed with high res cameras. It traveled about halfway to the north pole, then after running out of fuel, it glided I think 100-150 kilometers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p491/Sphyrinx/30c750c1.png\u0022 alt=\u002230c750c1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p491/Sphyrinx/8677cef8.png\u0022 alt=\u00228677cef8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p491/Sphyrinx/61a6016a.png\u0022 alt=\u002261a6016a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p491/Sphyrinx/2519771d.png\u0022 alt=\u00222519771d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is somewhat challenging to land, not that hard though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload it and try it for yourself!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?j39thbemttlef1a\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?j39thbemttlef1a\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
