However there was one stipulation, our first project is a long range jet with the ability to nearly circum-navigate the Kerglobe. I have my suspicions that my superiors just want a platform to launch assaults against our neighbors, and shudder at the thought of me and my groups work being utilized in such a way. But we have all agreed that the science that we could perform would out weigh their ambitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 15:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have run into a huge brick wall, they tell us it is nearly impossible to perform such a feet with the technology we have at hand...however the boys and girls (we are after all an equal opportunity Kerbin employer) in the R\u0026amp;D department inform us they may have found a way. They plan on using the defunct design for the light bomber code named \u0022Load Barron\u0022 and a feature essentially coppied verbatum from one of our neighbors. The \u0022OneFJef\u0022 has come up with a wing design that allows for extreme long range and our Kerbals believe this is exactly the breakthrough we have needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 57: With the design coming to an end I can\u0027t help but wonder if this is at all possible, even with the breakthrough we recently came up with.

What if our platform is used to dominate the entirity of Kerbin...none the matter now we must press forward for science! (Self plug WARNING!!!)

What a dismal failure...not even the Kerbins in the Happiness Department can\u0027t even come up with reasurances enough to make any of us hopeful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 134: Eureka! After an all night banana fueled binge I have stumbled across the answer...it was so SIMPLE and we were so blind to this fact. Just move the glide wings...BACK AH HA! I demonstrate this to the Kerbals in the R\u0026amp;D department and their jaws drop. Our technicians are immediately put to work adjusting our existing fleet to the new design specs.

Around 55km out they jetisoned their booster jet engines and switched on their main turbo jet engine. At this point the auto pilot was activated and the Kerbins participated in a live feed.
