This is my first post!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(There are no pics using it because I decided to post it at the last minute, sorry!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I made my first successfull ship, a mid-career rocket which is capable of getting to the Mun or Minmus and back with very little fuel left, if helped with RCS which is very efficient in higher orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XW9Knle.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022XW9Knle.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it consists in 5 stages, the first one entirely made of solid fuel boosters:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SzR7K3C.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022SzR7K3C.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second one, consists in 5 liquid fuel boosters, a central one and 4 externals which are connected to the central one, providing it with fuel until they dry out and the central fuel tank starts to pump. This stage is used for getting into orbit, and doing the gravity turn: (there are two stages here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gM1s2QI.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022gM1s2QI.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis stage is the lander and maneuver stage. This is the most efficient stage of the rocket, since it\u0027s small and the rocket itself is very powerful. With the help of RCS there isn\u0027t much of a burn to get to Minmus\u0027s orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hFPm7WD.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022hFPm7WD.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the last one is the capsule decoupled and ready for returning into the atmosphere and landing safely with a parachute:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3GHSa0w.png?2\u0022 alt=\u00223GHSa0w.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload file: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/beoy7opwji557im/MRX.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/beoy7opwji557im/MRX.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you think in the comments!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothke","CreatedById":51185,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T06:01:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is very similar to how I design the landers in early game, although I tend to add the basic girder between the tanks and the landing gear to widen it improve stability and prevent it from tipping over if I accidentally land on uneven terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matirozen","CreatedById":12398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T16:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I took some time adjusting the landing legs for them to be at the same height or below the engine.
