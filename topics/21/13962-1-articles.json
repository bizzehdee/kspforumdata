Featuring parts from BACE, NovaPunch, JAWRD, Ludo (obv), Probodobodyne, Fixed Camera (including cockpit .cfgs), and Damned Robotics, this warship delivers warheads with near-pinpoint accuracy in almost any direction. Two individually-controlled railguns (railgun 1: rotation, 1-2; hinge, 3-4. railgun 2: rotation, 5-6; hinge, 7-8) and two targeting cameras provide superior firepower. Each railgun has four rounds. Railgun 1 fires first; its targeting camera can be activated with two hits of F8. A further F8 will switch you to railgun 2\\\u0027s targeting camera. If this isn\\\u0027t your ideal setup, it\\\u0027s pretty easy to modify the order the rounds fire in, and you can also fire both at once to ensure area denial. Accurately aiming both railguns simultaneously is theoretically possible but our pilots did \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E test it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you run out of ammo, or are intercepted, you\\\u0027re not completely helpless; board the Bumblebee Mk. I situated below the blimp and make a clean getaway. (Would have included the turbojet, but it kept breaking on vessel launch) You will need approximately 500 meters of altitude minimum clearance to perform this maneuver, although skilled pilots could probably do it in about 400 meters. I dropped from 750m and evened out at exactly 300, but there is a response delay in turning on the jet\\\u0027s engine that will vary depending on human response time. Alternatively, you can bundle the ignition with the decouplement from the blimp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunching this vessel is indeed a bit tricky... fill to 100% gas levels ASAP, and start your engines when you\\\u0027re approximately 75-80% full. Then proceed to take off like a completely normal, innocent fighter jet. (You should leave the runway at approximately 20m/s) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS tanks and thrusters are included to make maneuvering easier, but it does leave something to be desired. You should note that for modifications purposes, the craft is at ~95% weight capacity already - too much more and she won\\\u0027t take off! (I added two more RCS tanks for a total of 1.8 additional mass units and she never made it off the runway.) She hovers at approximately 95-96% gas level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YQeav.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YQeav.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecent firing angle - note the distance and feel between the gun and target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that all numbers as of today are very rough!
