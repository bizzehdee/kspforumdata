As you can see by the navball, the launch is somewhat problematic: the ship is pretty close of the maximum mass 3 aerospikes can get off the ground of KSP , and to add, the ship is not exactly structurally solid ( again , experimental and proof of concept \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ).

I had just ditched the last fuel tank below the lander proper. It had got to 100 km with a sliver of fuel. This was a major improvement on Accordion A ( pretty much the same rocket , but with 3 heavy landing legs and with lower mounted engines ( will explain that change later ) ) that was forced to start burning the final stage still in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iqpzr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iqpzr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunar Injection Burn.

I chickened out a little here, since I could had waited 1 to 2 more seconds before burning. I don\u0027t leave this exclusively to MechJeb because it has some kind of respect for the Kerbals and tries to avoid high Gs.

Tried to do a as much as possible full throttle burn, but this needs some fine tuning since I have made a direct burn from the surface, so I made a part of it in in slow burn. The fuel budget ( as you will see in the next pic ) was more than enough to cope in a bug-less environment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pd3ES.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pd3ES.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActivating parachutes for aerobraking in the highest possible altitude.

This made that the ship was too much top heavy for MechJeb SAS could avoid it to turn upside down in reentry, a solvable but annoying situation. I could had solved this by putting a extra parachute, but that would add unwanted and unneeded mass, so, putting the parachute anchoring higher was the chosen solution ( I also not want the parachutes anchoring in the capsule in here, since it makes that the capsule detaches itself from the rest of the lander sometimes when the parachutes open. Not a big issue for this, but it would be problematic I needed to fire up again ( as in a Kerbin return from another planet ) and it is better to not learn things wrong \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ). It did not solved the issue completely, but it mitigated the issue enough for MechJeb SAS to be able to cope with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OPo2T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OPo2T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFiring for soft landing. I\u0027m pretty sure the ship could most likely handle a parachute only touchdown ( atleast the capsule would for sure ), but as we don\u0027t have landing legs and have fuel enough for it, better to do it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F1tSW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F1tSW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mC4tY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mC4tY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanded ship and end flight stats. I\u0027m not sure if the 7g are from the suicide burn in the Mun or due to the 6 km Pe in the return burn final orbit ( not good... too many g forces and would roast the ship if the reentry heat was on , even if the ship had a heat shield, because it meant a 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA reentry angle, far higher than the RL 6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA . Both were consequences of trying to avoid the dreaded fuel bug ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, let me point out that this is a proof of concept ship.
