I have built a few generations of such ships now, and several hundred of you downloaded my previous versions, so I decided it was time to update the designs. Primarily due to ARM parts, the part counts have been significantly reduced, and the large one now launches as a single piece and does not require orbital assembly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, these are high-end ships which require a lot of money to build, and require that one has cleared most of the tech tree. But they pay for themselves with science contracts once launched, and then can just keep going, and the tech tree is really just the start of a career-mode campaign anyway. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***************************************************************\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, here is the M117 Locomotive II class. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8RyGPYB.png\u0022 alt=\u00228RyGPYB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OeiKBaO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OeiKBaO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship has 6 docking rings for attaching cargoes: four standard rings forward, and seniors at bow and stern.

Aim for an apoapis of at least 160km, and do not transition to the final stage and LV-Ns before you have reached that altitude. The third and final booster stage will exhaust its own fuel before this is accomplished, however, so transfering fuel from the tanks of the Locomotive II to the booster during ascent will be necessary. However, once that apoapsis and most of orbital speed has been attained, pump any remaining fuel back into the Locomotive itself, and eject this final booster stage on a suborbital trajectory which will not leave it as space junk. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K7f0oaD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022K7f0oaD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, circularize orbit on the LV-Ns.
