The middle one is a big red, nothing fancy, just my standard fuel load with plenty of ports to handle it with ease, but the idea is that they are interchangeable, and make my fuel storage and transportation highly modular, and compatible with the rest of my fleet. In the back, and you can\u0027t see it very clearly, is the Miner. It has enough Oomph to land on Duna, and enough Delta-V by itself to lift a full orange tank back to orbit from there without touching its fuel (four nukes, two drills, a X200-8 fuel tank, a small crew cabin, a heavy converter, and assorted crap to make those work in a compact package basically). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it already has to carry the heavy drills to the surface, I save on tanking for kethane by also putting the refinery there and doing the refining in-situ as I extract it.

Basically only for roleplaying, it\u0027s pretty much just a place where I can store orange tanks (2x Sr. docking ports, 2x Jr, 2x Normal) and dock ships, and pretend there\u0027s enough hab space to support the mining crews. It also carries another sensor to continue mapping, and the Miner launches with two tiny independent RCS probes that can go into more inclined orbits to hunt the polar deposits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you get a whole standard Kethane mining operation for pretty much anywhere (except Eve, Tylo, and Laythe, it can mine from anywhere at a profit, and it can still supply mission going to those places from other nearby moons) in just two launches (one for the miner with a tank, another for the station with some fuel to get started on the way, about 3,5km/s for the first deployment).
