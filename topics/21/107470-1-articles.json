The Dalek form is just too top-heavy in the KSP physics engine, even when I clipped in extra stuff in the bottom. (Did you know: Radial parachutes are one of the most dense objects in KSP). Even when I engaged SAS, it still didn\u0027t work... .\\_. Oh well, cool idea anyways. Free cookie to anybody that can make it work."}]}
