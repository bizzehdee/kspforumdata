However, Kerbin\u0027s utter lack of birds, or any wildlife, for that matter, quickly shoved this project on the back burner for the Kerbal Media\u0027s spy program. It remains a quality aircraft, however, fully functional in all regards. Tailstrikes are virtually impossible, thanks to Tail-Gear Embedding^tm^ technology. It can get to a decent altitude as well. Just be careful when leveling out... it\u0027s a beast to turn at high altitudes.\n\nThe down-angled cockpit ends up with quite a nice design feature: not only can you see the runway better when landing, but pointing your level indicator at the horizon actually keeps you going upwards, instead of leaving you sinking into the deep blue of Kerbin\u0027s seas, or the jagged peaks of the nearest mountain. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n[*DOWNLOAD LINK*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jc3gxyvie1a9d6p/RAS-909%20%27%27Kyrian%20Wing%27%27.craft?dl=0)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
