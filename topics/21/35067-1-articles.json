Not things that were designed to not work, but stuff that accidentally didn\u0027t work at all. Not really any other rules, just post failed builds you think are amusing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first \u0022excellent\u0022 design is this crane for use on the Mun. I tested it on Kerbin and found no flaws with it. But note that this is the 2.0 version which had RCS in order to get unstuck, the first one didn\u0027t have RCS and just stood on the platform like this, unable to get away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RCS doubles in function, to get unstuck, and to get stuck again when you want to pick up something else from the platform. It spent its entire tank of RCS in two trips, meaning I would have to pick up one tank of fuel between every crane-job, and that is IF it had the ability to transfer RCS fuel, which I am pretty sure it doesn\u0027t. So it could do TWO jobs, then it was useless. But the \u0022beautiful\u0022 thing about the design is that it had the handling of a wild horse in low gravity, so with patience, and skill, and luck, you could do ONE trip without ending up in little tiny pieces scattered across the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i42.tinypic.com/21vd5.png\u0022 alt=\u002221vd5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here I managed to tip over the one crew module I had managed to place.

The first was only a near-roll, the second picture was from later on (3 minutes later). I used RCS to try to correct it in the second one, which only resulted in flying about a bit, before landing upside down (I\u0027m an ace RCS pilot as you can tell, even forgot to put on docking mode).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/dpv41j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dpv41j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/976ywl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022976ywl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere I finally dropped the flawed design I previously tried to fix twice.

And in order to get the magnet over the middle of the thing on the platform, you must approach the platform from the taller side, and you must have the platform in an odd-angle, not at a perfectly water-level area. The rocket at the back which doubles as a counter-weight is my solution to get the crane off the platform, because the wheels are placed too wide. I would lie if I said the wide stance makes it stable, I have already rolled one of these (having lifted and placed one thing). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I only put ONE thermoelectric generator on it, so while I lift stuff with the electromagnet I have a tendency to run out of electricity, which I have done twice thus far. A genius design indeed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Note that I didn\u0027t add any electric generators to the platform, so that runs out of power also, so I have to use hyperedit to just top it up once in a while (I really can\u0027t be bothered fixing that, and the hassle serves as punishment for my bad design).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPPS: The only good thing I can say about my cranes is that they are quite sturdy, the weakness in the first is that the RCS tank don\u0027t have struts so its the first thing to fall off, and the second crane falls over well before it lifts anything heavy enough to destroy it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-27T23:49:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2013 11:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ronny\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T00:37:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RfCLPcK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RfCLPcK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorked fine on Kerbin... landed with only one broken wheel on Duna. maybe 1m or driving and bam! flipped on back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve stopped using those wheels for anything but the lightest of rovers on the lightest of gravity moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plan for a circular station was never going to work.

Basically I thought it\u0027d be fun to fly one of the stock aircraft with the basic engine removed, two radial jet engines from the B9 pack on the top, and a solid fuel booster where the engine used to go. The theory was this might be able to create a plane that could get into orbit easier, maybe getting some sort of gravity boost off the sun or something I dunno. First couple of times the aircraft would flip out of control like a mad beast, looping around and spinning end over end until the fuel ran out and it crashed. Then I hit upon the idea of instead of wrestling to stop the made somersaults, just try something new, so what I did instead was just spin the aircraft, like a bullet from a rifle, and sure enough it was stable (albeit spinning like a drill). When the fuel in the booster ran out I managed to land the plane again using the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t want to use the aircraft again, my guess is that it\u0027s carrying about a ton of Kerbal puke in the cockpit now.
