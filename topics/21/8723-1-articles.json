Unfortunately I forgot to snap some shots of it in action, but you can see the mission report. Obviously it can be improved. ASAS was an after-thought, for example. Not exactly sure at what point I was doing 8,409m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from the mission report, I screwed up the Mun launch and ended up on a huge orbit. There\\\u0027s enough fuel in the return stage to deal with bad Mun launches and still come in for a nice landing, a measly 3.1G maximum altogether. I think that was at launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProblems:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The lander stage might be a bit thin on fuel. You don\\\u0027t have to be super careful but I managed one inclination change and had a small bit left over to assist the return, not that it needs assistance. I\\\u0027d imagine it might be a bit tight if you have to boost PE to get into an orbit around the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The middle rocket burns out about half way to the Mun so you\\\u0027ll be left with a piece a debris in space, and use the lander stage to get you the rest of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) It\\\u0027s a bit unruly going up but nothing that can\\\u0027t be controlled manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeedback for a noob?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-26T20:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo ASAS modules are not needed, only one of them has any effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
