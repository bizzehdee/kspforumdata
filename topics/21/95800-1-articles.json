I\u0027ve made a rather bad version of it that will somewhat fly. You have to pull up hard after you run off the runway and keep correcting upwards. Also, if you wish to go down, you have to dip down below the horizon slowly or else it will enter an irrecoverable tumble. It has some extra parts to allow some form of flight. Can someone make a better version and share it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/195l20hrajg292x/Osprey_1.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/195l20hrajg292x/Osprey_1.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MCqPQ9F.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MCqPQ9F.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T09:52:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks inteesting-I\u0027ll see what I can do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
