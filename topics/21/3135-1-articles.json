The reason for the separated engines is because I have a Munar mission in mind, the first one is for getting into orbit of the Mun and slowing down, the next will be the lander once legs are out. The speed configuration would mix the two, obviously. I went straight up on the top speed bit because that\\\u0027s how I measure top speed and that\\\u0027s how the great velocity race did it too IIRC. This 12000km pic WAS an orbit, by the way. It had a Pe around 200km and an Ap of about 13000km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use RCS modules ALOT (docking mockups, staying with jettisoned stages, messing around with them as kinds of hovercraft jets) but not when I don\\\u0027t need them. They would be useful for lunar landers, if it proved to hard to stop all horizontal motion for landing without them (From my preliminary tests with radial decoupler legged landers it\\\u0027s not that bad without them, actually). And if docking is implemented for orbit rendezvous before heading to Kerbin, then I\\\u0027ll put them on, but I refrain from doing so until the need arises. And in the case of a final stage, same thing. Only if they prove mandatory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, no need to assume I don\\\u0027t understand these things. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-22T20:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHumans have never gone to he moon on a manned mission without some sort of orbiting mothership (like Apollo) and came back.
