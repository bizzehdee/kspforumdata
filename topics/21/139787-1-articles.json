It flips out when I try to drive it. Is there a solid, reliable design for a majority of celestial bodies?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"teag2","CreatedById":119694,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T23:50:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure, but wheels are know to be buggy in the latest version. If it looks reasonable and doesn\u0027t work, chances are they are just glitching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T06:22:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it flips increase the spread of the wheels in relation to each other. Keep the center of mass low and add a reaction wheel but remember to set the sas to sas only. No pilot input or it will flip even more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T23:21:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis (eventual) exchange of craft has been moved to Spacecraft Exchange.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
