You can do it in anything from a 10,000 tonne monster to a 11.5 tonne spaceplane if you are clever enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I would recommend a fairly large interplanetary mothership - one which can insert itself into orbit around Moho or Eeloo directly from Kerbin with payload attached. I would also recommend that you have an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E lander so you can refuel at Moho or Eeloo, as well as separate ships for Eve, Tylo and Laythe (these can be combined if you are able). Of course, I didn\u0027t do any of that (see my signature).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RevanX_LSR","CreatedById":216972,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-14T11:56:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse a medium sized (100 ton) spaceplane to bring a large tank of nuclear and conventional fuel into space, and assemble a separate lander for Eve and Tylo. \u00A0You can use the spaceplane to land on Laythe if you want. Make a basic lander for all other bodies that can make it in a single stage and send it off to interplanetary space with a nuclear rocket. make it re dock to the mothership (nuclear rocket) and return to the mega tank and repeat for all the bodies. You may end up using more than 100 tons. If you are afraid of fuel shortages, prepare an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E module for refueling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the other bodies are very easy to land and return, so you only need a simple design. to save fuel, use two 400 tanks and a nerv motor offsetted 2/3 the way into the tanks. This gives you space for landing legs. Use an mk1 command pod with parachutes (not necessarily, this only helps for duna). Ensure your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETwR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E on kerbin exceeds 0.35 so you can take off easily on duna (which has the highest gravity), and you can even strap on a cr7 rapier engine and another small tank for laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe is the easiest of the three \u201Clarge\u201D bodies to land and ascent. Since laythe atmosphere thickens so rapidly, simply descent the following craft from low orbit just before hitting the landmass:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1x CR7 rapier engine with 400 fuel and four radial ramp intakes (the small kind), 2 wings attached in mirror symmetry to the craft, as well as landing legs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndecoupler\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1x NERV motor with 400 fuel or 800 if you used the previous design\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nparachutes. enough to slow you down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nonce you land, hope you land on flat ground and ascent back up vertically until 5km, then turn sideways and accelerate until 500m/s, before climbing rapidly to 20km. At that point due to laythe\u2019s scale height the atmosphere is still thick but not enough to impede your crafts acceleration. Slowly climb even more until you jets fail. Then decouple and use the nerv to circularise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo: Use two stages of rocket propulsion, like an 800\u002Bdart and 400\u002Bterrier to land and ascent. Land on high points to save delta-v (not worth it however) and maintain a constant altitude of 3 kilometres over the terrain to avoid crashing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse 1x vector engine with 6400 rockomax tank and then the tylo lander-like on top. \u00A0Also put an ion stage, since you should go there separately and land before returning back to main craft, due to this crafts large size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLand on a high peak like the crater rim mountains to save delta v. they are usually at a latitude so circularise in an inclined orbit and wait for it to fall overhead. This takes trial, error and quick saving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAscend vertically up until 20 kilometres, then slowly do a kerbin like gravity turn. You should have more than enough delta-v to circularise with the third stage, so use that stage to extend out your orbit and do the first part of kerbin transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-16T00:51:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2023 12:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 16\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by JNSQFan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-14T14:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can land everywhere except Tylo, Laythe and Eve using a single, simple design: Mk1 lander can, FL-T400, Swivel with docking gubbins and power generation as needed.

I\u2019d suggest keeping the ISRUs on the main mothership rather than doing some kind of detachable refuelling rig as that would just add complexity. Your Eve lander will (probably) be one of the heaviest parts of the mission so best to get that done first, while Tylo and Laythe require the most specialised hardware due to the higher delta-V requirements and Laythe\u2019s atmosphere so should also be high on the list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
