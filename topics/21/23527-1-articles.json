As a result of repeated ski-fi (sic) movie viewings our underpaid and opressed engineers came up with the K3-C SSTO. After several tragic incidents related to such disputed concepts as \u0022mass\u0022 and \u0022center\u0022, the W-Wing was optimized to deliver acceptable performance while maintaining the crucial visual \u0022oomph\u0022 requested by prominent Kerbal politicians.
