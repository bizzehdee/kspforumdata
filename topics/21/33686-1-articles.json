It\u0027s very simple (just results in rather more complex social problems);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/zri8uDc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zri8uDch.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zri8uDch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically all you need is 1 command pod, 1 command chair and the crew manifest mod (v0.5.4.0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(the other command pods in the above cloning machine are there to provide additional kerbals to clone. Afterthought - extra pods not necessary unless you want a mobile cloning facility, as crew manifest can just load the next original kerbal into the command pod) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst move (by EVA) a kerbal out of the command pod and into the command chair. Then open the crew manifest mod\u0027s \u0027transfer crew\u0027 section and select the kerbal that\u0027s now in the chair and transfer him back to the command pod. And viola, you now have the original kerbal still in the chair and his clone in the command pod. Get the original out of the chair and get his clone out of the command pod and now you can move a 2nd original kerbal into the command chair and repeat the cloning process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to clone the same original kerbal several times but it seems the magic only works once per kerbal, but you can make as many duplicates as you have originals to hand. In the above pic are two originals and their clones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re all sci-fi fans here, I don\u0027t need to warn you about the consequences of cloning, use this \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eun\u003C/span\u003Ewisely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strategia","CreatedById":68581,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T23:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022Are you..... me?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb2: \u0022Yeah.....\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022You know what this means?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb2: \u0022Totally.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb\u0026amp;Jeb2: \u0022TWICE THE EXPLOSIONS!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022So much for being able to afford life insurance premiums.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: *facepalm*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir Nahme","CreatedById":57378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T00:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis... explains... everything!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T03:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s fascinating.
