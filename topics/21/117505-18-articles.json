The write-up, **and** the save-file.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A Duna/Kerbin free return trajectory? Hmm, I\u0027ve never plotted one myself but how hard can it be? You just have to find out the perfect time to reach Duna. There must be information here about this kind of maneuver.\n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E OK looking into this the only examples of a Duna/Kerbin free return I can find involve simply performing a massive burn taking you close to a Duna encounter and out way past it back to Kerbin. That sounds like a crappy way of doing it. But it does the job, and if you do not perform an intercept burn you would simply return to Kerbin. It would be a long return though but this sounds like a simple way to do it.\n\nOk Majorjim, for you, and anyone else who may be curious about the what, how and why, here\u0027s some introductory notes before getting into the specific steps for this project.\n\nTo begin with, you\u0027ll need this: [\\[WIN\\] Flyby Finder V0.82 \\[KSP1.04\\]](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80978-Flyby-Finder-for-KSP)\n\nUnlike [KSP TOT](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476-WIN-MAC-KSP-Trajectory-Optimization-Tool-v1-5-0-Optimizations%21), it finds **all** flybys that match the user\u0027s specifications.. KSP TOT will only pick the one \u0022best\u0022 flyby it can find.\n\n*Flyby Finder* is Windows only, but it works fine running on Wine, so it can be used on Linux and Mac without any problems, if you have Wine installed. I haven\u0027t tried *KSP TOT* with Wine yet, but I think it\u0027ll work ok. Be aware that if it seems to not be working, it can take quite a while (as in, almost a minute!) to load and start running.\n\nAs good as *Flyby Finder* is, it doesn\u0027t provide one essential piece of information (nor does *KSP TOT*). And that\u0027s the Ejection Angle to Prograde/Retrograde. Maybe that can be calculated from the provided data, but I\u0027ve no idea how, and besides, there\u0027s another tool that can tell us, when we give it the data provided by *Flyby Finder*.\n\nGo to alexmoon\u0027s [Launch Window Planner](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/), and plug in the details of the planet you want the flyby for. Set the Transfer type to \u0027Ballistic\u0027, and click on the \u0027Show advanced settings\u0027 link. Set both the \u0027Earliest departure\u0027 and \u0027Latest departure\u0027 **to the same day**, as specified by *Flyby Finder*. Set \u0027Time of flight\u0027 to something that will cover all the bases, such as 0 to 1000 days. Click on the Plot it! button, and you will get a nice mini-display that should confirm the required delta-V as predicted by *Flyby Finder*, as well as the other details, including the all-important Ejection Angle.\n\nIf you\u0027re using a low-TWR craft like the Hermes, you\u0027ll also want to break up the many-minutes-long burn required, into smaller chunks, performed when the ship is close to periapsis. To calculate the burns and starting Ejection Angle, Red Iron Crown\u0027s [Precomputed Low-TWR Interplanetary Transfer Burns](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109670-Precomputed-Low-TWR-Interplanetary-Transfer-Burns) are brilliant. As I needed to do a modified version of his transfer burns, to avoid running into the Mun\u0027s SOI, I extended his spreadsheet to get the Ejection Angle data I needed. Anyone who wants a copy can download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qlj81n29xby7frd/MyMultiburnEscape.xlsx?dl=0). \n\nFinally, you will probably want to have a few mods installed. At minimum, you\u0027ll want *PreciseNode*, because it takes some real fine-tuning to achieve flybys. *Kerbal Alarm Clock* is nice to have, if only to keep track of SOI-changes, so you can nursemaid your ship across them. *MechJeb* is very handy to have, for the simple reason that it makes for easy setting up of nodes for the multiple burns involved, and it is better at timing burns than any human. (And it isn\u0027t fooled by KSP\u0027s wildly inaccurate burn estimates.. it gets burn durations **right**.) If you think that\u0027s \u0027cheating\u0027, then consider this.. NASA \u0022cheats\u0022 all the time. Their burns are computer controlled, because human reactions aren\u0027t quick or consistently reliable enough for accurate results. So you\u0027ll be in good company. If you install *MechJeb*, install *MechJeb and Engineer For All* as well. That way you don\u0027t need to add a part to your craft, all your craft will automatically have *MJ* or *KER* available. Speaking of *KER*, that\u0027s another helpful source of data. If you\u0027re following along with the rest of these steps, you\u0027ll also need *HyperEdit* to get the Hermes into orbit around Kerbin.\n\nRight.. with that out the way, let\u0027s get down to the specific methodology/steps needed to set up the Kerbin-Duna-Kerbin free-return trajectory for *The Dunatian*.\n\n1. Create a new game-save, then exit the game without going any further.\n2. Open the save\u0027s persistence file with a text editor (not Notepad, it adds invisible characters to files, that may mess things up). Set UT = 11146000 - This is Year 2, Day 91, Hour 0, Minute 6. Doing this will save you having to time-warp 2 years and 91 days before launching Hermes, and will place Hermes about 10 minutes before our initial burn is due to commence. Save the file.\n3. Start KSP and load the game-save. Go to the VAB and load Hermes. Add the crew, then put the ship on the launchpad.\n4. Using *HyperEdit*, put Hermes in a 100x100km equatorial orbit around Kerbin.\n5. Once in orbit, ensure the throttle is at zero, and stage the engines. Do it now, because if you don\u0027t, you\u0027ll forget later!\n6. Open the Map view, and rotate the view so that you\u0027re looking directly down on Kerbin from above, and Hermes is at the 12 o\u0027clock position.\n7. Quickly tap the . key once, then the , key once. This will stop the jittering, which will make it hard to create a manoeuvre node, otherwise.\n8. Click on Hermes orbit between the 7 and 8 o\u0027clock positions, and create a manoeuvre node.\n9. If PreciseNode didn\u0027t automatically pop up, press the p key to bring it up.\n10. Temporarily set the prograde value to 4000. This ensures we will get an Ejection Angle display.\n11. Set the UT value to 11146823.6 - This should **set the Ejection Angle to 133.3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0**. If not, use the 1, 0.1, 0.01 and \u002B/- buttons to adjust UT until you get a solid 133.3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 reading. (The reason for this value is that we need a final Ejection Angle of 136\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and from Red Iron Crown\u0027s spreadsheet, we know that we need to adjust this by 2.7\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, to allow for the 19 hours and 14 minutes it will take to do our preliminary burns, before we are ready to do our final burn at 136\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.) IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS INITIAL ANGLE BE CORRECT. TAKE THE TIME TO GET IT RIGHT.\n12. Set the prograde value back to zero. Do not move or adjust the node in any way. The node is going to be the foundation of our periapsis for all subsequent burns, and it has to be in exactly the right position.\n13. Open the *MechJeb Manoeuvre Node Editor*. You can leave *PreciseNode* open if you want.\n14. Make sure that auto-warp is enabled, set the MJ prograde to 100m/s. Click the Update button.\n15. Click the Execute next node button and wait until MJ has completed the burn and cancelled the node. The orbit\u0027s apoapsis should now be 240km.\n16. Close the *Manoeuvre Node Editor*, and open the *MechJeb Manoeuvre Planner*.\n17. Select \u0027Create Node\u0027 -\u003E \u0027Change Apoapsis\u0027 to 419km at \u0027Next Periapsis\u0027. Click on the Create and execute button. Wait until MJ has performed the burn and cancelled the node.\n18. Repeat step 17, six more times, raising the apoapsis in turn to 658km, 987km, 1471km, 2250km, 3708km, and finally 7409km.\n19. Next comes the fun/tricky part.. the final burn. This burn is performed 66 minutes after the ideal window specified by *Flyby Finder*, because if we burned exactly at the launch window, we\u0027ll hit the Mun\u0027s SOI, and our altered course will smash us into Kerbin. The one hour delay allows us to sneak past the edge of the Mun\u0027s SOI without touching it. So we\u0027ll need to make some minor corrections to our course to take this delay into account.\n20. Close the *MechJeb Manoeuvre Planner.* Enter the following settings into *PreciseNode*. UT = 11216020. Prograde = 501.5. Normal = -10.3. Radial = 0.\n21. The Ejection Angle will be flickering, but it should average about 138\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\n22. Zoom out, and set Duna as your Target. If you\u0027re lucky, you should already see a pair of closest approach markers. Due to small variations in burn times, etc, most likely you\u0027re going to have to tweak things. You\u0027re aiming to get a closest approach in the vicinity of 60,000km.\n23. By means of the 1, 0.1, 0.01 and \u002B/- buttons, carefully adjust the UT until you get a close approach. As soon as you have one, use the MS (Memory Save) button to record the settings. This way, if you mess up, you can get it back by using the MR (Memory Recall) button.\n24. Continue to tweak the closest approach lower and lower until you have it down around 60,000km, **saving the settings each time you get an improvement**. Sometimes, one click will make it a tiny bit worse, then another click will improve it even more, so don\u0027t stop increasing or decreasing the moment you see a change in the wrong direction.\n25. At the end of the burn, we\u0027re going to sneak that 60,000km down a bit lower, but for now, press AltF5 and create a named quicksave. If you mess the burn up, you\u0027ll want to be able to AltF9 to try again.\n26. Now that PreciseNode has set up the burn,use *MechJeb\u0027s Manoeuvre Node Editor* to execute it. This will be a long one, at 3 minutes and 9 seconds. However, we DON\u0027T want MJ to execute the final few seconds of the burn, because it **will** mess things up, if you allow it.\n27. MJ will throttle the burn down when it gets to the last 2-3m/s. When it gets to about 1m/s remaining, click on the Cancel/Abort execution button, and cancel the node. The closest approach will probably show something in excess of 100,000km. We\u0027ll handle the fine-tuning ourselves.\n28. Hit t to enable the SAS in Stability Assist Mode. This will make sure the Hermes stays aligned on the burn axis.\n29. Press AltF5 and create a named quicksave. I suggest using the current closest approach distance as the name of the save.\n30. Keeping the mouse pointer over the close-approach markers, **gently** tap the Shift **once**, to barely fire the engines. When the approach reduces by about 10,000km, quickly hit the x key to kill the engines, and then make another named quicksave.\n31. Repeat steps 29 and 30 until you get the distance down to the low 50,000\u0027s. This is as close as it\u0027s safe to get. We need to stay out of Duna\u0027s SOI, or we\u0027ll get our course messed up big-time, but at the same time, we want to be as close as is possible to make rendezvous easier for the DAV. Duna\u0027s SOI begins at 47,922km. My personal best closest approach is 51,900km.\n32. When you\u0027re happy with the distance, make a quick-save, and set an SOI alarm with *Kerbal Alarm Clock*. Time-warp to the SOI change, and shepherd the Hermes across.. now save again.\n\nAnd that\u0027s it!

At minimum, you\u0027ll want *PreciseNode*, because it takes some real fine-tuning to achieve flybys. *Kerbal Alarm Clock* is nice to have, if only to keep track of SOI-changes, so you can nursemaid your ship across them. *MechJeb* is very handy to have, for the simple reason that it makes for easy setting up of nodes for the multiple burns involved, and it is better at timing burns than any human. (And it isn\u0027t fooled by KSP\u0027s wildly inaccurate burn estimates.. it gets burn durations **right**.) If you think that\u0027s \u0027cheating\u0027, then consider this.. NASA \u0022cheats\u0022 all the time. Their burns are computer controlled, because human reactions aren\u0027t quick or consistently reliable enough for accurate results. So you\u0027ll be in good company. If you install *MechJeb*, install *MechJeb and Engineer For All* as well. That way you don\u0027t need to add a part to your craft, all your craft will automatically have *MJ* or *KER* available. Speaking of *KER*, that\u0027s another helpful source of data. If you\u0027re following along with the rest of these steps, you\u0027ll also need *HyperEdit* to get the Hermes into orbit around Kerbin.\n\u003E \n\u003E Right.. with that out the way, let\u0027s get down to the specific methodology/steps needed to set up the Kerbin-Duna-Kerbin free-return trajectory for *The Dunatian*.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Create a new game-save, then exit the game without going any further.\n\u003E 2. Open the save\u0027s persistence file with a text editor (not Notepad, it adds invisible characters to files, that may mess things up). Set UT = 11146000 - This is Year 2, Day 91, Hour 0, Minute 6. Doing this will save you having to time-warp 2 years and 91 days before launching Hermes, and will place Hermes about 10 minutes before our initial burn is due to commence. Save the file.\n\u003E 3. Start KSP and load the game-save. Go to the VAB and load Hermes. Add the crew, then put the ship on the launchpad.\n\u003E 4. Using *HyperEdit*, put Hermes in a 100x100km equatorial orbit around Kerbin.\n\u003E 5. Once in orbit, ensure the throttle is at zero, and stage the engines. Do it now, because if you don\u0027t, you\u0027ll forget later!\n\u003E 6. Open the Map view, and rotate the view so that you\u0027re looking directly down on Kerbin from above, and Hermes is at the 12 o\u0027clock position.\n\u003E 7. Quickly tap the . key once, then the , key once. This will stop the jittering, which will make it hard to create a manoeuvre node, otherwise.\n\u003E 8. Click on Hermes orbit between the 7 and 8 o\u0027clock positions, and create a manoeuvre node.\n\u003E 9. If PreciseNode didn\u0027t automatically pop up, press the p key to bring it up.\n\u003E 10. Temporarily set the prograde value to 4000. This ensures we will get an Ejection Angle display.\n\u003E 11. Set the UT value to 11146823.6 - This should **set the Ejection Angle to 133.3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0**. If not, use the 1, 0.1, 0.01 and \u002B/- buttons to adjust UT until you get a solid 133.3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 reading. (The reason for this value is that we need a final Ejection Angle of 136\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and from Red Iron Crown\u0027s spreadsheet, we know that we need to adjust this by 2.7\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, to allow for the 19 hours and 14 minutes it will take to do our preliminary burns, before we are ready to do our final burn at 136\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.) IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS INITIAL ANGLE BE CORRECT. TAKE THE TIME TO GET IT RIGHT.\n\u003E 12. Set the prograde value back to zero. Do not move or adjust the node in any way. The node is going to be the foundation of our periapsis for all subsequent burns, and it has to be in exactly the right position.\n\u003E 13. Open the *MechJeb Manoeuvre Node Editor*. You can leave *PreciseNode* open if you want.\n\u003E 14. Make sure that auto-warp is enabled, set the MJ prograde to 100m/s. Click the Update button.\n\u003E 15. Click the Execute next node button and wait until MJ has completed the burn and cancelled the node. The orbit\u0027s apoapsis should now be 240km.\n\u003E 16. Close the *Manoeuvre Node Editor*, and open the *MechJeb Manoeuvre Planner*.\n\u003E 17. Select \u0027Create Node\u0027 -\u003E \u0027Change Apoapsis\u0027 to 419km at \u0027Next Periapsis\u0027. Click on the Create and execute button. Wait until MJ has performed the burn and cancelled the node.\n\u003E 18. Repeat step 17, six more times, raising the apoapsis in turn to 658km, 987km, 1471km, 2250km, 3708km, and finally 7409km.\n\u003E 19. Next comes the fun/tricky part.. the final burn. This burn is performed 66 minutes after the ideal window specified by *Flyby Finder*, because if we burned exactly at the launch window, we\u0027ll hit the Mun\u0027s SOI, and our altered course will smash us into Kerbin. The one hour delay allows us to sneak past the edge of the Mun\u0027s SOI without touching it. So we\u0027ll need to make some minor corrections to our course to take this delay into account.\n\u003E 20. Close the *MechJeb Manoeuvre Planner.* Enter the following settings into *PreciseNode*. UT = 11216020. Prograde = 501.5. Normal = -10.3. Radial = 0.\n\u003E 21. The Ejection Angle will be flickering, but it should average about 138\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\n\u003E 22. Zoom out, and set Duna as your Target. If you\u0027re lucky, you should already see a pair of closest approach markers. Due to small variations in burn times, etc, most likely you\u0027re going to have to tweak things. You\u0027re aiming to get a closest approach in the vicinity of 60,000km.\n\u003E 23. By means of the 1, 0.1, 0.01 and \u002B/- buttons, carefully adjust the UT until you get a close approach. As soon as you have one, use the MS (Memory Save) button to record the settings. This way, if you mess up, you can get it back by using the MR (Memory Recall) button.\n\u003E 24. Continue to tweak the closest approach lower and lower until you have it down around 60,000km, **saving the settings each time you get an improvement**. Sometimes, one click will make it a tiny bit worse, then another click will improve it even more, so don\u0027t stop increasing or decreasing the moment you see a change in the wrong direction.\n\u003E 25. At the end of the burn, we\u0027re going to sneak that 60,000km down a bit lower, but for now, press AltF5 and create a named quicksave. If you mess the burn up, you\u0027ll want to be able to AltF9 to try again.\n\u003E 26. Now that PreciseNode has set up the burn,use *MechJeb\u0027s Manoeuvre Node Editor* to execute it. This will be a long one, at 3 minutes and 9 seconds. However, we DON\u0027T want MJ to execute the final few seconds of the burn, because it **will** mess things up, if you allow it.\n\u003E 27. MJ will throttle the burn down when it gets to the last 2-3m/s. When it gets to about 1m/s remaining, click on the Cancel/Abort execution button, and cancel the node. The closest approach will probably show something in excess of 100,000km. We\u0027ll handle the fine-tuning ourselves.\n\u003E 28. Hit t to enable the SAS in Stability Assist Mode. This will make sure the Hermes stays aligned on the burn axis.\n\u003E 29. Press AltF5 and create a named quicksave. I suggest using the current closest approach distance as the name of the save.\n\u003E 30. Keeping the mouse pointer over the close-approach markers, **gently** tap the Shift **once**, to barely fire the engines. When the approach reduces by about 10,000km, quickly hit the x key to kill the engines, and then make another named quicksave.\n\u003E 31. Repeat steps 29 and 30 until you get the distance down to the low 50,000\u0027s. This is as close as it\u0027s safe to get. We need to stay out of Duna\u0027s SOI, or we\u0027ll get our course messed up big-time, but at the same time, we want to be as close as is possible to make rendezvous easier for the DAV. Duna\u0027s SOI begins at 47,922km. My personal best closest approach is 51,900km.\n\u003E 32. When you\u0027re happy with the distance, make a quick-save, and set an SOI alarm with *Kerbal Alarm Clock*. Time-warp to the SOI change, and shepherd the Hermes across.. now save again.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And that\u0027s it! (I bet when you asked me to note the steps needed, you didn\u0027t think it was gonna be *this* complicated! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif))\n\u003E \n\u003E You can now time-warp to a few days/weeks before Duna closest approach, and use *HyperEdit* to place all the various assets on Duna.\n\u003E \n\u003E The game-save (and associated quick-saves) in which I did all the above, can be downloaded here:\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://www.dropbox.com/s/hcs5j4gy6rbmf6z/The%20Dunatian.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hcs5j4gy6rbmf6z/The%20Dunatian.zip?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\u003E The save also includes the \u0022fixed\u0022 Hermes craft, now properly balanced, a hitherto unused tank (the adapter behind the Hitchhiker Container) has had fuel added, and the essentially useless monoprop in the capsule has been removed to save a little weight.\n\nOK I wanted some time to reply to this properly.

I think figuring out the correct timing and course is going to be tricky..\n\nOnce I began, I realised the above was not the correct approach. I should make any required course corrections for the Duna portion of the journey, before attempting to return to Kerbin. Otherwise, I wouldn\u0027t know if Hermes actually carried sufficient delta-V.\n\nOn reaching the flight\u0027s mid-point, I checked for the close-approach markers, and as expected, they were gone. Hermes would pass 900,000 km ahead of Duna. A little under 80m/s of prograde correctional burn would be necessary to get a suitable flyby, though this would naturally result in Hermes missing its\u0027 Kerbin encounter later. I was expecting this, as the same thing happened on my first attempt. Crossing orbits ahead of Duna was a nice bonus (my previous attempt passed behind Duna), as it would make things a little easier for the DAV to rendezvous. Experimenting with various approaches, I was able to get to within 2,500km of Duna\u0027s surface, along the way spending 9 hours in Duna\u0027s SOI. A nice side-effect of passing through Duna\u0027s SOI was that the gravitational pull nudged my trajectory back 50,000km closer to Kerbin\u0027s orbit, saving me a little fuel on my later correctional burn to rendezvous with Kerbin.\n\nAs a result of this testing, I was able to determine the factors that would be necessary for a successful rendezvous with the DAV. At the 2,500km periapse, my slowest surface speed relative to Duna was 2,900m/s. By the time I\u0027d left Duna\u0027s SOI, that speed was in excess of 5,450m/s. Though I didn\u0027t think to check, when I entered Duna\u0027s SOI, my speed at that time would have been similar. So ideally, a DAV launch should be timed to encounter Hermes at periapse. Once we have some idea of the necessary flight time involved, this will simplify the setting of a KAC alarm for the DAV launch.\n\nAfter departing Duna\u0027s SOI, I course-corrected for a Kerbin encounter, and set off in pursuit. On entering Kerbin\u0027s SOI, I set up a burn to bring my periapse down to around 100km. On setting up a circularisation burn, I discovered that I was approx. 800m/s short of what would be required. Deciding that a wildly eccentric orbit was better than none, I fired up the engines to see what would happen. The orbit closed with literally only 40m/s of delta-V remaining! My final orbit was 145km x 15,000, with dry tanks. Had I not been able to save 40m/s due to the Oberth Effect when departing Kerbin, I would have failed to gain a capture, and the crew would have been doomed to orbit the sun, somewhere out near Duna\u0027s orbit. Talk about cutting things close!\n\nFor my next experiment, I\u0027m going to try a mid-course correction that will allow me to pass behind Duna, instead of in front. The delta-V penalty for the DAV should not be too severe, and I\u0027m curious to see if it will prove to be more fuel-efficient for the Hermes. The main problem that I can see at this stage is that Duna\u0027s gravity will nudge my orbit 50,000km in the wrong direction if I make the same kind of close approach on the opposite side of Duna, than I did this time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T11:33:56Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 11:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JAFO**"},{"CreatedByName":"JAFO","CreatedById":132901,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T11:30:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I will trust you on this, I was just repeating something I saw on another thread.\n\nI had a feeling you\u0027d gotten the idea elsewhere.. Think of it this way.. you\u0027re in a lander above Duna. You\u0027re dropping towards the surface, and you have a proper west-east motion of 100m/s. Duna has a west-east motion of 30m/s. Your effective motion relative to Duna\u0027s surface is 70m/s. So if you cancel 70m/s of your sideways motion, relative to Duna, you are now stationary and falling straight down.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you have 100m/s of east-west motion, your effective motion relative to the surface, which is moving in the opposite direction to you, is now 130m/s. To become stationary relative to the surface, you now need to not only cancel your 100m/s of sideways motion, but you need to dial in 30m/s in the opposite direction.\n\nWhen you launch off the surface of Duna, because you were previously in contact with the planet, you have 30m/s of west-east motion automatically added to your sideways vector when you lift off. If you also fly west-east, that 30m/s gets added to any sideways velocity you feed in from your engines. If, on the other hand, you took off east-west, your true sideways vector is 30m/s less than your relative surface velocity would suggest.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is it still a flyby at the edge of the SOI of Duna?\n\nNo.. my fear of entering the SOI turned out to be unjustified. Because of the relative closing speeds involved, a few hours spent in Duna\u0027s SOI has only a relatively small effect on Hermes\u0027 trajectory. In fact, as my report above shows, if passing ahead of Duna, it can even have a positive effect on Hermes\u0027 course. This means we can get much closer to Duna, which I\u0027m expecting (pending empirical testing) to make the DAV rendezvous easier.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also I was thinking that when the physical possibilty of it is proven, when you set up a new file, you can simply add the velocity using Hyperedit rather than doing all the pe kicks.\n\nThanks for the suggestion.. I\u0027ll give that a shot at some point. It would certainly help with the extremely tight fuel budget. We could handwavium it away by suggesting that the *Taiyang Shen* resupply mission included some additional propellant mass.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We have to add a counterbalanced DDV to Hermes yet as well, plus a non encumbered version for the pickup.\n\nHmmm.. I\u0027d always assumed that the MDV was sent on ahead to Mars just like with the MAV and supplies.. not that it was ferried by the Hermes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ares 4\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s MAV spent eleven months getting to Mars. It left before us and got here around the same time we did. As expected, Martinez landed it beautifully. It was one of the last things we did before piling into our MDV and heading to the surface.\n\n I imagined that, after (or before) remote-landing the Ares 4 MAV, Hermes rendezvoused with the Ares 3 MDV in orbit, the crew transferred, and then descended to the surface. However, the book doesn\u0027t actually say if Hermes ferried any other vessels or not. Though now that I check, there is a kind of implication that the Hermes carries the MDV, in the way they were discussing stripping down the Ares 4 MDV for a rescue mission, at one point. If so, the MDV would have been mounted on the forward airlock, rather than one of the two airlocks located just abaft of the rotating crew quarters.\n\nFortunately, that\u0027s more of a logistics problem for you, than for me..

Think of it this way.. you\u0027re in a lander above Duna. You\u0027re dropping towards the surface, and you have a proper west-east motion of 100m/s. Duna has a west-east motion of 30m/s. Your effective motion relative to Duna\u0027s surface is 70m/s. So if you cancel 70m/s of your sideways motion, relative to Duna, you are now stationary and falling straight down.\n\u003E If, on the other hand, you have 100m/s of east-west motion, your effective motion relative to the surface, which is moving in the opposite direction to you, is now 130m/s. To become stationary relative to the surface, you now need to not only cancel your 100m/s of sideways motion, but you need to dial in 30m/s in the opposite direction.\n\u003E \n\u003E When you launch off the surface of Duna, because you were previously in contact with the planet, you have 30m/s of west-east motion automatically added to your sideways vector when you lift off. If you also fly west-east, that 30m/s gets added to any sideways velocity you feed in from your engines. If, on the other hand, you took off east-west, your true sideways vector is 30m/s less than your relative surface velocity would suggest.\n\u003E \n\u003E No.. my fear of entering the SOI turned out to be unjustified.

Tested landing and ascending in the MAV, which is an SSTO, the second stage is completely superfluous, if we need some extra dV we could just ditch the second stage engine and decoupler. Also if you fill the landing stage that has enough TWR and dV to get you a pretty good head start, the MAV could probably come back to Kerbin on it\u0027s own easily. The Delta II and Pathfinder are...good, it\u0027s fiendishly difficult to pilot the SRB booster on the probe and get it just right, but thats what you get for authenticity. I am trying to add more resources on the probe to make injection easier but every bit of weight I add to the nose affects the balance of the whole craft giving it a horrible rotation. Not sure what to do with that one.\n\nOh I also tested the Ares V and cargo delivery which went without a hitch, impressed a friend no end.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n![SwYmGDK.png](http://i.imgur.com/SwYmGDK.png)\n\n![hqpBejl.png](http://i.imgur.com/hqpBejl.png)\n\n![vFn7O8d.png](http://i.imgur.com/vFn7O8d.png)\n\n![rkRdYNm.png](http://i.imgur.com/rkRdYNm.png)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nBetter picture of Pathfinder on it\u0027s way to Duna\n\n![4rrGbeo.png](http://i.imgur.com/4rrGbeo.png)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nEntering Duna\u0027s atmosphere ready to ditch fairing and deploy chutes\n\n![24tny1I.png](http://i.imgur.com/24tny1I.png)"}]}
