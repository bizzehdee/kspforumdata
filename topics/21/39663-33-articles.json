For version C, I abandoned the ramp for a bunch of retractable ladders where the craft would have to kneel to load \u0026amp; unload. That resulted in a look of an unpressurized cargo bay with the rear cargo doors being invisible to anything that passes through. Finally, in version D, I went for a combination of retractable door \u0026amp; ramp using the DTS-M1 transmitters bound to an action group. Unlike the ladders, the antennas block stuff trying to pass through it until opened. The door is considered stowed so the MK3 cargo bay must be opened to use it. The ramp can be used at any time.

The case seems to be that the struts are connecting to the fairing base plate itself, because apparently while they do have colliders the sides don\u0027t count as parts (in which case this is not, in fact, a bug, but rather a simplification in programming). Thus the struts will remain visible and continue to function even if the fairing has been opened, until the payload physically detaches from the fairing base (decouples or undocks).
