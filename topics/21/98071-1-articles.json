Going both ways the KT-3 can haul over 300 tons to the Mun and back, and over 100 tons to Duna and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KT-3 is perfectly balanced and 6 reaction wheels make it pleasant to manoeuvre. The shape prevents tumbling during aerobraking, though the fact that it contains many low drag parts means you have to dive much deeper into the atmosphere than would be expected to slow down enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4b8eWNE.png\u0022 alt=\u00224b8eWNE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch is easy with the pair of boosters, though I\u0027d recommend that you get a good height due to the average TWR of 0.44. Some fuel is needed from the main ship to complete the orbit so refuelling is recommended to get the most out of the KT-3. Once in orbit any cargo can be attached onto its several docking ports which are spread around the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rayGqB1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rayGqB1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor testing I decided to set up a Mun colony after the failure of previous attempts. The new joint system proved easily adequate to prevent an wobble at all during the burn despite only using standard docking ports! The payload consisted of; 4 satellites, 2 landers, 2 rovers, 2 rocket cranes, and Rune\u0027s surface base pack. Less than a quarter of the fuel was needed to go from LKO to LMO where base deployment could commence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStats: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts: 110\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Mass: 113 Tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Height: 4.6m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Width: 4.9m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Length: 24.1m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: 146, 000 Kerbits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR: 0.44 fuelled\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Nodes: 4 jr, 7 standard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Powerplant: 8 LV-N\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Seats: 5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV (m/s) / payload (tons):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8345 - 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8000 - 2.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7000 - 12\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6000 - 25\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5000 - 43\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4000 - 70\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3000 - 115\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2000 - 185\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1000 - 492\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy haulin\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELauncher included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/18uQgGC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bit.ly/18uQgGC\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volcanix","CreatedById":117245,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T18:38:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E100 tons to Duna sounds really nice!
