This lander can land on kerbin, the mun, or minmus, and is using the 3 person command capsule, so you can do rescues with it. There is a ladder going from the pod all the way down the side of the ship (using two deployable ladders to cover the gaps between stages/the ground) so you need not sacrifice lives just to perform a rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes to orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen flying this ship into orbit I recommend that you set your target orbit to 150km, have the orbit turn finish at 100km in edit path, and have it stop staging at stage 6. At 10km, as it begins the gravity turn I recommend turning on RCS to prevent control loss due to excessive rolling. When stage 6 occurs, allow the outer ring of engines and tanks to clear before activating the next stage, or a collision will occur, destroying the majority of the ship. After stage 6 has shed, rcs should no longer be required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes when Landing on kerbin: The lander itself with full fuel *cannot* successfully land on kerbin. You will need to burn off about a tenth of the fuel in the outer tanks before mechjeb can land you. Also note that once the outer tanks have emptied you *cannot land* on kerbin, even by staging the outer tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, note that the command pod *does* have an rcs tank attached to it, so if you are unlucky enough to have run out of fuel in orbit of kerbin you can jettison the lander entirely and slow your orbit enough using the rcs jets to parachute down to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig image of the ship on the pad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jFbKW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jFbKW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlakJak70","CreatedById":88347,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-28T20:32:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for sharing, looks nice.
