The way you distributed the weight/thrust should keep it steady and stable during descent and landing. My only issue is the ascent module. It doesn\u0027t look very stable. If I had to guess, the center of mass is somewhere in the middle. It should be lower if you want a stable flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thobewill10","CreatedById":6148,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T01:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery Nice.
