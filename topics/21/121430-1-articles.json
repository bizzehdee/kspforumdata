Grabbing units work very well but are extremely hard to get to align well and if you have them radially arranged it\u0027s hard to get them to all engage. So combining the two and relying on the physics warping of x4 accelerate I can get a perfectly aligned connection with all the grabbing units engaged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere needs to be sufficient reaction wheel torque or RCS thrust in the craft you are pushing so that it is not completely being steered from the tug but apart from that it can run on 100% thrust and stay perfectly on what ever node is assigned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[TUG - Action Groups]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 middle radiators (6 total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 angled radiators (12 total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 tensioning gear (18 total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7 docking lights (2 total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 arm grabbing units (6 total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9 release/decouple grabbing units (6 total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[space Station - Action Groups]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 start fuel cells (4 total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 stop fuel cells (4 total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 toggle gigantors (4 total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0 toggle antenna (4 total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7 docking lights (2 total)[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TABLE]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/itVn1Pp.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022itVn1Pp.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECraft files:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve included some basic launch vehicles that will get the Tug and the Station to a 125k circular orbit with about 3/4 fuel remaining so will need a top up from space planes etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are still beta so if anyone wants to test them out please let me know any bugs and I\u0027ll look into them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I\u0027ve taken some liberty with assigning resources to adapter pieces on the space station so that the part count is lower and so that there are less things to click during refueling procedures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the tanks on the tug have been converted to Liquid Oxygen keeping the amount standard as per mk2 tank sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station will hold 14 Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/swo3rx94bacg5xm/beta_SS.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebeta_SS.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/wcb93syjcsh5hsp/beta_TUG.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebeta_TUG.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-26T03:13:13Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2015 03:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aegeas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T18:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T23:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis will solve a lot of issues people have with large ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manek22","CreatedById":99501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T00:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks awesome.
