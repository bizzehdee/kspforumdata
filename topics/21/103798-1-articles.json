With the use of- **Bamboo-Stageing** it squeezes out the last Delta-V. It can transport two payloads with 7,8 tons and land them with the included lander stage safely. It includes a docking module for a return stage from a planet-rover to deliver science home to Kerbin. For this use the emergency decoupler before rapid spontaneous disassembly occurs.\n\n **Operational Manual:**\n\n - Slow 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 turn advised\n\n - If desired, fire liquid engines at the beginning with minimal thrust (10 %)\n\n - SRB should get you above 10 km.\n\n - If flown correctly, no Delta-V from the Orbiter is used to get into Kerbin Orbit.\n\n* * *\n\n**The KeSOIEV (Unmanned)**\n\nKerbin SOI Exploration Vehicle (Mk.

It has a low center of mass and a max speed of 18.4m/s. With its various [experiments](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114246-Moar-Science-experiments!-Really-are-there-more) on board, we hope to find new interesting facts about our neighboring moons. With the build in RW and RCS even flipped rover can be returned to his functional form. When flying over slopes the rover is capable of conducting low orbit science. Karbonite detection was recently added. The rover features a **return stage** who is able to get into a stable orbit and rendezvous with the KeSOIDeS to return non-transmittable science. Also included is a lander vehicle for the descend of the rover.\n\n **Operational Manual:**\n\n - The Smart Parts do most of the important work. Just get it stable 5 meters over the surface.\n\n- For Minmus:\n\n-- Don\u0027t go faster than 10 m/sec\n\n-- Use RCS to keep the rover down\n\n Automated:\n\n - Lights\n\n - Brakes\n\n - Airbags inflate / deflate\n\n - Decoupling of Lander\n\n - Activate SAS and RCS to stabilize\n\n - Switch Control to the rover\n\n - Be aware that the lander gets a bit unstable when low on fuel.\n\n* * *\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T18:41:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T23:03:10Z","Content":"These look very nice!\n\nTo link albums into a post:\n\n[noparse]\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
