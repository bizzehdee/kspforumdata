I discovered this when I was playing with super fast planes and my design broke up mid flight resulting in my pilot being in a cockpit that was not attached to anything at 20kms. Remembering stories of WWI pilots (who were never issued parachutes as top brass believed they encouraged cowardice) faced with similar situations I decided to exit the cockpit, and to my surprise the pilot was okay after falling into the sea... It seems to me that as long as the vehicle is subsonic you can get away without burning up. Supersonic skydives tend to end up in the kerbal disappearing in a puff of logic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAttached are the screenshots I took.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/DmoqO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/DmoqO\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WuZewSE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WuZewSE.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Z94VNES.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z94VNES.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-16T01:16:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2017 01:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Andetch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Epictures added correctly\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Optimist","CreatedById":151904,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-17T13:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbals have a ridiculously high impact tolerance of around 30 m/s, while their terminal velocity in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is around 25 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andetch","CreatedById":173643,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-18T00:05:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell whatever the numbers (I am more seeing what I can actually do rather than what the numbers say) you gotta hit the water......
