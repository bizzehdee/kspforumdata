I also have spent a long time on it pretty much since 0.18 came out. I literally only succeeded three days ago with \u0022Polaris Express\u0022. Some things I found that are important: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir for the engines. Add intakes till you can get to at least 25000 before stalling the air breathing engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe aware you will probably reduce throttle on your air breathing engines as you near the edge of the atmosphere. Keep reducing to keep the IntakeAir in the green, but don\u0027t continue reducing if you 1) begin to descend, or 2) begin to decelerate. That would be the time to switch to rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour flight control surfaces will likely become less effective in the 15000 range, so kick on the RCS at that time. Have enough RCS thrusters so that SAS can maintain positive control of the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spaceplane needs to be balanced and STAY balanced - I have been putting COL and COM on top of each other, or COM slightly ahead for stability reasons. If not balanced - the various lifting surfaces will bve fighting one another. Never use fuel to balance a CRAFT. Have fuel on COM or perhaps two tanks equidistant from COM. A fuel balancer can be helpful for the latter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t climb out of the atmosphere - you need more lift. We\u0027re not rocketing out, but lifting out (more than not). Lift is a function of how much wing area you have, and how fast you are travelling (thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, you need a lot of wing, a lot of thrust to give that wing lift, and a lot of air intakes so the air breathing engines can be used as long as possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENEVER (almost anyway) switch over to rocket power till air breathing engines are unusable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck out my video of the Polaris SSTO and make sure the annotations icon is on, I put a lot of comments on there.\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/9iPdz_EuQqQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/9iPdz_EuQqQ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-21T01:19:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2013 01:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KissSh0t","CreatedById":57142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T01:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is one of my SSTO\u0027s showing the center of weight, lift, and thrust to give you an idea of something that works very good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs fuel drains from tanks, weight shifts, so you will want to create a craft that... as the fuel drains, the weight does not shift back or forth or from side to side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I have stripped my ship of it\u0027s wings so you can see what is underneath, as you can see I have made an array of air intakes so the higher it goes, it will be able to have air right up to and slightly over an altitude of 30000.
