Voyager 1 did flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, then only several years ago became the first human object to leave the solar system and enter interstellar space. Unfortunately, we only have Jool in our system, so no glorious ring shots.\n\n**Craft Info:** 79 parts, 2 tons\n\n**Craft Download:** (Mediafire) [Link](https://www./?6zs92ndy8958x85)\n\nPics:\n\n![jGEEN39.png](http://i.imgur.com/jGEEN39.png)\n\n![WvWrquF.png](http://i.imgur.com/WvWrquF.png)\n\n![bEisrMy.png](http://i.imgur.com/bEisrMy.png)\n\nThanks for viewing, and leave some rep if you enjoyed! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T21:28:20Z","Content":"Is it actually balanced?
