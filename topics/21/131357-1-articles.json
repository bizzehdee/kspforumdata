Here is a\u00A0quick video of my Superfluously Rotating Recoverable Boosters. Made with a measly 108 stock parts, these useless beauties make some kind of vague helicopterish movements before crashing....I mean landing. They are supposed to rotate independently of the rest of the booster, and they did in testing, just not in this recovery test, that also took way too many tries. I can\u0027t think of any good reason to use them, I just kept working on them until they worked, mostly. You must be doing less than 25ms to deploy the blades successfully, the boosters themselves are actually quite powerful, but who needs 108 parts in a booster. I am wiping my boots of them for a while, If you want to continue the obsession, the craft file is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6gbi4omighqajJ4SUd1bXdQNzA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJk010si2XA?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Oh Yeah, thanks to Majorjim for the Thermometer hinges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-04T12:53:37Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2016 12:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by selfish_meme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T13:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts a great concept dude, I will definitely have a look at this and see if there is anything that can be done to get them rotating separately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XB-70A","CreatedById":144985,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T14:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReminds me the Roton concept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"winged","CreatedById":143617,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T14:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least it didn\u0027t explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T19:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just had a peek.

There are three sets of four wheels in it, but it still get lateral movement. I have seen it turning faster than any other bearing part I have ever seen, but that happens very infrequently. The blade angle is a problem as well, more angle gets the bearing moving quicker but also provides less braking effect to the booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
