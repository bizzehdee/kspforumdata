Today was my first day able to just sit down and play KSP all day. So I built and researched a ton of stuff, and my KSP feels like a whole new game with all the mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo where to start first? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jbT4zIS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jbT4zIS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my Direct Express. It was built a couple different ways. I used to call it the DTSO, but I like this name better. The first stage sends a little over 18T on a sub orbit by going strait up. I found mechjeb incredibly useful with this. Not even for piloting but rather as my engine control unit (ECU) so I can get a good bit more out of the jet engines for the first few 16KM. I use mechjeb now more out of laziness since this is my main shuttle and I have used it at least a dozen times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XI4gRdm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XI4gRdm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the orbital stage can get a little over 5T to orbit. I switched to the Radial aerospikes since I can\u0027t have a exposed engine with deadly reentry. The other *slightly* less realistic has a very low ISP and a ISP of 390s is very much in the realm of a upper stage rocket today. Actually with the new rocket parts my direct express needs to use struts less often. Normally only when I have to send up a orbital tug. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CAz49as.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/CAz49as.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso I have the beginnings of a interplanetary spaceship. It needs more a refuel port and some kind of lander, but the modular system means I can re arrange the parts to make a better ship later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I don\u0027t have here is my set of minning rig that will be using the Kerbal attachment mod to process Kerthane on a Munar base.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
