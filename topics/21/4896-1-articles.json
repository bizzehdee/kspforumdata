With a huge fuel capacity, and space for a large cargo bay, it has a far greater capability than the Sparrowhawk, but its military implications are limited. It is possible that it could be used for Mun missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TohVf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TohVf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
