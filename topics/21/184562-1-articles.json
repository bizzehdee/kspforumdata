After months of refinements, I think Phoenix Lambda might just be the one.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPros:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-\u0026gt; Very stable in flight with tanks both full and empty. Easy to maneuver and simply fun to fly. No unnecessary drag generated\u00A0by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E having to keep pitching up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt; Given its size and mass, its drag is minimal.\u00A0Everything that can be put into a cargo bay has been put into a cargo bay. On Kerbin, this puppy can glide at an angle of just 10\u00B0 to 15\u00B0 without losing speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt; Gets easily into orbit with some 2800 m/s delta v left. Just pitch up to 10\u00B0, activate the Nervs at around 15,000 meters and press 1 to switch rapiers to their closed cycle mode when they hit thrust of 100 kN and lower. Wait till your apoapsis reaches 70,000, then hit 1 again to kill the rapiers. Done. You\u0027re in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt; No parachutes, no air brakes, no ladders. Due to the design of the craft, it doesn\u0027t\u00A0need any. Phoenix can land on Duna using just its wings and the Vernor engines mounted from the bottom. If you need to get back to the cabin from an EVA and cannot use your jet pack, simply retract your front wheel and the craft will kneel for you to climb onto its nose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt; High stability on the ground. The craft is equipped with one landing gear in the front for steering and\u00A0four rear landing gears ensuring it will survive even some of the most violent landings. It is also equipped with small side gears for extra stability. Phoenix can drive on a difficult terrain at speeds up to 80 m/s on Kerbin, 30 m/s on Duna and 20 m/s on Mun.\u00A0Who needs rovers anymore?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt; The rear forked wings, other than looking cool \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E and enhancing in flight stability, also serve as landing struts for bodies without atmosphere. Due to their position, the craft will always end up\u00A0on its wheels\u00A0with no assistance from the pilot. No more space planes stuck on their backs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt; Two drills and a small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E on board. Mining is lame, I know, but the freedom of choice where to go next is addictive. Phoenix landed on Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike, Dres, Laythe, Val and Pol in a single mission, before safely returning to Kerbin. With full tanks, it boasts some 4,000 m/s of delta v in vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt; Seats for 6 kerbals and a wide spectrum of science collecting devices.

Those Nervs are no Mainsails...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt; No landing on Tylo and no getting back from Eve.
