So, I compromised, and came up with the Hexa series of jet powered rockets. Confused? KER sure was. But, after \u003Cs\u003Eyears\u003C/s\u003E \u003Cs\u003Eweeks\u003C/s\u003E three days of development, I eventually produced one that worked. Introducing, the Hexa-2b.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/PL3kL/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdentical to the Hexa-2, except for the fuel structure left on the pad after launch. This gives the rocket/jet/whatever enough fuel to stay on the pad until the engines have finished spooling up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll update this post with an instruction manual when I have time, but for now there\u0027s just a few simple guidlines:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0After you take off, the jets will start to lose thrust. I don\u0027t know why this happens, but the only solution seems to be to fire up the rocket engine, and turn it off when the engines reach 130 kN of thrust.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt seems to work best if you do an extreme gravity turn. You can probably push 45 degrees once you get above about 10-12 KM.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt will have very little fuel left after making orbit. Or, more specifically, it will have very little oxidizer. To refuel it, you\u0027ll need to use a klaw-equipped refueler, since I couldn\u0027t fit any docking ports on it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis ship was primarily meant as a test/proof of concept. If you find a more efficient flight path, or an alternate use for the ascent stage, please tell me!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/RocketSquid/Hexa-2b\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/RocketSquid/Hexa-2b\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-25T15:49:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2016 03:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RocketSquid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
