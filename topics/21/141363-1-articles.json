It was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft in the 1960s by Lockheed and its Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence\u00A0Kelly Johnson was responsible for many of the design\u2019s innovative concepts. During aerial reconnaissance missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes to allow it to outrace threats. If a surface-to-air missile launch was detected, the standard evasive action was simply to accelerate and outfly the missile. The SR-71 was designed with a reduced radar cross-section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SR-71 served with the U.S. Air Force from 1964 to 1998. A total of 32 aircraft were built; 12 were lost in accidents and none lost to enemy action. The SR-71 has been given several nicknames, including Blackbird and Habu. It has held the world record for the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft since 1976; this record was previously held by the related Lockheed YF-12.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can see the prettied up version in my short film Cold War Blackbird below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n81 parts \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/SelfishMeme/SR-71-Blackbird\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/o8ZqD/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4UASgXSLig?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exothermos","CreatedById":41827,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T05:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally fun video! \u00A0Your models are fantastic. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yaeah","CreatedById":98009,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-15T05:21:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m really diggin the plane man, excellent job on the video as well!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
