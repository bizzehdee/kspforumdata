Choose infinite fuel. After physics kick in, start your engine. Make sure the motion dampers are switched on (Action Group 1). This enables the brakes on the rear wheels of the testing cart. Without it, the needle may never stabilize! \n\n\\*Go to your required settings (throttle, mixture, supercharger, blower pitch, prop pitch, WEP) and wait until the needle stabilizes. Read the position of the needle and remember it or write it down.\n\n\\*Stop your engine and activate the basic jet engine(s) at the rear of the 2x2 plate. Use the popup and the thrust limiter to adjust and read the values, once the needle stabilizes at the same location. You\u0027re done!\n\nFrom this test I know my PO8RE with Standard Prop 3R32 produces 183kN at sea level and my PO2R with 2 blade prop produces 25 kN (the PO2R is included on the test stand as an example)\n\nTips: \n\n\\*Sometimes it helps switching the motion dampers on and off again, to get a more accurate reading. Especially with weak engines or very heavy engines. Losing weight from the fuel tanks helps as well but not too much, the mass works as a damper as well, reduces vibrations and oscillations from wild engines.\n\n\\*For very wobbly engines, a second set of motion dampers may be enables, Action Group 2.\n\n\\*The large fuel tanks behind the scale are to draw the camera nearer to the scale, since camera position is set by mass.\n\n\\*Two standard props are included, they are fine for testing - not for flying. Both left and right turners. The props have 3 blades, 3 segments per blade, 5 times stacked. Blade angle is 32 degrees. \n\n\\*If you want to fly with these props, increase prop pitch to at least 45. During flight, highest speeds are possible at angles close to 90 degrees at the expense of acceleration and climbing. Perfect for diving!\n\nUpdated to version 1.1!\n\nChanges: \n\n\\*Larger scale for engines that turned out to be producing more than 150kN, second read-out jet engine added.\n\n\\*Included standard propellers for testing, both left and right turners. \n\n\\*Added a subtle joke.\n\nDownload link: [http://kerbalx.com/crafts/1325](http://kerbalx.com/crafts/1325)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T01:09:35Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 01:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Azimech**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T18:07:43Z","Content":"Download is live!"},{"CreatedByName":"Adester","CreatedById":131235,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T18:53:59Z","Content":"\\*sigh\n\ni have to give someone else reputation, befor i can give some to you... could you please be a little less awesome?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T18:59:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Download is live!\n\nAaand there goes your rep.
