Weighing in at 157 tons and made from 294 parts she can carry 11 Kerbals into LKO, refuel and then travel to wherever you need it to go. Simply fly up to 25km, fire the big engine and then fly into orbit like a rocket! It also has a couple of LV-N engines for interplanetary travel giving you around 7000 DeltaV, although burn times are fairly long. The main engine can give you around 3200 DeltaV if you want to get somewhere in a hurry!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/j5lqkjJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022j5lqkjJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RUkEbq4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RUkEbq4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SN6Ip5V.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SN6Ip5V.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HK4HPQa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HK4HPQa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHotkey 4 deploys the ladders so the passengers can board her without trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/RnCuC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

All fuel drains from the outer fuel pods first, then the 2nd front fuselage section, then both the front and back main tanks and finally the central main tank. All engines will drain fuel in this order ensuring the centre of gravity stays put however much fuel is left. The front fuselage fuel section, (above the hitch-hiker containers), is empty and it is recommended not to fill it for balance reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/bvo2u7347bvh39a/Astraeus_I.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file here.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eorin","CreatedById":79133,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T21:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell done, i like it very much!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb Cubed","CreatedById":70444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T17:47:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is really nice, a lot different from the other wingless VTOL\u0027s, which I am not a big fan of.
