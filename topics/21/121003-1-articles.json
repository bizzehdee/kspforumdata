I really like the combination of Turbojets and LV-N, it seems like they are meant for each other by using one type of fuel. Anyway, I\u0027ve had some issues building the smallest spaceplanes. I tried at first using a single LV-N and two Turbojets but the LV-N didn\u0027t have enough power to get a 17T craft to orbit. The LVN TWR was just too low at ~.55. Maybe I wasn\u0027t flying it right, but I tried many times. I read around and saw that most people use 2 LV-N and a single Turbo. I tried that and indeed the craft was able to reach orbit, but I didn\u0027t like how I had to use 2 LV-N which were expensive and also very heavy. Once in orbit the extra LV-N would be dead weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution was to have a single LV-N and a single Turbojet to have the smallest plane possible. But there is one major problem: You can\u0027t have them both face the same way without them being offset from the CoG which causes the plane to flip. The solution: stick the other engine on the other side and have them face opposite ways! I made an airframe that doesn\u0027t change CoG with fuel consumption and the CoL in the same spot. I didn\u0027t use any control surfaces and opted to use 2x medium stabs. The result: A light spaceplane with a single LV-N, and a single Turbojet. It flies very well and has about 1000 DV left over once in orbit. It\u0027s not done yet, but the proof of concept works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to fly it: Very simple. Not the most optimal but fly at a 30 degrees until the jet cuts out by itself then flip the plane over (sideways, not over the top!) and ignite the LV-N. Also the pod is facing the way of the LV-N, so control from there once you switch. Very stable plane. Haven\u0027t tried re-entry but that\u0027s usually easy to solve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Lb4KJzd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Lb4KJzd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have other ideas for small 1 LVN and 1 Turbojet plane designs?
