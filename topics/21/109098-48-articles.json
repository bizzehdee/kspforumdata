That\u0027s a very high number; usually I make my designs so that they have at most 0.7 tonnes per square meter; more often, I shoot for 0.5 tonnes per square meter (comparable to the Concorde or Space Shuttle orbiter). High wing loading is going to give you better high speed performance, but it also gives you high takeoff and landing speeds; with a wing loading that high, it wouldn\u0027t surprise me if your stall speed is above 200 m/s. It may be what I\u0027m seeing in your stability screenie there isn\u0027t inherent pitch up tendencies, it may be that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E can\u0027t calculate reasonable stability figures because Mach 0.35 at zero meters altitude isn\u0027t producing enough lift.

With that you will also approach the runway at a much lower angle of attack, which will help on holding it together while breaking.\n\nThere are a lot of engines on that, are you really sure you need that many?

My own self, I tend to stick to a standard flying tailplane design (i.e. fuselage mounted but with a full-motion horizontal stabilizer) to fight Mach tuck; pretty much all the craft in my *Auk* spaceplane series have that setup. The exception - the *Auk V* - is a tailless delta, and its pitch characteristics suck.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E So, what kind of plane are you wanting to build?\n\u003E \n\nWhenever I am designing one of my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E(heavy lifters in the range 100-1000 tons), once I am done with initial fuselage form, fuel tanks and rough engine sizes I switch over to wing configuration. Dihedral delta wing, that fits into 5 mach shock cone, seems like a no brainer as it provides as much lifting surface as possible, while minimizing drag at transsonic speeds and increasing plane stability. For example, a couple of my latest designs,:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/kbhtJvZ](https://i.imgur.com/kbhtJvZ.jpg) - Do not mind red numbers, I fixed them by raising wing position.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pikHVuu](https://imgur.com/pikHVuu)\n\nHowever, when it comes to designing vertical and horizontal stabilizers I do not have any algorithm to choose, which one fits best. I still tweak their size to have stable aircraft, but when it comes to choosing tail configuration the only guideline I follow is that my plane looks good. In the first picture I went for T-tail and this resulted in a very stable plane overall. Second craft received two vertical angled fins on engine nacelles(similar to blackbird configuration) and it kind of worked too. \n\nSo, I am looking for guideline to chose the optimal tail configuration, depending on craft geometry, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E position and so on."}]}
