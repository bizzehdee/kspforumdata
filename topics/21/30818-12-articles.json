This should move your center of lift far back enough to stabilize the plane, since planes with centers of lift right where the center of mass is usually fly like they have a \u0022dead zone\u0022 where the nose just drifts all over the place\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason you lost control (I think) at 27km is because those three big fuel tanks in the wings (they are fuel tanks right?). Two of them are located in front of the center of mass, which means that when they empty (and they\u0027ll be the first to empty, since the ones farthest from the engine empty first) your center of mass will travel backwards, since the tanks at the front are now empty and weigh less. Right click on the part and drag the fuel slider down to see what I mean. Anyway, because your center of mass moves back behind the center of lift, the plane becomes even less controllable that it was before until it gets to the point where it wants to fly backwards so much that you can\u0027t correct it with SAS or control surfaces, and it just flips around all over the place\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no way to tell the game to transfer all fuel into the engine from all attached containers equally, so I try to keep all of my fuel tanks aligned with the center of mass, so my center of mass doesn\u0027t move when they drain. I also make sure that my cargo bays are both the same distance apart from the center of mass as well.

THEN when you load your ship onto the runway, right click on every docking port (or set up a hotkey in the hangar) setting them to not allow fuel crossfeed. This stops the tanks transferring to each other and forces them to all transfer into the wing, and they all transfer fuel into the wing at the same time instead of one by one, and then the wing transfers the fuel to the engine, which it is directly attached to with the fuel line (make sure the fuel line is attached to the ENGINE, and not the fuel tank in front of it, and make sure that it\u0027s separated from the fuel tank in front if it with that big docking port that\u0027s set to not allow fuel crossfeed)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-26T23:22:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2014 11:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tripod27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T01:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor FAR spaceplanes TAC fuel balancer is near-essential - it will balance tank drains while keeping some full or empty, letting you move fuel around while it\u0027s doing that.

The craft had pretty serious yaw issue at subsonic speeds but it wasn\u0027t uncontrollable. The craft is a bit twitchy at low speeds, but that is because the CoL is SO close to the CoM. The only problems I had with it was it had a great deal of drag, more than most of my design, by about a multiple of 5, most of my SSTOs only have a .02-.03 drag rating in FAR. But that comes with experience and time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight profile I used was my standard flight profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClimb at best speed to 12km.
