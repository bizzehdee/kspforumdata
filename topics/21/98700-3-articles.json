It\u0027s mostly done but I have discovered the reason for the main problem most helicopter designs have and that is the rotors bending in one direction. This problem slowly magnifies until either the rotors break or get ripped out of the bearings. It looks like the problem occurs when moving forward and it is due to the front sweeping rotor getting more lift than the back sweeping rotor and the front sweeping rotor ends up with more lift and bends upwards and vice versa. Adding canards on the ends of the rotors can solve the problem if placed correctly but I have to analyse exactly how the works so I can replicate this more precisely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T13:45:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I dislike control surfaces on helicopter rotors / propeller blades.

The collider mesh is a simple one with only 8 sides I believe - and I used 8 wheels. Thus creating a rubbery joint between fuselage and beam that\u0027s jerking back and forth, lowering max rpm and losing a lot of energy due to drag. I used struts to remedy this, the mass of the propeller blades pulls the rest through. Widening the gap between the wheels and fuselage didn\u0027t make it less, it made it worse.

Take a look at the Juno D211D--I use the 1x1 panels, which support collisions up to 80 m/s. I also make sure that if they collide, they\u0027ll hit the i-beams (not the jets!), which also have a 80 m/s impact tolerance. This ensures that I get jams (or in severe cases, the shaft dislodges), but no explosions. It does require a *slightly* larger engine space to have the jets above the i-beams, but I consider it a good tradeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the plates is they are big, so they\u0027ll start impacting sooner than the smaller blades you use right now. To solve that, I tilt them in the Juno engine, which increases the gap between the i-beams (and therefore, the max speed) before they start colliding. Interestingly enough, testing shows little or no loss of RPM by tilting the panels, which I would not expect. As a result, the Juno doesn\u0027t explode during overspeed conditions--only jams--and usually is recoverable from jams with a throttle down. You can probably use this strategy to make your engine indestructible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only time I\u0027ve gotten an engine explosion is from diving with the Yak at 160 m/s. I\u0027m not sure the cause, but I think the shaft might be ramming into the rear of the engine--Juno was designed for a puller prop. I think there\u0027s a parts collision at the rear of the engine, as it\u0027s stressed for pulling forces, not pushing ones. I tested adding rear wheels to make it work as a pusher, but adding more wheels lowered the efficiency slightly, so I never kept those modifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedshift also recommended strutting the turbine blades to the shaft, as this might help separation. I haven\u0027t really worked with it much, as tilting the blades resolved all of the issues for me, but it\u0027s something you might try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you\u0027re getting vibrations, you might try strutting the wheels holding the structural fuselage together. Reducing their vibration goes a long way to making a much more smooth running engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-24T16:04:45Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2015 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lothsahn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T16:50:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t worry. I use the M650 I-Beam, those have an impact tolerance of 80 as well. Strutting the blades doesn\u0027t help at all I\u0027m afraid.
