From an economic point of view, it is cheaper to have a very large mobile fuel station that you can move anywhere you need it and dispose of it once its fuel has been used up, instead of making multiple smaller launches. However, the Hyperion fuel hub (what I call the actual station module) can double as a fully functional space station so it is up to you if you decide whether to keep it in orbit and refuel it once it\u0027s empty, or drop it and launch another one to replace it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/UzYK9mnp0xU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock craft download: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/012BRi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://goo.gl/012BRi\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-19T10:10:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2014 10:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GoodGameHunter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Megalodon 720","CreatedById":108146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T18:37:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHoly Kraken!
