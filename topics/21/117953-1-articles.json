Before the dawn of the domestic suited wide-bodies (A330 and such), the B757 was good for medium-haul and domestic flights for both low-cost and higher-class airlines.\n\nIt is no longer in production (boeing y u do dis T-T) but it\u0027s life continues with the airlines still operating the old aircraft. \n\n![xBPggMk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xBPggMk.jpg)\n\n![j6VLadi.png](http://i.imgur.com/j6VLadi.png)\n\n![GdAtAdE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GdAtAdE.jpg)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/lmPWfhO1LAU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThe Boeing 767-300:\n\nThe more advanced sibling of the B757, the 767 was a widebody variant with a better range. It\u0027s avionics are similar to that of the 757, so they share a common type rating (meaning that pilots who operate the 757 can pilot the 767 without additional training.)\n\nLuckily for us, it is still being produced to this day.\n\n[![brvJNo4.png](http://i.imgur.com/brvJNo4.png)](http://imgur.com/brvJNo4)\n\n![2Bsy8ls.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2Bsy8ls.jpg)\n\nhttp://www./download/pcp9i17o3thc5s5/Boeing_B767-300.craft\n\nDownload link - Boeing 767-300\n\nThe Boeing 777-300ER:\n\nThe most advanced of the three models, boasting fly-by-wire systems and much more range, the Boeing 777 was a legendary aircraft, a huge advancement for Boeing. It\u0027s current legacy will continue on, as more and more versions are developed. (777-9X, anyone?)\n\n(And yes, the Mk3 Cockpit looks horrible on it.

I spent a fairly huge amount of time making them - About two to three months since the start of the project.
