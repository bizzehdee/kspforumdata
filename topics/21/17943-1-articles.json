Can you advice on this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested it by flying to mun, orbit it, flying to minmus, orbit it, make an escape out of the Kerbin system, went about double the destance of kerbin-kerbol. Only then did I have to switch to lander-engines. I dunno if it can land and take off from anything larger then a moon, but if the planets are closer it should be easily do-able. It has two booster stages, one stage with 6 normal liquid engines, one stage with the big liquid engine and then a lander stage. 3 man capsule and you only have to use the RCS for the first 3 kilometers after take-off. After that it\u0027s totally stable and responds very well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the lander engines I managed to make it back home and land safely. Lander engines are the final stage, but I think it\u0027s possible to make a stage on top of the lander-stage to be able to escape from any planet propperly. Also I wanted to land on minmus on the way back but sadly it wasn\u0027t on a propper alignment and I didn\u0027t want to waste fuel and not be able to get Neilin (and his companions) back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice on how to post a picture of it and the craft-file? If I have to upload it anywhere can you guys share a link?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iZINC","CreatedById":41100,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-27T15:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eupload it to medifire (google that if you don\u0027t know) also you can take screenshots in ksp but I don\u0027t remember the key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen mediafire will take you through the steps then give us the link.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maxed-Rockets","CreatedById":27598,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-27T16:09:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EF1 will take screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
