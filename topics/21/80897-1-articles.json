While developing rockets especially for heavier payloads i thought it would be cool if i could get the test rockets back to KSC later. Yet the parachutes are too small to really land large main stages and even if you get them down at reasonable speeds they usually still disassemble as they slow dive into water (splashdown should give you a merciful crash tolerance 1.5x the normal one). So i decided to slap probe cores on my main stages and to leave them in orbit. Probably i would find a better method at a later time to \u0027reposses\u0027 them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Typical main stage worth recovering looks like this for example. I usually launched them without payload to determine their payload capacity (not using any mods but chatter and alarm clock).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/repo_02.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022repo_02.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly time went on and orbit filled with expensive rocket trash and i started to suffer from Kessler syndrome (lots of trash) despite it sometimes being remedied when launching KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/repo_01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022repo_01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace plane stuff got researched and i started to create space planes to transport a lot of stuff into LKO but also always with the option in mind, to get some of that stuff back. So i constructed ever bigger space planes until i got to create REPOMAN! Constructing a big plane like this was quite a challenge, getting it quite correct aligned and balanced and stuff. Unlike other space planes and transporters this one also features 4 nuclear engines for extended operations at least in the Kerbin system. Other than that it also has 12 rapier engines and can be refitted and used as a space transporter for roughly 156 max TOW too (payload with nukes installed 45t, without around 57).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/repo_03.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022repo_03.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERepomans main purpose though is to reposses and return stuff to KSC. So Repomans basic fitting is a claw. In this special version it\u0027s balanced to connect to rockomax sized trash. Once basic tests were done, Repoman started for the first repo-mission in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/repo_04.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022repo_04.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to repomans nukes it\u0027s very fuel efficient to do the final insert into orbit. And of course all other space borne operations are quite a lot more efficient than with the rapiers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/repo_05.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022repo_05.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the usual approach procedure Repoman got ready to attach to one of the old Zeus experimental main stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/repo_06.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022repo_06.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttaching a payload like this must be as precise as possible. Had to take care that CoM doesn\u0027t move too far forward or backward. The height alignment of the claw is already perfect for rockomax diameter. Although not seeing CoM while flying i guessed pretty well where CoM is. Also supporting my guess a bit with pumping fuel around. Good thing repoman has these big sidetanks since Zeus main stages were designed to arrive with as much fuel in orbit as possible. This one had 1.5 orange cans worth of fuel on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/repo_07.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022repo_07.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the reposses process had to begin, de-orbit burn went well. Intentionally overshooting KSC a bit. While turning back to KSC i started to burn the excess fuel using the rapiers in closed cycle mode. This got landing weight from 145t down to around 100t which seemed a bit safer than keeping the fuel. Also flying in atmosphere it turned out that balance was hit pretty well. Would still have had the option to pump fuel forward or backward to modify balance if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/repo_08.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022repo_08.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe approach went well. Got the plane perfectly aligned with runway. Kept SAS on to keep the inherently wobbly construction a little less wobbly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/repo_09.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022repo_09.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnock Knock!

If splashdowns would be more merciful as in allowing lets say 1.5x the crash tolerance and if there would be bigger chutes it would make more sense.
