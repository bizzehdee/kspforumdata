It may be a result of just my particular structure and rigidity of the ship. You can see my video now above. Interestingly, my framerate does not go down while recording... though, video work was what this machine was designed with in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoY\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HoY\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can help you with the part count, by taking off some struts. you have the tri-couplers installed incorrectly and have needed to overstrut to compensate \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (probably wont save you any parts, but it will be more stable to launch...)\u003Cp\u003Ealso, you dont need fuel lines from the tank to the tri-coupler. they crossfeed to engines properly(this is to refrence the LVN\u0027s not the Jet engines.

Less thrust, but those orange engines will eat up that toroidal tank in a matter of seconds. better off using rcs from a practical point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just overstrut in general. I like more rigidity and tend to over-engineer. I do try and limit the use of struts in the final stage, but on launch I subscribe to the MOAR STRUTS philosophy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an interesting video, though, incidentally, almost exactly how I originally had this ship configured when I built the MK I. However it had a number of faults that I eliminated in later versions. With the engines rotated out in that configuration, the decoupling of the engine shrouds would actually destroy 3 of my engines as the parts impacted each other. I also tried the docking clamps like that originally, but they did not have the strength to hold up the weight of the rocket and resist shear. It detonated several times on the launchpad before I removed them. Finally, I had those adapters on the ends as shown, but it turns out they make a really really weak link with the jumbo fuel tanks, and would shear off and wobble like crazy no matter how many struts I added, so I removed those too and attahed the tanks directly to the tri-couplers. I am, however, still having an issue with 2 of my engines (the left and right LVNs in the center cluster) that seem to wobble freely on the tri-coupler and overheat as if they aren\u0027t directly attached like the others. I\u0027m really perplexed as to what\u0027s causing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I do need the fuel lines. I tried it without them first (on the side booster clusters... the middle cluster needs the lines because I feed from different tanks) and the engines wouldn\u0027t fire because they were fuel deprived. That might have been before I removed the adapters as previously mentioned, though (I had them on both sides)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to limit my parts list to as bone stock as possible. I make an exception for MJ because he\u0027s invaluable (though, less reliable lately in staging analysis in the VAB, so, if I can find a mod to replace him....) RCS for those satellites would require adding an RCS tank, and of present there\u0027s no RCS tank suited to the task of use in small probes like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
