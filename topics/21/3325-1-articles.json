The last stage actually has Aerospike engines in a 7-slot adapter (long slow burn for less weight,but i might take a look at the engine type again now that you mentioned it...). The SRBs on it serve to give it a kick across the highest atmosphere layers (less air drag in that altitude).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the fins... yeah they look cool 8) i dont know about stability but this thing flies on SAS alone,i dont have to touch the controls unless i want to change course and it only waves a tiny bit around very slightly without affecting the flight characteristics...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe adapter below the actual lander is there because standard hollow decoupler was not working,dragged the whole thing with it for some reason.... and the other (stronger) adapter is just too big to fit under the lander...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only single problem i actually had with this ship is that it tended to snap between the lander and the orange fuel tank (at the SAS/RCS tanks) during orbital maneuvers before detaching the last ascent stage, i pretty much fixed that by replacing steel struts with carbon fiber ones,and adding 2 more sets of steel struts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E That was because the whole thing is too thin and top section,being more independent parts,has more RCS than the rest of it... might need some further fine-tuning but it doesnt snap when firing full burn for orbital anymore atleast...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand yeah... sorry for the wall of text ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-01T23:18:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe seriously need re-attaching capabilities.
