Welcome to **Titanium Engineering\u0027s** main craft thread. You will see photos and functions of all of our crafts below sorted in alphabetical order. A link to the mediafire folder containing all of our crafts will be located at the bottom. These are all stock planes, despite mechjeb being installed.\n\nArc Biplane\n\n![2CC227CE6E3FB72DBE3F3A35D846CBD19B1B912A](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/720918374243573921/2CC227CE6E3FB72DBE3F3A35D846CBD19B1B912A/)The Arc Biplane is a slow but sturdy plane. It is difficult to spin it out of control, but it is definitely possible. There are no action groups. Turning is slow. Handling is good. Top speed is 211.1 m/s, going at a slight incline upward. It has two RCS thrusters on the front to help provide extra control if nessecary. Warnings: This plane requires SAS to fly. Do NOT disengage SAS when landing as it will tilt forward and cannot be reversed.\n\n**Jarvis Fighter**\n\n![38589574E3F7E745D5ECC8066BA3EFC96C26D9E9](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/720918374243587918/38589574E3F7E745D5ECC8066BA3EFC96C26D9E9/)\n\nThe Jarvis Fighter is a fast and sturdy ship. I have not yet discovered a way to spin it out of control yet. It is equipped with 6 missiles. Action Groups: 1 is to activate the first two missile engines, 2 is to launch the first two missiles, 3 is to decouple the pylon and activate the next missile engine. 4 is to fire the second missiles. 5 is to eject the pylon and activate the next engine. 6 is to detach the missiles, and 7 is to detach the final pylons. Turning is quick, and testing has revealed you can preform a 180 degree turn at maximum speed. Handling is excellent. Top speed is 165.5 m/s, with full missile payload, going at a slight incline upward. The missiles can be manually controlled, and have two RCS thrusters each. Warnings: This plane may or may not require SAS to fly. This plane takes the entire runway to lift off, so pull up at the end to avoid altitude loss. Missiles are made for use in vacuum, and act as bombs in atmosphere. I personally forgot to edit the stages, but move the top stage to the bottom for it to work properly. Do not activate any other stages.\n\n**Jarvis Spyplane**\n\n![BEBB95195404583A59A0A4D1C3A497FC4F008FD9](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/720918374243622716/BEBB95195404583A59A0A4D1C3A497FC4F008FD9/)\n\nThe Jarvis Spyplane is a fast and sturdy ship. It is the original version of the Jarvis Fighter. I have not yet discovered a way to spin it out of control yet. Turning is quick, and testing has revealed you can preform a 180 degree turn at maximum speed. There are no action groups. Handling is excellent. Top speed is 313.7 m/s, going at a slight incline upward, which really shows how heavy the missile payload is on the fighter. Warnings: This plane lifts off at 110 m/s very quickly. Make sure you are at full throttle when lifting off so the speed doesnt decrease rapidly when lifting off, causing the engines to blow up on the runway.\n\n**Porpo Drone**\n\n![289C60E613F591082F74A14C3589F82E5603BC51](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/720918374243656339/289C60E613F591082F74A14C3589F82E5603BC51/)\n\nThe Porpo drone is a supersonic jet, and a sturdy one. It is difficult to spin it out of control, but it is definitely possible. There are no action groups. Turning is slow and fast, depending on your speed. Handling is good. Top speed is 1114 m/s, going at a slight incline upward. It has no RCS support. Warnings: The max speed is recorded at the moment that the plane\u0027s front intake overheats, disabling the engines. It is recommended to not go that fast, unless you are on a suicide mission. This plane receives extreme heating effects starting around 850 m/s. Be cautious with the speed.\n\n**Taurus Fighter**\n\n![6F48E960195E5D1C9C9E867BB176FEAA71FBA38C](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/720918374243670453/6F48E960195E5D1C9C9E867BB176FEAA71FBA38C/)\n\nThe Taurus Fighter is a slow, sturdy dropship/personnel carrier. It has not been found to spin out of control. There are 4 missiles with the same action groups as the Jarvis Fighter. Turning is slow and tanky to avoid the kerbals from falling out by wind. Handling is tanky. Top speed is 90 m/s, with missile payload and no kerbals, going at a slight incline upward. It has no RCS support. Warnings: Kerbals provide massive amounts of weight to the ship. Handling is tanky, so when turning be sure to also be pulling up to avoid altitude drop. This aircraft is hard to lift off. Near the end of the runway, give it a nice jerk upward to yank it off the ground, but not too steep to lose your engine. \n\nCraft Suggestions: The issues with the Taurus\u0027s stalling and slowness can probably be fixed by replacing the Rapier with a turbojet engine, or placing a bicoupler and adding an extra rapier.\n\nSuper special thanks to MINODOG101 on steam for his massive amounts of tips and assistance fixing problems with these planes.\n\nYou can contact me on steam at DarkEclipse for plane ideas.\n\nLink to all crafts: [https://www./folder/n7zjsnr0geq3z/Kerbal_Space_Program](https://www./folder/n7zjsnr0geq3z/Kerbal_Space_Program)\n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Hope you enjoy!
