However, the propulsion stage (which is jettisoned after de-orbit, leaving the spaceplane without any means of propulsion as it is not needed during the reentry and the glide to the landing point) packs a big delta-V, allowing for a Mun flyby. A modified version of the spaceplane could theoretically be used for a Munar landing. Usually, the KS-44 is launched in a piggyback configuration, on the KS-98.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KS-98 is an unmanned rocket-powered spaceplane carrier - basically a big fuel tank with wings and engines attached to it which is used to propel the spaceplane to hypersonic speeds before releasing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/hMiSKHu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hMiSKHu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quasarrgames","CreatedById":91692,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-11T03:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey this is kind of a cool idea.
