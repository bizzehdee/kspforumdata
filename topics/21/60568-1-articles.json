It\u0027s got an internal bomb bay that\u0027s bigger than 4 B-1 Lancers. But, It won\u0027t seem to get to takeoff speed. I personally engineered it, Taking all aerodynamic properties into effect. It just wont fly though. I attached solid fuel boosters to it, they got it to the end of the runway no problem, but then exploded after an overheat. UGH. It\u0027s also a good time to tell you the thing wobbles around like a drunk person on the runway. It\u0027s tail weighs about 20 solar masses, and the 10 Jet engines stuck on it could barely get it to 75 m/s.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LRROioH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LRROioH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to submit this to AAT, to replace the aging D-15 Destroyer.
