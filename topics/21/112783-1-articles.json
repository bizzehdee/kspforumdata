But simply making modules is something almost everyone\u0027s done. I wanted to do something more. So I decided to additionally create a set of Ground Crew Vehicles so that a single SSTO could launch all of the modules for a space station *without having to be recovered after every flight to add a new module*.\n\n**How the System Works: (\\*note\\* the vehicles in the album are older versions; the other pictures are of the updated versions)**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
