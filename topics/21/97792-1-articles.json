This simple craft will happily lift off the ground, or water, at speeds below 60m/s with little drama. The tough construction of the hydro-skis also mean that it can cruise on the water at speeds in excess of 80m/s. Speeds above 90m/s, on water, are not recommended and Prediction Duck will disavow any knowledge of a warranty. Turning at speeds above 60m/s, on water, is highly recommended and our R\u0026amp;D group termed it\u0027s water turning stability as \u0022Why is this not even trying to blow up? Bored now...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all seriousness. This aircraft is stable on the water. It turns nicely at speeds on the water. And it\u0027s only real quirk is that it wants to nose dive at times, but doing so only digs the skis into the water causing it to slow down. You have to really try to get the cockpit to actually touch the water or for it to actually take any damage at all. SAS, for the most part, stops this from happening. The wing floats do a very nice job of preventing the wings from touching the water as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the air, there is little drama. It likes to drop its nose due to the elevated position of the engines, but with SAS engaged, this is completely negated. It is not an acrobatic aircraft, but it does turn nicely. It is simply easy to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note: it is possible to taxi and lift off the ground with the landing gear raised. It has a low enough take off speed that the structural intakes, that make up the skis, are not damaged by being scraped along the ground. Landing with the gear raised, on the other hand, does not go well unless landing on water.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
