With the new parts, I\u0027m aiming for low part counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my first offering, a 640t payload lifter at only 170 parts with a ~16% payload ratio. It has a probe core, generator and RCS to de-orbit itself and nose cones to look fresh. If the payload has no reaction wheels, you will need to apply a bit of throttle to maneuver it for the circularization burn (it has RCS but 6 ports aren\u0027t enough to turn it very quickly). Or you can always add some reaction wheels to the lifter yourself. You can even remove all the extras to get it down to 124 parts (over 5t payload per part, booyah!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload here is just a generic refueling station at exactly 640.00t (if you notice the strange configuration of junior docking ports, that\u0027s why).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sG5HnBE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sG5HnBE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownloads\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubassembly: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16399537/ksp/Lifter%2064%20Mk%2003.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELifter 64 Mk 03.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ew/ Refueling Station (Action group 1 toggles solar arrays): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16399537/ksp/Lifter%2064%20Mk%2003%20%28Stock%29.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELifter 64 Mk 03 (Stock).craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
