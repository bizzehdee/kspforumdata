I fixed the mirrors, and spruced up the interior a bit - there is now a second reserve battery where the glove box is supposed to be, and a faux dashboard/steering wheel for the driver.

Or K-350 Super Duty.\n\nAdditional Tweaks:\n\n- Front downforce can be reduced/disabled by using right click - deploy function\n\n- If accidentally activated, all body panels now open outwards - making it look like a ventilation option. \n\n- Aux battery 1 (large pack) is default activated, preventing careless drivers from getting stranded after a few minutes of driving without FC or battery. Aux battery 2 (glovebox) kept as reserve. Tow truck operators shouldn\u0027t be bombarded by calls in the middle of the night now. \n\nMeanwhile, pics showing interior and \u0027fixed\u0027 mirrors.\n\n![XI8kr3K.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XI8kr3K.jpg)\n\n![zbvujE4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zbvujE4.jpg)\n\n![KeuZc2d.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KeuZc2d.jpg)\n\nThe craft file I\u0027m posting doesn\u0027t have the decals and the cameras of course - this is my cinematic test rig for filming driving scenes later.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T15:03:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 03:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T23:04:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Speaking of which, any plans for a King Cab version?
