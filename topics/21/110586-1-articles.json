The Luftwaffe forestalled this problem by building turbines which were made of steel with tungsten alloy sprayed over the blades to cut expenses. As a result each Me 262 needed replacement engines after just a few hours in the air.\n\nThe only way to end the problem could be changing over to ramjet propulsion, which is cheaper due to the lack of turbines or moving parts. Of course this means that the engines would have to be mounted far from any surface which could disturb airflow and flame outs would occur at IAS speeds under 290kph or 80m/s but not in KSP. The liquid rocket engine designed to give that initial acceleration is included though and the pilot is free to use it whenever he/she should choose.\n\n![S6Jtp6K.png](http://i.imgur.com/S6Jtp6K.png)\n\n**The Blohm und Voss P 209:**\n\nBlohm \u0026 Voss taking a page from the Horten brothers wanted a cheap fighter which could be made with few materials, so few in fact, that they left out a tail. There\u0027s nothing fancy about this plane but it has a very low stall speed and low drag. It\u0027s maximum speed in a straight line at 500m is a mind-blowing 320m/s\n\nIt is a fun flyer though\n\n![hvUD65S.png](http://i.imgur.com/hvUD65S.png)\n\n**The craft files**\n\n[https://www./folder/wql92qlj1jijy/1946](https://www./folder/wql92qlj1jijy/1946)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T14:02:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 02:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Halsfury**"},{"CreatedByName":"_Bugs","CreatedById":123899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T09:59:23Z","Content":"These are actually really cool."},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T14:48:21Z","Content":"Thanks, they were fun to build. \n\nI might go ahead and build some other concept planes from the same period."},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T15:32:54Z","Content":"Okay, forum\u0027s officially been taken over by flying wing designs.
