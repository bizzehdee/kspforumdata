The station is able to rotate at a rate of up to 11 rpm before structural instabilities begin to show themselves. This means that any gravity up to 1.5 Gs is able to be simulated, allowing the brave astronauts who live there to prepare for almost any mission without worry of atrophy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween work and university it took me about two weeks to finally finish this station. All the pieces are docked with two Clamp-o-tron docking ports to try and keep everything aligned, but even that isn\u0027t foolproof. Once it got down to the final pieces of the ring, it took a lot of wiggling and jiggling of the pieces of the station before all the docking ports would properly dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanman Kerman, the pilot of the tug that was used to construct the station, had a close brush with death during construction. While switching through vessels in the 2.5km radius, I switched to the tug and the cockpit decided to spontaneously and violently remove itself from the rest of the tug. Poor Danman had to evacuate and EVA over to the station before he became kraken food.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the album documenting the construction of the station from start to finish, with some IVA views of the construction thrown in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/4ItWy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
