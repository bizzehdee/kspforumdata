This version is the lightest of my Viper designs and, as such, has no RCS which means it requires the \u0022stilts\u0022 to simulate a launch tube takeoff (uses landing legs instead of landing gear)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETakeoff Instructions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Begin the first stage and throttle to maximum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once the turbojets begin to glow yellow release the stilts with spacebar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Pull back. Hard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Soon the craft will rise and you can fly normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe warned: This craft flies relatively smoothly but due to the anhedral, it likes to roll quickly. Turns can be pulled off relatively quickly but beware that reducing throttle to tighten turns usually leads to a rapid stall. If you do stall, try to point the nose downward and activate the SAS. Occasionally the craft will \u0022grip\u0022 the airflow again and you can continue flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t be too surprised if it takes some practice to get it right, I\u0027ve found it\u0027s worth it, as it\u0027s a very fun craft to fly and can reach speeds well over 300 mps with a steady altitude increase. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding Instructions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Ensure the landing legs are deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Note the two parachutes on the rear of the craft and on the nose: you cannot perform a \u0022combat landing\u0022 with this design, you WILL lose the front skid and nacelle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Reduce throttle to 1/3 power and scout a landing area (land on uneven ground at your own peril)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. When you\u0027ve reached your desired landing point, reduce throttle to zero and ensure that you are ~200 m above where you want to touch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Hit the spacebar to deploy the parachutes. These ensure that your horizontal movement is essentially nullified and that you have a slow, even descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Correct any nose-downs and rolls during descent. Try to ensure that the rear skids touch down first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I do have a version that has enough RCS thrusters and RCS fuel to hop into the air long enough to allow the turbojets to propel the craft forward (eliminating the need for launch stilts), I\u0027m not entirely pleased with the design yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-08T21:42:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2012 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Raelsmar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efixed \u0026quot;dihedral\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;anhedral\u0026quot; for accuracy\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mchizz","CreatedById":37072,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T02:45:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWHY IT LOOK SO PRO???? lol nice plane :3:0\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thesandbar","CreatedById":41697,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-24T01:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ram nacelle at the front doesn\u0027t do anything atm, and should be at the engine, not the intake, for any effect.
