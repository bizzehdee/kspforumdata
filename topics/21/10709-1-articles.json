We\\\u0027ve yet to see any evidence of any machine achieving over 500m/s (feel free to write to us if you know otherwise).\n\nAs a result Excalibur Exoatmospheric have developed the *Hyper Streak.* Not the most balanced Kerbal vehicle as it\\\u0027s primary propulsion system consists **three** RD-170 rocket engines fueled by C7\\\u0027s lightest one metre fuel tanks (750x0.9). However apart from this oversight not a single .cfg edit can be found, and all other aspects of the vehicle are balanced.\n\nWe also switched the *Ground Interfacing Tackle* (or G.I.T.) from Tosh\\\u0027s standard cart to Tiberion\\\u0027s landing gear parts due to stability issues. Good brakes too.\n\nDue to this modification we soon realised that the vehicle could not handle anything but the smoothest bumps without launching itself skyward. This led us to seek a perfectly flat environment and we found that in the polar regions...\n\nThis led us to develop the *Hyper Streak\\\u0027s* pi\u00C3\u00A8ce de r\u00C3\u00A9sistance... the abilty to launch as a suborbital rocket, fly to landing as an aircraft before pursing the land speed record as a \\\u0027car.\\\u0027 Due to around 2 hours of intensive testing the vehicle is very stable in all modes of flight... just be sure to make your landings with lots of turbine power, you may land nose-first at high velocity otherwise!\n\nOn the pad..\n\n\u003E ![WHlxF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WHlxF.jpg)\n\nSeparating second stage liquid boosters...\n\n\u003E ![DIGNJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DIGNJ.jpg)\n\nGliding in before powered landing at the Southern ice cap...\n\n\u003E ![5B2QI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5B2QI.jpg)\n\nSuccessful polar landing...\n\n\u003E ![S01tV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/S01tV.jpg)\n\nConversion to LSR vehicle...\n\n\u003E ![uVIQT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uVIQT.jpg)\n\nReady to rock and roll...\n\n\u003E ![d5HTj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/d5HTj.jpg)\n\n*Hard* acceleration to top speed...\n\n\u003E ![cYLZn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cYLZn.jpg)\n\nFinal velocity before engine cut-off...\n\n\u003E ![BCjaj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BCjaj.jpg)\n\nJeb accidentally locked out the controls during testing of a new water speed record prototype based on the *Hyper Streak*. This resulted in the untrained occupants being launched **straight up** under full thrust. The following image was taken of the errant craft just after MECO...\n\n\u003E ![YOIjU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YOIjU.jpg)\n\nDon\\\u0027t think we\\\u0027ll be seeing those poor saps again any time soon...\n\nAs I said this isn\\\u0027t necessarily a balanced vehicle, hence the \\\u0027unlimited land speed\\\u0027 category.\n\nFurther development pending to break the 500m/s barrier. If anyone has beaten this figure without .cfg edits or ridiculous mods and have the pictures to prove it - please let us know!\n\nStay tuned."},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-17T15:31:58Z","Content":"It\\\u0027s OP, you just need 88 mph to time warp!
