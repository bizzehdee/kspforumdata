A fourth launch brought a tug to the station, which then brought the station to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, where it was supposed to remain as a parking lot for landers and a bus station for shuttles and crews destined for the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt soon became apparent that the fuel tank was grossly undersized, and there weren\u0027t enough docking ports.

It was initially going to have five large tanks to operate as a fuel depot, but when I realized that the asymmetrical docking ring and solar panels actually balanced each other perfectly, I toyed with the idea of putting engines on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus began one of my most involved construction projects yet. It\u0027s taken as many launches as Tycho station, but has also included rigorous testing along the way. Once the first four main pieces were up (the habitation core, the drive section core, the solar panel array and the docking ring) I took it on a short mission to Kerbin\u0027s two moons. After that success I finished out the drive and habitation sections and tested again. There was significant wobble, so I set out to strut the ship up using Kerbal Attachment System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, on the first EVA to install the first section of struts to the drive section, something glitched out and the main engine block exploded. I\u0027m still not sure what happened, but I didn\u0027t autosave beforehand (why would I? I was just adding struts) so those engines are just gone now. Which makes the struts that much more important, as there\u0027s no longer any thrust going directly through the centre of the ship\u0027s spine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, the original plan only called for the four outside engine blocks to have two nuclear engines each.
