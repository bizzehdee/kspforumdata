Also the first class to have armor.

Non stackable armor piercing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrigate- extremely fast light armor and weaponry. Good for lane patrols or quick reinforcements. Slightly larger than heavy fighter \u0026amp; corvette.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDestroyer- first class to have real firepower. These are a mix of frigate speed with cruiser armorment. Extremely deadly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECruiser- the first class of ships that can be used for the capital ship role. These ships carry a ton of heavy weapons and are designed to go solo into battle if they have to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMedium cruiser- just more weapons and maybe an extra layer of armor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeavy cruiser- often mistaken with battle cruisers these powerhouses often have big engines to power them. They carry guided armor piercing and often have more than one layer of armor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssault class- these monsters have little in the way of weapons, but are known to take multiple anti capital class rounds and keep going. Armor often exceeds 3 layers making them next to invincible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBattle cruiser- 2nd biggest ship in a fleet only to the battleship. It has the might of the battleship but is much smaller and often about cruiser sized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrier/ escort carrier- these ships are designed to carry light and medium fighters with the occasional heavy fighter or frigate. Escort carriers are much smaller and carry less fighters, but have better speed and maneuverability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBattleship- the final ship, the battleship dwarfs even the biggest destroyers. The shells alone are bigger than a light frigate. These things can penetrate anything at almost any range. Then only ship with more armor is the assault class.
