Sometimes craft work, just very specifically. Also, the maker will have a lot of practice flying it, you may not be able to unless you practice a lot with it.

I think it\u0027s too hard to look through every RB and figure out which ones were posted this week, so all craft in RBers but not in spacecraft exchange will not be considered.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Bugger, I already started a list and thought I\u0027ll get a head start just in case.
