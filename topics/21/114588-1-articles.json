Regardless, I felt somehow inspired to create my own replica. This was designed to be as close to its real-life counterpart as possible- nine-engine main stage with thrust vectoring engines, 3.75m diameter, which is the closest you could get to the real thing\u0027s 5m diameter, one engine second stage, even got the 13.150 long ton payload bit, too. The only deviations are the lack of recoverable stages, and I kind of had to make the landing leg lookalikes into fins because there were some serious stability issues under nuStock. \n\nI\u0027m willing to bet that with their supplied payloads, both rockets could easily be pressed into service in a Realism Overhaul game. (After actually playing Realism Overhaul, I recognize how flawed this logic is... the Skippers don\u0027t even exist in RO, but the real-life Merlin family does... I\u0027m going to go try and make a Falcon 9 in RO now.) \n\n![sR8aF7n.png](http://i.imgur.com/sR8aF7n.png)\n\nIllustrated is the Falcon 9 with payload fairing. While this version has a 13 ton payload capacity, I suspect you can pile a bit more on it because it gets into orbit with 7/8 of the second stage\u0027s fuel left. And that\u0027s not mentioning the payload\u0027s own fuel, which in this instance was designed to be a normal-looking ISS service module. \n\n![CRd4JJ7.png](http://i.imgur.com/CRd4JJ7.png)\n\nThis version features a Falcon 9 with the CrewDragon service module and crew transfer vehicle. (No launch abort system, though...) Highest part count, but it\u0027s barely over a hundred parts. Also has a surplus of fuel in orbit.\n\n![Fy4iRjC.png](http://i.imgur.com/Fy4iRjC.png)\n\nHere\u0027s the CrewDragon and DragonTrunk in flight. The DragonTrunk doesn\u0027t exactly fit together, but hey, it\u0027s supposed to be unpressurized... \n\n![TqYDsPM.png](http://i.imgur.com/TqYDsPM.png)\n\nThis is the proposed Falcon Heavy, which is basically just three Falcon 9s strapped together. (Yup. 27 first stage engines.) This thing acts a little... funny with MechJeb autopilot, but it acts equally odd when I tried piloting it by hand. Eh, well, it gets to orbit, just don\u0027t mind the LFBs overstaying their welcome. And that\u0027s just the booster nosecones exploding, the core stage is fine. (This version has *yet more* Seperatrons than the one I last tested, though, so it might actually not explode. Still crossfeeds funny, though.) \n\nSpeaking of payload:\n\n![t4u2zrV.png](http://i.imgur.com/t4u2zrV.png)\n\nLaunches the core of a \u0027Waypoint\u0022 class space station, with many, many docking ports on which to attach... things. (Gross weight in orbit: \u0022more than\u0022 53 tons, as per the specifications.) That second stage has about half its fuel left. (I might do something more \u0022Muskian\u0022 for the payload later, like little Duna IRSU landers to pave the way for an eventual colony.)\n\nNext up: the Falcon One, SpaceX\u0027s first rocket. \n\n![bvv7izt.png](http://i.imgur.com/bvv7izt.png)\n\nFeaturing one \u0022Merlin\u0022 (LVT-45, a Skipper would have lifted too much payload) and one \u0022Kestrel\u0022 (LV-909), this little dynamo can lift up to several hundred kilograms into orbit.\n\n![2lX0xOV.png](http://i.imgur.com/2lX0xOV.png)\n\nRequisite light payload of a fake RemoteTech communications sat. Note that there was not enough weight allowance to fit a reaction wheel, so use in an actual RemoteTech game is not advised!\n\n IRL, maximum range was LEO, but this thing could probably boot a satellite this size into full keostationary orbit or even a munar orbit, given how much delta-V the second stage has left. Notably, this makes an excellent early-career light-lifter, once you fit your own low-tech payload.\n\n[Download all four crafts here!](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a0tiiij6khls1bq/AACT1_B1-Hwwk4XVc5LbkeG2a?dl=0)\n\n(Update: Now they\u0027re all actually stock. You\u0027ll still need MechJeb, but that\u0027s close enough.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T15:15:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 03:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kagame**"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T13:48:57Z","Content":"Wow, how does this have no replies? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAwesome work!
