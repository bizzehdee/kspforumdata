Should have included a belly shot, it looks asymmetrical on the screenshots above, but if you look closely at the first one you\u0027ll see that the bridge structure, for example, is balanced by that nifty flat 2m fuel tank on the bottom (that thing\u0027s incredibly handy, since it has exactly the same mass as the pod). The only thing affecting balance a wee little bit is the front, actually, but luckily since wing panels are so light, it doesn\u0027t influence the flight behavior much (and certainly not with SAS on). The only thing still bugging me is the rather low turn speed when purely on RCS, haven\u0027t quite figured out the right configuration there yet ... with the engines engaged it\u0027s decent enough for its size, but that just ain\u0027t good enough ^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, I guess the bridge isn\u0027t too smart a choice in that position from a tactical viewpoint.

Compounding that is that unless you are firing a truly massive missile, you\u0027re not going to get all that overly large a warhead on route to the target; even if said warhead is a nuke, you still have the issue of limited number of weapons enroute to the target if firing from the ground. there is also the matter of having to get close enough for the warhead to be of any use, as in space the blast radius of a nuke is severely diminished in both radius and power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know some people are going to point out the fact that you could skip having a explosive warhead at all and go for a KEW approach; you\u0027d still have the issue of a target being able to engage the weapon before it could hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, IMO, and from reading alot of sci fi, the best Defense system would have a series of missile batteries in orbit equipped with fragmentation warheads ( throw a cloud of flak in the path of a target and have it run into it) so they can whittle away at enemies from a distance while any warships in orbit maneuver to intercept the target(s) and commence Singleship operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong thought on how Warships are always better in most regards to Planetary Defense Systems such as missiles aside, has anyone considered using a modular basis for their Warship designs? I\u0027ve been reading a bunch of Sci-fi and I came across the idea of making your warships modular IE things such as weapons, shields, troop transport capability, Singleship operations, you name it, are all modules you \u0022Install\u0022 onto a basic core structure, which would be most likely the engine section, Command and Control and crew modules; that way you could keep several different \u0022Modules\u0022 in orbit, say docked to a orbital station, with the core of the ship nearby. All you\u0027d need to do is have the core dock with whatever module you needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you had incoming Cap ships; you\u0027d simply detach whatever module you had docked (assuming its not the Antiship one), attach the proper one, and off you go! Once you\u0027ve completed your mission, be it successful or not, you\u0027d return to the station, and you\u0027d deal with the mission module as needed; reattach to the station or dump it as you see fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvantage of this design would be that unless a enemy managed to do catastrophic damage, the mission modules would take the damage leaving the core module intact and still viable; you\u0027d simply \u0022blow off\u0022 damaged modules as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisadvantage would be that this type of design is a jack of all trades; Okay at all, good in none.

Even if you used a laser, all a target would have to do is to roll the ship to keep unheated pieces of hull and armor presented to the beam point. And the death ray mirror design.... hmmmn, there is a series I was reading where they use a series of solar mirrors to take out attacking superdreadnoughts... then again, they were focusing massive amounts of power. Something on the order of a a few terrawatts of power onto a point about a meter wide. They later upgrade to a petawatt of power.

I advise reading some books like the Honor Harrington series for more on ship combat strategies.\u003Cp\u003EAnd about the laser thing.... you don\u0027t need extendable radiators; conformational strips along the hull would do the job. You could even use jettisonable heat sinks; pump the ships heat to a high thermal capacity sink, and eject it once it hit capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you want to trash cities.. use an icbm, a ship in orbit is a very roundabout and expense way of doing things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI you seriously think your railgun toting behemoth can maneuvre faster than a missile, thats fine, just sayin point defense might be a little easier \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReading your posts, I dont think were on the same page, I mean space combat between nations around earth, so a logistics craft would be a lifter of some kind, like a Soyuz,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand my point is that trying to control lower altitudes and orbits closer to home is easier done with ASATs than with death stars.
