It was as evenly balanced as freaking possible. Eventually, after three design revisions, I scrapped the SSTO name, and built a good booster for it. Works wonderfully as a spaceplane. xP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the Dragunov Mk 3.2 ( as I\u0027m calling it ) is concerned:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust how many ASAS modules do you have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI, personally, do NOT like ASAS. At maximum, I use SAS modules, and if need be an avionics cone. The ASAS wobbles too much for my liking...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also need a LOT MORE RCS FUEL. It\u0027s crucial for attitude adjustment. A really good place to put two or three tanks are right before those reversed tail-cones. ;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the subject of part-clipping, have you tried putting multiple pairs of wings within one another?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good majority of designs I used to see often involved wings that were almost indiscriminately separated, or not at all. Double-, triple-, even quintuple-stacked wing designs. What I saee in your current Dragunov Mk 3 is a distinct lack of lift vector, enough so that the weight of the NERVAs, fuel, and other engines isn\u0027t dragging it down faster than the jets can push it up. You may ALSO want to think about replacing that front wing section with another delta. Looks weird, I understand, but they are designed for lift after all. ;P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd speaking of deltas, try putting four of them together for a larger wing. Two of them can face as they do, and you can place the third along the edge of the first and flip it, extending that portion for the fourth wing. It\u0027s also a commonly-used design, but hey - it works. In most cases. xP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, those multiple control surfaces on the main wingfs could potentially be replaced by the longer one. Better for lifting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CoM most definitely moves backwards. Where you have your fuel line to your turbojets makes it so that the fuel has to empty out of the forward tank, THEN the backwards one. A good way to counteract that is to simply move the fuel line. Make it so that the fuel pulls FORWARD first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might also be of benefit to you to have both the turbos and the miniature rockets share a giant fuel source, I.E. place two opposite fuel lines between tanks. This allows either engine to use BOTH tanks, and in fact, is what I did with many of my designs for my \u0022SSTO\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, try replacing your small solar panels with ones which extend outwards. They generate a LOT more power in the long run, AND can swivel to face the sun - a must-have for the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really, REALLY like this design a lot. All of what I said was based on observations only; I have not tried any of what I said within KSP YET. I may get to it tonight if I don\u0027t crash. xP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with posts above. The triple-turbo system is a very good indicator of flame-out. Since I use MechJeb to limit acceleration at times, I normally have no need to worry about flame-outs, since 2.0.7 can reduce throttle to prevent a flame-out. Handy in some situations, but probably not SSTO work. And, while I can\u0027t see myself needing to use that large strut for your landing legs - I think the smaller ones would work as well, especially in conjunction with the Mk 2 legs you have there - I can understand the need for it structurally. Strut those struts up, however!! If you land on those legs, your craft may decide to do a crab-walk and blow itself up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all I got, Assault!
