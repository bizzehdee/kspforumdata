I don\u0027t remember the speed of this craft at sea level, but it\u0027s probably not THAT far off from what you\u0027re getting. However, the bigger the craft, the more the drag, so the slower it will go. That\u0027s why I tried to keep this one as small as possible for max speed. If you could get your craft up to 12km, you might hit 100 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, you really should install VOID. Being able to tell the rad/s of rotation is very helpful. I used to make a rig which had two engines pulling on each other, but the ksp runway isn\u0027t perfectly level. I tried to count RPM\u0027s manually at low power settings, but that was inaccurate too. VOID makes it so much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen designing, keep these properties in mind:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Engine Efficiency - Easily measured by how many rad/s you can get at a very low power setting (like 5-10%) with an empty shaft. By making small changes to the engine at such a low power setting, with VOID, you can see how they help or hurt the efficiency. I generally shoot for a power setting that gives 20 rad/s or so and make changes from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Prop Efficiency - Larger props usually have better efficiencies than small props, so consider adding blades. Someone also mentioned that changing the angle of the blades may help a lot--especially at high angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Engine Max RPM - This is a key characteristic of the engine, and in conjunction with the prop size, determines the maximum altitude the craft can operate at. Higher altitudes have less wind resistance, allowing the prop to spin faster. This is generally limited by the expansion of the turbine blades as the shaft spins faster and faster. Eventually, they\u0027ll collide into something, creating \u0022FUN\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Max RPM failure behavior - Some engines explode catastrophically, others just jam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Engine Power - A combination of the # of jets and the engine efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Engine Weight - In general you want to minimize especially the weight of the spinning shaft. A heavier shaft \u002B propeller will reduce efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Engine Size - Bigger engines typically can have a higher max RPM and weigh more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Pusher/Puller - Some engines may work fine as a pusher, but a puller will rip the prop right out of the engine, or vice versa. Positioning of wheels affect this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Max Propeller weight/power - Heavier props may fall out of an engine, especially when mounted horizontally. Also, props with a lot of blades can pull harder on the engine, ripping the shaft out of the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Juno D211 optimizes is a puller engine which optimizes small size and efficiency. It also simply jams (not explodes) at max RPM (if the jets are positioned properly). Max RPM can be adjusted by tilting the blades inside (as seen in the P38) at a loss of efficiency. It does NOT handle large props well, as they generally overload the bearings and cause the prop to rip out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAvimech\u0027s engines generally have had a lower efficiency and lower max RPM than the Juno, but the bearings are much more solid, so they can handle larger and stronger props. Recent versions feature a much larger # of jets, which make them much more powerful than the D211.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the above, you might be able to get your delta wing to 100 m/s, if you can increase the max engine RPM (or increase the prop size) enough to get it up to say, 12km... Or you might just have to reduce the part counts of the plane or add blades to the props to increase efficiency. The hardest approach is probably to increase the efficiency of the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T15:22:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 03:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lothsahn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T16:10:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery good Lotsahn! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some things to add:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) Blade length has been mentioned and number of blades. Number of blade segments defines blade length and the segment the furthest out produces the highest lift. It\u0027s important to note you can slide a segment down, towards the root. If you do this halfway, you won\u0027t have the irritating gap between segments at high prop speeds. In real life, it\u0027s the shape of the aerofoil that defines the lift/drag ratio of a prop. Since the shape doesn\u0027t have influence on lift, stacking multiple blades together is a fine way to increase maximum thrust. But of course mass and drag rise the same way, unlike real life. And my 4 blade 4 segmented 4 stacked prop ... has 64 wing segments for a total of 71 parts. That\u0027s not nice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) Blade angle is very important. Together with the other variables it defines max rpm of the engine. If have a strong feeling that the behaviour can be compared with real life. With piston engines, blade angle is set as to work like the gearbox of a car. That means: low prop pitch at low speed and low altitude. increasing throttle increases prop speed quickly, this is good for acceleration. But, at higher speeds the engines accelerate beyond their most efficient operating rpm, increasing fuel consumption, heat production and wear on the engine. If you on the other hand, set a high prop pitch at low speed, you\u0027re creating an immense amount of drag while the engine is operating below it\u0027s optimal rpm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12) Funny thing is: turbines in KSP also have an optimum rpm range. I\u0027ve discovered a very interesting behaviour which can increase max power some more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least I can tell you that on some turbines rpm limits are not defined by turbine blade expansion but by increasing internal drag due to it\u0027s own air resistance and especially low frequency vibrations, where an increasing amount of energy is lost in the suspension struts of the landing gears. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13) Blower angle ... took me some time to find out, this is the most important factor for a powerful engine. A difference of 1 degree can have a moderate impact, 5 degrees can make the difference between a plane that flies 30m/s at sea level or 40m/s. You need Part Angle Display for this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14)And now the fun part! The most hated feature of the current joints system: the rubbery connections. The turbine blade expansion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve discovered that a blower that misses it\u0027s target slightly will create more power once the turbine blade has expanded.

Do Jets cause actual damage to the parts? Any idea how this works?

The list of damage updates crashes KSP. Blades go if damaged too much, central shaft parts too, that\u0027s usually the case with my 12 blower, and always the segment at the rear.

That means that with 8 turbine blades, the blades have enough time to cool down (when not getting hit by one of the jets) that they don\u0027t hit the explosion overheat threshold.
