It looks similar to what I whipped up in my career save (ok, I had no memorable failures, and in fact used it extensively as a base for a junk deorbiter, and based it on the small ports since I rushed it), but yeah, simple is sometimes good. The thing I was gong to tell you, actually, is that I also use KAS and KIS, and they both work fine in 1.03. \n\nIn fact I just used them to put some chutes on the old expansion module form mine, and deorbited it to recover some funds. No junk left in space, especially if it\u0027s valuable junk! The lab module, though, is still churning data hooked up to a much more massive wheel station. Said station is also waiting for my first, and last, science mothership to process the Munar data, and when that\u0027s done, those 5k of science will mostly wait in the bank, because I only need 1.5k to clear the rest of the tree. Look how dinky and small those early career designs look compared with the new behemoths.\n\n![ZwlBLor.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZwlBLor.png)\n\nRune.

That station would have never flown otherwise... the ring has the consistency of rubber, and bridging the diameter with few connections is tricky.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The inexorable march of progress is far outpacing the scientists!\n\nThanks for confirming that 1.0.3 doesn\u0027t break KIS/KAS! With 1.0.4 fixing the craft loading issue, it looks like I can get back to business (in space at least) so long as Kerbal Engineer and the quintessential Alarm Clock also plays along fine.\n\nAs others have commented I find the use of empty SRBs as structural parts most intriguing. Somehow when I think of SRBs as structure, I am tempted to construct some Greek pillars out of them!"}]}
