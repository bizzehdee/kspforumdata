I love the newer parts. The massive, bulky, non-cylindrical, non-spherical parts that are meant to be used for making humongous vessels. So, here I am, ready to release the Goliath series. Not to be confused with Goliath Industries\u0027 parts, which are possibly going to be used, but may not since B9 provides awesomer massive parts. This ships will have the goliath logo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will not release any vessel that cannot make it to orbit or beyond, and I will definitely make sure to release any ship files, should people start asking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe architect out.

But that doesn\u0027t mean you couldn\u0027t just make something that works. I mean, the bigger parts were made with space stations in mind. Big space stations.
