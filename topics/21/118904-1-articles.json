Good question, It\u0027s a nice-looking yet functional tank, utilizing TWO Vulcan Turrets (BDA) and enough ammo to feed them, it can be driven manned or unmanned because of it\u0027s probe core and external command seat, it had eight wheels and I have observed a speed of 21.2m/s on it, but it may have gone faster when I had the HUD disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me more! Okay, It weighs just over seven tons, has 78 parts, looks very nice and the main body can survive hits of up to 80m/s thanks to structural panels, the double vulcan turret was inspired by HatBat\u0027s tanks (can\u0027t remember if it\u0027s GMI or HKA lol) on Duna, in his Kethane Station series, and the rest is inspired by my imagination, it may not be something you\u0027d fling against a Zokesia tank (Haven\u0027t tested this theory though, you\u0027re welcome to.) but it\u0027s reliable, functional and just as pretty, and thanks to it using Vulcan turrets instead of the usual cannon, you can spam shots until either you run out of ammo or the guns overheat, without having to reload! Because of it\u0027s ladders, a Kerbal can easily climb up the sides and board the command seat, It has some nice lights, too, so you can see at night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoar? Fine, heres an album of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/9j0qi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E As you can see, it may not be good for destroying buildings, but I\u0027m sure that in further testing it will wreck other vehicles. This is also being designed to be operable on Duna, but since I don\u0027t want to go there until I go there legitimately, I\u0027d love if you guys tested it there and gave me some results, it drives fine on Kerbin so it should be okay on Duna, If you have any suggestions for improvements on it\u0027s design, please inform me, as I want this to be a reliable tank for most if not all terrain. (8 wheels does seem to make it flip if you turn too sharply at too high of a speed.) All in all, the V1 Boar is designed to play a supporting role in defending ground bases, and not specifically to attack them, but it\u0027s possible, and well within it\u0027s capabilities, I\u0027m a post, not a cop, do what you want with it, I\u0027m just designing it with that role in mind. And again, two Vulcan Turrets is very good for bulletspam.\u003Cp\u003EHeres some pics so far, atm it\u0027s two pics from the album, but as it gets developed I will add moar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TE9Ye6i.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TE9Ye6i.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E6xAxqu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022E6xAxqu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A7Ez2h2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022A7Ez2h2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/5vKyp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
