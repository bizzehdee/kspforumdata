I wanted to also make it where you could enjoy the view from different angles without rotating the ship. I think it turned out quite well and It was mainly an exercise in using the techniques I had learned from the Open Source Construction Techniques for Craft Aesthetics thread.

I also Just noticed I will have to fire back up the game and undo something. I used a double R7 Rocket to get it up there in a hurry so it needs to come off before it will work on a stock game one second please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit for those who dont know what a double R7 is its this thing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/VTFv0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
