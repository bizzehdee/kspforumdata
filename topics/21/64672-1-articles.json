I went through and tweaked EVERYTHING multiple times trying to get first of all, the ability to send a single stage rocket up, and second of all, to be able to send 6 Kerbals up to my 250km space station. I ended up tweaking it so much that I managed to land six Kerbals on Duna with the same time (to be fair, I had 182 dV in my rocket right before aerobraking though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh also... you need to turn off the large engine as soon as you feel comfortable/the bordome of waiting doesn\u0027t keep it on. I usually turn it off permanently as I coast to my orbital burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took half of the fuel out of the Dragon command pod (which is gorgeous by the way) both to give the draft more dV and for lightness. Launch profile (since I only took before and after screenshots) was controlled entirely by MechJeb. 0.5km g-turn start at 85 degrees with 89km finish (which was too high) to a 250km orbit. Used the Mun for escape. I aerobraked on Duna at 9km trajectory which put my less than a couple hundred meters from a mountain \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E . But my favorite part about the whole thing was that I made it to Duna in one stage (if you count the decoupling of the launcher as a second stage then I guess after landing it was two stages).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and... if you use it you\u0027ll probably want either another battery or some more solar panels. Landing in the dark had... complications. I didn\u0027t put any on because I liked the look of having over 6000 dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods Used: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDragon Command Pod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/yv6egdh3g4isjp8/CTS-1%20Dragon.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/yv6egdh3g4isjp8/CTS-1%20Dragon.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D4UvyEZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022D4UvyEZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JMmLFez.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JMmLFez.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-02T02:40:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2014 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by horndgmium\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
