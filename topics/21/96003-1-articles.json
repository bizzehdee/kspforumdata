It\u0027s got a TWR of 0.11, so, you know, it isn\u0027t gonna take off like a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has no tail surface, but plenty of torque, meaning it can side-slip all over the place.

When it does, pull up hard. Alternatively, just gently take off at 50 m/s or higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t a fighter jet. It is a paper airplane that\u0027s trying to carry the weight of an obese Hippo. I\u0027m not even sure what will happen if you stall it, and I know for sure that it isn\u0027t gonna fly well above 10 degrees AOA. If you can get a sustained climb rate of 3 m/s near the ground, I\u0027ll be quite impressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t gone above 2500 meters yet, so I\u0027d be curious to see if someone could mod it or something and get the thing into orbit, or at least to high altitude and speed. I\u0027d estimate it ought to be able to reach orbital velocity at around 33000 meters... if it still has fuel by that point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, I should issue this as a challenge: See how high you can get in an ion-glider with no solar power with FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T09:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot 11371 meters, 153 meters/second, and 670 kilometers range with a version with no control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maelstrom Vortex","CreatedById":111435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T09:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might get better performance and lift out of the lighter composite wings.
