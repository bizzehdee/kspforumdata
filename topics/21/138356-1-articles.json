Basically, the most important factors in a hovercraft are the hover height (determines how quickly the pressure equalizes), the overpressure in the air cushion (determines pressure equalization rate and lift), the perimeter (determines pressure equalization rate), and the lifting area (determines lift). If one so desired, they could also simulate the actual thrust from the compressor, though I assume in any reasonable hovercraft design, this is very low, and mostly comes into play with the WIG effect. (F.E. Helicoper disc area ends up making an air cushion, softening helicopter landings and meaning they don\u0027t need as much thrust for takeoff.
