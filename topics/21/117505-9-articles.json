The Duna Descent Vehicle should already be in Duna orbit (prior to original crew arrival) and then the Duna Ascent Vehicle docks, transfers crew, and then undocks. Also I think a crew return mission is launched from Kerbin once Hermes is back in Low Kerbin Orbit, but the book doesn\u0027t make it that far. \n\nThe craft does have docking ports on both sides and before I did some research on the design I had a transfer vehicle on the crew end and an ore-container counter-weight on the other end."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T14:29:55Z","Content":"Testing testing testing, at least I am getting closer to the ground\n\n![0hUuRwT.png](http://i.imgur.com/0hUuRwT.png)\n\n![5JCwjOz.png](http://i.imgur.com/5JCwjOz.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T11:07:43Z","Content":"Thanks JAFO for the maps, I have updated the marked maps with approximate locations.

You could remove them and hyperedit the Hermes as one ship (without any docking ports, just all connected). And that seems to help.
