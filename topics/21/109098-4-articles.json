But if anyone by chance knows of any other material I can educate myself with I\u0027m all ears.\n\nI\u0027m still struggling through it, but here\u0027s what I\u0027ve got so far:\n\n\\* The CoL is now more of a guideline than an actual rule, so...\n\n\\* Pull up the stability \u002B derivatives and run it. Look at the red numbers and the tool tip describing what they\u0027re supposed to be\n\n\\* Start gently nudging various control surfaces, hitting the calculate button, and see if the number moves in the right direction. Keep tweaking until it\u0027s green\n\n\\* For transonic craft and vessels that have trouble pushing through the sound barrier: turn on the transonic design curves. The green curve is cross-section area. Keep that as smooth as possible. The yellow curve shows how fast the green curve changes. Try to keep the bumps in the yellow line as small as possible. For instance, if you have a section where wings start increasing in size, see if you can match that with a reduction in fuselage size to keep the rate-of-change of the cross-section as small and as smooth as possible.\n\n\\* The black horizontal lines show scale, so if you have a small craft, the yellow line will look all bumpy but that\u0027s because you\u0027re waaay zoomed in, graph-wise. Only worry about big bumps in the yellow line if the horizontal bars are getting squished vertically (showing that you\u0027re \u0022zoomed-out\u0022, graph-wise).\n\nExample: In the first image, see how the yellow line has a serious bump right behind the cockpit where the wings increase the cross-section area. Now in the second image I\u0027ve replaced the tank with a tail that narrows as the wings increase in size. This keeps the cross-section area changing smoothly (and in fact, decreases slightly -- green line), reducing the bump where the wings start. There\u0027s still a huge bump at the end where everything just stops. This is one of my problem areas, but it can be mitigated a bit with careful placement of tail and elevator wing/surface shapes.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

But it does help if you can use it.\n\nThe first screen in Ferram is the static analysis screen. This gives you pretty graphs.\n\nIt has two options at top: Sweep AoA and Sweep Mach. There are boxes at the bottom which say Lower, Upper and Mach/AoA. This page can produce two different graphs: if you press the Sweep AoA button, it shows the behaviour of your plane from Angle of Attack values between Lower and Upper, at the speed shown in the Mach/AoA box. If you press the Sweep Mach button, it shows behaviour at speeds between Lower and Upper at the AoA shown in the Mach/AoA box.\n\n*The blue line is the Coefficient of Lift. It\u0027s good when this is high.*\n\n*The red line is the Coefficient of Drag. It\u0027s good when this is low.*\n\n*The yellow line is the Coefficient of Manoeuvrability/Instability. You want this to be angling down (like it is here), and it\u0027s best that the slope of the line isn\u0027t too steep and that its X-intercept (where the yellow line crosses zero) isn\u0027t too far above zero.* \n\n*The green line is lift divided by drag. It\u0027s good when this is high.*\n\n![rPK07yh.png](http://i.imgur.com/rPK07yh.png)\n\nThis picture shows how the plane will act at Angles of Attack between 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 while travelling at Mach 2.\n\nSometimes the lines split into two lines. This shows how the plane responds after a stall: you get a sudden loss of lift and increase in drag that lasts until you return your AoA to where the line isn\u0027t split any more.\n\nThis is the same picture at Mach 0.8. See how the plane can stall at that speed?\n\n![M6CfRoR.png](http://i.imgur.com/M6CfRoR.png)\n\nIf you click the Sweep Mach button, you instead get a look at a bunch of different speeds with Angle of Attack held constant. This shows Mach 0-6 with a 3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA. The bumpiness on the left shows the effect of breaking through the sound barrier.\n\n![xLkx98L.png](http://i.imgur.com/xLkx98L.png)\n\nThe second page of Ferram is data and stability derivatives. This produces scary looking numbers.\n\n![JmXc3vw.png](http://i.imgur.com/JmXc3vw.png)\n\nTo get those numbers, you need to put in values for altitude and speed.\n\nAll of the confusing letters that appear when you hover your mouse over the output numbers relate to this picture here:\n\n![bodycs.gif](http://www.mathworks.com/help/aerotbx/ug/bodycs.gif)\n\nx is forwards, y is sideways, z is down. P is roll, Q is pitch, R is yaw. Don\u0027t worry about the Greek for now.\n\nIf you hover your mouse over any of the numbers, it\u0027ll pop up a tooltip explaining what it refers to. Mostly, however, all you want to do is make as many as possible of the numbers green and as few as possible red.\n\nThe one other useful thing on this screen is the \u0022level flight\u0022 stuff up top right. If you set the analysis for zero altitude and the speed for whatever you think you can reach on the runway, you can find out how much AoA you need to take off (the \u0022level flight\u0022 value). Try to keep that number below ten for easy takeoffs.\n\n***Transonic drag and Area Ruling***\n\n![QMJY7km.png](http://i.imgur.com/QMJY7km.png)\n\nGo to transonic design and toggle the area curves. The green line shows the cross-sectional area of the aircraft as you move from nose to tail; the yellow line is a measure of how smoothly the green line is changing. Mach 1 Wave-Drag Area is the thing that you\u0027re aiming to minimise; if you manage to get the wiggles in the yellow line to the smallest amplitude possible, that is what you\u0027ll achieve. The lower the wave-drag, the less power you\u0027ll need to get up to speed.\n\nWith all of these analyses, you should have your gear toggled up. See how much they affect the outcome here:\n\n![xtV7a77.png](http://i.imgur.com/xtV7a77.png)\n\n***How to Apply FAR Aero Analyses***\n\nThe pretty graphs: use these to check for excessive drag and regions of instability. AoA graph is the more useful of the two.\n\nNumbers: use the Level Flight figure to work on your takeoff speed and flap settings. For the stability figures, check takeoff (0 altitude and .35 or so speed), low altitude (5km and .8 speed), Mach 1 (speed obvious, 10km) and edge of rocketry (25km, Mach 4.5). You want green everywhere. You won\u0027t get it, at least to start with.\n\nHover your mouse over the red ones and use the picture above to work out what the tooltips mean. Once you decode the x\u0027s and y\u0027s, usually they just mean something like \u0022has a tendency to roll when pitching up\u0022 or similar. Sometimes the solutions are obvious (e.g. too much yaw slippage, add a rudder), sometimes they take a great deal of trial and error to sort out.\n\nWith the transonic drag stuff, just wiggle parts about and see what happens. To achieve the lowest drag, \u0022fill in\u0022 dips in the green line and \u0022shave down\u0022 peaks.\n\n**Video tutorials:** [https://m.youtube.com/user/TheWanderfound](https://m.youtube.com/user/TheWanderfound)\n\n**Illustrated tutorial:** [http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Tutorials/Hangar%20to%20Landing/story](http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Tutorials/Hangar%20to%20Landing/story)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T06:14:52Z","Content":"For anyone having trouble with FAR rocketry:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

All of them use only 30 parts - maximum allowed for Level one SPH.\n\nThose are build from early available parts in career mode, based on SETIctt mod. You will also need DMagic orbital science mod for all those nice scientific stuff. Plane is made as purpose for stable early subsonic flights, with weak engines available on early tech tree nodes you can\u0027t go faster anyway.\n\nI highly recommend to try [SETIctt mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106130-1-0-2-SETI-CommunityTechTree-Contracts-Greenhouse-BalanceMod?p=1649006\u0026viewfull=1#post1649006).

Really super stable, a pleasure to fly, has a good operational range but climbs really slowly.\n\n[![screenshot_2015_05_18_02_02_00.png](http://s26.postimg.org/6h3w8v65x/screenshot_2015_05_18_02_02_00.png)](http://postimg.org/image/6h3w8v65x/) [![screenshot_2015_05_18_02_03_21.png](http://s26.postimg.org/aer5y9sz9/screenshot_2015_05_18_02_03_21.png)](http://postimg.org/image/aer5y9sz9/) [![screenshot_2015_05_18_02_06_09.png](http://s26.postimg.org/q5c8rwc8l/screenshot_2015_05_18_02_06_09.png)](http://postimg.org/image/q5c8rwc8l/) [![screenshot_2015_05_18_02_06_16.png](http://s26.postimg.org/3s4i53bat/screenshot_2015_05_18_02_06_16.png)](http://postimg.org/image/3s4i53bat/) [![screenshot_2015_05_18_02_10_55.png](http://s26.postimg.org/izkhpg35h/screenshot_2015_05_18_02_10_55.png)](http://postimg.org/image/izkhpg35h/)\n\nBe careful though, or you\u0027ll end up undershooting the run way like I did on my first attempt, still it held pretty well and did not crash. Coming in for my second attempt, gently gliding into the runway, really easy to stop, isn\u0027t it glorious?\n\nOn rockets though:\n\nIt seems with the recent FAR it becoming more and more impossible to launch some more simple and traditional fins-less rockets. I\u0027ve run some tests with this cool prototype.\n\n[![vls1.jpg](http://s26.postimg.org/lyreckcmt/vls1.jpg)](http://postimg.org/image/lyreckcmt/) [![screenshot_2015_05_18_02_22_49.png](http://s26.postimg.org/z9anscdth/screenshot_2015_05_18_02_22_49.png)](http://postimg.org/image/z9anscdth/) [![screenshot_2015_05_18_02_46_04.png](http://s26.postimg.org/6c04z6yut/screenshot_2015_05_18_02_46_04.png)](http://postimg.org/image/6c04z6yut/)\n\nThe first kinda what I was aiming for, though memory fooled me.... Anyway, even though this kinda of rocket seems super cool, it becomes too bad at turning and thus too unstable... Anyone achieve some kinda design like this in FAR?"},{"CreatedByName":"Cinocal","CreatedById":54959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T21:23:29Z","Content":"The Slick Brick!\n\n![Mn7fqTg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Mn7fqTg.jpg)"}]}
