It\u0027s compatiable with any space plane with horizontal dimensions that can fit into the ring. It also has a centered mass, so that as the fuel runs out, the center of mass is still within the center of mass of the plane it is towing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y45/levelord/KSP/screenshot12.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot12.png~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y45/levelord/KSP/screenshot15.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot15.png~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from Mechjeb, everything else is pretty much stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T20:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s one reason I switched away from using inline docking ports. You can\u0027t make a blended body aircraft with them unless they are stuck out like a goose neck. The twin jr ports dont look as good but try do the job. Could probably do a little but better by using a cubic strut in their place but clipped into the yanks then have the ports on the inner node of the cube...
