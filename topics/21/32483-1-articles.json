It looks like Nelson Kermin has a bit of a problem here. You see, he\u0027s down there on the ground. But he has to get into orbit and rendezvous with the Kerbal International Space Station. And, as you can see, his ride is waaaaaaay up there, on top of that massive rocket. So how do you get a kerbal from the ground, up into a space shuttle that\u0027s sitting on top of a rocket?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is The Kerbal Mobile Platform Rover!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/6436/screenshot8aq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot8aq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/2669/screenshot9gxe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot9gxe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/3893/screenshot10bk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot10bk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal Mobile Platform Rover is able to wheel itself into place allowing poor little Kerbals stuck on the ground access to those difficult to reach space shuttles that happen to be sat on top of a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/657/screenshot6md.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot6md.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like little Nelson is going to space today after all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal Mobile Platform Rover was actually pretty difficult to get right. The were a number of problems in designing such a thing. The first, and second, were getting the height and length of the platform correct. The next was to add enough ballast (in the form of fuel tanks) to the bottom and opposite side to stop the thing from instantly tipping over! But that was the relatively easy bit. The hardest bit was designing it to allow for that steep incline onto the launchpad area. The solution, as you can see, was to use the massive wheels, so that hitting the incline didn\u0027t immediately break the wheels, and also to angle the front wheels of the rover at 20 degrees, which allows the front end to mount the launchpad area, while the rear wheels at the standard angle power the thing up and over. I also added an angled landing gear to the front and rear to try to help with stability and stop it from falling over from accelerating or braking too hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt still requires extremely careful driving though ... But it works! It actually works!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t seen any other contraption like it, although I haven\u0027t been around KSP for long. I felt the need to share this with you guys purely because just looking at this thing makes me laugh out loud.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Penguinhero","CreatedById":42632,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T20:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow we just need a gangnam style parody called kerbal style\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb Cubed","CreatedById":70444,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T04:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep very kerbal good job getting the thing to stay up\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
