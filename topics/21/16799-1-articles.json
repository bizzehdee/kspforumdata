The two outer engine on the other hand can take fuel from the centre tanks, Also the symbol for the fuel lines greys out when I stage instead of remaining green. Other than that it works fine, take off is as simple as full throttle and pull up then set the trim to almost full until 12km then as the fuel is burnt just slowly adjust the trim down and after about 30mins you will reach 15km and be going a bit over 400m/s. I\u0027m sure it could be done a lot quicker than that, Once I get that fuel line problem fixed I will rename it from X-Plane 3 to something better just have to think of a good name.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadownailshot","CreatedById":32828,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T20:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat looks pretty cool but...
