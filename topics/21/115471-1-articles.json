They look like they where made in a hurry. I know you are a fellow builder and from one to another, I would spend more time cleaning up the designs and adding a little more detail. Also, there really is no need for exposed struts anymore dude. They are just as strong when hidden inside. \n\n I know you make a lot of stuff, I just think you need to spend a little more time cleaning up the designs or putting more detail into them. Even if that means releasing less craft. They will be remembered better for it.\n\n Anywhoo, just the opinion of a very picky builder!
