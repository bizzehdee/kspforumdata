I was bored, really bored. The kind of boredom which shouts for KSP. I decided I\u0027d try to create a rocket with enough fuel to reach a low circular orbit, and a solid fuel booster to decelerate and return to Kearth. What happened instead, is that after reaching orbit at 42,000m (\u002B-15m) I noticed I had a full liquid fuel stage and the deceleration solid fuel stage left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this means is that this vehicle will easily allow you to get into orbit =\u0026lt;100Km high with enough liquid fuel to try hohmann transfers up to about 1,000Km (I got bored after 3 transfers and 500km altitude, with about 3/4 liquid tank left. It\u0027s also small enough that you can easily maneuver it\u0027s orbital stages without requiring non-vanilla things (Like the RCS module) nor a godlike patience and attention. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?ak5j97cds1imoqk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?ak5j97cds1imoqk\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshot: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/1696/hto1n.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/1696/hto1n.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frenchie16","CreatedById":5784,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-20T20:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is amazing how little fuel it takes to perform Hohmann transfers, especially if your orbital vehicle is quite small. It\u0027s also amazing how, to get just a bit more mass into orbit, you need a much, much larger rocket, because for each extra engine and fuel tank you add, you need even more engines and fuel tanks, because now your rocket is heavier!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice job building something that big and yet reliable from the stock parts, by the way.
