I believe that could even go as SSTO considering the only \u0022payload\u0022 is three lander cans, six nukes, the cupola and a bunch of struts. A mainsail with two orange tanks can SSTO good 15 tons of payload. Here you have six times that meaning if the dry mass of everything except the tanks is 90 tons, it can get to the orbit on its own with no SRBs.\n\nOf course now filling all these tanks is gonna be fuuuun."},{"CreatedByName":"chd","CreatedById":78680,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T18:51:59Z","Content":"Yeah, I definitely have to work on efficiency---all suggestions welcome.

You may want to consider changeing the center stack to a LF only tank however as your main fuel supply. Personaly I find going that large to be too laggy.
