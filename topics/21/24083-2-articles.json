But I\u0027ve strutted it a bit firmer, and conducted a couple of successful launches in a row. No need to turn gimbals off, but I still recommend throttling down a notch after you get to 100m/s and during 1st and 2nd stage burns.

I have never used it, so I wouldn\u0027t know really.

Here\u0027s a control trick I use which has helped me immensely: I keep ASAS on all the time, and when I want to make corrections in one direction, I press the appropriate control key \u002B F to temporarily disable it, and as soon as I\u0027ve moved and it\u0027s going fast, I just stop pressing stuff. Let it settle tapping F every now and then to reset the ASAS in the current heading, rinse and repeat. That way you can control surprisingly wobbly messes, as long as you have control authority.

It looks fine, it takes off fine, but the center engine flames out for no reason a small bit after leaving the runway. Second, the action groups are non-functional, at least the action group to raise the landing wheels. Third, the shuttle appears to have a toggle-able ASAS that causes the vehicle to be non-stock.

Tell you what, I will finish the Crys 2.0, post it, and make sure it\u0027s free of mods this time. (And as a one-time bonus, because yesterday was a good day and a better night, check your inbox, and see if you like what\u0027s inside.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I went ahead and changed the ASAS just in case, the download should work just the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
