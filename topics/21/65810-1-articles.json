It\u0027s quite similar to the proposed real one though. This is a project that\u0027s quite dear to my heart as a Marine pilot-in-training. I want nothing more than to fly one of these someday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the articles I modeled after, you can get an idea of what it does from these: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/gallery/2006-12/semper-fly-marines-space/?image=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/gallery/2006-12/semper-fly-marines-space/?image=0\u003C/a\u003E , \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/03/03/703975/-Semper-Fly-Marines-in-Space-New-Poll\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/03/03/703975/-Semper-Fly-Marines-in-Space-New-Poll\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aXArm9P.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aXArm9P.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let me know how I did! It flies okay, for some reason the CoL is not quite center even though everything was built in symmetry (that might just be a glitch) And YES, it is a SSTO! I tested it to 100km after losing about 800 m/s in flight (due to not paying attention and yawing 90 degrees), it\u0027s certainly capable of more. And it certainly does the job DARPA intended it for. Two pilots and capable of delivering 12 marines to anywhere on Kerbin (as well as the Mun I guess) in less than two hours. Even though it\u0027s supposed to be 13 marines. Whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could probably use a little more tweaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELLL (those counterweights are ,y favorite things ever)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 (I really need to find some better landing gear)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW (struts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP-Wings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/q4yv5bp3jvh1i6v/SUSTAIN%20Mock-up.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/q4yv5bp3jvh1i6v/SUSTAIN%20Mock-up.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/wC0xP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
