But i guess technically you could use it for some serious deep space travel. She uses the kethane egg as its \u0027harvester\u0027 and can do her own conversion as well.. docking can be a little hairy but pretty happy overall with this design. still have some ideas for it like detachable probes or perhaps a maned lander! \u003Ca href=\u0022https://plus.google.com/photos/112641351938774591545/albums/5895524415914310913\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://plus.google.com/photos/112641351938774591545/albums/5895524415914310913\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso in the above albums you can see my Fuel Depot, Nuclear powered kethane converting beast... I have one orbiting pretty much anywhere I have mined or am planning to mine for Kethane.
