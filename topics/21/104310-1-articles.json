Whilst not intended as a reproduction of any of the aforementioned aircraft, I hope that there is at least a family resemblance. Not built for any specific purpose, it has pleasant flying characteristics and I\u0027d like to think it\u0027s a good looking aircraft.\n\nIt won\u0027t fly itself off the runway, but only requires modest elevator input to unstick and become airborne. Glide characteristics are good and with the upswept tail booms, you\u0027d have to be seriously abusing the elevator control near the ground to suffer a tail strike.\n\n![voo1.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/voo1.jpg)\n\n![voo2.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/voo2.jpg)\n\n[Craft download file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a3ir9sr9v5548iq/Voodoo.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T08:09:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 08:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow88**"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T14:33:12Z","Content":"Mmm.. very creative layout!\n\nI wonder how it flies.. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T18:58:40Z","Content":"That looks sweet!

Why is there a jet in the nose? At least it appears to be one. Is it for balance?"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T20:52:15Z","Content":"Yes, balance only. Even though I had the CoL just behind the CoM without it, I think the CoM was too close to the trailing edge of the wing, and it led to some strange flight characteristics. Adding the engine at the front moved the CoM forward enough to lose those bad traits."},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T21:11:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, balance only.

It has quite a low landing speed if you cut the engine over the threshold, so there\u0027s no need to really pull the nose up to lose speed - just glide it in."},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T08:11:17Z","Content":"Just a small bump as the craft file has been updated so that it downloads the 1.0 compatible version."}]}
