You can see this in the example below, that I purposely blocked the yaw controls during high-\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1, to observe the effects for later use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mv9BIOYl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mv9BIOYl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe observation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the lack of sufficient airflow passing over the yaw control surface, the lack of yaw authority wasn\u0027t too surprising. However, what was more surprising was the attribute that roll input brought along at high-\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1, which was yaw control. High-\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1 \u002B roll input = roll and yaw? What was happening! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter looking into it, I came up with a theory for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen both ailerons are in the same position, the airflow has to travel the same distance on each wing, thus creating no asymmetrical forces to the aircrafts yaw direction (Example 1 below). However, when one of the ailerons are pitched up, this forces the air to follow the contour of the control surface, effectively pulling the air down and out the back, creating a force pulling that side down and thus effecting the yaw (Example 2 below). It may not be the most bullet proof theory out there, but for my purposes it provided what seemed to be the correct solution in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JLpIABXl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JLpIABXl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qtZDZDbl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qtZDZDbl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E____________________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe next aircraft is the, KB XF-3.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t2NCKADl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022t2NCKADl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2DUITssl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222DUITssl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENote a few things:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] The forward and rear mounted canards, unobstructed through a wide variation of angle of attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[2] The elongation of the vertical tail beyond the bottom of the aircraft for airflow at extreme angles of attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[3] The upwards curved wingtips to improve wingtip high alpha performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[4] The substantially smaller ailerons mounted on the wingtips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe purpose of this aircraft:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis aircrafts purpose was to test the possible solutions to the problems observed on the XF-1. For a start, the vertical tail was hugely enlarged to increase its effective width at high-\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1 (Example below), not to mention it was also extended below the bottom of the aircraft to ensure maximum airflow over the yaw controls at all times. The addition of the rear mounted canard was to improve handling while at high-\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1, this is because with the XF-1, pitch is done by the canards only, however on the XF-3 pitch is controlled by three control surfaces. These are the forward canards, that only input pitch, the rear canards that input both pitch and roll, and finally the wing mounted elevators which only input pitch. Because of this layout, the pitch authority on the XF-3 is greater than the lighter XF-1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember above, when we talked about roll having yaw affects, well that problem was fixed, by keeping the airflow on the wing symmetrical at all times. The elevators on the wing move simultaneously as not to create asymmetrical airflow, yawing the aircraft. The only ailerons on the wing are tiny to avoid the yawing effect at high-\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1, and the majority of the roll authority rests with the rear canards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nswHuTtl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nswHuTtl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe observation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll control surfaces on the new craft have much better authority, even when at extreme high-\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1, due to the open airflow allowance of all control surfaces and partially down to the placement (Example below). The XF-3 has exceptional high-\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1 performance, and for the time being it is the peak of my progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther issues are currently known, but there are no explanations I can offer to provide a solution, and thus this concludes the observation until I progress further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FnjsyCp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FnjsyCp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Above: Red represents airflow obstructions, in the case of the forward canard, it serves to create drag keeping the nose up.
