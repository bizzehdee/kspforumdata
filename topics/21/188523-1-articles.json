Align to the desired docking port, and accelerate a little for final approach.\u00A0 This technique has been highly successful on larger versions of this vessel docking with still larger vessels.\u00A0 *(Bear in mind that when approaching tail-first the engines are almost 27m closer to the target than the docking port, and flipping tail-to-nose will bring the docking port of this craft when normally balanced 32 or 33 meters closer to the target due to where the vessel\u0027s pivot point is.\u00A0 A dock-to-dock separation of 50m would mean a real distance facing away of 23m and 17m after flipping).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014When altering the balance of the craft (e.g. to put the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E more ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E), keep in mind that adding fuel to the rear and front \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks in a 2:1 ratio will be approximately neutrally balanced, i.e. will keep or return the ship to close to its starting balance.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014Water landing (via parachute) was tested on Kerbin at 75% fuel.\u00A0 If your splashdown attitude is close to vertical, your docking port may be at risk of destruction as you rotate down, but this can be prevented by using the Vernors to slow your fall.\u00A0 (Presumably similar precautions should be taken if landing on Tylo.)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014The top speed in water is 38.7 m/s when full.\u00A0 The top speed on low fuel is uncertain because during testing the plane unintentionally took off.\u00A0 In subsequent testing, the vessel was able to intentionally lift off when top speed in water was about 70 m/s, when fuel fell to between 20 and 25%.\u00A0 (Highest speeds were obtained when fuel was moved forward and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E set to prograde.)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014Why the precoolers?\u00A0 Although the shock cones more than meet the needs of normal flight, I like the idea of having strong static airflow for those, ahem, \u0022off prograde\u0022 situations.\u00A0 They are also handsome.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014Why the \u003Cem\u003Eeverything?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 This design was not arrived at minimalistically; I\u0027m sure there is a lot you could cut, starting with the rear parachutes and airbrakes.\u00A0 But I wanted a feature-rich craft, and those are features, and it is Minmus capable, so there.\u00A0 Having said that, I do still welcome criticism if you think anything is too blatantly unnecessary.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014Why no offset?\u00A0 I just didn\u0027t want to use offset; a little bit to neaten up the often messy intersections of aerodynamic parts is okay but I often see it used in a way I think of as exploitative.\u00A0 So in a way the only minimalistic thing about this design is the offset and part clipping, which was a design choice.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014After the 1.8 atmospheric changes, this plane can actually fly on a 3R\u002B3N configuration, but taking away two nacelles worth of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E completely negates the benefit.\u00A0 It\u0027s slightly less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, significantly less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, and a more annoying ascent path; why bother?\u00A0 Well, I could probably just yank one jet off the regular design (keeping 4 NERVs) and limp to orbit, but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E gain (112 I think) is, while noticeable, quite modest and I would be nervous about sending it to Laythe untested with that much less atmospheric performance.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003ESo, how do you like the plane?\u00A0 How do you like the post?\u00A0 Comments and questions welcome.\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit history:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.1\u003C/strong\u003E\u20149/28/19:\u00A0 Added vacuum landing notes.\u00A0 Added \u0022Miscellaneous\u0022 section.\u00A0 Made major changes to vehicle (reduced RAPIERs from 6 to 4, replacing two Mk3 side pods with four Mk1 side pods).\u00A0 Edited text accordingly.\u00A0 9/29/19:\u00A0 Added Minmus picture.\u00A0 Edits to vacuum landing notes and other things.\u00A0 9/30/19:\u00A0 Swapped location of RAPIERs and NERVs (reducing tailstrike risk);
