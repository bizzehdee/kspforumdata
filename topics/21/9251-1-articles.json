Landing accuracy of course depends on your piloting skills, but there is plenty of fuel to adjust your orbit as needed. I can easily touch down craft within 100m of each other, and can probably do better if I try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I have flown this, there is not a whole lot of fuel left in the tanks for the kerbin landing. You need to make a semi-powered landing, as the innermost \\\u0027abort\\\u0027 stage has about a 50% chance of exploding if you try to parachute down with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24 tanks, 12 solid boosters.

Apparently, the drop of 2 meters or so on the mun is enough to make the RCS tank explode. Somebody needs to build the thing better. However, the decoupler on top stays intact, so there is some payload delivery! I may try putting landing legs on the RCS tank and see if that helps. The extra weight might be a problem though. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-07T07:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually I think I know what your problem is with the RCS tank on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbals seem to have made their RCS tanks out of paper and have no concept of impact tolerance, I have tried before to on one, and even at 0.1m/s it\\\u0027ll blow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027d suggest ditching the RCS tank as an instrument package and use a SAS or a second stack decoupler instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
