The proton launcher is of Darth Lazarus\u0027 design, with some minor aesthetic modifications. During launch, press 2 to jettison the fairing. Once in orbit, press 1 to activate the station. It has 1000m/s delta-V, although it can only use about 100m/s each manoeuvre before you have to manually pump the fuel around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oxbjdEL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oxbjdEL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/qp8ng2iwil6n2ic/Almaz.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
