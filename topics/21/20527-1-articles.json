I present to you the K-15 and K-16!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty happy with the way they came out. Like their real-world counterparts, the 16 is a faster and a little more agile, but also a bit, shall we say, squirrelier. The 15 is also a little more robust. It can land going 60\u002B m/s and with the nose basically on the horizon, but the 16 needs a little more finesse to bring it down in one piece\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a little more mass thats not engines or fuel on here than I usually care for, but I think it looks pretty sexy. I experimented with replacing the nacelles with a pair of fuel tanks, to give it better range (the \u0022e\u0022 model, of course), but I couldn\u0027t find a good place to add the extra lift and control authority it needed to get off the ground. Any change I made either made it look stupid or made the asas freak out. So here ya go. Looks like test pilot Kirk really enjoys it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecraft file: [ATTACH]33679[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lndIu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lndIu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xt65w.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Xt65w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore like a gas tank with wings. It\u0027s got nothing that\u0027s not needed, and is probably missing a few things that are needed.
