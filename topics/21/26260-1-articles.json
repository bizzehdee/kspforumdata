The result was the Nova SHLLV capable of 110tons to LKO. From Nova then came the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24787-0-19-1-Zenith-rocket-family\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EZenith rocket family\u003C/a\u003E covering the whole spectrum between 15-110 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then as with all things in engineering, when you build something really big people immediately start to wonder about how to build another one even bigger. Nova is no exception and I received quite a few messages proposing even bigger lifters. So I started seriously thinking about a Supernova.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is Nova was specifically designed with the goal of \u0022largest 2.5m core possible\u0022. When you look at the back of its core stage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/64qrft.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002264qrft.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...you\u0027ll see the problem of making it bigger - basically there\u0027s nowhere to put any more engines under a 2.5 stack, even after adding the tail connections to increase the area. The only option left is then to use a bigger stack. Without resorting to 3.75m mod parts the only way to get a fatter stack is to create \u0022synthetic\u0022 stacks made up of multiple stock stacks. Thus this was my solution to the problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/2zyj6o2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222zyj6o2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA synthetic stack made up of a 1.25m stack at the centre surrounded by three 2.5m stack clustered around it, enough area for much more engine power than the 2.5m Nova core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is the final result:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://105.imagebam.com/download/iivX2wVhbb9-xwbAD-qt3w/25379/253783352/screenshot1061.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1061.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESupernova Super Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E160.6 tons to LKO (75km x 75km)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPayload fraction: 15.01%\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThrust at lift off: 18,000kN\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECost: $369,560\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECost/ton to LKO: $2301.12\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPart count: 267\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have noticed one other difference from the Zenith family of rockets - no 1.25m engine clusters. This was a deliberate design choice: I noticed that many 100ton\u002B rockets have part counts well above 300. The problem with a lifter using up that much part is that a payload that weighs more than 100 tons is itself going to take up A LOT of parts. If you\u0027re lifting 160 tons to orbit and your rocket is 350 parts and you load another 350 part of payload on top you\u0027re going to get something too laggy to fly for most people\u0027s computers. What is the point of designing and sharing a booster if it\u0027s a painful experience to fly? Engine clusters whilst highly efficient is very part heavy. The 12 engines of Nova core alone takes up 32 parts, if I put three Nove cores together that\u0027s almost 100 parts before I add struts. Mainsails bring the part count down at the cost of efficiency. Compared to the Zenith family Supernova has a lower payload fraction than all of them. However on the other hand mainsails give excellent value for money in terms of thrust/dollar. Thus being purely powered by mainsails Supernova has a lower per ton cost to LKO than all members of the Zenith family.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s have a look a the ascent profile:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://105.imagebam.com/download/1_BZy8BeYQ_oVlAY-9KYCA/25379/253783359/screenshot1066.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1066.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore lift off, hit action group 1 twice to turn off gimbling for all booster engines.

You\u0027ll notice that Supernova stages mainsail boosters in threes rather than the more conventional pairs. This is partly due to the size of the rocket and partly due to the geometry. At around 9000m your second set of boosters will run out so stage them too and then start to pitch down to 45 degrees for gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://107.imagebam.com/download/utLKKdB_1gl7qgOnzM54Tg/25379/253783381/screenshot1073.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1073.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 26000m your last set of three boosters will run out. At this altitude and without any control surface left you will usually have some roll motions. Turn off ASAS and turn on RCS to correct the roll.

I noticed one interesting thing - if you instantly turn off the throttle with X the sudden jolt can knock loose/ explode some of the nose cones on top of the 2.5m stacks. It doesn\u0027t seem to cause any damage or affect the structural integrity of the rocket so I wouldn\u0027t really worry about it, but if you want to avoid it then throttle down with Ctrl instead of X.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://103.imagebam.com/download/IQDIVhuoqxe_d0nQ-vgAEw/25379/253783412/screenshot1081.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1081.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupernova just before throttling up for final circularisation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://106.imagebam.com/download/tfqYRvhWnT1U8HwxwkMatg/25379/253783418/screenshot1085.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1085.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayload released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://102.imagebam.com/download/DzY4U_7TJwwCMpT9aPDGpA/25379/253783422/screenshot1087.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1087.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://107.imagebam.com/download/Nq3QVov8tGdtjmAwj4GMuQ/25379/253783430/screenshot1090.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1090.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://107.imagebam.com/download/FLiEgxSRM5xDSSMuvo_uFA/25379/253783436/screenshot1093.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1093.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with the Zenith rocket family, Supernova is equipped with probe core, RCS system and electrical system for self-deorbiting after payload release to ensure compliance with the Clean Space Policy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download.php?kcs8op66cpst9yc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download.php?kcs8op66cpst9yc\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-10T13:21:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2013 01:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Allister","CreatedById":63976,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T14:21:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice Temstar!

But I find that for a payload of this size 2.5m parts no longer hold up. The combined forces of a 200ton dead weight being forced down by gravity against the 2G or more acceleration coming up from the engines is just too much for some parts to take. It took a lot of very precise strutting finally make a payload that wouldn\u0027t crush it\u0027s own 2.5m core while under acceleration so I felt that the 4x design was too unwieldy and with a margin of error for failure too small for comfort.
