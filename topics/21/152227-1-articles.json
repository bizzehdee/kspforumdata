I haven\u0027t gotten this to space yet; I took a screencap shortly after (actual) liftoff and shortly after the game crashed.

It estimates about 18 minutes worth of fuel. This is a very early modded science mode game, and these are the first jet fuel tanks/engines/air intakes that you can unlock. The intakes and engines were made larger with Tweakscale, and that also increased the output enough for the bigger tanks. I haven\u0027t tried this with other engines. Has anyone else done this and, if so, how did it go?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrmcp1","CreatedById":79657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-19T11:40:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a small jet booster for some of my small rockets which is capable of landing\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/abylLph.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022abylLph.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing the early jets is a bit tricky as they loose thrust at higher altitude.
