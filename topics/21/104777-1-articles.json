It even has a similar passenger capacity! And I chuckled at my mention on the video... mine looks much, much worse. Even if it is balanced better. The way you build yours though, you could probably move the CoM upwards (and gain stability) by shifting stuff like fuel under the beautiful hull you built. The problem, though, is that the shape of the Quinjet makes it probably pitch downwards in RL, unless the tail is angled a lot to counteract the torque form the downwards facing front...\n\nRune. Who knows? Maybe it\u0027ll still fly on 1.0, it isn\u0027t that crazy of a design."}]}
