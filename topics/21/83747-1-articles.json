The last time I asked people what they would prefer to see me build, they were requesting weapons a lot. So the skunkworks have been pretty busy lately! This is a bit of a small addition, but since I\u0027m about to release a couple of carriers soon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 (yes, a couple, and only one of them is the B9 monstrosity I previewed elsewhere), it is kind of an important one. A compact carrier-based fighter! Featuring stock armament but easily converted to something else (you have space for missiles where they are now, and you can always put a turret under it), more T/W that you know what to do with, stupendous maneuverability, and a rather limited autonomy in an incredibly compact package, the Knife looks exactly like what it was designed to be: a fast short-range interceptor capable of taking out ships many times it\u0027s size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/SDOFA40\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SDOFA40.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SDOFA40.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say \u0022a rather limited autonomy\u0022, but that is mostly regarding in-space maneuvering. As a SSTO, it is astounding. It is a true speed demon, climbing vertically at close to terminal speed before getting to orbital speeds terrifyingly quickly adn being able to get apoapsies of ~140kms if you milk the engines properly... then glide to the ground and do it again faster with the \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E half of the fuel tank. After circularization, though, you will have only a bit over 500m/s to play with, but considering by then you should be considering which ship is going to work as carrier to carry additional ammo and monopropellant (no oxidizer in the whole ship! Minimizes subsystem complexity, and I make all my auxiliary vessels burn mono now) and get you places, so that shouldn\u0027t be an issue. \u0026gt;500m/s is more than enough for any engagement in close orbits, I think, and this way the sortie to drop a couple of \u0022lance torpedoes\u0022 end up being quite cheap in delta-v for the mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and speaking about that. What is a \u0022lance torpedo\u0022? Well, my favorite stock weapon, because an I-bean going at \u0026gt;650m/s down your throat must hurt:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/PMImJW8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PMImJW8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PMImJW8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing spin-stabilized, the spread as you can see is pretty much non-existent if you fire both of them at the same time, so they are accurate at medium ranges if you can line up the target right. But if you launch only one at a time (there are action groups for that), go for the close kill because recoil will throw you off somewhat. Don\u0027t worry, the missiles have such high T/W that they can get up to effective impact speed in terrifyingly short distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to flight notes, well, all I can say is that the ship was balanced to fly without missiles and does it\u0027s best like that... but you can still glide her to a landing at full load, or get a takeoff at less than 60m/s, or go to vertical climb before the end of the runway. And she will be \u003Cem\u003Emore stable\u003C/em\u003E the more loaded it is, so it may be actually \u003Cem\u003Eeasier\u003C/em\u003E to fly. The hard part is controlling vertical speed on the climb to orbit, it tends to go too high too fast to get the most out of it, so keep an eye on the vertical velocity indicator (next to the altimeter) and try to keep it under 100m/ once you are on your speed run at about 25kms. BTW, it is a clippy design, I won\u0027t deny that, and you have to move the camera around to get to some monoprop tanks inside the intakes. But you can see all of the four intakes, and they actually make the ship \u003Cem\u003Eprettier\u003C/em\u003E. That\u0027s good in my book. Oh, and only 50 part loaded with missiles, so yo know, you can actually play with it next to the carrier and the enemy ships, even if they hide under a lag shield. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is all about this somewhat wimple but cute and well rounded fighter, expect a couple (or more!) releases kinda soon, since a lot of military pieces are coming together to round up the military catalogue of the skunkworks.
