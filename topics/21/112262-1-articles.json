For that you need a rocket fuel factory.\n\n![CWdombAl.png](http://i.imgur.com/CWdombAl.png)\n\nAt only 52 parts once deployed, you can let it just next the launch pad.\n\nPut engineers on the pod and there you go!\n\nStats:\n\n- 45360 units of liquid fuel\n- 55440 units of oxidizer\n- only 12 hours and 30 minutes to be full (works day and night)\n\nComes on wheels, press \u0022stage\u0022 once you are on the desired spot.\n\nAction group 1 start fuel cells and deploy drills.\n\nAction group 2 start drilling and converting.\n\n(Truck to go from the factory to the launch pad with the fuel not included)\n\n[download link (dropbox)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wwiml0lutqxfh07/AADgmGVkNVyl5IsUPwlgMYt-a?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T14:14:27Z","Content":"Wow, really?

Would have to make it in pretty large scale =)"},{"CreatedByName":"H2O.","CreatedById":92782,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T18:11:20Z","Content":"Yes that is what I was trying to say, actually.\n\nBut yes, you will have to be patient to make that into a business.

I parked it right next to the side of the launchpad, just close enough that it didn\u0027t stop new ships being deployed. I then made a hinged arm with a claw and a reaction wheel that kinda flopped onto ship to be filled. Worked fine and no need for a truck. \n\nI\u0027ll see if I can recreate it in 1.0 as it was kinda fun. Bit useless really as fuel is cheap but it was still fun."}]}
