But I\u0027m also not trying to compete with the amazing MunBug, Sure I want to give people an alternative but I\u0027m not gonna go full replica style for now. This is just my Apollo-style rocket, working as a saturn V and so on, but not exactly the same. I could never replicate the LM, my abitilty to go in detail like that just isn\u0027t there, but I will replace those things by own design that function in a similar way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this works, but first of all! We need a new name, and that\u0027s where you guys come in. I am here and now requesting the community to help me name this rocket once and for all!
