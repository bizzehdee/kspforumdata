This one almost slipped under the cracks, but I rediscovered it the other day, and it\u0027s tons of fun to fly. What *for*, that is more dubious, since it\u0027s effectively a very expensive small satellite carrier with a reusable upper stage, but... who cares when you get both a Koriolev\u0027s cross on ascent and a hair-rising runway landing at the end of the mission? \n\n![7APPVR1.png](http://i.imgur.com/7APPVR1.png)\n\nSee, it started as a X-37b replica, but once I had built the tiny orbiter, I though it would be fun to use the then-new Mk2 fuselages to offset the lifting values on the orbiter on top and not \u0022cheat\u0022 with hidden control surfaces or the like. Well, midway through the build, I realized I had built an awesome Soyuz-like launcher, so I went with the full 1.5 stages things (no fuel lines!). So there: much bigger than it probably needs to be (some tanks actually start empty), but it is *awesome* to launch. And along the way I realized I had invented engine cowlings for on-the-pad inspection, just for the kicks of it.\n\n![KrRoTQx.png](http://i.imgur.com/KrRoTQx.png)\n\nAs to use, well, it has quite the respectable payload capacity. See this picture just after ditching the core, which BTW leaves you in a nice 200x30km suborbital trajectory if you do things right:\n\n![tvkQE6k.png](http://i.imgur.com/tvkQE6k.png)\n\nThe payload is over three metric tons, and you still have more than one km/s in the tanks. That means pretty much the whole kerbin system, or in other words every satellite contract you might choose to pick. But let\u0027s face it, if you are launching this, it\u0027s not to make money... Anyhow, check the imgur album for a complete mission, and tell me what you think of this: a waste of funds, or something nice to try out for a change of pace?\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The radial decoupler bug is definitely an unintended bug, and there is an extremely simple way of getting around it, so why not? I used to edit the decoupler manually, actually, but this is just so much more convenient. And the other bunch of bugs it also fixes, of course.\n\nRune. Should be easier to find!"}]}
