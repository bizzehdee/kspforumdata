The obvious answer is planes! But the problem was that I hadn\u0027t upgraded the runway yet, and didn\u0027t even have anything that that could roll as landing gear! So the solution I tried for was a Vertical Take Of and Landing craft, a VTOL. It\u0027s a single use only, so I basically try to capture all of the crew report portions of a contract first, in a particular area, then come down for a landing and do a single EVA report, then recover and start again. Once I\u0027ve got a ladder I could feasibly climb back up to the cockpit, reset the parachutes, and start flying again. I\u0027ve only done a few landings in this thing so far, and they\u0027re hairy to say the least! But it gets the job done, and always gets down in 1 piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight is pretty simple to fly, with SAS on, and it flys pretty level, slightly nose-down. I\u0027m going to work on balancing it out as my next task, so it\u0027s easier to fly without SAS. Take-off is straightforward: SAS on, full throttle, ignite engine, takeoff and push down on the stick until level flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you think, and where you can see improvements could be made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://funkyhoratio.altervista.org/KSP/VTOL%20Jet%201.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft File\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x2jIxKI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022x2jIxKI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7dt8Jg5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227dt8Jg5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i2RsWyV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i2RsWyV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Freak80MC","CreatedById":37559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-21T01:38:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s funny to compare this to my career mode plane that I use for survey contracts. I went for an actual plane design, but since I didn\u0027t have landing gear wheels I just made like skis out of some girder pieces. (I have since now upgraded the plane to include some wheels) Only thing that sucks is I still don\u0027t have ladders and thus once the kerbals out on the surface, the mission has to end.
