It carries a working spinning centrifuge [requiring CleverBobCat/Damned Robotics modified Rotatron pivot], a communications array, the capability to carry up to four smaller craft, and its engine section comprises of both nuclear and ion engines. It is capable of operating under full thrust without damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be noted that timewarping causes the centrifuge to spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TGvULCk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TGvULCk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s24.postimg.org/6j4nembr9/screenshot106.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot106.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn its test flight, the F\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1fnir used 1/4 of its liquid fuel/oxidizer, and very little of its xenon gas reserve, to reach Minmus orbit.
