And that is not going well.\n\nSo I\u0027m left wondering if I\u0027m just having trouble designing them, which is ok I can just keep trying until I get it, or if I\u0027m just trying to do too much with one SSTO and really need to create ones that are more role specific.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve been trying to do is use the Mk3 cockpit, the 16 passenger section, the longer cargo bay, one or two nukes and the RCS tank. Granted that doesn\u0027t include the necessary fuel tanks, RCS thrusters, and engines to get to LKO. And I\u0027m only really trying to get enough delta v to get to orbit and dock with a refueling station. Then from there be able to get to at least Duna.\n\nI guess this could have been put in one of the questions sub-forums, I posted here though because I\u0027m hoping to see screenshots of large SSTOs that may give me ideas or maybe even push me in a completely new direction in my designs. And I didn\u0027t post any of my failures because I\u0027m not at my gaming computer and I think I deleted most of them as being hopeless.\n\nThanks,\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T15:41:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fenris**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ojimak","CreatedById":57539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T16:32:02Z","Content":"My largest so far is my OO-5 \u0027Aepyornis\u0027 (Because who says biplanes can\u0027t be SSTOs?) - 169.2 mTons at launch, 41.9 mTon payload = 24.8% payload fraction. It\u0027s not really up to the specifications you want, lacking the nukes and passenger bay, although I personally don\u0027t think nukes are really necessary if you\u0027re just going to LKO. I usually go pure RAPIER, with one for every 13 or so tons of total weight.\n\nThe wing shape used here is what I use on all my SSTOs: canards in the front and then minimally (entirely subjective) sized main wings.\n\nPretty Orbit Picture:\n\n[![H9AdIQJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/H9AdIQJ.png)](http://imgur.com/H9AdIQJ)\n\nCoM/CoL/CoT\n\n[![kpuguCn.png](http://i.imgur.com/kpuguCn.png)](http://imgur.com/kpuguCn)\n\nOn Runway\n\n[![mczNYfh.png](http://i.imgur.com/mczNYfh.png)](http://imgur.com/mczNYfh)\n\n[![SkrgKiu.png](http://i.imgur.com/SkrgKiu.png)](http://imgur.com/SkrgKiu)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Four to six Stratus-V Cylindrified Tanks should be enough for most large-scale docking operations and skilled pilots can probably do it with much less (not me though). If I was going to Duna I\u0027d personally add nukes, but would also consider clipping them inside other engines for aesthetic purposes/taking up less space.\n\n-Ojimak"},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T05:35:06Z","Content":"[http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230783-nram-griffon-p3-stock-ssto](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230783-nram-griffon-p3-stock-ssto)\n\n![sL8j4K2.png](http://i.imgur.com/sL8j4K2.png)\n\nThe craft itself is 327 tons, with two full orange fuel tanks loaded (the maximum cargo load) this is 407 tons to orbit. No staging, no external fuel tanks, just a whole bunch of engines (and thereby parts).

It would appear that I don\u0027t need the amount of fuel I was trying to pack on, I need to get better at making wings for atmo, and I was surprised to see crafts larger than I was trying to make using less engines than I was thinking I needed.\n\nI was also trying to see if the SSTO I was trying to create was possible with KSPs physics as I can waste up to 8 hours trying to perfect a craft and everyone has proven that it is.
