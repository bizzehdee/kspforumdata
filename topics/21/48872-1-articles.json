It flies exactly like you\u0027d expect a huge airliner to. I\u0027ve clipped some canards into the front, as well as used the stock thrust-vectoring turbojets instead of the B9 non-vectored ones. Without those modifications, it would NOT be able to keep the nose down at speed. I haven\u0027t flown and landed it but maybe you\u0027re a better pilot. It CAN take off of the runway without using the drop-off at the end, but watch your tail, as it is exceedingly easy to do a tail-strike and blow off your engines.
