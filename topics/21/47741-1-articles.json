The (real life) problem with landers like this is that the surface time is limited. It\u0027s okay if you just want to plant a flag and grab some rocks. But to do real science you need more surface time than an astronaut can really accomplish without getting out of their suit at some point. The later two and three-day lunar missions would have been impossible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to build my landers with cans as well, but even with that my Tylo lander was a lot smaller than that. What I did was design a lander that had enough fuel to lift off, plus about 500 m/s or so. Then I created a first stage for that lander that had nothing but fuel and engines. From Tylo orbit, the first stage fired and cancelled all of the orbital velocity, then did a slow burn down to the surface to keep the vertical velocity low. The first stage ran out of fuel about 1,000 m off the surface and the second stage landed on Tylo with enough dv to get back to orbit. It was really tight, the lander didn\u0027t have enough fuel left to rendezvous with the main ship, so they had to come get them. But it worked. I then refueled the second stage and used it as a lander on Bop and Pol. (I had another lander with parachutes for Laythe that was reused at Vall.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
