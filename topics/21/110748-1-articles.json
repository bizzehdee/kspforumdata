This is the F-5E Tiger I prototype. I\u0027ll have a Tiger II out soon, but to say the least, this one looks more accurate.\n\n![PebDMv7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PebDMv7.jpg)\n\n![khUzowi.png](http://i.imgur.com/khUzowi.png)\n\n![bq4NY2j.png](http://i.imgur.com/bq4NY2j.png)\n\n![aCxBiub.png](http://i.imgur.com/aCxBiub.png)\n\n![d3zTkbD.png](http://i.imgur.com/d3zTkbD.png)\n\n![n79YkrO.png](http://i.imgur.com/n79YkrO.png)\n\n![BT8vlkf.png](http://i.imgur.com/BT8vlkf.png)\n\n![ktpOxE5.png](http://i.imgur.com/ktpOxE5.png)\n\nShe handles a little quirky, but she still flies well, There is a reason why I stuck prototype to the title, and it\u0027s because Tiger I is my prototype for the Tiger II.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/r1nlfwwiphp8nqf/F-5E.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r1nlfwwiphp8nqf/F-5E.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kozak","CreatedById":128114,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T04:17:28Z","Content":"LoK!\n\nI love how that\u0027s the first thing i notice about it.\n\nawesome craft, have some rep"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T14:24:59Z","Content":"A few nitpicks:\n\n1. I would recommend replacing the fuel tanks ahead of the tank ahead of the engines with precoolers to simulate the auxiliary inlet doors.\n\n2. Not a fan of the decoupling moment caused by the wing mounted airbrakes. The airbrakes on the F-5 are a single spoiler just ahead of the mainwheel undercarriage on the underside of the fuselage. I personally don\u0027t see it working simply because the airbrake in KSP is too big and you\u0027d prang it on the runway. I personally found the typical side fuselage layout with the brakes ahead of the stabilators to help the handling of the plane.\n\n3. That bird has way too much rudder. I would recommend a smaller control surface or disabling engine gimbal.\n\nThat aside, the F-5 looks to me like a tough plane to build, but you pulled it off, so you get rep from me for making this beauty! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
