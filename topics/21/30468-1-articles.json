For example, I run both a test universe and a reality universe that have completely different standards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn an effort to dispel the unfair notion that those of us who seek additional reality features in KSP are some sort of humorless sticks-in-the-mud who don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know how to have fun, I present to you my latest idea for a science fiction universe called Thunderbirds Are Go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it is loosely based on Gerry Anderson\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s famous work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the basic concept; regardless of how you run your space division, you will now also conduct ground operations with a fully realized, but quite impossible reality-wise, ground division called The Thunderbirds. Thunderbird operations are wholly unrelated to your space division, so feel free to run that as you please and as real as you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to take this concept anywhere you like. There are no rules other than to have fun! So, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll tell you what I plan to do, and you can either do something similar or modify and change anything you like about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my version of this universe, The Thunderbirds have two primary tasks (so far); post-mission vehicle recovery and removal of debris on the ground. All debris is unlimited in its persistence and may not be removed, ever, by \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cend mission\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. The Thunderbirds do have limited space assets such as a space station and a rocket based vehicle to rotate crew. There are also several satellites in orbit meant to support ground-based operations. However, The Thunderbirds do not conduct space operations outside of supporting ground elements via LKO observation. In other words, debris in space is the responsibility of the space division.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy version of The Thunderbirds has five vehicles similar in capability to Gerry\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s universe. These descriptions are what Gerry\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s vision was, and then I show what I am using as a similar vehicle. Not exact replacement; for example, my Thunderbird 4 is amphibious, not submersible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThunderbird 1 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Hypersonic variable-sweep wing rocket plane used for fast response, rescue zone reconnaissance, and as a mobile control base. Currently: stock Aeris 3A\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThunderbird 2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Heavy supersonic VTOL carrier lifting body aircraft used for the transport of major rescue equipment and vehicles, including Thunderbird 4. Currently WIP: Large Airship with winch and pod that contains rover. Rover equipped with landing legs on the front (thanks to whoever I stole that idea from!) to destroy debris on the ground. Thunderbird 4 does NOT launch from a Thunderbird 2 pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThunderbird 3 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Re-usable, vertically-launched SSTO (Single-stage-to-orbit) spacecraft used for space rescue and maintenance of Thunderbird 5. Currently: My own Kerbal design that is not SSTO or re-usable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThunderbird 4 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Small utility submersible for underwater rescue.

The two tanks will be joined in the middle by structural parts creating a platform, or the \u0022deck\u0022 of the boat, if you will. The I\u0027ll stick on a ladder and a few chairs and see how that works. I may even try to develop that idea a little more with obvious inspiration from the absolutely brilliant Dropship One and Dropship Two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the problem with dropship two was two much mass below the water line, even though we do not have much in the way of realistic water physics. I have launched boats made by other folks and there is never too much below the line. Obviously, TB4 is going to take quite a bit of development. As it stands now I haven\u0027t strutted it up or anything so it will likely break in half by just making that little drop to the runway when you launch. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, great to see someone else having fun with the Thunderbirds!
