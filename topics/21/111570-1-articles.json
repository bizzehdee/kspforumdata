So far I have the Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka Model 22, a jet propelled Japanese kamikaze suicide attack plane built towards the end of World War 2; the Heinkel HE-162, a Luftwaffe jet fighter built late in the war; the Horton HO-229, the first stealth bomber, 3 were built by the Luftwaffe in 1944; the Messerschmitt ME-163 Komet, a German rocket-powered interceptor, it protected key locations under German occupancy; the Messerschmitt ME-262 Swallow, the first ever operational fighter jet, it was the cause of 542 allied kills; the Bachem Ba-349 a rocket powered interceptor like the ME-163 with and Interesting landing procedure; the Arado Ar-234, the first operational jet bomber; the Heinkel He-176, the first aircraft to be powered solely by a liquid-fueled rocket; the Northrop XP-79B, an experimental flying wing aircraft with was destroyed during its first flight; the de Havilland Vampire, was a British fighter jet manufactured during the war by de Havilland, 3,300 were produced; the Gloster E.28/39, was the first British jet-engine powered aircraft to actually fly; the Bell P-59 Airacomet, was a proposed jet fighter in the U.S. during WWII it was canceled because the USAF was not impressed with its performance; the Hawker Siddeley Sea Hawk was a British naval fighter, 542 were built (Coincidence? I think not); the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star, was the first jet fighter used operationally by the United States Air Force, 1,715 were built; the Dassault Ouragan, was the first French-designed jet fighter/bomber to enter production and active service; the Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka model 11, was a rocket-propelled Japanese suicide bomber during WW2; the Grumman F9F Panther, was Grumman\u0027s first jet fighter and one of the U.S. Navy\u0027s first successful aircraft carrier-based jet fighters. I am currently working on the Sud-Ouest SO.6000, and the Heinkel He-178. Any suggestions and feedback would be appreciated. Also if you want me to use KAX to make prop planes show your support and if enough people like the idea I will.\n\n![YBiaPZM.png](http://i.imgur.com/YBiaPZM.png)\n\nYokosuka MXY-7 Ohka Model 22
