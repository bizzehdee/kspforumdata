Next, press the zero key to extend the \u0027masts\u0027 and 1 to retract the first mast again (2-4 will retract the others). 5 and 6 will rotate the tops of the masts. Align the first decoupler with the large engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow stand the Kerbal to be rescued on top of the small rocket engine. Quicksave at this point, because there is a very good chance that something will go wrong. To launch, throttle to 100%, reactivate one of the fuel tanks (not the one farthest from the crew pod, it won\u0027t feed the large engine), hit the space bar and immediately press \u0027x\u0027, as quickly as you can. Switch to the Kerbal before he gets too far away, and try to find the decoupler flying somewhere below you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 3 - Freefall\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the EVA pack to catch up with the decoupler. Once you match speeds with it, briefly timewarp to stop its rotation (try to have it horizontal). Grab the ladder and check your orbit in the map view. Unless you are \u003Cem\u003Eincredibly\u003C/em\u003E lucky you be headed toward a close fly-by or an impact trajectory. Hop off the ladder and push up or down to adjust (this is the second hardest part). Try to get the periapsis between 29km and 34km - I think the sweet spot is about 30km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the orbit is correctly tuned, let go of the ladder and timewarp toward Kerbin. When you start to drift away from the ladder, exit timewarp, grab and let go of the ladder, warp again, repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you drift \u003Cem\u003Einto \u003C/em\u003E the decoupler, wait until you pass through it before coming out of timewarp (watch the end of the video to see why).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 4 - Re-entry\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHold on tight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft requires the Damned Robotics mod: [thread]9675[/thread]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csub\u003E* Up to 25% survival rates\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the first working design of the EKRS.
