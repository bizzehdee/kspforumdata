You sent your whole base in one go. You design your base in the VAB, then you create a skycrane above it that can land it on the moon and finally you make a launcher capable of getting it into orbit. this is doable, I sent 100t bases to the Mun and Minmus this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You build a modular base. Start by building your whole base in the VAB, connecting the different pieces with dockingports and you all put them on wheels. Then you save your whole thing, and ditch out everything excepted for the part you want to send. This will probably kill your current root part, so take a probe core and build a skycrane from it and attach the module you want to send under it. Build a launcher under, send your thing to the moon. Once you got it landed, go back to the VAB, take your whole base again and keep another part that was attached to the first part and repeat the process. Then you send it to the moon and roll it all the way to your first module and connect them together. Then you just repeat until you have your whole base on the moon. Subassembly load can be extremely useful here for the launcher/skycrane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow boths have their stenghts and weaknesses. The first method requires to build a very strong launcher, which can be hard. Landing a large base can also be tricky. The second is very very long, but requires less trouble with the launcher and landings. Those are the most commonly used ways I guessed, idk if anyone does it eitherway but it\u0027s how I usually operate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck! ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThriftyNifty","CreatedById":68580,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T22:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see my issue here.....I have no idea about skycranes.

Just put a decoupler on the top of your module, a fuel tank, radial engines, and you got a basic skycrane. And why isn\u0027t the module part working? IF the problem is the height, just adjust the wheels in the VAB so they are all on the same level and the docking should be fine. Just find a way to make everything standardized and you should be fine. And else if you want extensions with the first idea, you could simply land separate modules next to the first one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
