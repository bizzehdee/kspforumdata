If you haven;t played it and still know the plane, I commend you. The P-26 Peashooter is an American fighter plane designed and flown in the 1930s. It didn\u0027t see much service in WWII due to how outclassed it was by the Luftwaffe\u0027s Bf-109s and Fw-190s, but it did see some service against the Japanese in China. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HLVcjAM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HLVcjAM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Peashooter is capable of carrying a 100lb bomb underneath the fuselage, making it suitable for dive bombing. Although it can\u0027t wreck buildings, it can destroy tanks or jeeps, provided you can hit them with it! Maneuverability is good, although not stellar, although I believe this accurately reflects the real plane\u0027s handling characteristics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8GfKcI0.png\u0022 alt=\u00228GfKcI0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/THU4zQX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022THU4zQX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe handling changes very little after the bomb is dropped, although to someone who is unfamiliar with this style of plane, it can be a little difficult. Takeoff and landing can be difficult as well. Is is recommended to jettison the bomb before landing for extra safety, and lower the flaps (AG-1) to decrease speed as much as possible. Keep the nose level with the horizon so they main gear touches down first, then cautiously apply the brakes (on and off, not for more than two seconds) until the tailwheel touches the ground. Once all three wheels are down, brake until stopped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B7ZUHTU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B7ZUHTU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SjyX4Em.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SjyX4Em.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, it is a very fun plane to fly, quite fast, although not as maneuverable as my Fokker Dr.I. It is very detailed while only having 134 parts, so almost anyone can fly it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/pTrevTrevs/P-26-Peashooter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETRY IT FOR YOURSELF HERE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAs always, thank you for taking the time to view this, please let me know your thoughts, and rep if you liked! \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bubbadevlin","CreatedById":136524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T02:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E, really surprised you didnt just throw some junos on there so the engines were less obvious, but great replica! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T13:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bubbadevlin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bubbadevlin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENice! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E, really surprised you didnt just throw some junos on there so the engines were less obvious, but great replica! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I already had the thing built and knew how it performed with the wheesley, so I just left it there.

At least I think that\u0027s how it works. Gimbal has to be disabled, or else the thrust would drop off when the engine swivels upward, because the thrust vector would be pointing into the rudder or elevators.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
