A docking port and proper 360 degree RCS would need to be fitted if you need to do docking type things.\n\nDe-orbit at between 20-30 degrees nose up. The orbiter seems pretty rugged and has survived full on tumbling re-entry.\n\nThe launch vehicle has to engage the engines to reach the other side of the water. There is a closed reserve tank at the front if needed.\n\nThere may be more efficient launch profiles but the above places little stress on the launch vehicle and leaves about 6-700 m/s delta V.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T22:14:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 10:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fellow314**"}]}
