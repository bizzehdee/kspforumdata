Just giving a description of the craft helps no-one and just clutters up the forums. Try to get a download link and at least 1 picture up here. However, I have noticed that jets tend to not get many comments."},{"CreatedByName":"Pirate_Commander","CreatedById":141929,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:55:26Z","Content":"I couldn\u0027tget the pic to come up so I was waiting for it to show up first"},{"CreatedByName":"Pirate_Commander","CreatedById":141929,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:59:28Z","Content":"I couldn\u0027t get the pic to come up so I was waiting for it to show up first\n\n(oops)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T03:05:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 03:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pirate\\_Commander**\n  \noops it did twice"},{"CreatedByName":"CitizenAerospace","CreatedById":107486,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:10:59Z","Content":"Upload load to imgur, then use the buttons you can see at the top to post the pictures.
