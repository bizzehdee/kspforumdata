Earlier today I built this little rocket to get me to the Mun; I\u0027ve done it a million times before, nothing new whatsoever. The thing is, as soon as my apogee reaches ~35-40 kilometers, my rocket spins completely out of control. SAS doesn\u0027t help, when I press \u0027x\u0027 the marker moves down to 0 but the engines don\u0027t cut off, and staging doesn\u0027t work, all for about five seconds before I finally regain control. This is a recurring problem, it happens consistently every time I try to use this rocket. Other ones perform just fine, but I don\u0027t want to give up on this rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the life of me I can\u0027t figure out how these attachments work on vBulliten, so I\u0027m just going to post a link to mediafire for the .craft download. I\u0027ve also got a VAB picture of the rocket, although I sadly didn\u0027t get anything from the actual problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s worth noting that I just downloaded a new KSP folder yesterday, and my only modification is that I edited the .cfg of the command pod to increase its rotPower and linPower because I\u0027m sick of being able to barely control my rocket in space without thrust. I don\u0027t see how that could be causing this issue, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0qmmB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220qmmB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?4bhg223lobtr3yq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?4bhg223lobtr3yq\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sbowyer28","CreatedById":4338,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-07T16:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIve had this same problem, U would try to add RCS or fuel for stopping the rotation.
