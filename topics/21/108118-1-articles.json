Much sleeker than the Enterprise and faster too; though this one has only Aerospike \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Impulse\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 engines - the Transwarp drive \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cwon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be installed until Tuesday\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had to make a few design concessions so consider this a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Kerbalised\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 version of the ship.\n\nHer not-so-spacious docking bay contains a small science shuttlecraft (requires a single Kerbal to pilot it).\n\n[DOWNLOAD](http://www.whoshotdk.co.uk/KSP/Ships/SPH/USSExcelsior/USSExcelsior.craft)\n\nYou might need to right-click that link and use \u0027Save As\u0027 or similar.\n\nIMPORTANT STUFF\n\nShe won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t hold together within an atmosphere so getting into orbit will require a tool such as HyperEdit. The ship will likely explode under her own weight the first time you launch, so using the F12 debug menu, switch on \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Hack Gravity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 then re-launch. Once you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve gotten into orbit you can then \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Unhack Gravity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2.\n\nThe game will probably have the saucer mounted Cupola set as the default control point. To get correct navball alignment, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll want to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Control from here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 on the RC-001S command module which does double duty as the deflector dish located underneath the saucer on the secondary hull.\n\nThe ship has a little wobble. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sure more struts would help but I like a low part count!\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n**U.S.S Excelsior**\n\nDelta-V: 4,791m/s\n\nMass: 125t (including Shuttle)\n\nDry Mass: 29t (including Shuttle)\n\nPart count: 111\n\nPart count (including Shuttle): 158\n\n**Science Shuttle**\n\nDelta-V: 2,080m/s\n\nRCS Delta-V: 313m/s\n\nCONTROLS\n\n[4] Toggle antenna\n\n[8] Toggle primary docking port (at rear)\n\n[9] Toggle docking bay doors\n\n[0] Undock/decouple docking bay port\n\n**Please enjoy the ship and leave me some love (rep) if you like it!**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
