In that time I built these 2 ships that convinced me without a doubt I would have fun with the full game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first one is called \u0022Mega Missiles\u0022 it\u0027s an 11 stage rocket that has about 11min of burn time and can reach speeds og almost 6500m/s If you time your launch right you can get to the moon in record time, no messy orbiting required! lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://sites.google.com/site/ouchsdownloads/home/downloads/2013-07-27_00002.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-07-27_00002.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is well... It\u0027s literally a pile of fuel tanks welded together...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://sites.google.com/site/ouchsdownloads/home/downloads/2013-07-27_00003.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-07-27_00003.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elol, I know right? Despite it\u0027s looks, it\u0027s actually completely symmetrical and can easily get into orbit with it\u0027s absurd amount of burn time from the tanks. The tanks are hooked up to the thrusters in such a way that they run out of fuel in patterns, and thus a surprisingly stable orbit can be achieved from all of the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, If anyone else is on the fence about buying the game, Maybe these will convince you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut I have edited them in the full game so I don\u0027t know if they will still work in the demo but I still only used parts available in the demo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can download them from here :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://sites.google.com/site/ouchsdownloads/home/downloads/Demo%20Ships.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://sites.google.com/site/ouchsdownloads/home/downloads/Demo%20Ships.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbol Prime","CreatedById":57626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T03:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery kerbal rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Immashift","CreatedById":57223,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T03:51:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmm.

Welcome to the dark side of the paid version mate. I\u0027m sure you willl enjoy yourself with all the stuff you can do in the full game. My advice to you: Don\u0027t bite off big projects out the gate (no space stations or missions to Moho). Start smaller and work your way up to learn the ropes. Another thing: Rendezvous and docking is hard, PRACTICE! And always fold in solar panels if you get the slightest hint you might hit them. It saves you a lot of quickloading later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF5 quicksaves and holding F9 loads your last quicksave.
