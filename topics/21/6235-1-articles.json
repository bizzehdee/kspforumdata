The first time, I was convinced I\\\u0027d just crash again. And the second time I was convinced I was just lucky the first time. Hence the launchpad snap just to give a visual look at the stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the addition of a booster stage, I had the reaction mass needed, and more, for Munar landing and return, achieving this goal yesterday and once again since. This is a very forgiving and responsive machine, otherwise thorough Kerbal exploration of the Mun might still elude me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave the RCS fuel for when you\\\u0027re out of the atmosphere and/or landing on the Mun. Just enable ASAS and launch, letting the airfoil surfaces do the work. This leaves a full tank of RCS fuel for quickly executing the roll after intiial stage-and-a-half separation and for the actual Mun landing. Leveling off on the way to a highly inclined orbit followed by Munar orbit insertion is quite a sight, looking like a spaceplane burning towards Kerbin\\\u0027s nearest neighbor. The vertical stabilizer on the upper surface of the orbital stage is there to help differentiate, but even without such visual aids, this stage is quite easy to control, and should have some fuel left over to aid in the burn towards the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seanoog","CreatedById":8599,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-01T18:22:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, welcome to the Forums. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour ship was nice to fly, however there is still much to improve on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 8 Decouplers \u002B Winglets on the lander is overkill, only really needs 4, so could save weight there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027d recommended that you have a shorter landing module, as its much too easy to topple with yours been so high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Green Winglets that dont move, have no benifits to that particular stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(However they do transfer heat very well, especially good when radially mounting several SRB\\\u0027s together, at keeping there temps in check.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Asthetics!?

I\\\u0027ll swap them out for the functional winglets if they really are basically stylish heat sinks. Also, I\\\u0027ll have a look at the asymmetry.
