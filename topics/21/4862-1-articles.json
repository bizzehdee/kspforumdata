Specially commisioned by the KSP for a partly reusable vessel, which may at some point be used as a cargo ship; as large section of the spaceplane is given to a fuel tank which is not in use. This could easily be converted to carry freight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike previous launch platforms, Veto Aerospace found it especially difficult to build a prototype. As a tailsitter launched craft, it is highly unstable during ignition, and Veto spent almost two thirds of its budget for the program on prototypes which kept falling over, or flipping back over end and crashing near the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater tests brought problems involving the starboard aerothrusters failing before the port aerothrusters - this invariably led to the craft spinning out of control, and on only one occasion was it brought under control before crashing anyway, being too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oK2wE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oK2wE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe\u003C/em\u003E Storm Petrel \u003Cem\u003Ein orbit.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v14v5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022v14v5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe\u003C/em\u003E Storm Petrel \u003Cem\u003Ejettisons its first stage.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003EStorm Petrel\u003C/em\u003E \\\u0027Aeronaut\\\u0027 type spaceplane is a variant of the \u003Cem\u003EStorm Petrel\u003C/em\u003E class of tailsitter orbital-return vehicles.

Also, an extra two parachutes were nescerssary to slow to vessel sufficiently to prevent breakup or explosion on impact. The rearmost aelerons were damaged, the rear \\\u0027chutes were jettisoned, and the craft ended upside down in the water, but was otherwise intact, and retrievable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-26T06:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really liek the idea of having a two-stage large spaceplane.
