(GRRR... Why does Astronomers Pack remain so steadfastly BROKEN?!?! Everything ELSE works more or less just fine, but that one STILL crashes my game even when NOTHING ELSE is added! \\*Sadface\\* I want 1.04 to be as pretty as .25 was, dangit! ) \n\nAhem... \n\nRight, so Kollaborative Warfare - very entertaining series. Here\u0027s a link to a list that\u0027s got all of their videos to date. \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL7TVzn8CoIqkRv5irA37ONb2i_lnAqpX1\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nSome members/nations are very competent (AI Industries) some are hilariously incompetent (Spacegame Junkie) some are hilariously devious and/or agressive in an almost Black Adder fashion (Beardy Penguin and TAPE) and then there\u0027s Twitchy... who brings a certain insane style all his own... I mean... LOL and wow... \n\nOverall the series has inspired me to really work on some good designs for true mayhem and destruction! \n\nFirst - before going any further, I\u0027ll list what mods the KW guys are using. These HAVE to be part of the mod files - except astronomers pack - even a couple of the guys in the series are having trouble with that one. Basic EVE works okay though. I\u0027d recommend making AP optional myself. \n\n**BD Armoury** (The weapons. Obviously it\u0027s MUCH harder to have a war without this stuff - though Macey Dean managed with pure stock...)\n\n**Vanguard Technologies** (Parachutes for the Kerbals - I\u0027d recommend the version with default parachutes. You WILL have to bail from a plane sooner or later... )\n\n**Kerbinside** (Need this for the various bases around Kerbin) \n\n**Texture Replacer**\n\n**Diverse Kerbal Heads** (Texture Replacer and this give your Kerbals individuality) \n\n**Tweakscale** (REALLY helpful always)\n\n**Environmental Visual Enhancements** (the basic version works just fine, but... ) \n\n**Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack** (This does NOT for many people, myself included. A real shame, that.)\n\n**Burn Together** (If you want to fly or drive stuff in formation) \n\n**Improved Chase Cam** (Really handy to help perspective during maneuvering) \n\n**Infernal Robotics** (HInges, pistons, all that good stuff) \n\n**Kerbal Foundries** (Awesome and durable set of wheels and tracks - great for making robust rovers, movable defense turrets and TANKS. Also some hover parts!)\n\n**Firespitter** (More good stuff - mostly useful for adding helicopter and prop plane tech) \n\n**Kerbal Aircraft Expansion** (More useful options for planes, jets, props and the like) \n\nI\u0027m using others as well, and if I started a KWar with anyone, I\u0027d argue for those mods to be included as well, as the ones I\u0027m adding are for the most part, stock-a-like. There are some exceptions, but I\u0027ll note them. For now, here\u0027s the mods you\u0027re going to see in this particular post with the first craft: \n\n**Adjustable Landing Gear**\n\n**Mk 2 Essentials**\n\n**Mk 2 Stock-a-like Expansion**\n\n*Next - the first entry -* \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T12:34:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 12:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Logan.Darklighter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T10:31:51Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to check it out but the youtube link is unclickable."},{"CreatedByName":"Logan.Darklighter","CreatedById":7375,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T12:54:09Z","Content":"And the first craft is a Long range supersonic bomber. I present to you, the - \n\n**B7 Valkyrie**\n\n![09ElR0x.png](http://i.imgur.com/09ElR0x.png)\n\nIt\u0027s a long range supersonic bomber capable of carrying several types of payloads. Inspired by Rune\u0027s White Dart space plane, I\u0027ve included in the download files several different pre-made payload bay options. Some carry ground attack missiles in various configurations. Some carry bombs, and there\u0027s even one with air to air missiles (on the assumption you want to try your hand in dark multiplayer or against AI opponents fighting off multiple attacking fighters or supporting one group against the other with missiles fired from the edges of the battle). \n\nWith 8 .50 caliber turrets spaced around it, the B7 can defend itself against fighters or even shoot down missiles! It has 8 Countermeasure pods, just to make sure you don\u0027t run out at a bad moment. \n\nWhy the .50 cal turrets? Well - they sit flush to the frame, unlike the other guns available in BD armory, and I figured that aesthetically they made more sense for a supersonic bomber. On the B7, in their \u0022folded\u0022 position, the guns are all pointing to the rear with the back of the turret facing the airstream. But they have full 360 motion. At almost every angle, you\u0027ll have at least 4 turrets able to train on a target. And straight forward you can get all 8 on target if you aim right! \n\nIn guard mode they are DEADLY accurate versus fighters and can even shoot down incoming missiles. (Don\u0027t depend on that, though - use those countermeasure pods!)\n\n![0CornsE.png](http://i.imgur.com/0CornsE.png)\n\nThey also do fine double-duty as low level strafing guns. \n\n![StnYb1h.png](http://i.imgur.com/StnYb1h.png)\n\nBut the B7\u0027s main defense is sheer SPEED. The idea is to massively bomb or missile saturate an enemy defensive position and get the HELL out of dodge before taking any damage. \n\n***\u0022Though I fly through the Valley of Death, I shall fear no evil. For I am at 80,000 feet and climbing...\u0022***\n\nIt was based around the frame of my latest spaceplane, the Antares. The Antares uses OPT engines that are - quite frankly - almost ridiculously over-powered. But the basic airframe is more than capable of high speed with just the stock \u0022Whiplash\u0022 turbojets.\n\n![3RtngvR.png](http://i.imgur.com/3RtngvR.png)\n\nIt\u0027s capable of getting from the runway up to 10,000 meters and Mach 2 in about 30-40 seconds. The trick is holding BACK on the throttle at the right time to avoid overheating and exploding engines! I\u0027d consider \u0022safe\u0022 cruising speed and altitude to be Mach 2.5 at around 15,000 meters. And the Valkyrie is capable of BRIEF sprints at well over Mach 3 between 16,000 and 20,000 meters. WATCH THOSE TEMPERATURE GAUGES though if you do that! You can push it too far and then you\u0027ll REALLY be sorry... \n\n![R0iSfLB.png](http://i.imgur.com/R0iSfLB.png)\n\nBut - if you plan your speed and altitude properly, you can \u0022supercruise\u0022 halfway around Kerbin for a strike one way, and at least half of that distance if you plan a full return round trip afterwards.\n\nThe main design by default has the action groups set up to cycle through the weapons and drop missiles or bombs individually, but you may wish to change that. It\u0027s easy to set up volley fire with the action groups. In fact I recommend it in some cases. \n\nThough not required, I HIGHLY recommend TAC Fuel balancer and set up the fuel tankage feeds back to front to maintain the COG forward of the lift when the fuel gets low.\n\n**Payload Options:** \n\nThe Payload bay is capable of holding the following that I\u0027ve tested and saved as sub-assemblies included in the package: \n\n- 3 Cruise missiles\n\n- 6 Maverick Missiles\n\n- A mix of 12 Hellfire and 4 Mavericks\n\n- 5 AMRAAM missiles\n\n- 3 Cluster Bombs and 6 Mk 82 Bombs\n\n- 12 Mk 82 Bombs\n\n- 12 Mk 82 Snakeeye Low Altitude Bombs\n\nA note on designing your own payloads: \n\nOne of the things that kept destroying my test Valkyries - particularly at high drop speeds over Mach 1 - is the fact that you need to set your drop time on the missiles to MAXIMUM and your Ejection speed on the launch rails high. You basically need to KICK those missiles down and away from the payload bay and clear of the aircraft so they have enough clearance before they ignite their rocket engines! \n\nAlso - try to give the missiles clearance space from the back of the bay. As well as clear drop angles that don\u0027t get entangled with other missiles/bombs! \n\nI can\u0027t tell you how many times I\u0027ve watched a missile pin itself against the forward wall of the bay before exploding and shredding the plane... oy... ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif)\n\nA very full bomb bay - \n\n![ghHZ4x1.png](http://i.imgur.com/ghHZ4x1.png)\n\n![dXcZhlO.png](http://i.imgur.com/dXcZhlO.png)\n\n![jD9jhFu.png](http://i.imgur.com/jD9jhFu.png)\n\n![lHPMmcB.png](http://i.imgur.com/lHPMmcB.png)\n\n**A word on naming and history:** \n\nThough the B7 Valkyrie resembles an SR 71 Blackbird, I decided for several reasons to name it as an homage to a fantastic piece of Aviation history and technological know-how - that unfortunately wound up obsolete in terms of mission profile before it ever had a chance to see production. That plane was the XB-70 Valkyrie and it was a transonic bomber with speed rivalling that of the Blackbird but capable of delivering several nuclear bombs! It was an amazing plane, but ICBMs and stealth technology basically ensured it would never enter production. That and an unfortunate crash of one of the prototypes caused by an F-104 getting too close in formation and colliding with and shearing off the vertical stabilizers ensured the end of the program. \n\n![UVtuk2b.png](http://i.imgur.com/UVtuk2b.png)\n\nAs for my particular choice - well - that row of 6 engines, it\u0027s Mach 3.3 top speed and capability as a bomber pretty much were reason enough, I\u0027d say. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWell - here\u0027s the bomber for you to test. There are two SPH craft files - one is the regular Valkyrie, the other is an unarmed version in case you want to come up with a completely different weapons config from the ground up. \n\n[**B7 Valkyrie Craft files**](http://www./download/787cmmozd9s7cec/B7_Valkyrie.zip)\n\nAlso in Sub-Assemblies are several Payloads ready to slot in. They\u0027ve all been tested to make sure they can all fire or drop all their payloads without destroying the plane. Still - occasionally weirdness happens. I make no absolute guarantees. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThe Payloads are: \n\nAir to Air payload: 5 AMRAAM Missiles. \n\nAir to Ground Payload: 12 Hellfire and 4 Maverick Missiles (seen in the screenshots above)\n\nCruise Missile Payload: 3 Cruise missiles\n\nMaverick Payload: 6 Maverick Ground Attack Missiles\n\nMixed Munitions Payload: 3 Cluster Bombs and 6 Mk 82 Bombs\n\nMk 82 Bomb Payload: 12 Mk 82 Bombs\n\nSnakeeye Bomb Payload: 12 Mk 82 Snakeeye Low Altitude Bombs\n\nSo - take her for a spin and let me know what you think!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d like to check it out but the youtube link is unclickable.\n\nLink is fixed!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOh - one other image for anyone wanting to see some Kerbal Engineer stats. \n\n![0bAHbbc.png](http://i.imgur.com/0bAHbbc.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T13:14:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 01:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Logan.Darklighter**"}]}
