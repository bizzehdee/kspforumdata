At first I thought it would be something that does many return trips to an MPL science module, docking and refreshing the experiments, but then I thought, what if I made the MPL PART of the rover?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sbE2mlK.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022sbE2mlK.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd from underneath,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BYPQTCn.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022BYPQTCn.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is it would attach to the side (or even the top) of a rocket via the docking port, get shuttled out somewhere, then land and drive around, sucking up all the science available without the need for return trips. Then when it\u0027s done, fly up into orbit and redock with whatever brought it there, and fly home to Kerbin. All science gear is attached (times 2!), and can be removed as needed if relevant techs aren\u0027t discovered yet. Given the massive rover wheels though it will take some focused research to unlock the base vehicle anyway. The plan was to test it on Minmus, but that involves building a craft to get it there (or hack stuff to teleport it, but I don\u0027t know how), and I need sleep.

After a lot of re-arranging, I ended up with the USRV Mk3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kf0NqAu.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022Kf0NqAu.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a clean start, you need 4498 science to unlock all the parts needed for this, which again is still a major chunk of the tech tree, though a few thousand less then before. Keep in mind this doesn\u0027t include the launch vehicle, but the one I posted above would be build-able with the parts unlocked on the way to the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the link to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/716gpi8ydpcg6sz/USRV%20Mk3.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUSRV Mk3\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T22:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery brutal, that science won\u0027t know what hit it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Assault Bunny","CreatedById":61177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T02:29:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew update!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a trip to the Mun to soak up some science, I noticed that my design didn\u0027t have enough solar panels to sustain operation as just a rover, let alone processing and transmitting science.

It\u0027s now much less inclined to try and back-flip and break off the engines, and is able to process and transmit a full load of science without zeroing out it\u0027s power. Caution is still advised on night sides of moons, as it has no RTGs (hadn\u0027t unlocked them). I also took out the atmospheric sensors. On any place it\u0027s likely to use them, it wouldn\u0027t be coming back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve included a launcher for convenience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qVQBaZF.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022qVQBaZF.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s enough to get it into a barely sub-orbital trajectory before the last stage, which can easily get it to Minmus orbit. After that it\u0027s mostly spent, but once detached from the rover it should have enough left to either crash into Minmus/the Mun, or possibly even return to Kerbin if you\u0027ve done it well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe included launcher features caps on the USRV\u0027s engines, with attached wings.
