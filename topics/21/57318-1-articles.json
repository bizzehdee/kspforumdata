Expanded with another three designs, the Munshine family now features a total of nine lifters. Amazing advancements in the \u0022structural skeleton\u0022 technology that was pioneered on the Munshine VII (formerly Munshine X) have allowed the family to grow to an amazing 165-ton payload capacity in case you really, \u003Cem\u003Ereally \u003C/em\u003Eneed to put that much stuff into orbit at once. We\u0027ve gone ahead and re-organized the naming convention too. Where the Munshine lifters were previously named in the order they were designed, and beginning with V for historical reasons, they are now ordered by payload capacity for ease of use.
