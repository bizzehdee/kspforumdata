Here\u0027s one of my latest creations, the Mk V orbital scooter (yes there were 4 other... less healthy versions before it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E ). Aside from the certain appeal to strapping a Kerbal on top of a rocket and shooting him out into space in nothing but his space suit, the orbital scooter turned out to be quite a useful little craft as it has a decent fuel autonomy, enough for one or two orbital rendezvous, and in case you happen to run out of fuel you can always fly by RCS since the craft is so light. Who knows maybe I\u0027ll strap some small landing gear on it and try taking it to the Mun one day just for laughs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can download the zip file here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/UXTQB8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://goo.gl/UXTQB8\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the presentation video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wPn63iOi2fI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote 1: I listed this under stock since it doesn\u0027t use any fancy components, however, I do run the MechJeb mod and the scooter integrates the MechJeb control box, but you can take that out easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote 2: For easy access, I included a pod in the launch configuration, so that you can simply EVA your kerbal, and climb up the ladder and into the scooter without having to do this in two different \u0022launches\u0022. However the scooter has remote control so you don\u0027t need to launch a kerbal up into space if you don\u0027t want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T15:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice!

Docking to objects is going to be a hassle and moving object with it is going to be a bigger hassle. Also as the limited fuel runs out, the RCS and the center of mass is going to be different, meaning that it\u0027s going to be unstable. But other than that, this thing looks cool! Just like my MMU\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoodGameHunter","CreatedById":100624,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T19:13:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah the scooter is not designed to move stuff around, just to move kerbals in a stylish way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The docking port is just so you can park the thing, it wasn\u0027t originally included in the design until Jebediah took a short break at the orbital station to get a drink and his scooter flew off into the depths of space heh.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
