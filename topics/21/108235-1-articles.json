Docking port might be useful if I had some sort of super freighter that could attach a bunch of bases at once. Mostly there because it was required in contract. 2 hab modules, science junior, bay with temp and pressure \u002B goo. Also four batteries for the long dark of Munia. Ladders for kerbals to climb down to play dustball on the mun. Also a ladder for scientist kerbal to access science gear. With a way to fuel on the ground this could be a lander. One shot from KSC to mun was a crash at 40 ms when fuel ran out. Simple small refuel in low kerbal orbit makes it cake.\n\n![2n7fb4i.jpg](http://i57.tinypic.com/2n7fb4i.jpg)\n\n![2lm9jyd.jpg](http://i60.tinypic.com/2lm9jyd.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T16:36:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 04:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Stickyhammy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T16:43:08Z","Content":"Interesting double-barrel approach. I tend to just put it all in a tower instead... which is probably why my Mun base is sideways right now."},{"CreatedByName":"Stickyhammy","CreatedById":110509,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T16:51:42Z","Content":"I believe in equality for all kerbals. This way no kerbal has a penthouse and the other kerbals have to live in the sewers. It was also easy to land with a larger surface area. Once I get further in the tech tree I will change it up to add a lab and a place to dock rovers. Probably not add miners to this design. Best to make a new one for that."}]}
