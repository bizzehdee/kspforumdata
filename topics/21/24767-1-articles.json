Oh and I like large control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI especially like the little probe-controlled four-kerbal rovers I made. They were specifically designed to hold four Kerbals while still being relatively lightweight, having a low center of gravity, and looking at least slightly elegant. Oh and I hate the look of the 4-Kerbal pods on small rovers. They look okay on large rovers, but I have no idea how to make them look good on small rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ZyzUxaX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZyzUxaXl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZyzUxaXl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction Groups:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. toggles solar cells\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. toggles lights\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. toggles ladders\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. toggles antennae and sensors\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. undocks all modules/rovers from the scaffolding\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe title really is most of the description, and so I\u0027m not gong to bother to go much in depth about it unless anyone specifically asks. Oh and almost any descriptive information can be found in the image descriptions in the album, just scroll past the understood parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the major characteristics, I guess, is that this base has way more fuel than necessary (I had maybe 1500 m/s delta-V unused upon landing) allowing for poor/unaided fliers like me to easily get this base to its destination, regardless of flight plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be able to get to Dres.

If you don\u0060t like docking in orbit because of lag then have you thought of putting your base on wheels combined with legs and docking once you have landed? It would open up possibilities for you and your system. You could land over 2km away (less lag) then drive to your base and connect a module then put it on its legs and it will be a proper base module. If you wanted you could even have a mobile kethane mining mun base...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bacondeity","CreatedById":60104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T13:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWord to the comment above mine, that\u0027s what I did with my Mun Base.
