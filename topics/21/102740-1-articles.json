You can glide in unpowered at approximately 30m/s minimum. On landing, you can use the bow facing RCS jets to help slow down and come to a stop.\n\nThe best way to take off from water is to get up to approximately 50m/s, then sharply nose her down then back up to bounce her out of the water.\n\nFuel tank sits in the center of the plane inside the fuselage so refueling will require the TAC Fuel Balancer mod or ninja mouse skills. She has a Docking Port Jr on the bow keel to connect with a fuel tanker or whatever.\n\nGetting up and off the extending ladders (Telus Mobility Enhancer) is tricky - I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve found the easiest way is to climb to the top of the Telus, then quickly let go and re-grab. Your Kerbal should grab the horizontally mounted ladder so that you can climb up onto the wing.\n\nHope you like the craft!\n\nDave"},{"CreatedByName":"Prof. Endwalker","CreatedById":83020,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T12:17:43Z","Content":"Kinda hard to see with it being night, but it looks pretty good!

I think you can use any parts you like for the floats, so long as their Crash Tolerance is high (i.e 80m/s) and that they keep more fragile bits out of the water. One thing to watch out for is that the floats will move the Center of Mass downwards which can play havoc with the flight characteristics of the plane. Placing the wings a little lower helps.\n\nHeres a daytime screenshot of the Aquamarine...\n\n![AquamarineMkI.jpg](http://www.whoshotdk.co.uk/KSP/Ships/SPH/AquamarineMkI.jpg)"}]}
