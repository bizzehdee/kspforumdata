The landing can handle some slope but if you think you are going to land on a gradient you might want to modify the landing gear yourself. It works fine for most situations. If you are landing a lot higher than sea level you might need to use a bit of thrust to slow your landing as the parachutes will be less effective. It\u0027s not something I have tested to be honest although it is worth noting that at near sea level altitudes the lander is falling at about 6 m/s so higher up it may not be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xqqzu3z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Xqqzu3z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPress hotkey 2 to activate the escape towers and jettison all the parachutes.
