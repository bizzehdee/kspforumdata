To that end, I took the most efficient orbiter I could fly, the Shamrock, and added a very rudimentary lander on top. I also add a trio of SRBs below to get the rocket off the pad. I have flown the craft to Munar orbit and back, but have not landed due to being unable to operate a no-ASAS lander without a bit more practice. However, half the lander\\\u0027s fuel was remaining once stable Munar orbit was achieved, so I think it\\\u0027s possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight can be difficult, so here is the method I used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fire SRBs. Go straight up until they burn up, and toss them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fire the Shamrock core stage at full throttle. Go straight up until 12,000 meters, then pitch over to 45 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-At 35,000 meters, throttle the engine down to half thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Once the apokerb is at 75,000 meters, turn of the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Once at the apokerb, burn horizontal to achieve orbit. This will deplete the fuel in the core stage, so use the lander to finish the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Once orbit is achieved, fly to the Mun as you would in any other ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease leave feedback, I\\\u0027d like to see how others do with the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-04T23:43:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith that last tank half empty once in mun orbit, by my calculation, you will not have enough fuel to land and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith half the tank, you have about 1200 delta-V remaining.
