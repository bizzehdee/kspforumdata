To fix the revolting, \u0022classic\u0022 way of landing, I built an airstrip that\u0027s able to support anything you throw at it (warranty void if any object thrown at it)! So let\u0027s get to the features!\n\n**Features of your now favorite craft:**\n\nSupports BOTH landers and planes!\n\nMobile to drive to any desired place\n\nLights that are WAY too bright for guaranteed night landings\n\nAn amazing surprise at 4x warp (download to see)!\n\nSeats for your tortur...I mean kerbals!\n\nLow part count for huge size!\n\nAnd a lot more for you to discover! (so corny)\n\n(I recommend KJR to make sure folding and other events do not occur)\n\nPics for Clicks\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
