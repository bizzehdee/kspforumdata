After about 25 minutes in construction, they had completed what they believed to be the best ship ever! After the leaders of the program got a look at it, it was immediately awarded it the prestigious prize for \u0022Ship most unlikely to reach orbit\u0022. They were about to see that they were wrong...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sg6tgoZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sg6tgoZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is it in the VAB. Note that it does NOT have Mechanical Jeb, that is only shown to display it\u0027s statistics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the most unsafe method of craft delivery it eventually arrived at a stable orbit. Where it remained, doing nothing for several days, until command had the idea of sending the ship to Eve, because, why not!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt got to Eve easy enough and preformed a few aerobrakes to save fuel. Gilly was in the ideal spot for a visit, about to pass the decending node, no Kerbal had ever been to Gilly before so the engines were fired again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xMIpDBv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xMIpDBv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took a bit of working to get it into orbit over Gilly but it did, and was moving at a whopping speed of 12 Meters Per-Second!. The ship does not come with it\u0027s own landers so Thompbin Kerman stepped out and used his EVA pack to land on Gilly. After discovering that he could take one step and move more than a few meters, he determined that Gilly is silly and proceeded to return to the ship using the EVA pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was still more than half of their fuel left so they cruised back to Kerbin and entered orbit at 240 Kilometers. The \u0022Not able to get to orbit\u0022 award was then revoked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BdBRyx6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BdBRyx6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTATISTICS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeight at launch: 375 Units\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFarthest distance traveled: Gilly Return Mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum Crew: Seven Kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumber of Parts: 208 at launch, 167 in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines: Eight NERVA Rockets for Space Operations, producing 480 Kn of Thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the link to download the ship. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?ixaokim2f9tljxi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?ixaokim2f9tljxi\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, this is my first post to the Spacecraft forums so feel free to give me constructive criticism on what I could do differently. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-28T04:43:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2013 04:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Tom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastodon","CreatedById":57231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T05:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELove it.
