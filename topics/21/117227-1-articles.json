Ready for general release.\n\nDownload here:\n\n[http://wikisend.com/download/247446/Shuttle](http://wikisend.com/download/247446/Shuttle) Kourageous.craft\n\n![Kourageous3_zps2y0ogul9.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/KSP/Shuttle%20Kourageous/Kourageous3_zps2y0ogul9.jpg)\n\n It flies really well (for a shuttle) throughout the entire mission. You can even launch it without ever using RCS if you\u0027re careful. Comes with docking adapter and \u0022skylab\u0022 style payload, which really should be deployed before attempting deorbit/ landing. Plenty of DV for LKO ops and payload capacity.\n\n Staging:\n\n- SME Ignition\n\n- SRB Ignition\n\n- Launch clamp release\n\n- SRB Jettison\n\n- Tank Jettison/ OMS engage\n\nAction groups:\n\n1) toggle doors/ lights/ radiators\n\n2) toggle solar panels\n\n104 parts and costs $115,000 on the pad.\n\nProcedures.... make up your own.

I\u0027ve built a couple so far, all of which work with the center of mass in line with the center of thrust.

[The Muon](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78162-Showcase-Showoff-Your-Rep-Worthy-Crafts?p=2015653#post2015653) was more of a rocket plane, and had big booster rockets strapped to the side. \n\nMy latest attempt is the Fermion, which is based on the Starclipper. It does have some design elements from both of my previous two attempts, as well as some borrowed elements from the fine folks of the forums.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

For the things I\u0027m building in space these days, one orange tank isn\u0027t really gonna cut it."},{"CreatedByName":"Agent86","CreatedById":73499,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T01:46:05Z","Content":"![o0h18r3.png](http://i.imgur.com/o0h18r3.png)\n\nThis shuttle I built has but one booster and no off centered engines. Two large cargo bays and space for 16 passengers allows me to bring whatever I need to fulfill most orbital station/ground base contracts. Pitch on ascent is controlled by throttling the engine on the booster."},{"CreatedByName":"Naito","CreatedById":18126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T02:52:33Z","Content":"\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I don\u0027t have a ton of good photos, but the photos I have are certainly alright. Could make it to low Kerbin orbit if piloted correctly, with fuel left for correcting rendezvous errors and deorbiting. \n\n![Af2M5S0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Af2M5S0.jpg)\n\n![IRoXgSq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IRoXgSq.jpg)\n\n![BO7uIwF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BO7uIwF.jpg)\n\nThat last photo is my favorite, something about the angle and, of course, the washed out filter. \n\nI wanted to make the shuttle small, test an asymmetric design, and have the outer fuel tank form around the shuttle itself. The result wasn\u0027t perfect, I still could have worked out the fuel tanks on the sides, but it worked well enough. Enjoy!"}]}
