Also added 4x Comms Sattelites, 2x probe landers, and 2x probe tugs. In addition, added in a lander unit for the CommandModule/Heavy Tug.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the core craft and posted specs. At 90\u002B tonnes in the displayed configuration it\u0027s on the heavy side, but is liftable as a single unit using stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some non-stock parts displayed, but they can be swapped for comparable stock parts fairly easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe core, stock config has 4200\u002B Delta V available on the drive-units, enough to bet most places one-way in the Kerbal System. It is designed to utilize a drop-tank(s) docked behind the drive-unit between the nacelles to extend this range. This 4200 m/s deltav is not taking into account the additional delta-v gained by utilizing dropp-tanks or modules that are jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission modules, landers, sattelites and rovers are to be attached in orbit to the available docking nodes. Once in orbit and mission modules are detached, the craft becomes a space-station for the associated planetoid. If refueled, the drive section can serve as either a fuel depot or the craft can be reuitlized for other missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntended for an 11 man crew. (3 in the detachable tug/cockpit, 8 in the escape pods docked alongside) but again mission modules can adjust this accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m most proud of the comms and the power modules. Comms because I like the design (even if it is mostly wasted mass) and the power module because it allows retracting the main solar panels to within the diameter of the craft itself while having plenty of storage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll modules are reconfigurable and detachable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModules (Fore to aft):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Command Module/Orbital Tug - Large and standard sized docking ports and a ton of RCS fuel. If a lander mission module is provided, can also serve as a reusable lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* CrewTank - Crew storage and work facilities. If a lander mission module is provided this can be utilized as a ground unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Hull - Main point of docking mission modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Escape Pods - These are currently a mod-item, but a stock 1-man command pod \u002B parachute \u002B a couple sepratrons attached to a docking port would suffice for the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Main Power. 10x 1M batteries, 2x large folding solar arrays, and ancillary stationary arrays. Allows solar arrays to be retracted and protected by the bulk of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Comms Array - 2x dishes on dorsal and ventral of the craft plus 2x ancillary docking nodes and ancillary comms antennas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Main Drive Module - Fuel tank \u002B 4x Nuclear Nacelles attached radially. Capability for adding additional modules aft - intended for drop-tanks, though others could be utilized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Lander Module for Command Module/Tug - Added in lander capabilities for the command-module. Also serves as small drop-tank for the main-drive if needed to extend range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent issues: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Design for the Core lifter likes to have the last booster stage collide and explode against the drive unit. This destroyed the drive section and the comms module immediately before it, necessitating achieving an stable, but ecliptic orbit with just RCS which had to be later circularized. Suspect I need to reinforce the last booster stage with struts to maintain structural integrity post achieving Apoapsis, and pre-Periapsis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Mechjeb was tested for this craft, and was found wanting in fuel-efficiency using RCS for maneuvering and docking. Burning through 3x large RCS tanks is not acceptable just to attach a new drive and comms section. Will be performing future maneuvers manually and regulating mechjeb to only an informational display as clearly the system is not ready for main-stream general usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Docking the drop-tanks aft will prove to be... interesting. The nacelles in their current iteration extend beyond the main fuel tank. Future revisions of the craft will need to consider shortening the nacelles and perhaps reducing them to less than 4 engines for a variety of reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* May look into adding quantum fuel transfer nodes - still debating if that addon helps with the main-craft or would be best utilized on ground vehicles and craft where docking is difficult for refueling and fuel-xfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill look to reduce mass while retaining multi-mission capabilities and increasing fuel efficiency for future revisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Update 1 Notes: Craft is at minimum mission status. Debating launching now as adding additional modules at this stage is questionable due to system performance. Already down to a few frames per second to the point where I don\u0027t dare leave too much else orbiting nearby or unnecessary modules attached. Next edition of this class of craft will likely combine the power module with the comms section, reduce the number of engines, change the drop-tank module to a single large tank, remove the escape pods, and in general reduce parts across the board. Also will be needing to rethink my staging for parts - lander section for the command-pod may be stuck up towards the bow rather than attached at the stern. Determining destination now - will launch this evening as-is depending on what the next launch window is... probably Moho, though Duna is also a possibility.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts are always welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuuko\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-02T22:07:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2013 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Luuko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFinal assembly.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
