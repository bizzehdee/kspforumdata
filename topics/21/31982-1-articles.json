With some inspiration from Sal_Vager\u0027s Apollo 15 mission, I was inspired to revisit my Duna-capable Jupiter series. The Jupiters, when built, were the tallest vehicles ever launched from the KSC (in my own game), and when I designed the lifter, I basically expanded on the Mercury VI I\u0027ve built in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the Mercury VI; my first Mun-landing-and-return capable rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OZcSoI0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OZcSoI0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the general idea; the larger tanks drop off first, and the smaller inner tanks burned alongside the central stage. Once we drop the initial stages, we repeat the process higher up the vehicle. It\u0027s fairly stable, because of its size, and it was a good rocket at the end of the day. A variant serves as my low-Kerbin orbiter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo compare, here\u0027s the Jupiter I, older sister of (and only slightly different from) the ship that went to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p3mMU4a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022p3mMU4a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see my general design process here. See the similarities between the Jupiter and Mercury vehicle, if you ignore the payload? The Jupiter is essentially the Mercury, but stretched. This, naturally, led to some problems; while the Mercury suffered from some minor stability issues, these were amplified in the Jupiter. Don\u0027t get me wrong - the Jupiter\u0027s a good ship; you just need to baby it during launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone\u0027s interested, the craft files for these are available. (The Jupiter V is the last iteration of the Jupiter series; it\u0027s definitely Duna capable, it just has a few more bells and whistles than the I, which is pictured here, or the III which went to Duna).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMercury VI: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/1ymbv6g8a1yh164/Mercury_VI.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/1ymbv6g8a1yh164/Mercury_VI.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJupiter V: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/a4cyf69wymf21m5/Jupiter_V.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/a4cyf69wymf21m5/Jupiter_V.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Jupiter series was my Apollo-style launcher - initially. Then, I chose to do a redesign of the launcher and lander so they were more faithful to the original Saturn V. Sal_Vager put together a phenomenal launcher, with proper engine arrangements and all, but I wanted mine to be a bit heavier, beefier. This doesn\u0027t use part clipping, mod parts, or anything like that. It\u0027s pure vanilla stock, so everyone can use it without worrying about it. It\u0027s a good looking launcher, without strut abuse, and I think it\u0027s one of the best stock Saturn V replicas available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough talk. On to the photos. A quick note here: these photos were taken during 3 separate flights. A demonstration launch was performed, and photographed. Then, my Apollo 11 was photographed starting about at the Mun landing. My Apollo 12 flight, completed today, filled in the rest of the gaps, so I think I have a pretty decent photographic record of how this thing stages, and how it looks in flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/elnQaw3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022elnQaw3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m2L9RBE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022m2L9RBE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N924EwA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N924EwA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the vehicle and its stats on the pad. Fear not if the details are hard to see; there are plenty of photos further down in the thread of the upper stages. Note the low part count; I did that on purpose so even folks with lower end computers could use it. It runs pretty well on my own Mac, so I would think that almost everyone could use this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8CyaoVv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228CyaoVv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WuFDQ9b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WuFDQ9b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/043i0pe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022043i0pe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome images of the vehicle in flight. I think this is an aesthetically pleasing launcher - few struts, and nice clean lines. Note the prototypical arrangement; 5 Mainsails standing in for the Saturn V\u0027s 5 F1s. The 1st stage boosts the ship to about 1100 m/s at something like 30 km altitude at a 15 degree graduated gravity turn (so 45* at 30 km). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ls2g711.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ls2g711.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rY72EeY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rY72EeY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the second stage, powered by 5 Poodles in place of the Saturn V\u0027s 5 J-2s (Thanks, Rune!). This stage is almost capable of orbit; you could probably get it to orbit if you wanted it for an interplanetary flight, or something. We\u0027re talking, like, periapsis shows up just as this stage cuts out. It\u0027s really close - just like the real thing; I think one of the Apollo flight\u0027s second stages managed to make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mmYw0d5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mmYw0d5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFiring away the escape tower a few seconds into the S-II burn, like the Saturn V. The escape tower is fully functional, and during early testing, saved the prime crew multiple times (you know how it is, testing a new heavy lifter - the first five launches are disasters until you fix the staging, balance the fuel, make sure the symmetry works, and put more struts on). It\u0027s set up to the Abort key in the Action groups - this maneuver, of discarding the escape tower once we clear the atmosphere, however, is normal staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GvvBzV3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GvvBzV3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NDW285N.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NDW285N.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscarding the second stage.

I dumped tons of fuel with the second stage and brought the CSM back with her tank 60% full. With some modifications I would not be surprised if this could make it to Duna and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s exactly where it\u0027s going next. It\u0027ll be fun to see how she does. And the fuel... yeah, it\u0027s a fuel hog. But, at the same time, it\u0027s nice to fly without worrying about fuel - at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wayfare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wayfare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--It was great to get hands-on experience with the ways in which you tackled each challenge in this build differently from me.

There are ways around this of course - tilt the MM up before decoupling, or do a bit of RCS translation, or use an EVA Kerbal (or even just the nose of the CSM) to bump the debris out of the way. You can even do away with decouplers altogether although that does leave the engine shroud stuck to the top of the MM. I\u0027m told that reloading the scene by exiting to the space center will delete that bit, but that seems like a hassle. Launching with the MM docking port connected directly to the CSM decoupler strikes me as the cleanest fix. Given that TD\u0026amp;E is done only once you\u0027re on the long trip to your destination I don\u0027t see time as a critical factor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jm419","CreatedById":57266,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T18:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to show you what I\u0027m talking about on my flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ Cdr.
