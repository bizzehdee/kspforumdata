I don\u0027t know of anything I can do to make either the NTR or the rocket lighter, I need the DeltaV on both. The one solution I came up with is to launch the NTR with half the fuel on board, then launch a fuel tanker to pump in the other half in orbit. This seemed like a good idea at first, but then I realized that the pack needs three NTR stages, which means three fuel tankers.
