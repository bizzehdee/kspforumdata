Long-time KSP player and lurker, first-time poster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomebody call Reaction Engines Limited - I just built a stock clone of Skylon, their proposed SSTO powered by SABRE engines (I\u0027m probably not the first to do this). I can say that it flew beautifully in Kerbal Space Program, so I think that the future looks bright for it in real life. That\u0027s how these things work, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, after fiddling around with complicated SSTOs with lots of aero-surfaces but not much flying prowess, some of which worked better than others, I decided to do something a bit simpler and crafted this unmanned SSTO, which I call the Javelin. Javelin model I is a cargo-carrying craft, while Javelin model II can carry passengers into orbit. It flew so well; I\u0027ve never been this proud of a vehicle that I created in KSP, and so I had to share it with people. In essence, all it consists of is a drone core with a cargo bay, docking adapter, some finely balanced fuel tanks, and a couple of SABRE engines (I mean RAPIER, sorry) mounted on small, stubby wings. It took a while for me to learn the proper ascent and de-orbit profiles, but I\u0027ve figured it out and it works really well. I also think it happens to look quite beautiful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Note that the craft itself is entirely stock; however, I flew it with Ferram Aerospace Research, which obviously changes the aerodynamics quite a lot.
