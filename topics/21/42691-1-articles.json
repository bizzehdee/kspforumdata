I wasn\u0027t building a space station, I was building a suspension bridge. That does not, however, mean that I\u0027ve given up on building a Stanford torus. I\u0027m just taking a different (much bigger, possibly MORE ludicrous) approach, with the eventual goal of building a 1:1-scale (diameter = approx. 1.6 km) Stanford torus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI present to you, KOS High Aspiration, which has currently just finished phase one of construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 1 consists of 17 different modules (16 arms and a core), and clocks in just shy of 2300 tons (though it\u0027s still less than 250 parts due to extremely conservative design). It is anywhere between 60 and 90 meters in diameter (this is a visual estimate, as I have no way to check due to the fact that it\u0027s still completely automated, and will be for a while). MET thus far is about 2 days, 7 hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 2 (extending the arms to full length) has now begun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, without further ado, the requisite image spam:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EView of the completed Phase 1 station.

This frame holds the RCS thrusters, MechJeb control unit, fuel and monopropellant, and ALL of the struts for the arm modules, such that none of those parts are present on the finished station. When the module is docked, the frame is removed and de-orbited. The end result is an extremely low part count relative to the size and mass of the station. With the arm module inside, the RCS is extremely well-balanced, to the point where translation becomes reliable (no small feat for an object that, when taken together, weighs more than 700 tons). The in-progress phase 2 station can be seen in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aRvlF8B.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aRvlF8B.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe in-progress phase 2 station, with one arm extender segment docked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Sv05hKz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Sv05hKz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck back regularly for updates and more insanity! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-17T00:42:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2013 12:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NGTOne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CleverClothe","CreatedById":60997,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T02:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt first I thought this was from Orbiter, then I realized it was Universe Replacer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost impressive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T02:29:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CleverClothe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CleverClothe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAt first I thought this was from Orbiter, then I realized it was Universe Replacer.\u003Cp\u003EMost impressive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMan, I should totally try this in Orbiter later.

Each arm, right now, is about 30 meters long, based on a visual estimate (the station core is known to be 15 meters in diameter, and the length of each arm is about twice the diameter of the core).

I\u0027m building the upper structure (the actual torus), just with more arms (I can\u0027t build a circle in KSP, and this thing will be too big to make ring-docking viable, so I will approximate it with 16 differently-angled segments). If I recall, this is the original Stanford torus concept from the \u002770s. The lower structure is a large mirror to reflect natural light into the inside, which is something that I (as far as I am aware) have no means of duplicating in KSP. The inner ring is a set of smaller mirrors, to reflect the light from the big one into the insides of the ring (also omitted in my design).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Stanford_torus_external_view_by_Don_Davis_AC76-0525.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Stanford_torus_external_view_by_Don_Davis_AC76-0525.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-16T19:53:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2013 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NGTOne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeburgers","CreatedById":75258,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T19:42:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDude, ambitious does not even come close to describing this.
