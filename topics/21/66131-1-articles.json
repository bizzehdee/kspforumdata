But, because the delivery is done at way less than half dV into the journey I\u0027m guessing about 400-500dV is added when the payload is delivered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the same scenario for Laythe. The dV requirement is very small to get to the planet surface considering, all you need is enough dV for Mun gravity assist, an intercept burn plus corrections for an encounter and aerobraking maneuver on the target planet. Most of the dV is the backside of the journey for planetary orbit plus escape and a burn back to Kerbin intercept with aerobraking. On both missions the dV is comfortably enough. Now all I have to do is prove it. It all looks good on paper...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPro tip on using nukes for dV calculation: Every percentage point of usable fuel mass adds 100m/s dV. I reached orbit with 40.32%(98T) usable fuel mass which calculates to 4052dV. I suspect the numbers going into the Squad calculations would be exactly 1:100.\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
