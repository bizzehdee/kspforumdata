I present to you the first working model of the Kegel!\n\nKegel 1 and 2 are simple 4-Kerman landers. This is the first one that can carry stuff to leave behind. It\u0027s purely experimental \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC the SABRE is the wrong engine, and there\u0027s a subtle, but infuriating, sizing issue with the width of the cargo hold\\* \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC but it\u0027s very nearly flyable, as you can see!\n\n![rSP14fB.png](http://i.imgur.com/rSP14fB.png)\n\n![b2dUzp1.png](http://i.imgur.com/b2dUzp1.png)\n\nI\u0027m very excited about the [Throttle Control Avionics mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107802-Throttle-Controlled-Avionics-2-1-0-0-90-Continued)! It should really help. \n\n![MWF7J7D.png](http://i.imgur.com/MWF7J7D.png)\n\n\u003Csub\u003E*It\u0027s maybe 10cm too short. That means that one of the three docking rings just sort of mashes up against its mate, rather than actually holding it all together.\u003C/sub\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T20:19:35Z","Content":"Ah yes, the joy of the first Eagle replica. Keep at it, they are tons of fun and lead invariably to interesting things! [Mine](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107474-Eagle-MkV-SSTO-VTOL-cargo-shuttle-Rated-for-Duna-and-Laythe-too!) doesn\u0027t look much like an Eagle anymore... but on the flip side, it SSTOes up and down on both Kerbin and Duna with a 20mT cargo. I built my modular base to fit it, so I can feel the pains having to line things up. At least now with the gizmos you don\u0027t have to do what *I* did!\n\n[![IVU3Pe5.png](http://i.imgur.com/IVU3Pe5.png)](http://imgur.com/IVU3Pe5)\n\nRune.

I might go back to that general design, though I like the mission flexibility (though not the physical flexibility) of the open structure. \n\nI\u0027m doing a lot of smackin\u0027 it into stuff so far. At least I\u0027m crashing into the helipad, now! I couldn\u0027t make it that far before. \n\nThings will probably get easier when I find my joystick, but for the time being, it blows up in really funny ways \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC sorta like a pile of wooden blocks.\n\nThe earlier draft:\n\n![1zgVH1K.png](http://i.imgur.com/1zgVH1K.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T20:56:49Z","Content":"Well, Kerbin is pretty much the hardest planet to VTOL in (with the exception of Eve, of course, everything is harder at Eve or downright impossible), so don\u0027t blame yourself. On the plus side, once you master VTOLs on Kerbin, landing anywhere else is a breeze. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOne trick I found to stick the landings: while you have a lot of vertical speed, zeroing it out is best done controlling from a top-facing docking port, but when the vertical velocity is very little you can\u0027t see where the damn prograde went (i.e: precision landing on, say, a helipad), and you start picking lateral speed. For those times you would prefer to control form a horizontal position, so the controls are like instinctual like in a plane, but clicking around in the middle of a delicate maneuver is a recipe for disaster. Well, you can switch from any other control point to the cabin by pressing \u0022C\u0022 twice: the first will put you in the eyes of a kerbal and reset the control scheme, while the second will get you back outside with the same camera angle. Can be done in like one second! Sadly, there is no handy way to do the opposite.\n\nRune. Other than that, I see you are having tons of FUN! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshua A.C.

I\u0027m really looking forward to trying out the joystick in KSP for the first time."}]}
