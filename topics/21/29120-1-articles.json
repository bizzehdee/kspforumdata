It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s my interplanetary exploration vessel. It was first designed when docking came up, and since then i made some adjustments to the modulated sections. It is build from 4 modules. Cockpit, Support, Fuel, Engine. As a example, i can just easy snatch in another fuel-module of the same constructiontype between the first fuelmodule and the support module (the long strut with the monopropellent tanks). It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s highly flexible and carrys normaly 2 landers. But they are still in redesign, thanks to the new 1-man lander that allows some new possibilitys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI call it K.S.S. Buzz Aldrin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Took me a week back then to bring it together when Docking came out, and it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s ofc builded only with stock, no special mod\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s or else where used for docking or transport the modules into orbit. Thank god that we got still unlimited kerbalnaut supplies. This version uses some 0.20 controlrooms, the spacestation observer room at the fuelmodule. Makes some good auxiliry commandrooms too. Well it worked 4 months ago for the Duna-Mission, but since then i didnt tryed any new mission. Time to do some more for.... science and bouncing kerbals! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah and for some reasons since 0.20 they scream like hell in the Ship. And sometimes when i change the control to a close by ship and switch back to the Aldrin, it simply implodes. Funny bug, but no idear what couses it. xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s1.directupload.net/images/130525/ct5gwr3a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ct5gwr3a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.file-upload.net/download-7636929/Aldrin-Command-Module.craft.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAldrin-Command-Module.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.file-upload.net/download-7636928/Aldrin-Drive-Module.craft.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAldrin-Drive-Module.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.file-upload.net/download-7636930/Aldrin-Fuel-Module.craft.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAldrin-Fuel-Module.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.file-upload.net/download-7636931/Aldrin-Support-Module.craft.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAldrin-Support-Module.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.file-upload.net/download-7636932/Armstrong-Lander.craft.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EArmstrong-Lander.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-25T22:20:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2013 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ferigad\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EShipfiles\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darth Lazarus","CreatedById":60937,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T20:49:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe bug of implodes ... maybe you have to rebuild the entire ship in 0.20 to fix it. several users got teh bug of expldoing or strange speed changign and stuff with 0.19 craftfiles in 0.20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enevertheless a very neat looking ship. i hop you have a coffemugholder for jeb \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T21:12:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice looking ship!

Technicly the fuelmodule there are 2 large oranges. In the past clipping wasnt a big issue but after i searched a bit in the forum, i think that it could be source of the problem. But it really only occures random. Nothing that can save/load fix at the moment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a matter of fact it was rebuilded from scratch with 0.20. But i assume that the clipping issue is a bug, i mean that it can implode then and not that you can clipping different items together, as far as i rembered that was part of the original idear and design in KSB, to clipp some parts together so that they look better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, i also uploaded the module parts )and the lander for atmospheric landings, still prototype, redesignt with the new 1-seat capsule) with my own carriersystem. Feel free to use your own if you want to shoot them up and mount them together. For the fuel-module you just need a low orbit and you will maybe have to transfer fuel from the module to the carrier rocket. I could have designed a better carrier system but it worked cheaper and quicker that way. You can still refuel in a final prepare mission. When you got the fueltank to a low orbit, you can simply attach the Drive-Module and bring it up to 120-240K , depends on what orbit you want to work to assemble the rest of the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greywind","CreatedById":57202,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T01:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood looking craft, what about Michael Collins though?
