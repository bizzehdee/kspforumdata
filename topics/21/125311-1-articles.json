I decided to take it upon myself to create the craziest plane I could. I thought for a bit about what could I do to make a crazy plane, and I got an eureka moment - a supersonic floatplane!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set to work designing, and my ingenuity created this marvelous creation - the X-1 Floating\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AOGp2rM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AOGp2rM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing low over the ocean.
