Once there they set about reverse engineering the old craft in an attempt to replicate such a successful design. It was only once they had got half way through the building process that they realised that they had got the plans sideways on and decided to continue anyway. The resultant corvette has been designated the Co-23 and is currently undergoing space trials before mass production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship is propelled by 8 Nervas and a pair of aerospikes giving it the impressive acceleration that is known across the Co-XX series and along with several reaction wheels offers impressive manoeuvrability compared to similar sized ships. Weaponry consists of 12 Hornet-III missiles for defence which work in concert with the advanced scanning and comms arrays to offer impressive beyond visual range capabilities. Due to the current state of peace in the Kerbin system the armour is only rated at Mk-I and the ship can easily be converted to civilian roles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/1l0npem2p8e96v9/Co-23A.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/1l0npem2p8e96v9/Co-23A.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3zuiCsb.png\u0022 alt=\u00223zuiCsb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0xPxPfH.png\u0022 alt=\u00220xPxPfH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wWon4Hr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wWon4Hr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-14T20:35:46Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2014 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Comrade Jenkens\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tada","CreatedById":57283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T23:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHehe, Im just having so much fun with \u0022old\u0022 XC-305 (one of the finest military ships ever created in KSP) creating my scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ship also looks quite nice, it look really like some vaguely reverse engineered XC-305.
