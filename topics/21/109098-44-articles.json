As I have an excess of fuel on landing, I might be able to ditch the set of FL-T400s, or trade them for FL-T200s. Having the excess could prove handy in space.

If I move those any further forward I\u0027ll block the hatches on the cockpit. I could attempt to graft more wings to the assembly; I\u0027m trying to keep this stock, avoiding TweakScale and Procedural Wings. There has to be a limit though; too much wing would mean too much drag in the upper atmosphere.\n\nHaving the centre of mass more forward also seems to mess with re-entry, where reaction wheels then have to work harder and drain more electric charge.

For a 28 meter long aircraft with a mass of 178 tonnes, a total wing area of 356 square meters will give you wing loading of .5 tonnes per square meter, which would be comparable to a Concorde (.5 is usually what I shoot for with my spaceplane designs). Add your 36 tonnes of cargo and that becomes 0.6, a bit on the high end but still acceptable. If you want .5 with your cargo, you\u0027ll need 428 square meters of wing area.\n\nI also agree with the notion of twin tails - my calculator for the same mass (178 tonnes) and length suggests a vertical stabilizer with a span of 6.78 meters (assuming a 3.5 meter root and 1.75 meter tip) is what you need, which is definitely out of the range of any of the stock parts...at least, any *single* stock part. \n\nI might suggest Procedural Wings if you find yourself having difficulty with the stock wing parts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-07T13:14:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2017 01:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**\n  \ndropping advice about the engines..."},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-07T13:38:16Z","Content":"[@Nixod321](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58279-nixod321/) and [@capi3101](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/59027-capi3101/) Sorry for confusing one thing: That displayed mass includes the 36 t cargo; you can barely see the orange tank in the image.

About what altitude/speed does the drifting develop? And what do your static parameters look like on the surface?\n\nMy \u0022calculator\u0022 is just an Excel spreadsheet I use that has a bunch of different formulas I\u0027ve come up with for aircraft design over the last several versions of KSP/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E (since I made the switch with KSP v0.9). Determining the desired wing loading is one of the early steps, though, and you can use just a regular calculator for it. My spaceplane design process begins by determining the desired capabilities of my craft (for example, an automated tanker is going to want to have the fuel payload, the probe core and all its goodies, the docking/port and all its goodies, all all the miscellaneous accouterments like electrical power and so on). I\u0027ll then put together a basic fuselage that has all of that and get its mass. Once I have that mass, I divide it by a factor of 0.15 to get a theoretical takeoff mass (and then try to design the rest of my plane so that it goes *under* that mass). From that theoretical mass I get the number of engines I need and the amount of fuel I\u0027m going to want. Next step after that is to divide the theoretical takeoff mass by the desired wing loading, which once again for most of my designs is 0.5; you can go higher or lower as you wish, but 0.5 works for me.\n\nDividing by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by two. So in your case, you\u0027ve got 178 tonnes of aircraft. 178 / 0.5 = 178 x 2 = 356 square meters desired wing area.\n\nI do a lot of cranked arrow designs (I use a rough analogue of the shape of the Space Shuttle\u0027s wings as a guide) and I use Procedural Wings, so my calculator spreadsheet then goes into specifics about how long the various bits should be once I\u0027ve determined my wing loading, with the length of the fuselage coming into play here.\n\nI could make the calculator available for download, though I\u0027d have to clean it up quite a bit first; I didn\u0027t exactly design it for anybody\u0027s use besides my own."},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-09T13:06:51Z","Content":"[@capi3101](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/59027-capi3101/) Thanks so far for the assistance.\n\nI don\u0027t have the craft file available now, but I redesigned the craft to use twelve Big-S wings including the two horizontal tail planes, two Big-S tails, and supporting control surfaces.

Are you having sideslip issues at landing? \n\nThe ascent profile you\u0027re describing sounds about right - you want to be going at least 1000 m/s at 20,000 m or it becomes increasingly unlikely you\u0027re going to go to space today. I typically wait to pitch up until I\u0027m going 1200 m/s at 20,000 unless it looks like I\u0027m going to burn something up if I don\u0027t pitch, and then I crank it up as hard as the plane will go (I\u0027m still generally lucky if, at first, I get better than ten degrees above the horizon). I design my craft to have about 1500 m/s of delta-V in the rocket phase of the flight; that gives you a little wiggle room for a comparatively mediocre ascent and still leaves enough for de-orbiting. A wet-to-dry ratio of about 1.6 works for most of the rocket engines you\u0027ll want to use, and twenty kilometers up is good enough to use the vacuum Isp for the rocket engines.

It should be capable of relatively quickly moving and deploying various things at different locations around Kerbin such as exploration probes or crew recovery parties for those kerbals who managed to land in the middle of nowhere on the way back from space. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  A possibility of paradropping items mid flight is also considered.\n\nThe main thing about it is the balance and stability. The center of gravity seems way way too far forward so that the tips of the main wing and not the stabilizer are responsible for the majority of the static pitch stability. While it may be kinda acceptable in cruise it is absolutely horrible for proper takeoff and landing as the thing lacks the control authority even with ridiculously high stabilizer incidence angles. The problem is that I can not possibly move the wing forward as in its current position the main gear bogies are almost directly below the center of mass. So either I have to drop the airliner style landing gear attachment and snap them into some other place which I do not really want to do or find another way to make the plane less stable.\n\nHow can I fix this? How is this current arrangement different from the real life designs of the same type? I guess with a highly swept back wing and the gear attached at its root large portions of that wing just have to be behind the center of mass anyways. And that kerbal wing is really not the most sharply swept one even amongst the airliners...\n\nThe second question is how to make the flaps more effective? Currently as seen on the derivative pages their effect is quite marginal or even negative when the angle is too high. Even when thinking of them as simple hinged non slotted flaps in the real world terms I would expect them to easily deploy to fifty or sixty degrees for landing. Or are they by any chance modeled as some type of slotted or fowler flaps? In the static page on the graph we see that the coefficient of lift never exceeds 2. To me seems quite low for takeoff or landing with flaps.\n\nAlso the level flight angle of attack value does something that I do not quite understand. When I decrease the speed for which it is calculated it increases to some value but then just suddenly goes zero. It does not approach the stall angle of attack. Does that mean that the plane can not fly slower than that for some other reason even though it is not stalling? Or is it just the prediction algorithm having trouble computing?\n\nAny help will be strongly appreciated!\n\nThank you!\n\nPictures\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/cT0yg](https://imgur.com/a/cT0yg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-01T21:23:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2017 09:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Kitspace**"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-01T22:17:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Kitspace said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hello!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The main thing about it is the balance and stability.
