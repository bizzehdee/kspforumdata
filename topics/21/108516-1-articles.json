This is a total rebuild from 0 of my favourite plane the YF-12A (blackbird\u0027s less known big brother [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_YF-12) the story if you are interested)\n\nThis new replica has 133 parts against the 220 of the old model, this means a lot less lag and lot more manouverability, speed and fun in general.\n\nIt is even better looking than the old model and more realistic, this is really the best i can do with stock parts.\n\nI can\u0027t really tell you how much hours i have spent on the old replica, probably 48h or something similar trying to reach the perfect shape and form, this new instead comes like magic in only 8 hours like if every stock piece i placed was really in the right place, well almost XD yes almost because i have spent hours finding the right shape of the nose section and these are the results:\n\n![De0tz49.png](http://i.imgur.com/De0tz49.png)\n\n![oQ0DyQE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oQ0DyQE.jpg)\n\n![soM1pUE.png](http://i.imgur.com/soM1pUE.png)\n\nAs you can see the shape is perfect and i\u0027m really proud of this.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E \n\nDECTAILS\n\n-Parts 133\n\n-fuel load: more than 1000lt standard (max \u003E 2000lt)\n\n-sea level speed: about mach 1 at sea level (depens on fuel load)\n\n-max speed: about mach 3.4 at 11/12km altitude\n\n-max altitude: about 20km\n\n-manouverability: outstanding\n\nCONTROLS\n\n-1 toggle engines\n\n-2 toggle nacelles\n\n-4 toggle missile bay\n\n-brake toggle rudders air brakes \n\nWARNING \n\nBefore take off click \u0022control from here\u0022 on the probodobodyne clipped inside the nose as shown here\n\n![N3B5PsT.png](http://i.imgur.com/N3B5PsT.png)\n\n[DOWNLOAD CRAFT](http://www./download/ad2qa8gduq8fmls/YF-12A_V2_By_Eorin_1_0.craft)\n\nThe craft comes coloured with kerbpaint, but if you don\u0027t have it it\u0027s not a problem, the craft will still work\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* the craft is modificable if you want and usable on youtube too, just remember to credit me ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nKerbapaint download (latest version updated by me) ALL CREDITS GOES TO KERBPAINT CREATOR: [Texel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/84670-Texel) (thanks for your work on this must have plugin)\n\n[DOWNLOAD KERBPAINT](http://www./download/xn3yjuo8drk59nq/KerbPaint.zip)\n\nIf you like my creations please click the rep button and comment, i spend a lot of hours on my replicas so these kind of stuffs are really apreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T21:53:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eorin**"},{"CreatedByName":"soulreaver1981","CreatedById":38542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T08:52:17Z","Content":"thanks for the paint mod"},{"CreatedByName":"eorin","CreatedById":79133,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T10:45:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E thanks for the paint mod\n\nNp, it was really a thing i needed to do for the yf-12a, a blackbird needs to be Black ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"_Bugs","CreatedById":123899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T10:50:48Z","Content":"How you did this in 120 parts is really beyond me."},{"CreatedByName":"eorin","CreatedById":79133,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T21:35:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How you did this in 120 parts is really beyond me.\n\nI just used only big wings and very few control surfaces and strut connectors mostly."},{"CreatedByName":"eorin","CreatedById":79133,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T12:18:26Z","Content":"Patch 1.03 and still this craft is working, to be honest it works even better now! max sea level speed increased from 950 km/h to 1000 km/h.\n\nPlus it looks better now with afterburner effects.\n\n![YbXavJ8.png](http://i.imgur.com/YbXavJ8.png)\n\nA lot of awesome crafts were released in these last 2 months, but i still think my YF-12 can fly over them or at least side by side."},{"CreatedByName":"eorin","CreatedById":79133,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T15:43:47Z","Content":"UPDATE: resolved most of the Z fighting, now in the hangar it looks better.
