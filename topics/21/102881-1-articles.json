It can reach the deepest corners of Kerbin\u0027s sea bed without cheats of any kind. Each engine on the back of the submarine is set to a specific thrust limit to balance the ship, just fire it up and let it go.\n\nIt comes with its own transport ship, a beautiful catamaran that can reach speeds over 95 m/s over water. It could go faster, but it will disintegrate if you push it over 100 m/s, that\u0027s the resistance limit of the air intakes used as floating devices.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Mz7uB9xrFw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n![Submarine.png](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NwqYiZE1oD8/VRWCzL70ZMI/AAAAAAAAAxM/O3PmpAEnz4k/w1118-h631-no/Submarine.png)\n\nTo download this ship please follow this link: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/syt1zanq5y3rou6/Submarine%20XVIII.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/syt1zanq5y3rou6/Submarine%20XVIII.craft?dl=0)\n\nThis submarine was designed for a challenge on the forums, the challenge specified that the submarine needed a Claw to attach itself to the ocean floor. Of course the claw won\u0027t work on Kerbin\u0027s surface, but I added it anyway just to comply with the rules.
