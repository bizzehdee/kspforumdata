This ship is no different, it will have to be placed into orbit around Kerbin but should be fine from there on its own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not an expert in every or any aspect of the game, and if there are issues you notice or suggestions you have, just let me know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip has not been gone over with a fine tooth comb and some parts might be a tad sloppy. I think most looks good, but won\u0027t guarantee it is perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a part count around 480 and runs smooth on my computer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not tested it beyond doing a basic burn in orbit around Kerbin. I don\u0027t think there will be any issues though but please let me know if you have any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It has one Ion powered shuttle and 4 probes already docked inside the bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It has 18 nuclear engines and 10 Ion thrusters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-it weighs in at around 320 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It has NO escape pods or any landing craft of any kind equipped to it. That said, it does have 4 more open docking ports on top and 2 Sr ports on bottom. So keep in mind unless you add some escape pods or more shuttles to get to a station or ship with escape pods, then anyone on the ship will not be coming home. I designed it with reusability in mind, and besides, captains and their crew do love their ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I use a fuel balance mod to keep fuel evenly distributed, if not you need to manually manage fuel... Main issue is draining RCS from shuttle and fuel from \u0022nacelle\u0022 tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** To orient ship for control and burns I placed a probe inside the saucer section, just zoom in all the way inside the very front and you will see it, just click and select \u0022control from here\u0022 and it will work great. Just watch switching to cockpit view and back as it will reset the controls and you will have to select it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Action Groups--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 deploys communication and side ladders.... after first push will then only toggle ladders on docking bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 Toggles Solar panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 Toggles Nuclear Engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 Toggles Ion Engine thrusters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso wanted to mention I forget some RCS ports on the back side... so just look it over and add a few where you think they will help for now...
