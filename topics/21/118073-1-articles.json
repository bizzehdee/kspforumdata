The Reactive armour can stop most armament. My reactive armour is just Wings over structural panels which gives it a better looking effect with the ability of being able to slow down missiles before impacting the main armour."},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T01:16:08Z","Content":"mine is double layered structural, spaced in most places. The worst damage that it has taken is 14 direct hits from smaller missiles at high velocities, and the ship was cut in half but still functional. In other tests, the armor was torn off by the 10th hit."},{"CreatedByName":"Canberra Gaming","CreatedById":147308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T01:28:13Z","Content":"Care if I take a crack at it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T01:41:23Z","Content":"Nope, give it a shot.
