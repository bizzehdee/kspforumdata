It\u0027s very stable though, no problems ascending, I can go straight up @45 deg (I use NEAR) without any pitch down for speed till 24km. The fuel capacity is just right on the edge of what I want, no wiggle room at all, I\u0027m not sure yet how to fix it without messing the whole thing up. I\u0027d like to have a little safety net in case I have an awkward rendezvous or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
