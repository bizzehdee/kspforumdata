Many people have attempted to make stock swivel jets with a variety of success. The craft you linked to is nice but it does use the Infernal Robotics mod. I\u0027m guessing the engines on your design are docked to the main craft and undocked and switched to during flight? That\u0027s pretty cool but it does mean you have to have the fuel connected to the jets and have to switch to the jets to control the throttle. I\u0027m not knocking your design though, just trying to guess how it works. I think it was GigglePlex who made a stock F35 with a swivel jet where the jet was still attached to the craft although it was a bit fiddly to fly, (imho).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing you could try is to use airbrakes as a lever to turn the jets although that would limit the rotation to about 80 degrees. Also, if you need any help with bearings then let me know as I have made quite a few.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"evader","CreatedById":111662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T00:34:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince 1.1 is out and the wheel physics changed, I decided to create a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/evader/swivel-2b\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edownload link\u003C/a\u003E for it.\u00A0 I also tweaked it for better electricity generation but my attempts to limit rotation using air brakes failed.\u00A0 Also tried\u00A0getting the swivel parts to dock to use fuel from the main body but had no luck.\u00A0 Maybe in 0g environments it would work.\u00A0 The bearing wheels are also fragile so I attempted to put stronger tail wheels which, while more durable, caused spontaneous explosions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
