The original Moth was one of my most popular downloads and was always going to be a tough act to follow. \n\n![mkD0QFo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mkD0QFo.jpg)\n\nFortunately this new model really outclasses the original in every way. While the old version used the heavy NCIS adapter to offset the mass of the cockpit, this new edition has a bespoke crafted tail section consisting of more useful things like RTGs, and batteries while still retaining the parachute of the previous version for landing back on Kerbin.\n\n![IrE28Gr.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IrE28Gr.jpg)\n\nAnother big change is the cargo port which let\u0027s you trick out your Moth with all manner of bling, or even indulge in a spot of base building! \n\n![DvV8zf3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DvV8zf3.jpg)\n\nThe download also comes with a handy selection of drop pods to ensure your valuables get to where they need to go in one piece! ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n![xqtBCtV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xqtBCtV.jpg)\n\nDV is around 8,500m/s and this can easily be extended by mounting xenon drop tanks to the docking ports. The craft can be used on Minmus, Gilly, Pol, Bop and Ike (with some fuel reduction). \n\n![DpwwwLR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DpwwwLR.jpg)\n\nDid I mention drop pods? ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n![Qnih32P.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Qnih32P.jpg)\n\n**CONTROLS:**\n\n1 - Toggle Ion Engines\n\n2 - Deploy Secondary Solar Panels\n\n3 - Toggle Primary Solar Panels/Landing Skids\n\n5 - Undock/De-Couple Top Docking Port\n\n8 - Toggle Drop Pod Gear\n\n9 - Toggle Drop Pod Engines\n\n0 - Toggle Drop Pod Doors\n\nABORT - Undock/De-Couple Cargo Port\n\n**LV INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\nSet control to the docking port at the top of the rocket, activate SAS, set full throttle and hit the stage button.\n\nEject the SRBs and LV drop tanks as soon they become empty.\n\nOnce the needle reaches the end of the light blue strip start pitching over on a 90\\* heading.\n\nBy the time the needle gets to the dark blue section you want to be at a 45\\* angle.\n\nHold this heading till your apoapsis reaches 40k then gently pitch over and hold course about 5\\* above the horizon.\n\nOnce you apoapsis reaches 80k cut the engines and coast out of the athmosphere.\n\nCircularize then press 0 to open the cargo bay doors.\n\nUndock your moth, and use the RCS thrusters to move it into position onto the docking port at the top of the LV.\n\nAdjust the staging and then seperate the kicker stage, once you use this stage you\u0027ll also want to get rid of the remaining RCS in the Moth\u0027s cockpit as it will affect the balance of the vessal.\n\nThe LV has a probe core and can be de-orbited if and when you choose.\n\n**OPERATORS MANUAL:**\n\nLike all my craft the Moth Mk 2 features a horizontal axis cockpit for sub-orbital flights/landing and a vertical axis docking port for orbital piloting. The top docking port must be used when performing burns with the navball or using Mechjeb. A joystick is also highly recommended and SAS should be kept on at all times.\n\nThe large solar panels were perhaps not designed as landing skids so care needs to be taken on touchdown. The Moth\u0027s RTGs and generous electrical storage means you can fold the main panels in long before landing. \n\nIf you\u0027re doing long burns keep the main pannels deployed and orient the craft to give the main pannels maximum sun exposure where possible. The Moth\u0027s bank of RTGs will let you keep running the engines at a reduced level if you do lose the light completely. \n\nThe craft features a central main tank and six smaller reserve tanks, three on each side.\n\nThe secondary pannels cannot be stowed once deployed but they\u0027re designed not to get in the way in things.\n\nIn my opinion the craft is light, agile and compact enough to dock just using the engines however it does feature a set of RCS thrusters which can be used by adding an RCS tank to either of the docking ports.\n\nI\u0027ve put the craft through some pretty hairy re-entries on Kerbin, and while you\u0027ll likely get a few explosions along the way they tend to be less important things like batteries and RTGs. The important stuff like the parachute and capsule seems to weather the storm without any problems.\n\nRight, I think that\u0027s everything covered. Hope you guys enjoy the craft and let me know if you have any Qs. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCupcake...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-03T22:13:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2015 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cupcake...**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T16:07:59Z","Content":"YES!
