The first stage is the rocket stage, to take off, the second stage is to drop bombs, and the third stage is to eject. The ejection doesn\\\u0027t have a Decoupler, so just pull up sharply and the parachutes will rip off the rest of the rocket (as long as your under 500 feet ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)). it is fairly easy to fly, and takes off around the middle of the runway. If you use it, please give me credit.\n\n![w36m1.png](http://i.imgur.com/w36m1.png)\n\n[glow=red,2,300]DOWNLOAD: [http://www./?46kg5q2q600glci](http://www./?46kg5q2q600glci)[/glow]\n\n[move]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MrMisquito-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/move]"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix Aerospace","CreatedById":26120,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T15:04:26Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums!
