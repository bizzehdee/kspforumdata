Due to the various part diameters many adapters were used. Several test flights failed due to excessive wobbliness between the adapter connections. Also the sheer weight and length of the vehicle caused several maneuverability problems and many test vehicles failed when they tumbled off course and were ripped apart by the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzMMOGfrTQY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe .craft file is attached below if any of you would like to try it out for yourselves.
