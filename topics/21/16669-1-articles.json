The first Mostly consists of an engine, landing struts, rcs, and two fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second stage is powered entirely by rcs, and is also equipped with landing struts, as well as sas (very much needed if you\u0027re trying to fly using just rcs for power).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to take the first stage of the lander from Kerben orbit to Minmus, then to the Mun, and only decoupled from it a few thousand meters into my takeoff from the Mun. That\u0027s with my incredibly sloppy flying included which significantly contributes to fuel usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty stable overall and it makes for a relatively easy flight (in my opinion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you guys enjoy, and if you can give any advice for improvement/optimization please let me know!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tnypic.net/38119.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002238119.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tnypic.net/cb15c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cb15c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tnypic.net/b9413.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b9413.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file download link!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?aqv7b0bh9se0ax6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?aqv7b0bh9se0ax6\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"overvolt","CreatedById":38819,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-12T09:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the double post, but I\u0027m assuming I can\u0027t edit this yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, made a second run around the moons and back with plenty of spare fuel.
