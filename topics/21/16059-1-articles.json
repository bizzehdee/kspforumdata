It needs to be a small craft, that preferably is single stage (but boosters are okay as long as they don\u0027t interfere with a ladder system), and can reach escape trajectories with fuel to spare for orbital maneuvers.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have come close to such a craft, but I didn\u0027t have enough fuel by the tiniest margin..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing, it needs to be small, so that once I add the entry stage, and initial Launch Vehicle, my computer can run it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDom \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikemc","CreatedById":32386,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T04:03:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo .craft file but Stage 1 has 1 Solid Fuel surrounded by 5 more and 1 wing-let on each, then the same for Stage 2.
