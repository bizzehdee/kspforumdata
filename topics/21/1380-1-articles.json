With minimal modifications, this design would probably be capable of escape. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne little note - this design makes use of structural SRBs. I prefer liquid fueled strap-on boosters, and since you can\u0027t strap LFTs to radial couplers, the SRBs are there just to hold the Liquid boosters. If you wish to install decouplers, you could also have the SRBs fire to give you a tiny extra bit of oomph. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(HarvestR, please modify the coupling software so that LFTs can attach radially?) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
