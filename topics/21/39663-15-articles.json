Nice idea. I\u0027ve been doing the same in my latest builds, and I have a couple of very nice capsules with all the gear hidden by 2.5m rockomax decouplers (you have to turn part clipping on, but you can stick a lot of stuff in there, and as long as the tip of the nozzle in just outside the collision mesh of the decoupler, stuff will still work). You basically stick the stuff (one T200 tank and a toroidal one will put a 48-7s at just the right height). But recently I have discovered large ASAS units also do the work a bit lighter, though you have to then put separate decoupler/separators, so it\u0027s a bit less part-efficient. A couple of examples, looking form below, follow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gJbC57O\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gJbC57O.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gJbC57O.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ATCAyVD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ATCAyVD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ATCAyVD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding them is dirt simple, I first built the service modules, remove them temporarily , then placed the decoupler/ASAS, then the important stuff back on inside them with part clipping on to make the used attachment node of the upper part of the decouplers usable again. It helps a lot for that last part to have editor tools to disable surface attachment, but you could actually place it with surface attachment activated too, it just would take a lot of extra effort, or putting the toroidal fuel tank on top (because it doesn\u0027t have surface attachment on itself). For the ASAS example, it is even easier, just built a service module under whatever you want (a decoupler, usually, if you want to detach the service module later), then stick with part clipping on the ASAS modules around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now the technique I actually wanted to show off: Mini-lander upper stage! With \u0026gt;500m/s, RCS subsystem with 30 units of monopropellant, enough battery to do the job, and a very cool look fitting inside a 2.5m radius (i.e, a fairing made of small panels with x8 symmetry), this thing is perfect for Apollo replicas. Just 12 parts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what we will need. As you can see, the root part is the upper docking port, and apart from that we have three oscar tanks, a toroidal one, and the awesome 48-7s. Note how the cabins are oriented so they stick the right way when surface-attached, and they have each two RCS ports placed one by one. You can\u0027t do radial symmetry later and expect it work, that\u0027s a downside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/WWSOlFb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WWSOlFb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WWSOlFb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now comes the tricky part. With editor tools, that\u0027s as easy as ALT\u002BR to activate surface attachment. Without them, you will have to use two small cubic struts to create attachment nodes on the surface of the oscar tanks at the right height. Which come to think of it, might allow you some symmetry options. BUT. That is two more parts than needed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Note that the placing the second cabin is a pain in the ass, since to see the oscar tanks through the lander cabin you have to clip the camera very close to them and can\u0027t see how high or low the result is. A lot of trial and error here will get the two cabins aligned, and this is what you get in the end, with just enough juice for munar ascent:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/XnsX7Hy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XnsX7Hy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XnsX7Hy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
