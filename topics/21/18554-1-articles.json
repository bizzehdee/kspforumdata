Ah well... Overengeneering took care of it. Special thanks to the fuel bug as well, I suppose. You need to ride it at about 2/3 throttle at all times or it disintegrates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt still has 2 full FL-T400 tanks and one full RCS tank, though. I also staged the 6 engines still with some fuel in it and the inner stack never got the chance to do any good. I suppose some strut connectors would rigidify it so it doesn\u0027t wobble, but I had some issues with the spin so I removed them. With it working perhaps there would be enough oumpf even with the fuel consumption fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you like it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
