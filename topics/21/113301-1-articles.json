It\u0027s currently designed to be able to take small manned space craft to space stations, and small probes to munar expeditions (maybe farther, if you can fly it efficiently!)\n\nAlso, after testing it looks like the launch vehicle goes into a spin when heavily\\* loaded. I\u0027ll upload a fixed version in a few mins."}]}
