I didn\u0027t get to find out the aircraft\u0027s range unfortunately. But I landed on a small island in the middle of the ocean and I was wondering if any might know distance wise how far is it from the KSC. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kuFM8J3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kuFM8J3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T19:45:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout me physically checking, i wuld guess it to be at least 150 km\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T20:02:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d gamble around 700km, based on a mission I did to the mountains south-west of that being 620 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Error","CreatedById":58941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T21:47:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBetween 300 and 350 klicks, best guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galaxy Inc.","CreatedById":79536,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T18:07:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just did a little math with a proportion of length in cm between the KSC and the island.
