Life Support mod and stock parts. It has enough delta V to get to Duna from a 100 Km orbit around Kerbin. The craft file comes with a launch stage to launch the transfer vehicle into orbit. It has about 2500 m/s of delta v. The craft has four 6x1 solar arrays to power the craft and 2000 electric charge. It can carry up too 7 kerbals to Duna, but only 3 can land in the surface. The lander has 300 m/s of delta v. Lander has two generators powering the craft all the time. Warranty void if used in water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Lander\u0027s craft file will be coming out soon, just needs some tweaking to make it land properly.
