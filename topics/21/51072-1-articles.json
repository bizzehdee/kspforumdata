As each launch vehicle includes its own dedicated Service Module, the T-Series removes the need for customers to provide their own interplanetary drive systems; allowing them to focus directly on pure deliverable payload mass. This is achieved without compromising on structural integrity, aesthetics, or high launch vessel part count. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, payload ratings reflect cargo capacity independent of a propulsion system. Unlike competitors, a T-Series launch vehicle will place your payload in orbit safely AND allocate you up to 2500 units of delta V (this value increases as payload mass decreases) of interplanetary travel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n98XMOc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022n98XMOc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/aLE1zJn-nVA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n98XMOc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022n98XMOc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach Kitfox, Phelan or Madcat-grade Service Module also includes a heavily shielded RTG for payload electrical support, as well as substantial command equipment for remote piloting and controlled de-orbiting.

I didn\u0027t know how to dock, let alone rendezvous, it took me a week at around 5 hours a day of forcing myself to learn not only to successfully get those suckers into orbit (without strutting) but get them to dock up and become my station hub.

My entire station is heavy on using docking ports, so it\u0027s literally dock and win, and that when I want to send something to, say Eeloo, the only thing I need to get into orbit would be the engines. Everything else would be sent up ahead, and use docking clamps to slowly build the ship in orbit, before it disconnects and flies out. Bonus points to my new design because the way I\u0027ve designed it (I hope) is that it would not be hard to start making new stations in orbit of any planet I wish. All designed around 5t to 45t modular payloads, as I had done all my early station designing built around using T-series lifters. I wasn\u0027t bad with lightweight rockets, but as soon as I started going bigger than 40t pre-ARM, either I couldn\u0027t get off the ground period, or I had so much TWR the Space Kraken killed me before I got to 45km height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c8iECUh.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/c8iECUh.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JK4Zqej.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/JK4Zqej.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daishi","CreatedById":85055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T01:16:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease do!
