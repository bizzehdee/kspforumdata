I\u0027ve done it for you. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I\u0027ve had a fun and productive day learning about part welding and its\u0027 limitations. I wasn\u0027t able to do some of what I wanted, but made good progress overall.\n\u003E The Duna Descent Vehicle, I reduced to the way it appears on Duna, since it doesn\u0027t need the fairing etc.. I turned the whole thing into a single part, down from the original 23 parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Comms Tower you already know about.. a reduction of 34 parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Hab gave me some trouble.. I was hoping to be able to lose another 20 or so parts by welding the underlying frame and the frame of the Solar Array, but even with the \u0027special\u0027 parts stripped off, those bits just would not weld correctly.. the part .cfg files were full of NaN, and they wouldn\u0027t display. However, I was able to turn the entire interior of the Hab into a single part, and rebuild the rest of the Hab around it, so that it looks and functions exactly the same as before, but instead of being 132 parts, its\u0027 now just 73 parts!\n\u003E \n\u003E All told, those three items result in a combined reduction of 115 parts. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E The part-reduced craft can be downloaded [**here**](https://app.box.com/s/4rk6rxlnwbqc7zrk07cpehqwe086xvc8).\n\u003E \n\u003E I would have done the debris from the Ares 3 Duna Ascent Vehicle as well, but I\u0027m having some trouble getting the welded parts re-attached to the core ship, so they can be dumped on the ground realistically.. if I can get that sorted out, it will result in another 40-45 less parts onsite.\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E Yes.. See the OP on page 1 for all the things that have been done so far.\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, that\u0027s a bit outside the scope of this project..\n\nFor some reason I can\u0027t download the welded craft zip file? but i am on safari on OS X will try linux later"},{"CreatedByName":"JAFO","CreatedById":132901,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T05:52:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For some reason I can\u0027t download the welded craft zip file? but i am on safari on OS X will try linux later\n\nDamn.. looks like my box.com bandwidth hasn\u0027t reset yet.. sorry about that.
