View full album](//imgur.com/a/xX4ne)\n\nA heavy fighter with a lot of punch, the Crow Mk1 is designed for taking out capital ships with ease with its two M105 Howitzers. Yes, howitzers. And I even managed to make them look good with the rest of the ship. Anyway, besides those howitzers, its armor can more or less shrug off anything less than a direct HEKV hit and it has a chaingun and a rocketpod for use against smaller ships. And, its set of countermeasures could theoretically be used for evading guided missiles.\nMods Used: BDArmory\n\nSome inspiration taken from the Vulture Nova by [KODI](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97300-Kerbin-Orbital-Defence-Industries-BDarmory-required)\n\nAction groups:\n\n1 - Main engines\n\n2 - Emergency mono-propellant engines (in case you only have the cockpit remaining)\n\n9 - Next weapon\n\n0 - Fire\n\n[DOWNLOAD](http://www./download/lb5hmogq4nykop3/Crow_Mk1.craft) on MediaFire\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T17:48:39Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hobbes Novakoff**\n  \nAdded link to KODI"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T17:18:42Z","Content":"Nice!
