I am aware that it \u0022might have one or two\u0022 historical Inaccuracies but I never wanted to do an exact Replica. The only practical Use I can think of is Tourist Contracts, as it is cheaper and has a lower Tech Level than my other Designs that can get two or more Kerbals to the Mun/Minmus but hasn\u0027t even nearly the Potential for Science as they do (Saturn 5 for the Mun and something SLS-Style for Minmus). Theoretically it could also be used to fly Scientists/Engineers to the Mun and Minmus for levelling up.
