In fact, it\u0027s probably impossible to construct a lifter that can get it into orbit legitimately. There are two methods you can use. The first is to activate the infinite fuel and infinite RCS cheats and allow mechjeb to put it into orbit using the main engines. They are powerful enough to do this. The second is to use a program like Hyperedit to hack it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaging:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly the first stage to detach the holders and activate the main engines is functional. The second stage will simultaneously fire all weapons. If you want to fire weapons individually you should manually activate individual components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsability:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft is practically unusable, at least for me. It\u0027s even worse if you put 2 of them near eachother like I have in the second screenshot. I have managed to test its weapon systems on another copy of itself (shortly after taking second screenshot), and they do work and deal damage. However, it\u0027s so laggy that the aiming process took me about 10 mins. If you have an extremely powerful PC, this will probably make great screenshot and video material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://filesmelt.com/dl/Retribution_Class_Cruiser.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://filesmelt.com/dl/Retribution_Class_Cruiser.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
