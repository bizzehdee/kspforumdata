The Rocket itself is made by the very talented mr. Mulbin, creator of incredible ships such as the Space Station Kit Mk.2, the Munbug VI Lander, and the Duna LK-1. His works gave me a sudden urge to do the same as his. . . since he uses a narrower range of parts, but uses them in way you\u0027d never think were possible. . . which was a big eye-opener for me. I\u0027m also glad he let me use his Jool V rocket system. . . or as I call it, \u0022The Mulbinar Lifting System\u0022, which was instrumental in the execution of this project. And even though my station looks a bit bigger, it actually uses fewer parts, and will still have enough fuel for the core rocket to de-orbit itself and not be labelled as debris. But enough of that, let\u0027s get on with the show, and get this over with. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: Although this is labeled as a stock ship, I chose to label it that way was because the mods are minimal, and in my opinion, are used widely by many KSP players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKWRocketry (For the external, replaceable fuel and RCS tank, and the RCS thrusters as well)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep Space Mission Pack (I used it\u0027s 2.5m to truss adapter, I thought it\u0027d look nice. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENFJ Truss Pack (Since they give a touch more flexibility with more parts to use, and they add another shade of color \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Aerospace pack (The only thing I used from this pack were the different lights included, again. . . to make the thing look cool \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFROM THE GROUND-UP, LITERALLY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeconds after liftoff (It lifts slowly. . . but it will get into orbit, don\u0027t worry. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jjgwp5s.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022Jjgwp5s.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoval of the mainsail stage.

I deliberately did this for you guys to decide what to use to close that hole up; be it another large docking port, to extend the fuel capacity, effectively making it a gas station, or perhaps make it liable for interplanetary travel by re-launching a 2 or 3-engine nuclear drive system, a lander and return vehicle to the regular docking ports, and attach probes to the clamp-o-tron juniors.

For me, this is one of my favorite shots, as you can see the ladder running the length of the main truss. It\u0027s still got a few problems though, since the ladder is too angled at some points, making the kerbals stop as they get to those said locations. But still, making them walk down then letting go to skip over those parts. . . isn\u0027t so bad either, right? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/buIGzTf.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022buIGzTf.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFinal Words:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if the pictures are a little fuzzy, my computer can handle only so much modular parts before crashing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis project took a little over 4 hours, since I had permission from mr.
