I do not currently know the nominal capacity. I want you, the reader, to build a fully functional vessel capable of going anywhere and then deploying a lander that can land anywhere except Eve or Tylo that this lifter cannot lift. Now, the catch is it can\u0027t melt my system so the entire assembly must be under 550 parts. That gives you almost 300 parts to play with, though I\u0027d be much happier if you kept it under 500 total as this lags already, not because of physics, but because of all those engine particle effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObligatory craft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_BVD9gAcd6BcHNfY3pWZkZSMzg/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_BVD9gAcd6BcHNfY3pWZkZSMzg/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T15:09:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow!
