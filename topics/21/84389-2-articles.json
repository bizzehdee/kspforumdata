If you know Jebretary you\u0027ll see this is a logical step for me to add (Jebretary maintains ALL versions of a craft as you develop it), but it will be rather different to how Jebretary functions and there will be a limit to how many versions of each craft can be stored. Initially that limit will be pretty low, like 2 or 3. As I can afford to put more database power behind then I will bring that limit up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Justin Kerbice\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Justin Kerbice\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E*snip\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t looks like now there still missing parts left \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part scan it still quite intrusive and rough, it takes everything, including my test and/or secret parts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E !\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it touches every .cfg file it can find in the GameData folder. I\u0027d considered it from the KerbalX end of things; does it matter if random test mods and totally user specific stuff ends up in the knowledge base? No, its intended to deal with clutter, it either won\u0027t have any effect or if your custom data clobbers another mods part info it still won\u0027t matter because that mod will have stronger associations to its parts (having been reported by more users). also mods that are only reported by one user will not show up in the mod search interface (they do currently because mod things still have only been reported by one user).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut from the users side of things I can see that you\u0027d want it to ignore certain mods. Two ways I can think to deal with this, either you need to create a file inside each mod you want to ignore called \u0022.dont_scan\u0022 or something like that which will tell PartMapper to ignore that folder and sub folders, OR (which is probably better) you create a ignore manifest file that you put next to PartMapper which simply lists the mods by name that you want to ignore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually the latter way will be easier to implement too, so I will probably add that in the next release of PartMapper, unless you have a different way that you\u0027d like to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Padishar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Padishar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere\u0027s nothing particularly complex about the maths, it\u0027s just the \u0022Tsiolkovsky rocket equation\u0022 (though it uses velocity vectors if you want to account for angled thrust). The tricky bit comes in working out which engines burn fuel from which tanks, in which order and correctly handling all the fuel flow rules and edge cases (e.g. when some of the engines in a stage stop burning before others) and in working out when to activate the next stage. The code in KER builds its own data structures from the core game objects (Part, ModuleEngine[sFx], AttachNode) so that it can run the actual calculations safely in a background thread.

A spaceplane isn\u0027t an aircraft, strictly speaking, and mixing them in with the \u0022ships\u0022 is probably not ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* \u0022Vertical SSTO\u0022 is probably a worthwhile category as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Auto-detecting the action group assignments would be a major bonus. Entering them manually is tedious enough that I\u0027m very unlikely to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* At the moment, it appears to be counting stock parts as a mod (named \u0022Squad\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* As mentioned above, you absolutely need a way to differentiate FAR and stock aero designs. Auto-detect if you can, but a user toggle if you can\u0027t. Very few spaceplanes function adequately in both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the list of possible classes is something that needs improving I don\u0027t want to end up having lots of sub-classes (that one called \u0022Moonbus\u0022 was just there as a test case and I keep forgetting to remove it). Oddly enough it seems that the more categories there are the more ambiguous they become and people seem worse at picking the right one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think its better to have broader classes and then add further definition buy using #tags. So a winged SSTO VTOL would get filed under aircraft (along with all winged things) but would then have the #tags SSTO and VTOL. That will make it get returned in more searches but still only in relevant searches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you did a search by typing \u0022SSTO VTOL\u0022 into the search field, it will find all craft that have SSTO and VTOL in the name and also craft that have both SSTO and VTOL hash tags.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to make more of a thing about the hash tags, they are kinda understated currently (although most pep are adding them). It needs to be clearer that hash tags are searched in when you type something in and I also want to have a page that shows a hash-tag \u0022word cloud\u0022 as another way of interacting with #tags.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really like auto detection of action groups too. It is theoretically possible, as in I can read which parts have action group assignments, but creating meaningful messages from it is much harder (kinda impossible). For each group I could just list all the parts for each action type (activate, toggle etc) , but it would be a clunky assembly of words that wouldn\u0027t really help, and I think would invoke a TL;DR response in most people. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT what I can do is read information from craft that have B9 info-drive part. That is now implemented (as of a couple days ago), so if you put action group info in there (or a poem or whatever) it will automatically populate the action groups when you upload (and just for the hackers who might be wondering; don\u0027t waste time trying to encode html and scripts into craft data or part/mod info, it won\u0027t work!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, to KerbalX everything is a mod and Squad and NASAmission are actually two completely separate mods. The only thing is that these two mods are known to the system as being special cases. This does a couple things, a) by treating them all as equal means there doesn\u0027t need to be any special case event \u003Cem\u003Ewhen\u003C/em\u003E Squad adds more stock parts, the system will get updated by whoever first uploads a part-map after a new KSP release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs squad and NASAmission are separate you can be more specific in craft searches and exclude craft that use NASAmission or return stock craft that use it and not just all the stock craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes the ability to say that craft need FAR/NEAR or any of the other mods that don\u0027t add parts seems to be what you guys are calling for most, so that is in the pipe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T21:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI understand your point about wanting to avoid too many categories, although I do think \u0022spaceplane\u0022 is a large and distinct enough group to have a stronger claim to a separate identity than many other things (satellite \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E station \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E base?
