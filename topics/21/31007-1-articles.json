Slowly throttle up to gain altitude and then tilt forward to start moving forward. For landing there is a docking clamp on top to switch control to so it\u0027s kinda-but-not-so-much like a regular atmospheric lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I cannot remember whose design it originally was so if it is yours, kindly tell me and I will edit it to give you credit. Also, it has fuel to fly to the small island with the airship. Enough to land, however, I am unsure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T22:54:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s Cupcake...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cupcake...","CreatedById":62843,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T08:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice, welcome to the club! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECupcake...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
