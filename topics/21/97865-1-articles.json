The alternative shuttle concepts are all pretty awesome (and most make more sense than the final design).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the fuel bug, I have a feeling it\u0027s the same thing that has been happening to me lately (well, it\u0027s been happening forever, but now I know how to detect and fix it!): parent part issues. When you drop a part in the editor, take care that the cursor is hovering above the part that you actually want to attach to, and not another one, because otherwise the game can build the connection from \u003Cem\u003Ethe other\u003C/em\u003E part. This is how you can \u0022lose\u0022 connection nodes, too, the game assigns it to the bugged parent part, that shouldn\u0027t have it in the first place, and when you remove the one connected to it, it reverts it to its node-less natural state, taking the connection node out of the craft file entirely. I\u0027m sure that\u0027s happened to you before. At least I think that\u0027s how it works. In any case, the solution is to remove and re-attach all the parts involved in the fuel routing, and taking more care in the future. The KER feature of popping a contextual name for the part you are highlighting helps a lot to know what you are dropping stuff into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
