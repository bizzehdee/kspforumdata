I didn\u0027t think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E only was possible at those higher scales. The jet to LV-N ratio is completely reversed from my design. Mine had 40 rapiers and 8 nukes (5 jets/rapiers per nuke). You had 8 nukes and 5 jets, or 3 rapiers if you prefer... 2.67 nukes per rapier, 1.6 nukes per jet. I may want to consider putting in more nukes and less rapiers.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI also note that you seem to have 10 shuttle wings, and I guess enough of other wing types to be roughly equivalent to 12 shuttle wings for 101 tons starting mass. So 8 tons per shuttle wing, and 1.7 tons per \u0022relative lift unit\u0022 or relative wing area, or whatever unit the lift rating is of wings.... Quite a bit more wing per unit mass than my design.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAlso, its impressive in a way that your dry mass is so high (over 50% of the wet mass), whereas my ~13% payload fraction design was like 280-290 tons dry mass, with a takeoff weight of about 900 tons (about 33% of the wet mass with payload). I guess you have more engine mass and less fuel mass, whereas I used more fuel mass and had less engine mass (per ton of craft)... the difference being that I went heavy on rapiers, and you went heavy on nukes.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAs for your payload, I\u0027m willing to count unused fuel as payload. Taking your numbers at face value, 55 tons dry mass (exactly for the purposes of calculation). Then you must have had 62.7 tons in orbit to get 1028 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E as your screenshot shows. That\u0027s 7.7 tons of fuel in orbit, from 101 tons starting mass. I\u0027m willing to assign that demo flight a payload fraction of 7.6%.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I recall one flight that was a 17% payload fraction (I may be mistaken, my memory is fuzzy, and I had a computer crash a while back and lost most of my files), and had a veeeeerrrryyyyy long burn on the LV-Ns that went to space, back into the atmo, and back into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe more nukes is the way to go...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you had, all totalled, 8*3\u002B3*2\u002B2*1 = 32 tons of engines for 100 tons of craft, and 8 tons of payload (rounding here). So 3 tons of craft per engine, and 4 tons of engine per ton of payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy craft had 40 rapiers and 8 nukes, so 40*2\u002B8*3 = 104 tons of engine for 900 tons of craft, and 115 tons of payload. so 8.5 tons of craft per engine, and about a 1:1 payload:engine mass ratio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur craft have very different ratios in multiple parameters, but the performance isn\u0027t all that dissimilar... interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI look forward to what you come up with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf possible, try to accommodate large and heavy payloads, and keep part count manageable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if interested, some old videos I put on youtube of my 3x system and some of my designs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O5SqRqygHo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O5SqRqygHo\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6bRj0SuEe8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6bRj0SuEe8\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that I\u0027m not always trying to push the payload fraction to the max...

I didn\u0027t think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E only was possible at those higher scales. The jet to LV-N ratio is completely reversed from my design. Mine had 40 rapiers and 8 nukes (5 jets/rapiers per nuke). You had 8 nukes and 5 jets, or 3 rapiers if you prefer... 2.67 nukes per rapier, 1.6 nukes per jet. I may want to consider putting in more nukes and less rapiers.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI also note that you seem to have 10 shuttle wings, and I guess enough of other wing types to be roughly equivalent to 12 shuttle wings for 101 tons starting mass. So 8 tons per shuttle wing, and 1.7 tons per \u0022relative lift unit\u0022 or relative wing area, or whatever unit the lift rating is of wings.... Quite a bit more wing per unit mass than my design.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAlso, its impressive in a way that your dry mass is so high (over 50% of the wet mass), whereas my ~13% payload fraction design was like 280-290 tons dry mass, with a takeoff weight of about 900 tons (about 33% of the wet mass with payload). I guess you have more engine mass and less fuel mass, whereas I used more fuel mass and had less engine mass (per ton of craft)... the difference being that I went heavy on rapiers, and you went heavy on nukes.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAs for your payload, I\u0027m willing to count unused fuel as payload. Taking your numbers at face value, 55 tons dry mass (exactly for the purposes of calculation). Then you must have had 62.7 tons in orbit to get 1028 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E as your screenshot shows. That\u0027s 7.7 tons of fuel in orbit, from 101 tons starting mass.

So 3 tons of craft per engine, and 4 tons of engine per ton of payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy craft had 40 rapiers and 8 nukes, so 40*2\u002B8*3 = 104 tons of engine for 900 tons of craft, and 115 tons of payload. so 8.5 tons of craft per engine, and about a 1:1 payload:engine mass ratio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur craft have very different ratios in multiple parameters, but the performance isn\u0027t all that dissimilar... interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI look forward to what you come up with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf possible, try to accommodate large and heavy payloads, and keep part count manageable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if interested, some old videos I put on youtube of my 3x system and some of my designs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022#\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EReveal hidden contents\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O5SqRqygHo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O5SqRqygHo\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6bRj0SuEe8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6bRj0SuEe8\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that I\u0027m not always trying to push the payload fraction to the max...
