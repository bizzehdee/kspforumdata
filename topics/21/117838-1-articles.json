What you do after you get to orbit does not affect whether or not it is an SSTO.\n\nThe concept that I\u0027m going after is to build an SSTO space plane and put it into orbit. The craft then separates into two parts leaving one part in orbit for the return flight pack to KSP, and the other part is able to go off and fly to any or all of the planets and moons then return to Kerbin orbit, dock with the space plane and fly home. Taking the full space plane everywhere is not terribly efficient, and landing tail-first is extremely tricky (things tend to break), and I have moral issues with using nuclear engines. So I\u0027m doing basically the same thing just changing the risk factors - also I like to do things differently than everyone else.\n\nI changed the design slightly in order for this craft to get into space as a space plane so the rapiers have replaced the LV-T30 which actually aren\u0027t any more efficient. I have aerospikes on the craft for landing and those could be used for orbital maneuvering as well. \n\nJR\n\nEDIT: BTW on my last test flight I was able to get into orbit with enough fuel to reach Minmus, so now I can go on to Duna.\n\n![nD0x90N.png](http://i.imgur.com/nD0x90N.png)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It is very interesting to see how you managed to put that, on top of a not-really-Longsword.

Drop the nose down to about 15 degrees between 12Km and 20Km to take advantage of the good acceleration of the rapiers at that altitude, then nose back up to 30 degrees and hit HotKey #3 to toggle the rapiers to closed cycle mode above 21Km. Soon after that the turbojets will flame out so hit HotKey #1 to toggle them off. Once in orbit you\u0027ll need to transfer all the remaining fuel into the Reliant craft before decoupling and heading to Minmus to refuel.\n\nThe craft is actually over powered on takeoff and it will allow you to fly a steeper glide path than you should. The objective is to get as close to 1100 m/s as you can before switching the Rapiers to closed-cycle mode so you should generally choose speed over altitude and that means keeping your nose down. Also the fact that you have too much LF left over is a sign that you should be taking more advantage of the atmospheric Ox which means you need to stay lower in the atmosphere for longer and that again requires a shallower glide path. \n\nI hope that helps.\n\nJR\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-04T05:51:26Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2015 05:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jolly\\_Roger**"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisD","CreatedById":144851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T01:47:21Z","Content":"The man knows his spaceplanes!

I was going to say that has never happened to me but I did experience something similar in my Kerbal Galaxy modded install. I haven\u0027t had any issues like that lately though.\n\nWith respect to the spacecraft, landing it is tricky, but if you have any kind of piloting skills it shouldn\u0027t be an issue. I have an instructional type video on how the three engine landing system works for a different craft with a similar design\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/gin8HC9TPaE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n. Basically you use the thrust limiter on the front engine to control the pitch as the fuel burns off. Another trick is to watch the RCS thrusters to tell if you need to throttle up or down and it\u0027s best is to control the craft from the top docking port when using the landing engines (that way you can just hit auto retrograde to help control it). The only recommendation I can make is that you practice landing it on Minmus a few times until you get good at it before tackling other larger moons. Duna is more complex yet, since the atmospheric drag will toss the ship around if you descend too fast. If you make it that far I would suggest that you keep your velocity below 500m/s under 20Km altitude and below 300m/s under 8Km. \nI guarantee it, if you can land that ship on Duna and return it to KSP you have entered the upper echelon of pilots. You got some mad skills then; there should be a Jebediah badge or something! LOL\n\nJR"}]}
