It seems to me, from glancing around the kerbal forums, few people are as heavily invested into SRB research as I am.. maybe because people already decided they\\\u0027re not worth looking at anymore? Personally, I have a great deal of fun trying to push them to compete with the liquid engine designs (as impossible as that it is for long distance travel). I\\\u0027m even considering trying to make it to the moon with SRBs! But that\\\u0027s far from now, for now I\\\u0027m just tinkering with how to cram a lot of them in a small space effectively. There\\\u0027s a few techniques that I had to come up with to overcome overheating and drastic shifts in speed, as well as weight limits (I\\\u0027ll leave you to figure those out from the craft file or on your own if you\\\u0027re interested at all). There\\\u0027s a few more things I want to try, and then I\\\u0027ll move onto Honeycomb III, which basically will be made from scratch with what I\\\u0027ve learned in mind.\n\nWell, either way I\\\u0027ve decided to share the fruits of my SRB experiments:\n\nthe Honeycomb II\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![honeycombiiside.jpg](http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/880/honeycombiiside.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![honeycombiitop.jpg](http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/3754/honeycombiitop.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nSome stats about the Honeycomb II:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It caps out at around 3km/s @ ~56km depending on how well you can time the first to second stage transition. The time says 1mins, 20 Secs, but that\\\u0027s after I floated around a bit.. it\\\u0027s probably closer to 1 minute. Is it a bug that my Gee Force was 23.7G? That seems pretty high, or is that not all that much?\n\u003E \n\u003E ![honeycombiireport1.jpg](http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/9231/honeycombiireport1.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![honeycombiireport2.jpg](http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/7218/honeycombiireport2.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nAttached is the Honeycomb II craft file, I warn you now that if you have a slow computer: this is not the craft file you were looking for. My computer is pretty good though it\\\u0027s starting to get dated, but I can still run games like Starcraft at Ultra high settings with clear framerates; even so, I get maybe 3 fps during the first stage of Honeycomb II.\n\nOn a side note: will Kerbal ever come with a \u0027don\\\u0027t show particles\u0027 option? I\\\u0027m guessing rendering all the particles this thing makes, along with all the shadows on the parts, really kills the frame rates."},{"CreatedByName":"wired2thenet","CreatedById":18275,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-02T04:43:36Z","Content":"...\n\nThe only words I can describe this with will get me banned from the forums, permanently.\n\nSo let me just say: You sir, are a Kerman!"},{"CreatedByName":"Imandreas","CreatedById":18071,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-02T04:53:30Z","Content":"NOT ENOUGH BOOSTERS.\n\nSeriously though.

Nice death trap drag racer!\n\nActually, the truth of the matter is I really don\\\u0027t have enough boosters. It\\\u0027s really not actually a death trap, all fuel can be expended without loss of life, and the command pod has a parachute so... But it would make a pretty decent drag racer if I can say so myself.\n\n I need to experiment with radial decouplers again, but last time I tried them they were falling off due to overheating even though they weren\\\u0027t even remotely in contact/proximity with any engines/explosions. If only there was some way to cram even more in... hmm..."},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-02T23:21:21Z","Content":"One of the most awesome stock rockets I have seen."},{"CreatedByName":"Krugz","CreatedById":23581,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-03T23:01:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One of the most awesome stock rockets I have seen.\n\nWhy thank you!

It\\\u0027s not done yet, but it\\\u0027s already too strong and overshoots the moon.
