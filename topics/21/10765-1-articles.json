Maximum maneuverability has been the primary concern in its design. Anyone who flies it does so at their own risk.

You can see in the pictures than certain parts look above the ones around it - because they actually are. I\\\u0027m assuming if you let go of the controls temporarily, the jet will start to roll.\n\nPretty cool though!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sordid","CreatedById":535,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T04:12:10Z","Content":"Yeah, it is very unstable, though mainly in terms of pitch and to a lesser degree yaw. Roll isn\\\u0027t really a problem.\n\nI\\\u0027m hoping to further improve it by making the overlapping wings symmetrical. On the left wing the forward part is on top, but on the right wing the back part is on top.\n\nEdit: Right, I made some modifications which I consider to be an improvement. Craft file has been updated. It\\\u0027s possibly even more unstable in pitch now, but what little spontaneous roll there was seems to be gone completely. Personally I consider the instability a plus, since that means good maneuverability. It does require constant adjustments, but you\\\u0027re in a Mach 2 jet fighter, you\\\u0027re supposed to be paying attention anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"purple100","CreatedById":10989,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T06:27:02Z","Content":"Performs great.

It doesn\\\u0027t have to be a sophisticated flight stick, I play KSP with a 360 controller, but even that is much more precise than keyboard control."},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T17:22:17Z","Content":"Nope, I\\\u0027m using a keyboard.

I suppose flight has become a bit more off-limits for binary users.\n\nEdit: Taking the ailerons off helped a lot, although I haven\\\u0027t reached max alt yet so I\\\u0027m guessing it won\\\u0027t perform very well up there.

The shape of the wing is reminiscent of the F/A-18, the lack of space between the ailerons and the stabilators makes it look a bit like an F-22, and the two oversized engine nozzles are straight out of the MiG-25."}]}
