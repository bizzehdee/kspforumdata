I also added some SRBs on \u0022outriggers\u0022 large I beams up high on my payload to reduce some of the pressure from the bottom. I went with SRBs because their thrust is a fixed amount, and to keep the part count down over tanks and engines. Anything else and I would get the explosions you are talking about.

These are less weight and empty quicker. I suspect though, since you said this happens on a stage that you need to reduce your throttle some. Also look at the flight report after the failed missions and determine if you need to add more struts. On my heavy fueler there is probably enough weight in struts to build a Mun capable ship. Again such is doable, it just takes quite a bit of trial and error.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
