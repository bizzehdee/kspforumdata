View full album](//imgur.com/a/vnrZv)\n\nAnd now, some specifics:\n\nPre-launch tonnage: 657,68 T\n\nCrew capacity: 11 (cupola, Mk2 cockpit, 2x Mk2 crew cabin)\n\nFully fueled dv: 5973 m/s\n\nEngines: 7x Kerbodyne KR-2L Advanced Engine\n\nTotal thrust: 17500 kN\n\nKerbin TWR: 2.71 (max 13.45)\n\nMain cargo bay: Mk3 Long cargo bay with sr docking port\n\nService cargo bay: 8x Z-400 Rechargeable Battery, 6x RTG\n\nDocking ports: 3 sr docking ports (2 on front, one in Main cargo bay), 2 standard docking ports (left and right), 2 small docking ports (under the cupola pod)\n\nMonoprop: 1025 units\n\nWith a semi-random ascent profile i reached an 85x72 km LKO and more than 1200dv left, but i guess you could squeeze some more following a better ascent profile. I had 4653\u002B5687 LFO and all the monoprop (4T) left, so about 1.6 orange tanks, so it can deliver ~55T to LKO (putting them into the cargo bay and using all the fuel).\n\nHere\u0027s the dropbox link:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/m08chzwriqyrp8x/Exodus%20Mothership.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m08chzwriqyrp8x/Exodus%20Mothership.craft?dl=0)\n\nPut it inside your SPH folder, not the VAB!\n\nHope you like it,\n\nBorbalf\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T10:50:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 10:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by borbalf**"},{"CreatedByName":"KandoKris","CreatedById":103873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T00:44:46Z","Content":"Holy cow. thats huge and really cool.
