The X-15 as he said was a rocket plane and used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters for control, making it more of a manned missile than a true plane.   The SR-71 is a good example of a true high supersonic aircraft design.   The thing is your lift moves back on the wing the faster you go, until a certain point then it will no longer provide the same lift as previous speeds.   I found some of my most successful high speed aircraft have been cranked delta wing designs.   \n\nI have lately been experimenting with a delta wing design with a variable geometry cranked wing end section.  That lets me set the wing to a more conventional cranked arrow design for lower speeds and for high speeds closer to a true delta.   This is based off of an old Russian design for the Su-17.   I have high hopes for this design and expectations.  I imagine it will do everything I need it to do, and still meet all of my mission requirements for new military aircraft designs."},{"CreatedByName":"UnusualAttitude","CreatedById":129962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T00:38:38Z","Content":"Hi guys.\n\nJust dropping by to present a concept I\u0027ve been working on for a while: a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E hypersonic passenger aircraft with transatlantic range.\n\nA proof-of-concept vehicle to demonstrate the ability to connect all the different launch sites in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, I tested *Livernon* on the Hammaguir - Kourou route.\n\n*Livernon* is a 16-seat super/hyper-sonic craft using the MK3 hypersonic cockpit with a take-off mass just shy of 100 tonnes, with 60 tonnes of liquid methane to fuel the three RAPIER engines.\n\n ![qo4j0m0.png](http://i.imgur.com/qo4j0m0.png)\n\nMost of the liquid methane fuel is stored inside a cryogenic tank which itself is stored inside a cargo bay to limit boil-off during the flight.\n\n![bLbFYnB.png](http://i.imgur.com/bLbFYnB.png)\n\nTake-off is a challenge, as always limited by the length of the stock runway.\n\n![90Gu3S4.png](http://i.imgur.com/90Gu3S4.png)\n\nHammaguir is situated in a dip in the terrain, and low-level performance and climb-out are sluggish...\n\n![BcA3U0h.png](http://i.imgur.com/BcA3U0h.png)\n\n...but *Livernon* climbs to 15,000m, goes supersonic and reaches Mach 3.5 by the time she reaches the western coast of Africa.

It can be tricky to calculate actual thrust provided by that engine without proper info.  \n\nEngine rotate propeller that \u0022grab\u0022 some amount of air and push it into lateral motion. Only that fraction of \u0022grabed\u0022 air in lateral motion actualy provide thrust.  \n\nAmount of air pushed in lateral motion depends on RPM, length of propeller blades, amount of blades, angle of attack of blades, propeller weight, atmospheric data (temperature/pressure/moisture)\n\nWhile we don\u0027t know actual thrust data for that aircraft, we know that overall craft \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E from that period was pretty bad. I couldn\u0027t find accurate data for that aircraft, but more modern aircraft(jet fighters) have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E between 0.2 and 0.3\n\nWith that in mind, we can only come to conclusion that actual thrust for Sopwith Triplane is 7 \\* 0.2 = 1.4 kN or in best case with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 0.3 thrust is 2.1 kN (rounded g to 10)\n\nYour craft in game have much, much better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E than real life aircraft. Regarding \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E being realistic or not, you have always need to keep in mind that is mathematical fluid model, not actual real life scenario where other variables kicks in.
