So called because by the time you have enough science to build it, it is a long shot that there are any tech tree nodes left to unlock. First in a series because I want to keep as much functionality as possible while removing advanced tech parts to gain as much benefit from the science it gathers as possible. I will release each step as it devolves. Currently it has about 12KDv for the main probe and another 2.8KDv on the sub probe. I expect this to fall rapidly as advanced parts are swapped for more basic ones. As returning science is to be made more valid the probe is designed to return physical science data. The main probe can either be left in space and collected with a tug fitted with a docking port Jr or landed with any remaining fuel using the NERVA. The sub probe can be returned using the parachute. It has strange goo, materials, and the four standard sensors. With two RTG as power and 600 battery, you will have to keep an eye on the power levels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Forgot to mention, be careful when staging the two sets of boosters not to let them hit your craft or the launch will have a bit too much kerbal in it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/nmrBS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The final probe has a parachute if you want to land that on Kerbin also. Have a look through the gallery and you will see the probe doing all these things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowered landing at KSC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SHSpNy6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SHSpNy6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-14T11:25:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2013 11:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by John FX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
