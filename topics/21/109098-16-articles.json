Less gooseneck, more of a blended-body delta design.

Will definitely investigate at some point, I did something similar ages ago that worked ( although I just ended up making bigger fuselages instead ). \n\n[![15664792597_9722dc78b4.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7552/15664792597_9722dc78b4.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/pSfa5Z)\n\nWhat seems to work rather well for this is just making it longer; wave drag decreased unsurprisingly, and there doesn\u0027t seem to be any change in required AoA at 20km at all, which \\*is\\* somewhat surprising.

I was always thinking, because of, like FourGreenFields mentioned, somwhere on forums someone mentioned that where graphs seperate there is a stall involved somewhere. Noone clarified that more, so we all was assuming that is it.\n\nHowever, based on expirience with my own craft designs, I was able only to put Cm yelow neutral point(where cross x axis) just slightly into area where graph lines splits and still have more/less contolable craft. Cl drop point was 5-10 AoA higher than AoA where graph start to split. Could be that due to moment of inertia, engine gimbals or something else involved that AoA is somehow higher than expected to be and plane reached stall area regardless.\n\nAnyway, when I started to design control authority in a way that Cm neutral point does not fall in area where graph splits, craft becomes more stable and controlable with only slight loss in maneuverability. Probably that is due to reason that even when moment of inertia or engine gimbals kicked in it was not enough to reach stall AoA degree.\n\nRegardless, my advice to bartekkru99 is still valid, to check AoA sweep with \u00221\u0022 pitching and set control authority in a way that craft does not fall in dangerous AoA area.\n\nNow we got even more info what dangerous AoA point is."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T14:05:24Z","Content":"If you\u0027re having fun building heavies, give this a go: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122243-Heavy-Lift-Economy-Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122243-Heavy-Lift-Economy-Challenge)"},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T15:19:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re having fun building heavies, give this a go: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122243-Heavy-Lift-Economy-Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122243-Heavy-Lift-Economy-Challenge)\n\nWell, I might give it a go, currently I\u0027m still searching for various mod combo that will more/less work well with each other without conflicts.\n\nMost of them still need to be updated and still have not rechecked that temperature FAR bug that was poped up within first days after 1.0.4 release.\n\nReal life issues were kicked in between, so I still didn\u0027t recreated anything solid worth to show for 1.0.4."},{"CreatedByName":"Ultraturbopanda","CreatedById":33909,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T06:09:21Z","Content":"I\u0027m working on my first SSTO in nuFAR.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

You\u0027re also right - the CoL indicator does not work with FAR installed, which is a real shame; to be honest it\u0027s the only thing I don\u0027t like about FAR, though if you know how to interpret the data FAR gives you then you don\u0027t really need it.

They don\u0027t have enough oomph for that craft.\n\nAlright, thanks. \n\nOkay...so when I go to design a FAR spaceplane, I usually try to shoot for ~1800 in rocket delta-V. That\u0027s usually just enough to get me into orbit with some wiggle room in case I botch my ascent profile - which probably happens more often than it should. Based on these numbers, your plane has got 1,581.59 m/s of delta-V, about 220 short. So yes, that\u0027ll get you sub-orbital; you need just a little more to make the final transition to orbit. Your options - either add another four tonnes worth of LF\u002BO (the equivalent of an FL-T800) or use a different rocket with a vacuum Isp of no less than 335. Myself, I\u0027d shoot for the higher Isp rocket; it\u0027s generally easier to swap out an engine for one that\u0027s more efficient. And by easier I mean that it usually causes less of a change to your overall drag profile. Of course, your options would be quite limited if you\u0027re picking between stock rockets...Terriers, Poodles, Nervs, Rhinos and Aerospikes are the only stock rockets with a vacuum Isp that high, and the ones that are the same size as the one you\u0027ve got aren\u0027t renowned for their overall levels of thrust (the Aerospike, maybe - but it still only gives 175 kN of thrust and it doesn\u0027t gimbal, two big downgripes).
