In order to travel the vast distances involved with Interplanetary missions, the vehicle will need a low-thrust, high specific-impulse engine, in addition to facilities that will allow the crew necessary room to carry out their actions, while also maintaining enough storage to house the food and water and fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve put together somewhat of a conceptual model here.

For such long-duration missions, the truss is actually designed to rotate like a centrifuge to simulate artificial gravity, like so: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.picasion.com/pic43/44faab7d0dadfdf665cd5d3e50149094.gif\u0022 alt=\u002244faab7d0dadfdf665cd5d3e50149094.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the ship\u0027s mass is taken up by the engine assembly (SAS modules, Heat Radiators, Fuel tanks and a modified NERVA engine assembly.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it is a fairly \u0027bare-bones-basics\u0027 vessel in terms of design, there are other features implemented.
