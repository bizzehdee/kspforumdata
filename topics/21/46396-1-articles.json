She\u0027s a nimble, flexible and forgiving craft - a petite little monster (clocking in at almost 300 parts) of a SSTO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell: two pictures from one flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SsaIq1a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SsaIq1a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8ghgCyD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228ghgCyD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for more detail, the imgur album\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/62vwC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

As-is, stock Dragonshy has *barely* enough thrust for a VTOL takeoff - you\u0027ll want to use a brief burst of the rockets as soon as the jet spools up and it starts feeling light on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel tanks burn evenly, for COG stability - in fact, the COG does not move at all, due to symmetrical fuel tanks and obsessive balancing. If anything, handling improves, as there is less mass further from the COG, so it can turn more quickly. Thanks to m4v for creating RCS Build Aid - it was invaluable. As part of that balancing, the Dragonshy sports three reaction wheels - so it\u0027s quite nimble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a relatively new builder, I had to get creative to get it all to work; in particular, getting the fuel logic to behave while using a ton of decorative intakes gave me fits. Still, I\u0027m very happy with the end result, and I hope you all enjoy it as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you\u0027d like an all-stock VTOL-capable SSTO with a LVN that can take it to minimus, here\u0027s the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3333645/Dragonshy%20mk8.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownload Link\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E (dropbox, right click to save)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAction groups as follows:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: toggle horizontal turbojet engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: toggle horizontal (Nuke) engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: toggle vertical jet engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: toggle vertical rockets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: lock gimbol on vertical jet/rocket engines (\u003Cstrong\u003Enecessary if you want to VTOL stably\u003C/strong\u003E - engines do not account for being above the COG in their vectoring, so they will actually work against you.
