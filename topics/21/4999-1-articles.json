With its massive wingspan, long glide time, low fuel consumption and high max landing speed [65 m/s], this craft is a must-have for any military\\\u0027s long-range aerial bombing unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the \u003Cem\u003EAlbatross\u003C/em\u003E is designed to launch its payload in air, as opposed to the \u003Cem\u003EGannet\u003C/em\u003E at sea-level, the craft has a much longer bombing range. However, it is less accurate. The \u003Cem\u003EAlbatross\u003C/em\u003E is a very stable aircraft, with forward V-wings above the massive delta-style main wings keeping the craft from tipping over forwards. It does have one or two flight quirks, such as its reluctance to turn unless by banking, and its tendacy to dip forwards at 2X warp. However, it is a very impressive machine, and it gets the thumbs up from our pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZxuZ0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZxuZ0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Squeal","CreatedById":11814,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-31T15:35:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not sure if having the SRBs engines facing the cockpit is an entirely sane idea, but a kerbal one none the less. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-31T15:52:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Squeal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Squeal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not sure if having the SRBs engines facing the cockpit is an entirely sane idea, but a kerbal one none the less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo overheating or exhaust damage has been recorded as being caused by the Avia before, during or after launch.
