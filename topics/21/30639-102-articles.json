You probably do not have either enough thrust or enough lift or both. A good rule of thumb is 15t per jet engine, 13t for RAPIER. and go to slightly more loading (17-15) when you get this working. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. It could be hard for a large plane, but try to calculate the total lift rating of the parts and make sure it is around 0.8-1 lift rating per t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Make sure the center of lift is slightly behind the center of mass (the spheres should touch or nearly touch), and the thrust vector is pointing towards the center of mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Install more control surfaces: canards near the nose of the plane, elevons near the rear. Make sure the canards are facing the right way or they wont work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m definitely putting more than that per engine, and thats also one of its biggest issues right now (not enough thrust to fight increased drag).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift is something I don\u0027t *think* is a huge issue.
