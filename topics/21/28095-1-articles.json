The only criticisms that come to mind is the excess of jet fuel and what I suspect are two avionics packages (I\u0027d just do 1 and use a regular nose cone in place of the other just to get more control authority). Also, I\u0027m curious to see if you can add a docking port to the top of the ship and how heavy a payload it could carry into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Varyon","CreatedById":60423,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T18:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been needing a nice-looking SSTO for a while now, and I\u0027m just terrible at them.

To the further details: It has 5 ram jet engines which will be shut down from the out side to the inside, so I have the maximum use of them. After I shut down the first two, I ignite the liquid fuel engines and the last ram jet will be in use until it flames out by itself, then I shut down the air intakes aswell for less drag. While ascend I normally move a big load of fuel to the front so it flys even smoother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, I made easier ones to fly. But in this case, the optics will have to pay it\u0027s price. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing with the fuel is, until Orbit I use quite a lot and the rest is for mostly for keeping balance. But you could probably do with less of course. Again: It\u0027s not the most economic, but looks rather decent in my opinion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the construction I have to say, since I had my good problems with keeping the center of mass within the limits and on the other hand making the outside looking all right, I decided to kinda use the \u0022flaws\u0022 of the game and for adding the rcs balls, the ram intakes and two rocket fuel parts inside the jet hull. (The fact that this even is possible was only found out last Sunday... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E) So I don\u0027t know, is this an accepted method or will there be flaming all over the place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want I could upload some more screenshots and if you tell me how to get it, probably even the .craft file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYours sincerely\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecpt_nosh\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
