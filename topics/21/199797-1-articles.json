I\u0027ve built at least ten unique Eve ascenders but only succeeded in reaching orbit with one of them. That was a 400 ton monster that relied on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, so I wasn\u0027t very proud of it. All of those attempts were rockets, and heavy ones, so I thought it would be worth trying to use propellers for the first stage of my next attempt.

Dry mass is 20.07t after staging off the propellers. Wet is 62.07t. Unfortunately I\u0027m not great at designing planes in general, so I\u0027m not sure I can do much better\u00A0with the wings. I experimented in the past with detachable wings, but I lost control instantly without them; the whole plane flips over backward. I think I could perhaps detach the forward wing section alone. I might also be able to remove or simplify the yaw stabilizers and the x-shaped wing strakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have a big task ahead of me to figure out atmospheric entry. I\u0027ve never created a single vessel of any shape or size that could enter Eve\u0027s atmosphere from orbital velocity\u00A0without catastrophic damage. I chose the MK2 parts initially thinking their heat tolerance would make reentry possible. Now I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s going to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould I ascend at a shallower angle? I\u0027ve never known what the right way to figure out a gravity turn is. It seems like successful Eve SSTOs burn at a shallow angle of between 2 and 20 degrees. I\u0027ve been starting my burn at 45 degrees to try to get away from the drag sooner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a good place I can stash fuel cell arrays? I need two for this design, and I\u0027d like to put them somewhere they won\u0027t cause drag. Even better would be if I could stage them with the propellers since they\u0027re dead weight after that point. Maybe I can put them inside a fairing with the propellers during reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also considering replacing the Darts with a smaller number of more powerful engines. I think having good in-atmosphere isp is less important at the altitudes I\u0027m using them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I do get around to making an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E some day,\u00A0I will have to\u00A0use two different engine types so I can make the most of my fuel weight.

After an almost complete rebuild, I got as high as 19.9km with the propellers which is probably the best I can hope for with this much mass. The new wings are quite large and practically mirrored on the vertical axis. My final run made orbit with 1200 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E in reserve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022evepto9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/Dgp5qgj/evepto9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fuel cell arrays ended up on the front decouplers where the propellers are. It simply doesn\u0027t seem worth it to hide them in anything. The kerbals got moved to command seats in the cargo bay -- not exactly travelling in style. The six Darts were replaced with three Skiffs. Admittedly that\u0027s less thrust, but it\u0027s also less weight and drag, and it has acceptable isp for that altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLesson learned on wings: If you have weaker engines with low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, you\u0027re better off keeping the wings for the lift and control they provide. Doubly so if you\u0027re lacking in gimbal and reaction wheels. Whereas if you have powerful engines like the Vector, you can power into a bullet trajectory earlier and drop all lifting surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLesson learned on performing a gravity turn: Same thing. Stronger engines can power through the atmosphere at a shallow angle. Weaker engines benefit from a high angle to get out of the atmosphere sooner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I one day embark on making an Eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, the question is this: Nerv or Dawn? Nerv makes sense because spaceplane wings and fuselages are some of the few fuel tanks that can\u00A0carry pure liquid fuel.
