There is nothing wrong with setting up a small outpost with a single launch, but just as with one piece monolithic space stations there are some serious limitations on the capabilities of such a base given that it has to fit a launch vehicle. To be a truly spacefaring civilisation one need to capability to build permanent structures on other worlds that are expandable. Instead of a single launch you should be able to add capability to a base by adding more and more modules to it, just as you would when building large space stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course docking is easy in zero G, but a lot more complicated on the surface. Through much trial and error I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve worked out a method to construct modular bases. If you are interested in the theory work behind the creation of this kit and/or want to know how to design your own modules compatible with this system you can read about it here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48876-The-art-of-modular-base-building\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48876-The-art-of-modular-base-building\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I use the kit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, each module that comes in this modular construction kit is already equipped with its own Mun-capable launch vehicle, going to Minmus should be no problem as well since delta-V requirement is about the same. If you want to setup interplanetary bases then you may need to rework the launch vehicle to fit the delta-V budget. Each module is equipped with some kind of landing system and the description of the module will tell you how much work the launch vehicle is supposed to do. There are three strategies I use to go to the Mun to ensure compliance to the Clean Space Act.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Launch Vehicle responsible for launch to LKO: the booster rocket will launch the module to a 75km x 75km orbit.

Take for example this module:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i42.tinypic.com/dww1z6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dww1z6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we are sending a module called \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTanker Rover Docking Bay\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to Glushko Refinery. The docking bay allows tanker rovers carrying fuel or kethane to dock with the refinery. Now if you look under the description for this module below you can see its rocket is designed for TMI. Hence the core stage of the booster rocket is responsible for placing the payload in LKO parking orbit first before igniting for a second time here for trans-munar-injection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce TMI is complete cut the rocket stage loose and use its RCS system to make some small adjustment to its velocity. For a prograde Mun orbit insertion a small amount of additional prograde velocity should make the rocket stage crash onto the Mun ahead of the payload which will go around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/2h6ysy8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222h6ysy8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/24dius5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002224dius5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, base assembly is going to require you having mastered pin point landing. Fortunately these modules usually have a lot of spare delta-V so you have plenty of time hovering and get the landing right. Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worry too much about getting it spot on, as long as it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s within say 2km of the base it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s good enough.

All the modular base parts have a bottom facing docking port and this rover has an upward facing one designed for docking with them. To get the cover underneath, first decouple the bottom rocket engine via the decouple option on the docking port. Then drive the rover underneath and ram the rocket engine out of the way. Once you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re under the module you will feel the magnetic attraction pulling on your rover. Commonly this shows as a rocking motion that pulls and pushes your rover back and forth. Counter this motion using your motor and eventually the rover will settle down dead centre underneath the module. At this point switch to the module and hit G to retract the landing legs and the module will sit down right on top of the rover and merge with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/2usa79h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222usa79h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here we have the new docking bay sitting on top of our Base Crawler, now it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time to get rid of all the rocket bits. Most of these modular base parts have a landing system that can be jettisoned once the piece is safely on top of the crawler. Most of the time this part contains the only probe core on the module so do not jettison the landing system until the module is safely on top of the crawler or else you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be able to retract the landing legs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway in this case the landing equipment with the RCS systems and NTR and so on have a small SRB powered separation, so hit staging and it will shoot off, you may want to switch to this part and use the RCS to tilt it so it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fall straight back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/xfd9qc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xfd9qc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re ready to deliver the module to the base. Each modular piece will have at least one horizontally aligned docking port that will be exactly level with all the other modular pieces when the landing leg is deployed. So what you would do is simply drive the rover around so that this docking port is brushing against an available docking port on the base. Now there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a problem here - if your module is heavy it will squash down on the rover\u0027s suspension and make the docking port lower by a bit. Add to this the little drop you get when you drop the module onto the rover and you\u0027ll usually end up a situation where the docking port on the piece you\u0027re trying to dock is lower than the available docking port on the base. Fortunately there is a simple way to get around this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/24zd64x.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002224zd64x.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you do is park your module right up against the docking port, switch to the base and raise the landing struts on the structures (usually that means legs on base truss) closest to your new module. This causes that section to droop down a bit due to gravity. And during its downward travel if it goes low enough it will find the docking port on your new module and it will become attached. Then it\u0027s a simple matter of deploying all legs and undock the Base Crawler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/2ns9vll.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222ns9vll.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there we have it, the new rover docking bay delivered to our refinery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that for these modular base components I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve used various members of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33381-0-20-2-Zenith-rocket-family-%28modernised-for-0-20-x-with-perfect-subassembly%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EZenith rocket family\u003C/a\u003E, attached to payload using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38285-0-20-x-Subassembly-Manager\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESubassembly Manager\u003C/a\u003E.

Due to the method of transport on the tunnels, what part would you recommend as being the starting point given the lesser number of probe cores than before? Or would you just advise keeping a base crawler on it until you get permenant probe cores or kerbals so it isn\u0027t tagged as debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually the truss pieces do have probe core, but they don\u0027t have battery so left on its own the core will die after a few minutes. I figure the probe core\u0027s slight drain in power is a good simulation on the need for power to maintain shirt sleeve environment inside the trusses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor first pieces anything with power generation will do, so that\u0027s the Tower of Power, the propellant depot, the stand along extractor, the tracking station. A base crawler or a crawler transporter will work too. Von Braun City actually landed with two loads of truss pieces (not including the Y truss) first before any modules and I linked those up and kept them alive by leaving a base crawler attached (I had two on site for assembly). Remember though the actual landing equipment for these modules generally have RTGs equipped, so they can stay alive indefinitely as long as you keep those landing equipments. If you\u0027re landing modules at your landing site but don\u0027t have truss pieces or base crawlers ready to assemble them then just keep the landing equipment attached until you are ready to start assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/oidlif.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oidlif.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding first module to the start of Von Braun City.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-26T23:44:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2013 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T23:39:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThankyou.

But then I thought more about this and you do have a point. Say for sample we have a mountain top base on Eve for launching harvested Blutonium and colonists. Instead of having two classes of rockets one for people and one for refined nuclear fuel, we could just have one rocket designed to lift X tons back into orbit and then have two different sets of payload modules lying around.
