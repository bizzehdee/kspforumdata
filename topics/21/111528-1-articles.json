I have it rigged so the bottom orange tank drains first, then to top. This keeps the weight in the front of the ship the entire flight and helps counteract the offset thrust from the skipper. \n\nFull throttle off the pad. Launch is the new standard, turn a few degrees right of the pad and it almost flies itself to space. Usually just minimal input is needed to keep it on course. The SRBs stage ~8km. From there its a gentle turn and climb to space. \n\nIt gets a little unstable as the last of the fuel drains out of the orange tank and it isn\u0027t heavy enough to help keep the nose down. The last ~500 units of fuel in the orange tank the ship wants to pitch up. I put a vernor to help out that last bit, but its the only time you need it (along with some light throttling). \n\n 2.9k dV is enough to get to minmus, mun, or anywhere else in Kerbin\u0027s SOI and return. I\u0027ve rescued multiple kerbals in one go with this ship.\n\nRe-entry is super easy. This thing has so much surface area you can come in a little \u0027belly up\u0027 and it slows down quickly. She glides to a gentle touchdown every time. I\u0027m rather proud of her balance. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThe shuttle was built in the SPH then imported to VAB. \n\nTo get the thrust right, the Skipper has been rotated 1 Shift-click notch on the rotation gizmo. \n\nTo get the fuel flow right, it has a fuel line from the top tank to the shuttle, and from the bottom of the shuttle directly to the Skipper.\n\nYou can even replace a Mk2 fuel tank with a Mk2 cargo bay and it can carry a small payload to space. I\u0027ve found I can play around with the number of cockpits and cargo bays with some decent variation of ships and equally similar/easy launches.\n\nI even have a mini shuttle version using FL-T800 tanks with a Swivel as the core stage.\n\nIt is possible and I hope this inspires you! Its super rewarding to build a shuttle-like craft. Enjoy!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/ww3g0)\n\nHere is a dropbox link to the craft file.

Let me know if it doesn\u0027t work and enjoy the ship!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T18:32:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MadChris48**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lime","CreatedById":137978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T19:09:11Z","Content":"Awesome rep for you!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T19:11:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lime**"}]}
