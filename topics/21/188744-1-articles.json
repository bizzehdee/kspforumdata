This was done to help achieve liftoff on the run way; when full, the craft was too unstable for me to fly properly X3 You might want to take this into account if you decide to refuel and take off on Kerbin.

Refueling takes awhile, even with stock speed up set to max! It does hit 4,000 delta V around halfway through refueling, so you can lift off partially empty if you know where you want to go, or need more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELift off from Minmus can be kind of tricky, as the craft doesn\u0027t have the reaction wheel strength to pitch up at full fuel, and the craft likes to curve after a while and slam one of it\u0027s wings into the ice!

Long-range SSTOs are really hard. It looks pretty well optimised too, with all that capability only on 2 x Nerv\u00A0and 2 x Rapier. Clever use of Big S tailfins as main lifting surfaces also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome thoughts which may or may not work:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf your target is Minmus, you should be able to get away using just one Nerv. That\u0027ll significantly cut down on your dry mass, improving your efficiency, which might let you add a second command seat for the engineer. You will probably need to get your Kerbin take-off exactly right though, to be able to make orbit with the lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. If you\u0027re\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealmost\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0there, consider adding a small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E/Ox tank: this will let your Rapiers give a final kick of acceleration where it\u0027s needed. This will also help you launch off the airless body: the thrust vectoring from the Rapier will also help pitch your craft up.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYour ore tank is unnecessarily big, since you can process the ore as soon as you get it. If you used a single radial tank instead, that would further cut down dry mass.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you dropped one of the drills and put the remaining one inside a Mk 1 utility bay, that would further cut down your dry mass and improve aerodynamics, making for a more efficient Kerbin launch. (This\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0require a bit of clipping though, so if you consider that cheaty, then don\u0027t do it.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTo help launch in a vacuum, consider adding a secondary landing gear: a medium gear just in front of the centre of mass. When you lower it, it\u00A0will raise the craft to an angle. Combine this with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002BOx tank that lets you kick out of there with the Rapier, and I think you\u0027ll find vacuum take-off much easier.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pacca","CreatedById":194084,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-08T17:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks! I really appreciate it ^w^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nA lot of my early designs actually tried to get away with one nerv! Unfortunately, these ones always ended up stalling at about 50,000 meters, then falling back down, usually burning up if I tried to keep pushing them...

Even besides it\u0027s obvious features, it\u0027s ability to function as an airbrake and a crumplezone is nice for any craft, let alone a multipurpose one.
