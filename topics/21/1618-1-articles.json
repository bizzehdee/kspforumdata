From stage one to stage three (a good 3/4 of the rocket), the rocket is traveling at only a few hundred m/s. Despite that, the burn lasts for so long that the rocket ends up something like 100,000 m away from the planet. By the end of stage 3, the lack of fuel means that the engines are finally pushing a bit more and the rocket is maybe at 2k m/s. Stage four is when the rocket picks up speed rather dramatically; it\u0027ll end up at ~7k m/s. Stage six... Well, I haven\u0027t actually let stage six burn to completion, but I suspect that it\u0027ll go pretty fast. Consider; starting speed is 7k m/s, the rocket is already outside of the planet\u0027s gravity well, and you\u0027ve got three large fuel tanks with 1000 fuel each. On top of that, the engine is a NERVA thruster which means it has a thrust of 100 with a fuel burn of 2. So we\u0027ve got about 25 minutes of burn time at max thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rdfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rdfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would assume it\u0027s not too bad straight up, if you\u0027re gentle with the throttle in the early stages--lord knows how many designs I\u0027ve got where you have to stay below 50% throttle on the first stage to avoid a collapse--but god help you when it comes time for pitchover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither that, or struts (which I haven\u0027t played with much yet) can be used to add additional longitudinal stiffness between, say, decouplers and the stage that they\u0027re jettisoning.

The very slow ascent means you end up well outside the atmosphere but only traveling a few hundred m/s. If you wanted orbit, you could toss away whatever remains of stage 3 before you start to gain any more speed. That means once you\u0027ve discarded the stages 1-3, you\u0027re left with a normal sized rocket with a powerful engine, already outside of the atmosphere, and with only slight vertical velocity. It\u0027s easy to tip it over intentionally and put it into orbit from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the struts, you are correct. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirmonkey","CreatedById":3119,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-14T22:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eany chance you could post the crafts file? i want to screw around and try to actually put this beast into orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-15T01:36:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts cool, it flies, but yes it does look inefficient.
