Many of them have only received accolades from their mothers and smelly Frank down in the processing dept.\n\nThe final spit polish process is wrapping up on the Farnsworth Dragonfly:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128029-Farnsworth-Dragonfly-Pre-Production-Dropship](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128029-Farnsworth-Dragonfly-Pre-Production-Dropship)\n\nI am planning on releasing many of the Farnsworth designs (mining equipment, modular station sections, 4 dropship variants, ssto\u0027s) as soon as we can replenish our spit supply.\n\nThe first generation fuel transport ship had a massive Kraken hidden in the landing gear. Many kerbals were destroyed because of it\u0027s evil. \n\n![MfSpXwU.png](http://i.imgur.com/MfSpXwU.png)![QbQ4ccK.png](http://i.imgur.com/QbQ4ccK.png)\n\n![wOmsVOD.png](http://i.imgur.com/wOmsVOD.png)\n\nWe were able to trigger violent flame filled disassembles with amazing repeatability. Because of these disasters the Farnsworth quality control department was created and now checks are made to verify the anti-explosion-ness of every design that leaves the plant.\n\nHere is a teaser of the Dragon Heavy dropship. Our stalwart pilot is retrieving junk from the surface of Minmus.\n\n![XzLsxs1.png](http://i.imgur.com/XzLsxs1.png)\n\nThe Farnsworth Rocket Surgery \u0026 Rubber Toaster Delivery Inc. storefront will be opening soon! \n\nOur anti-explosion-ness testers are already working double overtime to make sure the designers are not kraken loving idiots.\n\nAlso, need a signature image and advice on where the best place to upload the craft files is (dropbox, google docs, kerbalX)."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T11:52:22Z","Content":"I must add that I too find these babies to be quite beautiful.

Funnily enough I finished it today, came onto KSP forum and found this thread. I launched it as one piece. The lander is parked in the background, just past the hill. It docks to the 4 docking ports. I parked at AT Rabbit (courtesy of Frank\\_G) and my own personal Scout Hovership. Of course, the actual transfer and lander was assembled in orbit. Note I did NOT use cheats or the Hyperedit in the shot. \u002BRep if you like it!\n\nJust so you all know, I launched it in one piece because launching it in bits would be very annoying to assemble on the surface. Also the lander was part Hammer SRB, part Skipper LF\u002BO engines. And it has no more fuel in it (exactly 10.3 units left which will burn in under 2 seconds). So it was a one way trip for those wondering. Its original purpose was actually to serve as a command base for the Duna system.![KO0RYdf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KO0RYdf.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T15:31:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 03:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ryan234abc**"},{"CreatedByName":"ryan234abc","CreatedById":136492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T15:51:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The first generation fuel transport ship had a massive Kraken hidden in the landing gear.
