The external fuel tank has 1 of those 4 engine cluster things. The external fuel tank engine will need to be manually controlled during the flight. The Orbiter has 2 \u0022Skipper\u0022 engines, they have a thrust setting of 74%, this thrust setting is meant for an empty cargo bay, so I highly recommend increasing this before launch when lifting a heavy payload. During launch, let the SAS do the flying, it is very important to watch the pitch indicator. As the rocket becomes unbalanced (as it drains fuel), the SAS will compensate with pitch input. Basically, when the pitch indicator nears full pitch, the SAS is basically saying: \u0022I can\u0027t hold it much longer, do something!\u0022 This is when you need to adjust ET\u0027s (external fuel tank) thrust. I reccomend keeping the window for that engine open during the whole launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow some info on the cargo bay: The doors work by undocking from the shuttle, but they are held in place by some structural things, so hey shouldn\u0027t float away (hopefully). Once undocked, you can switch focus to them ([/]), and then open/close them with the yaw controls. Since they are now separate crafts, DO NOT timewarp, exit to the KSC Menu, focus on a craft over 2.5 Km away, etc. Close them first. When closing the doors, simply rotate them back to the docking ports. Note that there are docking ports in BOTH the front and back of each door. Sometimes the back ports may not dock, if this happens, try opening and closing them again. Leaving the door\u0027s SAS off seems to help with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cockpit lights can be toggled with \u00225.\u0022 The main cockpit is tilted down 5 degrees, this helps the pilots see out the windows during landing. Also there is extra crew storage below the cockpit in a MK2 Crew container. It is only accessible with the crew transfer, so you will have to clip the camera into the nose to click the hatch and enable crew transfer (You CAN just click \u0022EVA,\u0022 but warranty void if you do this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAction Groups:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Toggle Two Main \u0022Skipper\u0022 thrusters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Toggle OMS NERVAs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Undock cargo bay doors (usually needs to be pressed twice to fully undock)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Open/Close Docking Port (Located Under Cockpit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Cockpit Lights (Because why not?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbort: This shuttle actually has an abort!
