It is the first of my designs to feature an unpowered return vehicle. After main booster separation, propulsion is provided by an OMS (linear RCS thrusters). The orbiter carries a fuel module for the OMS in the rear that is jettisoned after the de-orbit burn. The key feature in this OMS fuel module is that additional RCS tanks can be added to increase mission flexibility.\n\nNote that this craft does not yet have regular RCS thrusters. The reasons for this is (1) there is no ability yet to disable RCS thrusters that you don\\\u0027t intend to use at the time, and (2) docking is not yet implemented. You can, of course, add them on, but they will chew through a good amount of fuel when you use the OMS.\n\n**Flight Instructions**\n\n**Important:** The craft will tumble out of control during the ascent if you point the nose too far from the prograde vector (the control limit is quite small starting out and increases as with altitude).\n\nTurn the ASAS on and begin your ascent. Roll your craft to have your \u0027up\u0027 be in line with the desired orbital direction. **Do all the maneuvers by holding the corresponding directional key and tapping \u0027f\u0027.**\n\nBegin the gravity turn at 5km. Do this by bringing the nose (dot of the artificial wings on the navball) to the edge of the prograde marker circle.\n\nExample-ish:\n\n![screenshot34x.png](http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/5820/screenshot34x.png)\n\nKeep pointing the nose like this until you get to around 30\u00C2\u00B0 (it won\\\u0027t really matter after that). Keep the nose within the prograde circle for the rest of the ascent.\n\nYou should be at around 36-40km and nearly 5\u00C2\u00B0 above the horizon when the main boosters cut out. AP will be around 80km and decreasing.\n\nUse the OMS to get the rest of the way into orbit.\n\nDe-orbit:\n\nI have accomplished successful arrival at KSC from 80km by putting my PE at 43km above KSC.\n\nJettison the OMS fuel pack after de-orbit burn.\n\nTrajectory can be controlled to a certain extend during re-entry.\n\nLanding:\n\nThis craft is very stable in flight and glides well. You should have no problem setting up your final approach.\n\nThe parachute must be used once you touch down. Failure to do so will result in flipping and destruction of the vehicle (it would be nice if we could brake only with the back wheels).\n\nGood luck to all pilots who gives this a try.\n\n[http://youtu.be/L6NR2VUYSmU](https://youtu.be/L6NR2VUYSmU)\n\nBelow are some screenshots showing parts of my most recent test flight.
