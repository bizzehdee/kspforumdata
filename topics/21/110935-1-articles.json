I did no Orbital docking, I lifted it up without fuel (40 tons), and refueled it in orbit instead. The entire process cost about 1.000.000 funds, out of which 600.000 alone was spent refueling the damn thing (Which I intend to remedy for future launches by building a minmus refueling Ore station)\n\nComments/Suggestions?"}]}
