Kethane pack had been a extremely popular pack in KSP, and rigs are more than common crafts used to extract it. So, here i make a common space for all kethane miners to share their rigs and planetary scanner crafts. If you have any, please post pics and tell us all about it. craft file recommended. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy crafts: The small and large miner tandem. (will get you guys pics soon) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small miner is a light vehicle that acts as a miner and a scanner. It uses 2 radial drills and is equipped with a medium scanner. Field experiments prove that they are effective and versatile. They can drain huge fields on the moon if used correctly and well. The large miner is a unmanned miner used to mine away tonnes of kethane and process it in one go. It has docking capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T01:00:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy Mun kethane mining base in my sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img856/833/quv1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022quv1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESVO-9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img707/5342/yq40.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yq40.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img39/9476/ahr0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ahr0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img59/7402/2frx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222frx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have more, but not anything I haven\u0027t already posted.

But I am finding that the bigger more robust craft I built earlier in the line, like the SVO-9A that is pictured leaving Ike in my previous post, was one of my best if not complex designs. There was literally nothing it couldn\u0027t do. But it was horribly unstable on re-entry with Kerbins atmosphere due to its short design. I may go back and improve on the concept with a longer more stable design and attempt another shot at Ike and Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T07:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...
