rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EFebruary 28th\u003C/a\u003E is finally gaining some practical application. \u00A0This project has languished in perpetual development since then because \u003Cstrong\u003E1)\u003C/strong\u003E I set some pretty high performance objectives, and \u003Cstrong\u003E2)\u003C/strong\u003E I was stuck in a bit of an archaic design methodology. \u00A0The original goal was to design a new interplanetary \u0022EV-X\u0022 ship to go to (at a minimum) the Joolian \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and return without refueling. \u00A0There were a lot of other requirements I mandated for myself as well, including but not limited to robust and redundant systems, while still maintaining modularity like my EV-4 \u0027Longship\u0027 variants. \u00A0The problem was it was going to be so logistically cumbersome (and costly in a career save)\u00A0to launch and assemble given all the components, that I found myself resorting to figuring out ways to adapt the EV-4 system for Jool instead. \u00A0While the EV-4 \u0027Longship\u0027 Modular Exploration Vehicle or MEV system is nice for going to and from places...that\u0027s really all it was designed to do. \u00A0Load a bunch of fuel tanks with a handful\u00A0LV-N engines, put some cargo or a crew section on the front, and send it on it\u0027s merry way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s when I realized that \u0022modular\u0022 didn\u0027t necessarily mean \u0022multipurpose\u0022 within my current building style. \u00A0The EV-4\u0027s could be reconfigured based on their destination, making them \u0022multi-mission\u0022 and reusable to transport crews/cargo to/from Duna, or Eve, or anywhere else provided you had enough delta-V strapped on. \u00A0So, I scrapped my \u0022EV-X\u0022 project and instead drew up a new project called M3V, or Modular, Multimission, Multipurpose\u00A0Vehicle system. \u00A0It\u0027s not so much a singular exploration vehicle like the previous EV craft I\u0027ve built, it really is a \u0022system\u0022 of multiple\u00A0craft. \u00A0Whether or not it\u0027s successful for a Joolian level expedition, I have no idea at the moment. \u00A0How many different craft or subassemblies will end up being part of the project, I have no idea either. \u00A0But bottom line, it\u0027s gaining maturity, I\u0027ve got some craft already being tested;\u00A0now I just have to make sure I can squeeze out as much potential as I can. \u00A0I\u0027m excited to see where I can take

However, rather than space tugs with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, you instead have several identical rover bases with a few docking ports in useful positions. Each rover base should be fairly minimalistic, limited to just the wheels, a single command seat or probe core, basic power generation, and the superstructure holding it together. Then the rovers can connect to surface base modules using docking ports (surface docking can of course be made much easier with clever use of landing gear, as I\u0027m sure you\u0027re aware by this point). Using this sort of system you can minimize the types of modules you have to land somewhere while still having it be quite multipurpose, because you\u0027d be able to change what the rovers do without having to send entirely new rovers (and you could also drive your entire surface base somewhere else if needed). I\u0027m sure it could lead to some interesting design challenges, but such a modular base system would probably be far better suited to a multi-purpose exploration system like the one you\u0027re designing rather than having several rovers and base modules with specific functions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-21T03:40:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223153573\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291595\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221503285428\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160814\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eloquentJane\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, eloquentJane said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[snip]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeh heh, I guess what I meant to say was:\u00A0 My rovers are only rovers, and my surface base modules\u00A0are only surface base modules.\u00A0 As opposed to a large lander that is also a mini-base, like my LV-1C or LV-2C, or a wheeled rover that has some rocket engines\u00A0on it so it can also be a lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, I never thought about doing it the way you describe. \u00A0I\u0027m doing it the inverse way at the moment; using rovers to attach\u00A0to and drag the larger surface base modules behind it like a trailer. \u00A0I think the main obstacles to doing it like you say (without a longer engineering \u0022thought ponderance\u0022) is that I always try to make my IVA\u0027s make sense. \u00A0The mobile lab piece\u00A0needs to stand up, since that\u0027s the orientation of the inside compartments.\u00A0 I like the look of the IVA\u0027s, and it would drive\u00A0me nuts to have the IVA\u0027s laying on there side. \u00A0I really wish there was a second set of Hitchhiker and lab modules that had sideways IVA\u0027s to make surface bases more like\u00A0real-life concepts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other personal obstacle is I hate long drives. \u00A0Not only for the boredom piece, but also because I\u0027ll inevitably get impatient, speed up, and wreck. \u00A0I know, F5 helps, but what can I say. \u00A0Which is why I design \u0022flyers\u0022. \u00A0I have a prototype Duna flyer that looks like the Rutan Voyager, but it\u0027s still a long way from working the way I want. \u00A0I\u0027m still a relative newbie when it comes to Duna surface ops. \u00A0But thanks for that idea, I might be able to incorporate some of that into my rover family.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-21T10:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be designing modular surface vehicles similar to those that I described at some point in the somewhat-near future most likely.
