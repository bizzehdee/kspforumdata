This is my pride and joy for the past couple weeks. Sure, it doesn\u0026#39;t handle as well as I would like, and it does have a wobble problem at low speeds (under 90 m/s), but it still looks strikingly like the real thing. I hope you guys can give me more advice toward improving this plane, and I\u0026#39;ll post extra craft files for more updated versions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[imgur]jS3jC[/imgur]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for the performance, the handling is a little too oversensitive for my taste, but some of you may like that. As said in the album, action group 1 will turn on the lights, change the gear lighting, and raise the ladders. Beware that brakes turns on thrust reversal for the jet engines, so make sure you aren\u0026#39;t flying backwards.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5TV3aouslKzd3VZZ01pRmZoeVk/view?usp=sharing\u0022]DOWNLOAD HERE (DRIVE LINK)[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://www./download/ywi6ix8tueeht93/Learjet_K7.craft\u0022]DOWNLOAD HERE (MEDIAFIRE LINK)[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHope everyone likes it, and if you do, let me know by slapping dat rep button!
