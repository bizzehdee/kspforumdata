Capable of 160 m/s on land (576 Kph), 90 m/s on water (324 Kph), and 100 m/s in the air (360 Kph), it is truly an all terrain vehicle.\n\n![MaHgkhL.png](http://i.imgur.com/MaHgkhL.png)\n\nWhen retracting its gear, the *Spirion II* has no problems, but careful when extending them! It does experience a bit of glitching, but modifications have been made to keep this effect to a minimum.\n\n**Instruction Manual:**\n\n1 - Toggle Extra Intakes. The *Spirion II* has a large number of intakes when it only requires one to operate. This feature seems to be buggy (Sometimes it doesn\u0027t work)\n\nHave SAS on at all times. When in rover mode, the only keys you really need to use are Q and E to control its roll. You may want to keep it pitched down just a bit to stop it from flying into the air. Limit downwards velocity to under 10 m/s for safe impacts. Even on moderately hilly terrain, full throttle is possible. Your own judgement is the *Spirion II*\u0027s speed limit. 160 m/s is generally safe. Warranty void if craft is piloted parallel to a slope.\n\n![jeIlWQU.png](http://i.imgur.com/jeIlWQU.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2PDRf7q.png](http://i.imgur.com/2PDRf7q.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E To take off, accelerate to top speed on water, and over 100 m/s on land. Gently and slowly pull up. It can take a few seconds to get airborne, but it will get there.\n\u003E \n\u003E To land, keep the engine **ON** for now: high speed is the only way to keep it flying. When you are close to the ground, (100-200 meters) pitch up so that you have 0 vertical speed. Extend the gear if you haven\u0027t already, and then cut the engine with X and click the Brakes button on the HUD to engage the airbrakes. (Optionally, you can hold B, but the button is much easier.) Keep your nose up so that you hit the ground as level as possible, at around 30 m/s surface speed. \n\u003E \n\u003E **It is possible to land on water in the** ***Spirion II.*** You do not need the gear out for this.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![GlyIvXt.png](http://i.imgur.com/GlyIvXt.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E To go on water, enter the water at under 25 m/s, the slower, the better. Raise the gear and ladder if you need to. You can go to full throttle at first, but limit your speed to 90 m/s or so. Faster speeds are untested. SAS should be on.\n\u003E \n\u003E To exit water, slow to under 25 meters per second. The *Spirion II*\u0027s airbrakes will help immensely (Activate with the B key or the Brakes button). Deploy gear and thrust to get back on dry land.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n[**Download the CRN-05** ***Spirion II***](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xx5yz5wuou7lp4f/CRN-05%20Spirion%20II.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:15:16Z","Content":"Wow.
