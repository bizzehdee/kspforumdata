It\u0027s not fuel-efficient, it\u0027s not pretty and it has other various shortcomings, but you can do pretty much anything with it. I use it when I don\u0027t want to spend an hour designing a rocket for a specific purpose with a reasonable amount of delta V - so I\u0027ve pretty much tested everything with it simply by exchanging to topmost stage (except for sundiving). Also: the solid thrusters aren\u0027t really necessary, but they give me an insane amount of fuel for ironing out all those (smaller and larger) piloting mistakes I make in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a quick guide on how to get to Minmus easily:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Ignite and wait for the solid rockets burn out. There might be some roll while the SRBs are still on, but don\u0027t panic, that\u0027ll stop once you\u0027ve gotten rid of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) At about 10km start tilting towards 90 degrees. You should pretty much hit the horizon on the navball when you\u0027re at about 50 - 60 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Burn towards the horizon at 90 degrees until the first liquid stage runs out. Kill the throttle (because the central engine will still be running) and coast to apoapsis (which should be somewhere around 200 km after this maneuver).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Tilt your orbit to match the inclination of Minmus\u0027 orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) When Minmus is somewhere around 7 or 8 o\u0027cklock raise your apoapsis until you get a Minmus encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Choose a landing site (if it\u0027s your first landing preferrably on of the things that look like an ocean) and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) At this point you should still have your second liquid stage (the one you started circularization with). You can use it to brake an begin the descent. At about 500 m you can toss it and use the lander the rest of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) When you return to Kerbin there should still be like half a tank of fuel left. You won\u0027t be able to make a powered landing, but a parachute\u0027s good enough for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said simply exchanging the top stage makes this my multipurpose tool. I\u0027ve done several Mun and Minmus landings, used it as a rover, rendezvous(...ed?) with my space station and escaped and returned to Kerbin. Let me know if this works for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"labency","CreatedById":43564,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T04:28:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks! i post my results\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
