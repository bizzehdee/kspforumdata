When modified for cargo duty, it can orbit cargo at just $320/ tonne.\n\n\\* The combination of light weight (36t), airbrakes, and ample jet fuel reserves means a positive recovery on the runway at KSC the first time, every time!\n\nIt\u0027s Adobe!

At 70 m/s airspeed, pitch up to 8\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Warning: Do not exceed 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until airborne\n\u003E \n\u003E  Climbout: At positive climb rate, retract gear and throttle up to full. Pitch up to 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\n\u003E \n\u003E  Going supersonic: At 10km altitude, pitch to 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and maintain until 360 m/s airspeed\n\u003E \n\u003E  Going hypersonic: At 16km altitude, pitch to 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and maintain until climb rate is reestablished. Let the nose pitch slowly on it\u0027s own until airspeed is no longer increasing (usually around 20km altitude and 1km/sec airspeed)\n\u003E \n\u003E  Boost to orbital apoapsis: When airspeed is no longer increasing, hit spacebar to engage the Poodle and pitch to 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Maintain pitch and full throttle until 2,050 m/sec airspeed is achieved. Throttle as necessary to achieve 75km apoapsis.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Boost to orbit: At 5 seconds from Apoapsis, boost and pitch as required to achieve stable orbit.\n\u003E \n\u003E Orbital ops: Press 1 to toggle orbit mode. This will deploy the solar panels, turn on the lights, deploy the docking collar, and turn on the docking light.\n\u003E \n\u003E -------------------------------------------------------\n\u003E \n\u003E Deorbit retroburn:\n\u003E \n\u003E  Orient the spacecraft retrograde and inverted. When opposite KSC, burn and pitch as needed to establish periapsis at 45km altitude directly overhead KSC.\n\u003E \n\u003E  After retroburn, pitch to point the nose straight down, disable the Poodle, hit the parking brakes to deploy the airbrake, and hit 1 to secure from orbit mode. \n\u003E \n\u003E Reentry:\n\u003E \n\u003E  Maintain 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch throughout the reentry. Pitch and turn as desired to deorbit overhead KSC.\n\u003E \n\u003E Approach: Ensure that Poodle is deactivated and release parking brakes to deactivate airbrakes. Throttle to 4 tics for cruise. Deploy landing gear below 100 m/sec and fly a normal approach to flare and touchdown.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-19T20:43:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2015 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T00:01:57Z","Content":"Looks interesting!

Everything from the engine combo to the downturned intakes has been done before by others.
