Every one of our vehicles is taken through a comprehensive testing process to ensure maximum functionality, usability, safety, and cost effectiveness. This process has drastically cut down not only on unintended deceleration via lithobraking, but has dropped the rate of airlock incidents by 1.2% compared to the earliest days of the space program.\n\n**SPACEPLANE CATALOG**\n\n**SORTED BY FUNCTION**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Only innovative quality is the simplicity of the drive system- a single KR-2L is all that is used, and as such it can complete burns faster than almost all of its nuclear or ion-powered rivals. Has enough delta-V and the TWR to, even when fully laden with craft, theoretically land on the Mun itself and return to Kerbin without bothering to mine ore and convert it into fuel. However, as the craft is incredibly long and top-heavy, this is disadvised. Class is currently being run through its paces around Kerbin\u0027s moons by one Mr. J. Kerman and company, so we will apply knowledge gained from that to future classes of Grand Tour Vehicle. [Craft file is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4yds67crdhzolf3/Calypso%20Mk_%20II.craft?dl=0).\n\n![PpEUIMa.png](http://i.imgur.com/PpEUIMa.png)\n\n**- \u0022ROVING FORTRESS ADZAM\u0022 CLASS**\n\nStill somewhat parts-heavy grand tour architecture, but requires one launch only. Parts count reduces to semi-manageable level once into LKO with all rockets discarded. Is also the only known Grand Tour vehicle that lands as a whole rover, drives around, mines ore, converts it into fuel, then blasts off to the next location. With a chassis and suspension designed by the world-renowned Vagani car manufacturers, it.... probably... won\u0027t break one of its massive XL3 wheels at an inopportune time. In case that happens, the Roving Fortress Adzam has a KIS/KAS workshop suite complete with materials to build a hoist so you can perform manual repairs, as well as build a miniature rover and four ore scanning sats, complete with engine to push themselves into the required orbit. Represents the state of the art in near-stock grand tour vehicles. As such, it exists in [core form](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gt8bm8njfux6xg9/Roving%20Fortress%20Adzam%20Mk_%202%20%28Chassisless%29%20%28KISKAS%20Dependent%29.craft?dl=0) only while Vagani take their time to perfect the suspension and chassis setup. Trust us, we tried doing the chassis ourselves... it tended to self-destruct whenever it turned left.\n\n**- \u0022HOWL\u0027S MOVING CASTLE\u0022 CLASS**\n\nThe second grand tour rover known to exist within Kerbal Space Program. This version is a massive improvement upon the Roving Fortress Adzam, having started with the same mission brief but a \u0022clean sheet\u0022 design. Part count and mass is half that of the Roving Fortress Adzam, but delta-V is equal and TWR unchanged. As such, it\u0027s a little less capable of self-repair and completely incapable of flinging little autonomous ore scanning satellites, but those with computers incapable of controlling 200-part rovers will probably not begrudge this. The Howl\u0027s Moving Castle class represents the future of grand touring, and is currently undergoing an intensive research and development program and not available to the public at this stage.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T19:12:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kagame**"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T23:41:53Z","Content":"Quite a handful of crafts here ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Not bad for a start ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
