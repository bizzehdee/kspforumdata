(this you can adapt if you get the craft file)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater, I thought this would serve well as a mobile base, still asking for a little exploration vehicle. Then the RAMROD came up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on designs from about three months ago, the thing got better due to kethane, along with what I call the Grasshopper. A little exploratory pod, able to take off from the Ramrod and go to... explore something else...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you can land, explore, drill for kethane and keep on going with the beast for further data recollecting. The ramrod is designed for small gravity worlds, you drill kethane, convert and jump to other location of interest with the grasshopper attached on top (for balance reasons, for it was to be placed on the back observation platform)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch system is the same a fellow KSPlayer designed version of MOLAB from NASA. (Respect!!!) I just don\u0027t remember the dude\u0027s name right now.There is one thing though, while on take off, you\u0027ll have to pay attention to the stages, as they\u0027re not in the correct order (My bad). I\u0027d try to correct them but I don\u0027t have the time right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: The pictures do not correspond perfectly with the final product. Some improvements were made, for better use, and not tested (But for sure they are better...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE 2: Test the thing. All the major work is done, you just have to tweak a bit with the parts for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file (mod version): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/xtjaihhy06cdtj9/Jump%20M%26E%20Rover%20Ramrod.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xtjaihhy06cdtj9/Jump%20M%26E%20Rover%20Ramrod.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTOCK (What the heck!), with Hitch-hiker Module (415 parts) : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8yqxx0xjkbtu9b/Jump%20Explorer%20Rover%20Ramrod%20STOCK.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/q8yqxx0xjkbtu9b/Jump%20Explorer%20Rover%20Ramrod%20STOCK.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts: 419\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: Kethane pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunching: Pretty much the same, gravity turn started on 10 000m (or even a bit more, say... 13 to 15 thousand) to 45 degrees then circularize and... there you go. After that, you\u0027ll have to pay attention to the external tanks on the Ramrod, these wil get you to the moon or minmus, but when these are empty, you can jettison them to carry less load and a better performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to put questions or suggestions, friends. I think this is the best I\u0027ve ever made and I have also a Stock version aboard (without kethane though, you can\u0027t refuel your grasshopper).
