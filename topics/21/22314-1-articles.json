I run a pretty decent computer (3.6ghz quad, 16gb ram, radeon 7970) and was still getting roughly 4-5 fps during the final stages of construction. What originally started out as a design for a simple refueling station in orbit became something entirely different. My first design failed miserably due to flimsy structure integrity during launch, and even though Jebediah thought nothing wrong of that, I was determined to have a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Erkle isn\u0027t the most reliable mod for clamping while warping/resuming games, sending the modules piece by piece was unreliable. Once I discovered persistence editing, that opened up all sorts of creative ideas. Finally I was able to send massive, single stations to orbit without the need to design them to be launchable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA side-shot of the station:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SDXDw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SDXDw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few small modules at the intersection where the beams meet, mainly used in extravehicular repairs and EVA\u0027s alike. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Base of Operations\u0022 section:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ju3ns.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ju3ns.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll notice the only thing non-symmetrical about the station is the different modules I used between the left and right. The right section houses all of the living quarters and necessities that Kerbins would need to live. The left section contains all of the scientific equipment used in gathering information - including a greenhouse and a powerful telescope! Both sections also have long-range radio equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELying perpendicular in both directions are the refueling stations. The station in its entirety holds 8,800L in RCS monopropellant and 18,000L in rocket biopropellant - plenty of fuel to get any ship short of a freighter back en-route.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k4yKC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k4yKC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, flipping the whole thing over to show you the engines - 12 ion engines, 6 on each end of the solar panel beams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few things to note:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Most obviously, this was never meant to be \u0022launched\u0022 from the ground. Use persistance editing. If you don\u0027t know what that is, no problem. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://tinyurl.com/92efuql\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s how\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: I have yet to test the capabilities of the add-ons that were used in this build. I know mechjeb works, but I have yet to test the refueling capabilities, or the use of the solar panels in recharging the batteries that the ion engines use. Technically, everything should work. Please share any feedback on any problems you have!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: The whole station has it\u0027s own supply of RCS fuel - Separate from the tanks used to refill other ships. It is incredibly massive in both size and weight, but this also gives it the advantage of being incredibly stable in ATT. Because the RCS fuel it has for itself is limited, I would only recommend using it to aim the ion engines for transitions and orbit corrections. (Less you don\u0027t mind dipping into the larger tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the list of add-ons that I\u0027ve used (The list might be incomplete, but I\u0027ll fix it up tomorrow [with hyperlinks]) :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb (autopilot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EORDA beta (docking/refueling)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EzKreuzung (electrical)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExPI Stations Pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKosmos Spacecraft Design Bureau - Space Station Parts 4.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechanical Mouse Industries Satellite Pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovaPunch Remix Pack (?

My guess is that even though the ion engines are fairly weak, it doesn\u0027t help that the whole structure needs to be stabilized in order for it to be effective. I might try changing the strengths of certain modules/pieces and adding struts to the structure in order to prevent it from going absolutely hay-wire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-17T03:30:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2012 03:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Rizz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kanharn","CreatedById":52914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-16T11:21:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery Nice.
