It is a two stage to orbit spaceplane but fully recoverable. \n\nIt is fully stock and only needs tech level 4 plane parts and full tech level 3, as well as only level 1 buildings. So very useful for career mode.\n\nCosts for orbit with a recovery mod are only 766 funds. I don\u0027t know if you can do this cheaper with this tech level.\n\nI\u0027m glad to hear what you think about it ;-) .\n\nHere\u0027s the video (with some further information):\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hi0umfBRh4Y?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T07:52:34Z","Content":"Very impressive! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
