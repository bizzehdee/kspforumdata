I wanted something I could reuse to bring the plane back to Kerbin and land.\n\nSo I came up with this, and I call it \u0022The Roamer\u0022\n\n[![QGHz9pIh.png](http://i.imgur.com/QGHz9pIh.png)](http://imgur.com/QGHz9pI)\n\nIt\u0027s mostly stock except for the Lightbulb nuclear engine from Atomic Age to prevent clustering a bunch of Nervas, and Quantum Struts to keep the docked plane steady. The way I set it up keeps the CoT behind the CoM nicely when the plane is docked. And the torque of the MK3 cockpit is enough to keep it flying straight even with the plane undocked.\n\n[![OBIuzy5.png](http://i.imgur.com/OBIuzy5.png)](http://imgur.com/OBIuzy5)\n\n[![p6eBkZE.png](http://i.imgur.com/p6eBkZE.png)](http://imgur.com/p6eBkZE)\n\n[![vAhP7NO.png](http://i.imgur.com/vAhP7NO.png)](http://imgur.com/vAhP7NO)\n\nI have more than enough dV to get to Duna and back. My next trial will be to get to get to more than one surface in one trip. The plane itself glides down nicely into the atmosphere with no heating thanks to the airbrakes.\n\nI have another design in the works as well. Anyone else have some piggy-back designs to post up?\n\nEDIT: The spaceplane and the roamer are launched into orbit almost empty using rockets. The plane doesn\u0027t have any air breathing engines so SSTO isn\u0027t an option. I have an orbital refueling ship around Minmus to fill them up.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nCraft file [download from MediaFire](http://www./download/vg29yxq324t3g30/Roamer.craft)\n\nRequired mod : [Atomic Age](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104855-1-0-Atomic-Age-Nuclear-Rockets)\n\nRequired mod : [Quantum Struts Continued](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93818-1-0-QuantumStrutsContinued-1-3-Magical-Struts-for-Rigidifying-Outside-the-VAB!)\n\nAction Groups:\n\n1-Toggle LANTERN engines on plane (Note that the engine has 2 modes available)\n\n2-Toggle Aerospike engines on plane\n\n3-Toggle Lightbulb engine on transfer ship\n\nDon\u0027t forget to disable crossfeed on the docking port so that the plane\u0027s tanks don\u0027t get emptied by the transfer ship. Transfer ship has over 5600 dV and should get you almost anywhere you need to go and back.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T04:15:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 04:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xtoro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yellowburn10","CreatedById":107558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T01:22:30Z","Content":"Wow, that\u0027s a pretty unique design right there!
