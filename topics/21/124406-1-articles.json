With a Max speed of 21.8 M/S on the ground and a airspeed of 118M/S at 100M this can move fast. When you are flying don\u0027t do any extreme or sudden movements or it may flip in air but it is great at recovering from flips. When taking off you need to lower the gears below 60M/S or the wheels with break. It can hold 1 kerbal but you can fit more on if you want.
