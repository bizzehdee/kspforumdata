Real Men need two and a half stages just to get into orbit, and blow up on the pad *at least* 75% of the time\\*. This is a Real Man\\\u0027s rocket. At least, that\\\u0027s the story I\\\u0027m sticking to if anyone ever asks me why I designed this thing.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, my first ever uploaded spacecraft (so forgive me the text-walling), the imaginatively named Mk.50/G \u0027Major\u0027!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Mk50.png](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4915761/Mk50.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Design principle: \u0027It seemed like a good idea at the time\u0027. \n\u003E \n\u003E No pictures of the full thing under power: I have no idea what would happen if I tried a screenshot, but it\\\u0027d probably make it explode.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\*I\\\u0027ve actually fixed the 75% thing, but it\\\u0027s good advertising. Kerbonauts queue around the block to fly this thing...\n\u003E \n\u003E That said, probably at least 30% of the 113\u002B struts on the first stage aren\\\u0027t actually needed: I put them there before I worked out what was making the rocket explode. Removing them (and excess crud like ASAS modules that don\\\u0027t do anything) and adding in extra tanks would increase performance drastically.....but removing \\*any\\* of the required ones will result in a fireball.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nThundering off the pad (usually) on the strength of 9 LVT-30 engines at full power and 12 SRB\\\u0027s, the Mk.50 series is unstable until very late in the first-stage firing, even with ~12 extra ASAS units on the first stage acting purely as ballast to stop it toppling. Keep them turned on, and it should stay upright. There\\\u0027s probably a more efficient way to do that, but taking them out makes it topple and/or explode, so I\\\u0027m keeping them. RCS below 19,000m can cause interesting crashes, as can disengaging ASAS while the first stage is still full of fuel. That said, RCS is usually a must-have-turned-on just before the first stage runs out of fuel, otherwise it overloads the ASAS and topples...although I \\*may\\* have fixed this with the /G varient. I\\\u0027m not brave enough to test it though.\n\nIf you have a laptop, this rocket will hate you. Mine literally *cannot* launch a Mk.50 unless it\\\u0027s launched as soon as KSP is opened. One shot. If it fails, I have to shut down the program and restart. Otherwise, it will collapse and blow up on the pad. Which isn\\\u0027t a fast process, but it\\\u0027s fun to watch.\n\nIt also breaks the altimeter on my computer 100% of the times it actually launches: I usually get it into orbit using the map screen to judge my altitude, then exit and come back to the flight to reset it. So if you\\\u0027re on a slower computer....this probably isn\\\u0027t the rocket for you.\n\n\u003E ![screenshot2.png](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4915761/screenshot2.png)\n\u003E Wilton, Ronnand and Thomnie were later killed when their command craft smashed into terrain on return to kerbal at the blistering speed of 12.8m/s. May their souls rest in peace. \n\nThe Major has five stages\u002Ba set of decouplers under the first stage engines to keep it intact on the pad (really, it should have three stages, but I goofed in the design), and is designed to get you to the Mun and back again. For all the...ah....questionable design decisions, it actually does this pretty well. I use it for direct-descent landings straight from an elliptical kerbal orbit, but it\\\u0027s probably good if you go from munar orbit. First stage (once those boosters are out of the way) takes you up to a bit over 20,000m (unless it explodes on the pad). Second takes you up to 100K and \\*nearly\\* into orbit (at least, it does with me. A decent pilot could probably squeeze an orbit out of it, or if you can edit it with an extra fuel tank or two. I can\\\u0027t, the editor lags like hell with this thing). Third gets you into orbit if you aren\\\u0027t there already, and on your way to the Mun...it also contains a third of your RCS fuel. For a direct-descent without going into Munar orbit, this stage also aims you towards your LZ, and starts to slow you down. It bombards the mun with debris when you jettison it, so...um.....see what you can kill with it. 4th stage lands (rather inefficiently, but very safely thanks to its 6 landing legs), takes off, and heads back. The fifth stage contains the rest of your RCS fuel (2 tanks), and 16 RCS thruster blocks. It\\\u0027s a pig to fly, but it\\\u0027s useful if you run out on the 4th stage and still have some RCS fuel left.\n\nI\\\u0027m actually genuinely proud of this thing. It\\\u0027s not that original, it\\\u0027s not my best design by any means, and it sure as heck isn\\\u0027t safe, practical, cheap, efficient or in any way *sane*.....but it works. And getting this thing working took a *long* time. \n\nNext on the to-do list: The Mk.53 \u0027Colonel\u0027, which will be more efficient, safer, better staged, less cluttered, and most importantly, at least twice the size of the Major."}]}
