I have cross-strengthened the fuel tanks and added lots of lateral supports, then double-crossed them, added many many many more struts - engines are so rigid even crashing into a moon should not move them. Yet it still ends up disintegrating after a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if there is anyone out there willing to take this mad contraption on and attempt a launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone is welcome to take this rocket and do with it what they want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spoot Knight","CreatedById":8302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-23T20:27:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first-glance guess is that the thrust is causing it to collapse into itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"princessjane","CreatedById":30815,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-23T20:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first-glance guess is that the thrust is causing it to collapse into itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep more struts or edit the cfg of existing struts making them stronger.
