Kudos to anyone who does. I may even let the first winner name the next Breaker variants. I\u0027m planning one that can dock, one that can dock with multiple kerbals, possibly a one with Munar/Minmus (landing not planned but possible) capabilities, and, if I resinstall B9 aerospace (and rarely, but possibly stock), a satellite carrying version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent ascent profile is a hybrid between a brute force SSTO and an air hogging SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-27T22:54:54Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2014 10:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neotician","CreatedById":68796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T22:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecial feature?

I was planning on using an LV45 instead of a RAPIER, but decided to add more fuel to the jet tanks and use that instead. It\u0027s got one of the fastest accelerations I\u0027ve ever flown with and it can really get up to speed quick, contributing to it\u0027s extremely low TTO.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-27T22:57:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2014 10:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CavemanNinja","CreatedById":98480,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T00:59:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm assuming you only took one screenshot for a reason\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 So, the wings are ejectable!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T01:23:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom my viewpoint, it looks like the craft drops the side tanks...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-the side jet fuel tanks are decoupled (hence the struts and ram are intake not clipping into the side). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The parachutes must be used for landing as wings and landing gear are ejected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The cubic strut visible is used to cushion the parachute landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess at least, from looking at the picture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-28T01:26:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2014 01:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T01:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou both are correct!
