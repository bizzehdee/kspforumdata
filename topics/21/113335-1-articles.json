Is it smooth and stable. There are a lot of other factors too but your craft looks like it would actually be just about fine in the current FAR. It may need some balancing weights placed in the airframe to bring its CoM closer to the real life version. And the removal of the I-beams off the tips of the wings as they really aren\u0027t there on the real aircraft, they are missile rails which are designed to be aerodynamic, I-Beams really are not."},{"CreatedByName":"landfish2","CreatedById":138824,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T20:08:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Download link seems to 404. =(\n\nfixed"},{"CreatedByName":"Triop","CreatedById":145841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T03:48:29Z","Content":"@ landfish2 \n\n**Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornet**\n\nAwesome, flies great !\n\nKudos."},{"CreatedByName":"JDarksword","CreatedById":145985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T16:09:02Z","Content":"Great job, I made an F/A-18E before you but yours is outstandingly better.
