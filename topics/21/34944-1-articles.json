(The command pod has been rotated for easier crew transfer in orbit, so be aware that the navball may be rotated 180 degrees from what you\u0027d expect.) Most of the involuntary inclination can be corrected for at this time.

(That was almost twice as much fuel as I needed to polish off the orbit, circularizing at 150km with 0 degrees inclination. The command pod came home with 76 units still in the tank, and the RCS fuel would have gone untouched if I hadn\u0027t burned a unit or two to pull away from the space station.
