Yaw control is also important but I find I\u0027ll usually tumble rather than sideslip\n\n\\* gentle piloting! allow a good 1/4-1/3d of an orbit to re-enter, leave the craft pitched up a couple of degrees and just let it slow down. Especially don\u0027t do anything violent when you\u0027re in the worst area of heat, because that\u0027s also high dynamic pressure.\n\nThe first two are somewhat interlinked - it gets worse as your craft gets longer because body lift tends to be a positive feedback loop, start pitching down and you\u0027ll get negative body lift in front of CoM, which leads to more pitch down if it\u0027s not corrected. You can design that out by having CoM fairly forwards - so you get more body lift behind it - and a rear mounted tail but those are not always compatible with spaceplane designs. Generally you want both full \u0026 empty CoM in the middle of your payload bay, and having canards means every surface is contributing positive lift.\n\nMach angle for Mach 6 - you go faster than that but pressure is so low it doesn\u0027t matter - is a bit under 10 degrees, try and keep all parts of the craft inside a 20 degree cone off the nose. Not sure what FAR does with aero stress with things that stick out of the shock cone but it\u0027s not good for drag either way. You get more drag at the wingtips than the root, so delta wings are also a good shape.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Does anyone know the mach 1 wave-drag area of some real jets? I want something to compare my designs to.\n\nCan\u0027t seem to find numbers on that anywhere - you could probably get an estimate from running the numbers on some blueprints! easy stuff \\*cough\\*\n\nI was going to say \u0022KSP craft are pretty small\u0022 but this thing appears to have the same span as an EE Lightning. Looks a bit shorter than one though.\n\n[![21452641784_d4c4cb6981_z.jpg](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5724/21452641784_d4c4cb6981_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/yFGp1d)\n\nEdit: wait, maths fail.

If I had some time I could probably get it down even lower. The setting\u0027s fully strict, 3x the regular resolution. Wave drag IS mostly dependent on the shape, not the size of a plane, at least with relatively small ones.
