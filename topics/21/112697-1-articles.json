Only had one try at ascent so far and upper stage motors were swapped.

And do they all have to get back to orbit?\n\nWell mk3 cabin has the best Kerbal/mass ratio. You can always use individual seats for virtually no mass but i am guessing it will be quite annoying to move 16 kerbals or even more. I actually managed to build one that can make orbit and even have enough dV left to return to Kerbin. I have one big problem tho. Can\u0027t do a proper gravity turn ascent... Yes going directly up untill i pass 50k then starting the turn works. Can\u0027t say i like doing it that way. Craft itself is balanced at every stage and very aerodynamic. Still it seems to love flipping even with fins. Guess i have to put bigger fins and deal with more drag or is there a trick to it? \n\nAlso if you really are going to build one that can carry 16 or 32 kerbals please keep the part count as low as possible. I created too many stages with asparagus, craft simply has too many parts for me to enjoy it. The craft is actually quite lagless untill i start moving in the atmosphere... New aero and temp system is killing my cpu combined with part count while moving at high drag situations in atmosphere.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T16:32:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T21:08:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Foxter are you up for the job now?
