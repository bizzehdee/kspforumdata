Right now, the top stage is MechJeb, but I should be able to modify it to use a lander for a crew when 0.17 comes out. Took quite a few iterations to get something that won\u0027t blow up on stage separation, and my solution was to simply use the smaller parts for most of the craft, with the larger parts acting as a booster through the lower atmosphere. It\u0027s the first craft I\u0027ve really designed for interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot much to say about it, hopefully it will get me there. Designed mostly to be a one way trip, although I think it has enough delta v to swing by and return to Kerbin if needed. I may end up doing what most people are recommending and sending two craft: One with the lander, and one with a return capsule. A future iteration will need a lander capable of taking off again in an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second craft is Deep Space 1. It\u0027s the result of asking the question \u0022Let\u0027s say I want to use only a single aerospike engine. How much fuel can I send into orbit with it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason being, well, it seems that navigating space is all about delta v. How much you can change velocity. And since it\u0027s space, it doesn\u0027t really matter how much thrust you have, only how efficient the rocket is. Basically, you want your ship to be a flying gas tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I designed a big gas tank to go with my engine. This thing should be able to make it to any planet in 0.17. It\u0027s not really designed to land (although I chose the MechJeb lander as the payload), but should be able to get me basic info about all of the planets and moons in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original design was two large gas tanks attached to a thinner, inner stage. After a lot of experimentation, I figured it would be boosted into orbit with large rockets, each two tanks high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the launcher got to four tanks long and two tanks wide, and that was getting me into the upper atmosphere, but not into orbit. It was, however, getting me there fast, so I knew that I had more than enough power, just not enough fuel to get into orbit. So, I decided to add another stage to the bottom of the existing rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat proved to be way more than enough - indeed, I had a lot of fuel left! Once in orbit, my launcher had four large tanks that were completely full, with four more tanks containing some leftover fuel. I had to incorporate those tanks into the final spacecraft - so I did, adding the ability to drop the four powerful rockets of the final liftoff stage, and allowing fuel to go back into the interplanetary craft itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result once in orbit? Over six large fuel tanks, filled to the brim, feeding a single aerospike engine. Plus some fuel left over in four more large tanks, and the four small centerline tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it turns out to have great endurance, even being able to make the 8 km/s delta v for a sundive. Never imagined I\u0027d ever want to create such a craft, but once I decided I wanted a deep space craft, I figured I might as well test the sundive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does take nearly the entire craft to do the dive, though. I was down to the inner tanks, having ejected all of the outer tanks. And it is annoying fighting the kracken on the way down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots taken are basically launching and in orbit. I didn\u0027t take any screenshots during the missions, will have to remember to do that in the future :/.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTES:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MechMars has a higher thrust/weight ratio of the two, and should be able to make it to the inner planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-When you break off the last four large rockets, Deep Space 1 will have a really low thrust/weight ratio. Be prepared for some really long burns. If you don\u0027t mind wasting a bit of fuel, you can keep the last four large rockets attached for a while longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Be careful about launching the last two large tanks on Deep Space 1, as they can snap off the rest of the vehicle. Best to do it with the engine off and wait for them to float off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MechJeb is required for these two rockets. No other mods were used. Both rockets should be safe for a MechJeb launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechMars 3:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hiiam0iqixpppq9/IViYWR-36h\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/hiiam0iqixpppq9/IViYWR-36h\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep Space 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rbt9zvylrxdav0a/oPPFAyLZoi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/rbt9zvylrxdav0a/oPPFAyLZoi\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-01T21:14:33Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2012 09:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by CobraA1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDuna, not Eve . . .\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iZINC","CreatedById":41100,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T12:22:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Epictures would be nice...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueSubstance","CreatedById":40362,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T12:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you add some pics please? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobraA1","CreatedById":18757,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T13:00:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I\u0027ll go put some pics in the post itself soon, although the dropbox links had pics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobraA1","CreatedById":18757,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T06:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: These aren\u0027t the most beautiful ships, but I build to be functional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the deep space launcher and Deep Space 1.
