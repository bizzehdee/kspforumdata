It uses 4 Whiplash engines to gain speed, 1 Vector to punch out of the atmosphere and 2 nukes for orbital manoeuvres. I wanted a plane that didn\u0026#39;t use Rapiers for a change.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/91CxF56.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/z8p0dPq.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Hotkey 1)[/B] Toggles Whiplash engines\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Hotkey 2)[/B] Toggles Vector\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Hotkey 3[/B]) Toggles LV-N engines\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Hotkey 0)[/B] Toggles cabin lights\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Flight instructions:[/B] Press space to switch on Whiplashes, (the Vector and LV-N\u0026#39;s will remain inactive when staged). Fly up to 10km. A glide angle of 15 degrees works well. Flatten out to go trans-sonic and stay flat until the Whiplash engines thrust gets up to 300 kn and orbital speed is over 1000 m/s. Then let the plane naturally pitch up until you reach 20km and an orbital speed of around 1200 m/s. Press hotkeys 2 and 3 to engage the Vector and Nukes. When the Whiplash engines give out press hotkey 1 to disable them and close intakes. When the Vector gives out press hotkey 2 to switch it off. Point to pro-grade and let the nukes slowly push you into orbit. You should have about 1200 m/s of deltaV to do orbital stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Re-entry procedure:[/B] De-orbit and enable air brakes. Flare the plane up and down below 40km to create enough drag to slow you down.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you re-fuel this in space with just Liquid fuel the LV-N\u0026#39;s will give you around 4337 of DeltaV to do other stuff if needed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[imgur]lZQeH[/imgur]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url=http://www./download/qef03rpndshvctn/Aero_Edge_SSTO.craft]Download here![/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet me know what you think.
