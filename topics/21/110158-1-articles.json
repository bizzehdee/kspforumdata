And I think that description really says it all. Big Reds! To orbit! And it ain\u0027t even that big itself.\n\n![fgplNQS.png](http://i.imgur.com/fgplNQS.png)\n\nHowever, it is a finely tuned craft right on the edge of what stock KSP can do if you don\u0027t cheat with it a lot. And the margin is very tight! It has, therefore, quite the piloting requirements. Don\u0027t worry! There is a piloting guide in the description and everything. I guess that\u0027s what happens when you go tight on TWR on order to maximize payload ratio... ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)\n\n![VRkrw3A.png](http://i.imgur.com/VRkrw3A.png)\n\nAnd what a ratio. It might make orbit on fumes, but almost half the weight in orbit is LFO, inside a spacious cargo bay where there is room for pretty much whatever you want if you don\u0027t want the fuel. I also think it\u0027s pretty elegant the way that it uses Vernors to achieve RCS translation and rotation, and a pretty powerful system at that, using the leftover fuel. Aerodynamic handling is quite fine, both with the full payload and empty it will stay balanced at all fuel levels. That\u0027s right, you can glide it to the ground with a full bay.\n\nBut best of all? It is *very* friendly to take close to your stations! 108 parts means that you can afford quite the big spectacular station without serious lag, even with a couple of these docked to it. I think by now you can see why I finally gave one of my SSTOs the most obvious game in my naming scheme. This one is here to stay, and be used for a long time, and I think it is worthy of the name.

First, yeah, I\u0027m very happy with how the engine assemblies turned out. Mind you, they are quite cheaty, I abused the translation and rotation gizmos to do some heavy clipping, and in the process I discovered that intakes behave in weird ways with respect of how much air they receive: if preecoolers are behind an intakes, they will get less air, but apparently they don\u0027t mind being attached to the back end of a RAPIER engine. Who knew?\n\nAlso, the question about the K-34 (the big chemical SSTO). I\u0027m really sad, but apparently I\u0027ve hit some short of development wall. See all those aerodynamic fuselages on the front? They must be doing something weird to the aerodynamics, because for the life of me, I can\u0027t get her to behave stably when empty, and I\u0027ve used every trick in the book. Either that, or sideways Mk3 tanks are a really bad idea, I wouldn\u0027t know since in the SPH indicator everything looks fine with the CoL pretty far behind the CoM. After some very frustrating reentries (either too lawn-darty, or total loss of control on hitting dense atmo, with no room in between), I have relegated it to the back-burner for now. I might revisit, but in the meantime the Longsword will have to serve the reusable heavy lifting requirement.\n\nRune. Which was another development surprise, but of the good kind: the longsword was built to be able to lift half the payload it ended up with."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T08:23:13Z","Content":"I really like the way you mounted the engines.

The kind of reply I enjoy answering. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Let\u0027s begin:\n\nYup, the trilogy is the Dart as light hotrod, the Spatha a medium workhorse, and the Longsword as the heavy super-efficient lifter. And no, I\u0027m not going anywhere. Just that at that point, it was 12:00pm, and I had been playing KSP while browsing the forums for six hours straight. There will be more stuff a I create them, after all R-SUV needs a lot of replacements.\n\nIntakes, yup, you guessed right, it\u0027s the leftover air from when I closed them and switched to rocket power. I still do that, even though I\u0027m not so clear on whether intakes decrease in drag when closed in 1.02 or not. Old habits!\n\nAs to the double dock, I just fiddle in the editor until the second one is so close it looks docked, but isn\u0027t. When the vessel loads, they dock before anything has a chance to move, and you get your firm connection. A handy trick. Also note that it is better to attach the ports to the rear surface of the tank immediately before the bay, since fiddling with translation for stuff attached to a payload bay is pretty bugged and will make it jump all over the place. Hope that helps, and glad you like it!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The master back at work I see.\n\u003E I can\u0027t get a ssto to work for the live of me\n\nThanks! And yeah, it is a whole new game, especially for those that liked to hand-make their hulls like you did. Wing drag when they see angle of attack \u003E5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA is now a killer! But other than that, it\u0027s not that difficult once you relearn a few things: You need TWR\u003E1 on the runway to break Mach, enough wing for AoA drag not to stop you doing so, \u003E1.5km/s of rocket power on the tanks, and you will make orbit without issues. But the part about minimizing drag is critical to go over the transonic barrier, and for that you need to keep the number of parts that see the airflow, including wings, to the bare minimum.\n\nHope to see you get back into the saddle soon!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I really like the way you mounted the engines.

They could be done a bit better, only by the end of the build did I discover that I had a lot of room to put more intakes in: the rear node of the RAPIERS.

Well, first of all, don\u0027t beat yourself, the test payload is also the maximum weight it\u0027ll lift to a ~75x75 orbit with any margin, so it\u0027s only reasonable you can\u0027t get her up unless you do things pretty much perfectly. I assume you are following the flight profile in the craft\u0027s description? If so, the only thing I can add is that maybe you want to switch the RAPIERs manually to closed cycle mode when they go under ~75kN thrust in order to keep a high vertical velocity that minimizes drag *while keeping a low-ish angle of attack to also minimizes drag*. It is easy to chase a higher cutoff velocity at the expense of going flat right at the moment you are experiencing the highest drag losses, and that can consume your delta-v pushing against air when you try to build vertical velocity back up later. \n\nIf that still fails, just empty the test payload a bit, or better yet, draw fuel from it by un-forbidding the tank, you will still get tons of it into orbit and it serves as RCS so you can also \u0022waste\u0022 it there (I wouldn\u0027t call it waste if it gets the mission done!). When you get more comfortable with it, I\u0027m sure you will be able to push the payload fraction to its limit and bring the full load to the station. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nRune.
