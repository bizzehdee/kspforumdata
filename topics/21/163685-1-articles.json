They invited government officials for a test drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a disaster. The government rejected the proposal based on the used technology like standard suspension and wheels, gearboxes and the piston engine running on regular fuel (Normalbenzin). The argument was they needed the parts for building up military vehicles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the drawing board. After many months of searching the team found parts they could use. From a terminated company (because the Soviets felt the fighter jets competed with their own designs, which made Stalin angry) they acquired jet engines and landing gear. At first the engineers wanted to use the landing gear as the main wheels but this idea went into the trashcan after they discovered the tires couldn\u2019t handle the roads, which were in terrible shape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey had already made the landing gear units a part of the bodywork design and a redesign presented a problem because of the delay, they wouldn\u2019t make it before the deadline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey eventually found, just in time, the final solution: \u003Cem\u003Eelephant skateboard wheels\u003C/em\u003E. There was a huge surplus because a famine in early 1948 made the government order all elephants to be slaughtered for food.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226cyA3kg.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022578\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6cyA3kg.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looked funny but did work: they were compact to install, provided reasonable grip and a smooth ride. Plus the brakes were excellent because -as we all know- elephants are heavy.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut because of the fact there was no gearbox and thus no way of driving the wheels, there also was no reverse. Drivers had to push their car if they had to back up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the time, aerodynamics were excellent. The jet engine could propel the car to an amazing 90m/s at 100% power. It was decided to reduce the power to 18.5% though, partly because the weak suspension damping made the car dangerous at speeds above 35m/s but mostly because all government officials displayed a different colour of the rainbow during a demonstration. They couldn\u2019t handle the idea that a cheap car for the plebs would be faster than their own state limousines. The population soon discovered how to remove the engine limiter but if the state police would catch you speeding, you\u2019d spend the rest of your life in a gulag for \u003Cq\u003Einstilling anti-socialist thoughts to the public\u003C/q\u003E, an act of high treason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YwSNZX9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022578\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YwSNZX9.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter production started in 1949, the population soon discovered funny little levers labeled \u003Cq\u003EEinziehfahrwerk\u003C/q\u003E hidded away behind panels, which would lower the original wheels. They also discovered these wheels didn\u2019t have bad tires like the design team claimed, in fact they were a lot better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a short trial the design team admitted the lie because they wanted the car to look ridiculous and make a fool out of the communist government. They were hanged the next day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe name of the car was allegedly the name of the wife of one of the team members. It sounded French but no government official spoke the language of the former enemy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022V52yze1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022578\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V52yze1.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was another way the team made the car ridiculous but this wasn\u2019t spotted by the government nor the public. It was discovered in the memoirs of a widow of one of the team members, when she published those decades later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETip for fun: Set the Juno to 100% thrust and disable crash damage, it\u2019s fast and good for drifting.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/crafts/31707\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload link\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-25T16:08:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2017 04:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Azimech\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"He_162","CreatedById":152811,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-25T19:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLove the \u003Cs\u003Estory!\u003C/s\u003E History!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-25T19:49:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223131022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022163685\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221501011478\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022He_162\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, He_162 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLove the \u003Cs\u003Estory!\u003C/s\u003E History!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
