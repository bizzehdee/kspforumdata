After seeing [this epic ship](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111927-Nova-Class-Starship!) by Redshift OTF, I decided to have a go at a more modest vessel.\n\nWith nice shiny lights, reasonable part count, a crew capacity of 51 Kerbals and a cargo bay that contains a useful science pod.\n\n **To get a correctly oriented navball, activate (Control from here) the command pod that sits just behind the RCS tank on the aft of the top section.**\n\nThe science pod contains every experiment apart from the atmospheric nose cone and has its own RCS thrusters with enough juice to de-orbit from a low/medium Kerbin orbit. Twin parachutes means it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll land safely on Kerbin.\n\nThe center of thrust is slightly off-center to the center of mass, but nothing that SAS cant\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 handle. TWR is pretty bad but not enough to make me want to kill myself.\n\nAlthough it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s probably possible to launch the Oberth from Kerbin\u0027s surface, I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t tried and instead edited it into orbit. If anyone cares to try and showcase their launch here I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be bloody impressed.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nSubject to change.\n\nTonnage: 42t dry\n\nParts: 161 (144 without science pod)\n\nKerbin Orbital TWR (full tanks): 0.12\n\nDelta V: 3,763 m/s\n\nCONTROLS\n\n[4] Toggle science pod radio antenna\n\n[6] Toggle lights 1\n\n[7] Toggle lights 2\n\n[8] Toggle docking port shielding\n\n[9] Toggle bay doors\n\n[0] Undock / decouple science pod\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
