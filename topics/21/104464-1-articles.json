You\u0027ll never meet a more quirky rocket! (Offerings to whatever god you pray to may be needed before launch.) The Russian Energia was designed as a heavy lifter, and made two flights- an orbital test flight of the Buran shuttle, and the Polyus military satellite, which failed to inject into orbit correctly. This download comes without a payload, but if you bug me enough I may make one. Hope you enjoy!\n\n**Craft Info:** 204 parts, 1,377 tons. (!)\n\n**Craft Download:** (Mediafire) [Link](https://www./?tn1j2nltqcj5fa9)\n\n**Flight Manual:**\n\nLike any rocket, straight up til 10k, then gravity turn. This rocket has plenty of dV, although KER calculates it weirdly. Don\u0027t use physical timewarp until the booster sep, at which point the core can handle two or three times warp.\n\nAnd now, beauty shots!\n\n![H5SXWP7.png](http://i.imgur.com/H5SXWP7.png)\n\n![lafq95f.png](http://i.imgur.com/lafq95f.png)\n\n![VMMm22Q.png](http://i.imgur.com/VMMm22Q.png)\n\n![7Y24itD.png](http://i.imgur.com/7Y24itD.png)\n\n![Qnz3Rdz.png](http://i.imgur.com/Qnz3Rdz.png)\n\n![Ej61y2i.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ej61y2i.png)\n\nThanks for viewing, and leave some rep if you enjoyed!"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T20:05:10Z","Content":"Great design sir \u002Brep to you"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T20:13:16Z","Content":"Me likes weird rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T22:10:19Z","Content":"Very nice, as usual!

I made it symmetrical to simplify my building, other\u0027s flying, and the fact that I based it on the vertical-mounted payload version.
