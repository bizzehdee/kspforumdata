This is a lightweight, long range jet designed for high speed interceptions. As such, low speed handling has been sacrificed for high speed atmospheric stability. At this, it excels, and is orbit-capable on the included fuel alone. Please note that this plane is designed to land with a high speed approach - I do not recommend any landing approach speed below 160m/s - cut engines as you encounter the landing zone and deploy brakes chutes to land successfully.\n\nThis model is also equipped with an experimental high force ejection seat. Our kerbal engineers claim it is incredibly fun, despite it being the cause of several mission aborts. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCraft file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_i9mp_pYiR0cFoyR0piUk9tbDg/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_i9mp_pYiR0cFoyR0piUk9tbDg/view?usp=sharing)\n\nIntroducing the\n\n***Flying Ace \u0026 Flying Fish***\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027m really happy with the way this open cockpit design and hidden engine turned out. \n\nEssentially the same craft with different landing gear configurations. Note that these ultralight planes fly well even on 50-10% throttle which will give them plenty of air time even on the miserly 40 units of liquid fuel included. When taking off from the water, get your speed to 30-50m/s before nosing down briefly and pulling back hard to bounce up, freeing yourself from the kraken\u0027s grip. Also - does anyone if there is a way to entirely remove parts from staging? I want to disable the structural pylons from unintentionally exploding off the craft if possible.\n\nCraft file: Flying Ace: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_i9mp_pYiR0dUxVeEg1S2JnVk0/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_i9mp_pYiR0dUxVeEg1S2JnVk0/view?usp=sharing)\n\nCraft file: Flying Fish: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_i9mp_pYiR0X0JPcFN1QTh0blU/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_i9mp_pYiR0X0JPcFN1QTh0blU/view?usp=sharing)\n\nIntroducing the\n\n***P-38 Lightning***\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I value low part counts, aesthetics, flyability and functional equivalence to the inspiration craft more than a strict visual reinterpretation when I build reproduction craft. So this is a fast flying, medium altitude plane with excellent handling like its inspiration. \n\nCraft file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_i9mp_pYiR0T3dyZlc5S19YcFk/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_i9mp_pYiR0T3dyZlc5S19YcFk/view?usp=sharing)\n\nHope you guys enjoy!"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T07:41:55Z","Content":"Sweet!
