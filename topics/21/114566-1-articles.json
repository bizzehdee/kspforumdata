V Panther**\n\n**Designer: Zekes**\n\n**Status:****COMPLETED**\n\n**Cost: $208,850.00**\n\n**The Panther was a German medium tank deployed during World War II from mid-1943 to the end of the European war in 1945. It was intended as a counter to the Soviet T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV.** \n\n**Comes with rotating turret, simply stage. Body requires a \u0022control from here\u0022 from one of the pods in the rear in order to operate normally. Camouflage not included.**\n\n***Download:*** https://www.mediafire.com/?44wwdd0wsydbdxh\n\n**To Operate:**\n\n**You probably need to open/close the MG port to get the armor to sit. Decouple turret, then select the body control units (slightly in front of the rear fuel tanks) and control from them. Then drive a ways, switch to the turret and set it to \u0022prograde SAS\u0022. Then go back to the body and drive around - it will turn safely up to 18 m/s. Just don\u0027t try to move the turret out of prograde follow while driving.**\n\n![Y8YHAgf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Y8YHAgf.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-26T21:11:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2016 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by zekes**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T18:18:55Z","Content":"Hans kerman approves!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vagani","CreatedById":112067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T18:23:56Z","Content":"This just recks mine, gj zekes as always ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Redhotita1","CreatedById":90870,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T19:05:13Z","Content":"Uh... don\u0027t ask why.\n\n![ecXO6ns.png](http://i.imgur.com/ecXO6ns.png)\n\nJust doesn\u0027t work... for now.\n\n![Qwcg1Hm.png](http://i.imgur.com/Qwcg1Hm.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T19:20:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Uh... don\u0027t ask why.\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/ecXO6ns.png](http://i.imgur.com/ecXO6ns.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Just doesn\u0027t work... for now.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/Qwcg1Hm.png](http://i.imgur.com/Qwcg1Hm.png)\n\nOh my!

The structural panels on the sides of the bearing are intersecting with the bearing and that is seeming to cause some glitchiness. Maybe you can find a way to redesign the top of the hull to allow for more space.\n\nDo I get an honorary zokesian membership card?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T04:20:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jon144**"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:44:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Comrade zekes...

It does not seem to rear-up all as much now but when it does it is more violent. Silly turns super smooth though.\n\nSorry... I found this last version still has problems. I am working them out. I can see why this was so frustrating for you now.\n\nEdit: I fixed a lot of the problems now. It still rears up but all in all is far more stable and the tank can even move with the turret detached fairly freely.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T04:20:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jon144**"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T22:00:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It does cause odd phantom forces like the original at some points.
