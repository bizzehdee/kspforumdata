(Two more heavy stages still attached). I haven\u0027t updated the stats of most of this post, or uploaded a new launch album yet, but have just finished testing this beast in the new version, and it passes like a true champion. Also, thanks to the Nerva update to Liquid-Fuel-Only operation, future Titans will be primarily pure LF carriers.\n\nA few weeks ago, Jebidiah got it into his head that those recently-discovered Class E Asteroids were built by somebody with something to prove. Not one to back down from a challenge, Jeb told his engineers that they were going to out-build this unknown challenger, and despite their qualms, eventually surrendered and got to work.\n\nSo... here is a ship that can haul over 250,000 units of Liquid fuel into a solid round orbit as high as 400km.\n\nIt uses a design that allows it to shut down the last set of boosters when the 70km orbit is reached, and allows the onboard LV-Ns to draw from remaining booster fuel to get your fuel station where you want it without draining the main cells.\n\n9 - Shutdown Innermost Launch Boosters.\n\n0 - Activate LV-N Engines.\n\n**DO NOT TURN BEFORE DROPPING THE FIRST STAGE**\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122198-Aerodynamics-Lesson-Of-The-Day](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122198-Aerodynamics-Lesson-Of-The-Day)\n\nWeighs as much as an upper-end Class E asteroid! \n\nFuture similar designs will include a Titan XV with fewer parts, (Titan XV R2) and one designed for hex-docking others like itself to create even more insanely huge stations, the first Titan that will be built with modularity in mind. Mechjeb will be mandatory for docking them.\n\nYou can download it at the mediafire link below.\n\nWarning - the launcher starts at 1,518 parts; not for the faint-of-heart PC\u0027s.\n\n[**http://www./download/j8nfmj6pz48882m/Titan\\_15\\_Build\\_Phase\\_9.craft**](http://www./download/j8nfmj6pz48882m/Titan_15_Build_Phase_9.craft)\n\n**MUST BE LAUNCHED FROM SPH / RUNWAY!!! This will collapse if loaded onto the launchpad!**\n\n![bp8YJjr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bp8YJjr.jpg)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

After depleting and ejecting the rest of the booster fuel, it weighs 3,316 tons in its final phase.\n\n![NxJqa3z.png](http://i.imgur.com/NxJqa3z.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-28T16:14:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2015 04:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camaron**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T23:00:57Z","Content":"How many parts is the lifter alone?"},{"CreatedByName":"Camaron","CreatedById":100218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T15:10:58Z","Content":"That ship starts on the launchpad with 1,494 parts, but drops to 246 in orbit.\n\nEdit: Launchpad part-count is now 1,518\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T05:57:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 05:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camaron**"},{"CreatedByName":"Camaron","CreatedById":100218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T05:58:06Z","Content":"I\u0027ve just tested this ship in KSP version 1.02, and....\n\n**It works even better than before!!!**"}]}
