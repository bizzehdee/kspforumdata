Developed a new lifter the other day because I needed an easy, reliable and effective way to transport probes to deep space and also station parts in to what ever orbit they need to be in! this is powered by a total of 5 mainsails and 1 poodle. The outer 4 booster sails get the rocket and payload almost into orbit. Usually with the right ascent it will be suborbital! The 5th mainsail it used to circularize the orbit but usually depending on the altitude and payload there is enough fuel left over to increase its orbit! Lastly, the poodle engine is used to do coarse corrections. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the album below, the rocket is being used to boost a space stations orbit into a better construction orbit. Currently the station is at 160km and need to be at 360km. The rocket as you can see has near half of the 5th mainsail plus the poodle to do this with. That is why it has no payload, I have to be sure it is able to boost the station where it needs to be and I figure it can! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts capabilities... The most I\u0027ve ever lifted with it is 50 tons and it managed to get into LKO with fuel left over to again adjust the orbit into a higher orbit! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61743-USKS-%28United-Soviet-Kerbal-States!%29-Now-hiring-AND-taking-requests!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload link is located here.\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW I ripped the mechjeb unit off so even though you see the mechjeb in the pictures, the craft file does not contain it! 100% stock! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: this is also my 450th forum post! yay me! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a//Y2dD7/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
