The sad part is that this isn\u0027t even as finished as I would like it, but KSP physics and my low level of skill have made sure that the perfection I seek is impossible to attain. I do indeed have the craft complete, it sails on the water with a decent max speed, doesn\u0027t capsize (when handled\u00A0responsibly), seats Kerbals on the bridge lookout stations, all that stuff. But despite my best efforts, I have yet to make this submarine dive-capable according to my desired standards. Oh well, when you try and build a submarine in a spaceflight simulator, i suppose some sacrifices have to be made. Anyway, here you go,\u00A0the Gato\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EClass \u003Cs\u003ENightmare\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0Fleet Submarine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KBnALWq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KBnALWq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Gato class formed the backbone of the US submarine fleet in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Although many people do not know it, the Gatos and other various submarines were one of the biggest contributors to the downfall of Japan and the Allied victory. They operated similarly to the German U-boats by raiding merchant shipping in an attempt to starve Japan out of the war, however they were also used for other duties, such as transporting agents and commandos, photographing islands in preparation for an invasion, etc. American naval doctrine also dictated that submarines were supposed to support surface fleets in large battles, scouting ahead for the enemy fleet and engaging them if possible. This is why they were known as fleet submarines. Because they were intended to operate alongside battleships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers, American submarines typically had a fairly high speed for submarines of that time (The Gato made around 21 knots on the surface). Likewise, they had an exceptionally long range because they were required to operate in the Pacific Ocean (A Gato submarine would have been able to travel 11,000 nautical miles at the speed of 10 knots). They were equipped with six fore and four aft torpedo tubes and boasted many features which were considered luxuries at the time, such as air conditioning, refrigerated food storage, and a bunk for every member of the crew. Their speed, range, firepower, and relative comfort, along with Japan\u0027s failure to develop any meaningful ASW techniques, helped these submarines succeed in the Pacific where Germany failed in the Atlantic (twice). By 1945, American submarines (which made up about 2% of the entire US Navy) sank approximately 30% of the Japanese Navy, including several capital ships. For comparison, the US only had around 200 Subs in WWII while Germany had\u00A0over 1,000, and ultimately failed in their task. After the war, the Gatos were quickly decommissioned, as newer models based on the German Type XXI U-Boat rendered them obsolete. Several are still around as museum ships across the United States (I have been fortunate enough to visit\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EUSS Drum\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in Mobile, Alabama, the first Gato commissioned and one of the most successful)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9XMkKbg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229XMkKbg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nAlright! Enough rambling about the real one, time to show you mine!. Although I had to forgo a detailed interior like my U-boat replica had, I was able to add three command seats for the deck watch, two for the deck gun crew, and make the AA positions accessible. The front mount features a Bofors 40mm cannon\u00A0while the aft mount has a double barreled Oerlikon 20mm gun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FfJVRvH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FfJVRvH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vfOX3LS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vfOX3LS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThe Gato is equipped with two periscopes. historically, one had a greater magnification and a smaller head, and was used for daylight attacks, while the other had a larger head (for better night vision) and a greater elevation for searching for aircraft before surfacing.
