It flies like a dream but has a funny 20degree AoA at altitude wich is no real problem. I had the pleasure of having to rely on the position of Minnus and the Sun when flying near the pole to keep my orientation; otherwise i would have gone lost and never made it back. The entire flight lasted 1hr and 48 minutes.\n\nHere are some things i noted could be fixed:\n\n- We clearly need more and brighter, more distinct stars.\n\n- The runway needs to be way longer and wider. It also desperately need night landing lights!! I just don\\\u0027t risk landing on the runway as landing on the ground is just as well\n\n- WE NEED MORE INSTRUMENTS! Please!! XD\n\nDoes anyone know what the land distance record for an airbreathing aircraft is?"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T20:33:51Z","Content":"I believe it is 73,000 miles, but I may be wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"Lunik","CreatedById":9250,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T20:47:39Z","Content":"Wow.
