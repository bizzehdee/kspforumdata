It is a vtol. Solemnly a vtol. It uses the plane vtol navball perspective for jet engines, and since the nuke is facing normally, you don\u0027t have to change views or anything. Its very low part count (I think about 90). It gets into orbit easily, has a good TWR, it can tow objects in the atmosphere and in orbit (I haven\u0027t tested towing objects into orbit). Its easy to control and reliable. Every aspect of this craft is perfect, except for its one weakness: fuel flow. It is perfectly balanced, but as much as I try, the jet fuselage will not transfer the fuel into both rocket tanks. This means at some point, for me it was in minimus sphere of influence, you have to pump the fuel from the jet tank to the rocket tanks (and preferably have both rocket tanks at around 75 fuel each, which means you have to try to do it precisely \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E).

I\u0027m amazed you managed to clip 2 jet engines in there. I had a go at fixing the fuel lines but didn\u0027t have much luck as there is almost no space in there to place anything. They only other thing I would change is to rotate the top docking port 180 degrees so it is the correct way up if you are using auto roll on Mechjeb, but that is pretty minor.
