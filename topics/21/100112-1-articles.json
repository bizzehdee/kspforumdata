They were designed for ease of operation and to minimize cost and tech requirements, beginning simply and progressing in complexity as necessary parts and facilities are unlocked. Together, these craft can reach 8 of the 9 biomes on Kerbin. Any with wheels can explore all KSC biomes.\n\n- Operating instructions are included in the craft files.\n\n- All of these aircraft were tested with a keyboard and without SAS. \n\n- Only rear wheels use brakes to prevent flipping over on landing. \n\n- All have a wide stance and steering unlocked to aid in takeoff and landing. Some feature outrigger wheels on the wingtips.\n\n- All feature the option to land safely via parachute for people who have trouble landing aircraft. It is possible to land on the KSC runway in this manner.\n\n1. Fly as low and slow as you are comfortable approaching the target area.\n2. Near the target, cut throttle and lift the nose to bleed off excess speed. Take care to stay on course during this phase of flight.\n3. The goal is for the plane to reach its minimum airspeed and stall forward directly over the target.\n4. Deploy the chute at this point and you will land very near this spot on the ground.\n\n AeroCognos\n\nThese craft can operate from the level-1 hangar and runway. Engine is thrust-limited to 50% for easier handling and increased range. \n\nCrew: Scientist Kerbal is recommended for the best science return..\n\n**AeroCognos S2** variant launches vertically and lands by parachute on the target biome with two sets of Science Jr and Goo canister for a cost-effective science harvest.\n\n[KerbalX link](http://kerbalx.com/Torquimedes/AeroCognos%20S2%20v10)\n\nCost:10,445 $\n\nMass:4.4 t\n\nParts:19\n\nRange: Able to reach 6 of 9 biomes on a one-way trip. Poles and Badlands are out of range and water landings are not recommended.\n\n![K249IH2.png](https://i.imgur.com/K249IH2.png)\n\nTech required (total 200 science points):\n\n1. Start\n2.

Apply pitch trim as needed en route. Fly safe.\n3. Land via wheels or chute as desired. Repack chute if necessary.\n4. Perform all experiments.\n5. Fly back to KSC and land by wheels or chute.\n\n**AeroCognos S3** variant Includes three sets of Science Jr and Goo canister to get more science in one trip, and wheels to make it a round trip.\n\n[KerbalX link](http://kerbalx.com/Torquimedes/AeroCognos%20S3%20V9)\n\nCost:14,950 $\n\nMass:4.5 t\n\nParts:19\n\nRange: Able to reach 7 of 9 biomes round trip. Badlands is out of range. Polar exploration is possible one-way. Water can be reached by rolling very carefully into the ocean and driving out at minimum throttle, as seen below.\n\n![71cKUDp.png](https://i.imgur.com/71cKUDp.png)\n\n![uS3Zpow.png](https://i.imgur.com/uS3Zpow.png)\n\nTech required \u002B90 (total 290 science):\n\n1.

It launches from the runway, lands in the target biome, and can be driven to additional nearby biomes for maximum science collection in a single sortie. It can carry all scinece instruments as they are unlocked. Its onboard lab can process results for more return on transmission, reset materials and goo for multiple uses, and store multiple copies of experiments. Finally it can be flown back to KSC for maximum cost recovery. \n\nCrew: If you prefer SAS in flight and manual landings, take a pilot. If you prefer to land by parachute, take an engineer to repack the chutes. Make sure there are two scientists in the lab before takeoff.\n\nThese craft require level-2 SPH. Tech required \u002B180 (total 470 science points):\n\n1. Start\n2. Basic Rocketry\n3. Survivability\n4. Science Tech, Flight Control\n5. Space Exploration, Aerodynamics, Electrics, Landing\n\nUpgrade options: \n\n- As you unlock more science instruments, attach them to the sides of the Science Jr module. The empty node on the aft end is for the nosecone sensor.\n- Add more solar panels for more power generation. If you add retractable panels, don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t forget to retract them before flight.\n- Upgrade antenna for faster transmission. Upgrade batteries for a larger tranmission buffer.\n\nAction groups:\n\n1. Raise/lower main landing gear\n2. Toggle air intakes\n3. Deploy parachute\n\nAbort: Toggle intakes and deploy parachute\n\n**CloudLab E1** is the single-engine variant, a more cost-effective craft for medium-range sorties.\n\n[KerbalX link](http://kerbalx.com/Torquimedes/CloudLab%20E1%20v4)\n\nCost:22,380 $\n\nMass:7.4 t\n\nParts:53\n\nRange: Able to reach 6 of 9 biomes round trip.

Stage to begin takeoff roll.\n\u003E 2. Make minor yaw corrections on the runway as necessary. The outrigger wheels will protect the wings. It is a perfectly cromulent strategy to drive off the end of the runway before pulling up to avoid the ocean.\n\u003E 3. Head for a border between multiple biomes. Fly safe.\n\u003E 4. Land near the border.\n\u003E 5. Send an engineer EVA to repack the chutes if you brought one. Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fall off the craft or you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to shuffle personnel in a game of musical hatches.\n\u003E 6. Use brakes and yaw and very gentle throttle to turn broadside to the sun for optimal solar panel generation. Set the brakes.\n\u003E 7. Gather crew report and perform all avaiable experiments. Process reports and clean experiments with the lab as needed. Transmit anything that gains \u003E0 science. Perform all experiments again.\n\u003E 8. Send a scientist EVA from the lab\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s upper hatch to hop onto the science pod. Collect data from all experiments. Hop down for EVA report and surface sample. Enter the lower hatch to store all data. EVA a couple times from the upper hatch to take and store more surface samples. Plant a flag as needed.\n\u003E 9. Release the brakes. Use brakes and yaw and very gentle throttle to drive across the border into another biome.\n\u003E 10. Until nearby biomes are exhausted, GOTO step 6.\n\u003E 11. Until all planned biome visits are complete, takeoff and GOTO step 4.\n\u003E 12. Takeoff and head back to KSC. Fly safe.\n\u003E 13. Land by wheels or chute as desired.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**CloudLab E2** is the twin-engine variant with more speed, longer range, and jet fighter aerobatics.\n\n[KerbalX link](http://kerbalx.com/Torquimedes/CloudLab%20E2%20v7)\n\nCost:30,140 $\n\nMass:11.5 t\n\nParts:83\n\nRange: Able to reach 7 of 9 biomes round trip.

Do not throttle full on takeoff, half is easier to handle on the runway. Stage to begin takeoff roll.\n\u003E 2. Make minor yaw corrections on the runway as necessary.

Use brakes and yaw and very gentle throttle to turn broadside to the sun for optimal solar panel generation.\n\u003E 6. Set the brakes. Use action group 1 to raise the main landing gear. The outrigger wheels will keep the craft level.\n\u003E 7. Send an engineer EVA to climb the portside ladder and repack the chutes if necessary.\n\u003E 8. Gather crew report and perform all avaiable experiments. Process reports and clean experiments with the lab as needed. Transmit anything that gains \u003E0 science. Perform all experiments again.\n\u003E 9. Send a scientist EVA from the lab to walk aft and hop onto the science pod. Collect data from all experiments.
