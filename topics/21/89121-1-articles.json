I\u0027ve been mucking about with VTOLS since .20 and I\u0027ve always wanted to create a VTOL SSTO that still looks like a plane. I\u0027ve seen some nice examples out there (levelord\u0027s in particular), but here\u0027s my own attempt. You can of course take of and land normally as well as vertically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/vZsjr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

There\u0027s probably a lot of guides out there, but I still see a lot of questions about it, so I\u0027ll give it a go along with a craft to guide you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction groups:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 = Jet engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 = Rocket engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 = VTOL engines (obviously only for #2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, I want to express to all who feel intimidated by SSTO\u0027s, that they are really quite easy to fly in KSP. With these two craft, after you take off (in whatever way) you want to keep your throttle at 100% and pull up your nose to about 30 - 35 degrees (Your heading obviously being 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0). Then you wait (or use time acceleration, but be careful for the \u0027bumps\u0027) until you get up to about 25 km. From about 25 km you will want to start to slow down your ascent a little. Drop your nose to 20 degrees and not long after you will hear your engine thrust drop off slowly. You should be going around 1000 m/s at this point. Don\u0027t worry if you\u0027re off a bit. Now you need to keep your eye at the top of your screen. More specifically at the vertical speed gauge to the right of the altimeter. It\u0027s probably pointing north at this point, indicating you are going upwards at about 100 m/s. Now we\u0027re going to start \u0027chasing our apoapsis\u0027. This means we\u0027re going to want to get our vertical speed down to a more relaxed pace. Essentially bringing our apoapsis as close in front of the craft as possible. Drop your nose to about 10 degrees and you will start to see the vertical speed drop rather rapidly, so ease it down by occasionally pulling up a little, keeping your nose pointed between 10 and 20 degrees. You should be around 30 km at this point. Don\u0027t worry if you\u0027re lower, there\u0027s plenty of fuel, so practice increasing and decreasing your vertical speed. Also if your vertical speed drops below 0 for a bit that\u0027s OK. No worries, plenty of fuel... Just ease it back up without going into panic mode and pulling up at a ridiculous angle. Remember: \u0022You\u0027re a leaf on the wind, watch how you soar...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we accelerate... Keep your vertical speed somewhere at 10 m/s all the way up to 35 km. At this point you\u0027ll be going around 1900 m/s and your engine will produce a low whine right now (still giving about 70 kN of thrust). You will find that to keep the same steady 10 m/s ascent, you will need to start tipping your nose down. You\u0027re almost at orbital speed after all. So don\u0027t be surprised to see your nose go down to between 0 and 5 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt about 36 km your speed display will probably switch to orbital mode and you should be somewhere around 2300 m/s and rising. At approx. 37 km you will start to circularize your orbit and start to push up your apoapsis away from you, all the way to the other side of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the last phase, we\u0027re going to squeeze every kN of thrust out of our engine and assist with RCS to push up our apoapsis above 150 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, your nose will be below the 0 degrees in an effort to stay in the higher atmosphere for as long as possible. Mind you, you\u0027ll still go up at 10 m/s or more. At around 39 km, your engine will cut out for the first time because it fails to find enough air to keep it going full throttle. Now you need to throttle down until it fires up again and repeat this process as you go higher and higher. Ever reducing your throttle until you finally run out of air (can be as high as 50 km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re free to use RCS to push up even higher, but your apoapsis should be over 100 km even without RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you just coast up to your apoapsis and fire up your rocket engines to circularize (which should take about 100 m/s dV)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a final note, the Cargo SSTO needs some fuel redistribution before coming back down. I\u0027d advise to put any remaining fuel and oxidizer in the tank directly behind the cargo hold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel balancer mod will help here...
