I\u0027ve been at it again...\n\nSo since somebody asked me on YouTube to build the \u0022Normandy\u0022 from Mass Effect... I just did that. Honestly, It\u0027s a little off scale (not big enough), but it works. Got all three decks laid out, got a working cargo bay complete with MAKO and it also has remote mining rigs for refueling. Ore tanks and refinery unit are beneath the outer hull panels.\n\nProblem is: Trying to play with a 1700 part ship kind of sucks, to be honest...\n\nBut without further ado, here is the Normandy:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8JhQvrifD7s?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
