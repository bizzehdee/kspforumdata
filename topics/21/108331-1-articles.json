I want you to build your best spacecraft (can be a space plane or a rocket I Don\u0027t Care or it can be a combination.) and at least get into orbit. I understand that this challenge is quite easy but trust me as time progresses these challenges will get harder. MUCH MUCH HARDER.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nSo now that you have heard the challenge here\u0027s what I need for proof. \n\n- If you have fraps a video would be greatly appreciated but fraps is not required.\n- A picture of your vessel on the Runway or Launchpad.\n- A picture of your vessel in atmosphere.\n- A picture of your Orbital Map\n- A picture of your spacecraft in orbit.\n\nBy the way this mission has to be Manned NO PROBES. The fastest person to get into orbit will be picked in 24 hours."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T02:45:27Z","Content":"I belive this should be in the clallenges section. Also, how do you know how long it took somone to get into orbit? You can use the mission clock to tell however you do not spectify that it needs to shown."}]}
