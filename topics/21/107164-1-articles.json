Invariably, creators would clad their rocket with structural fuselages or fuel tanks in order to get the correct shape (especially on the tapered boosters). With the introduction of 1.0 and stock fairings, this issue can be tackled much more simply and with far less parts.\n\nIntroducing the SPIRIT OF SEMYORKA; not quite a replica of the Soyuz-FG but built to resemble it closely, both in looks and functionality. Includes mini-Soyuz spacecraft.\n\n[DOWNLOAD](http://www.whoshotdk.co.uk/KSP/Ships/VAB/SpiritOfSemyorka/SpiritOfSemyorka.craft)\n\nYou might need to right-click that link and use \u0027Save As\u0027 or similar.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nAs reported by MechJeb (MechJeb not included):\n\nTotal Delta-V: 6469m/s\n\nLaunch mass: 112t\n\nDry mass: 39t\n\nPart count: 182\n\nDelta-V and mass values may be inaccurate, but probably not by much.\n\nCONTROLS\n\n[4] Soyuz Antenna\n\n[5] Soyuz Solar Panels\n\n[9] Soyuz Instrumentation module doors\n\n[0] Discard Launch Escape System and payload fairing\n\n[ABORT] Separate the Soyuz Orbital Module and Descent Module from the launcher\n\nASCENT PARAMETERS\n\nAscend how you feel is best. After ditching the boosters and the core stage in their turn, press [0] once atmospheric drag is negligible to discard the payload fairing and launch escape system.\n\nDESCENT PARAMETERS\n\nExecute the de-orbit burn, then stage to separate the Soyuz Orbital module. Stage again to separate the Instrumentation module. After re-entry heating has mostly dissipated, stage to deploy the parachutes and stage again to discard the heat shield. Finally, moments before landing, stage one final time to fire the braking thruster (though its pretty useless and totally not needed).\n\nNOTES\n\nI decided to use a small version of the Soyuz spacecraft; in the real world I believe it is roughly the same diameter as the launcher core stage. The launcher is quite capable of lifting a 2.5m size Soyuz to 100k/m orbit (built, tried and tested), but I prefer the more compact Soyuz as it scales well compared to larger parts that you might use to build space stations (such as Salyut).\n\nI hope you enjoy the craft - my hope is that it inspires people to use fairings and parts in new and interesting ways. Perhaps Squad may one day introduce a specialised version of fairings more suited to spacecraft shaping and cladding.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
