Maybe you don\u0027t want to mess around with any fancy pants docking cams? Well then give this here tug a try, it might bring a little joy back into your boring life as a space tug pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI present to you the dully named LKO Tug mk V\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4aj5mJD.png\u0022 alt=\u00224aj5mJD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt comes complete with all the handy features a discerning kerbal looks for in a tug. It has forward and rear thrusters, an extra set of RCS thrusters, and dual reaction wheels so that you can handle heavy loads while still being maneuverable enough to navigate crowded construction areas. Also included with your tug are both a spotlight and area light. And of course, the most important feature of all, is the side mounted cockpit with a transparent aluminum canopy. The side mounting of this canopy allows an unobstructed view of the entire docking process, from start to finish. No more having to bother with tedious checking from different points of view to make sure you\u0027re still aligned to your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some additional pictures that show more of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/suwLY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small note: The craft in the pictures has the docking clamp cover obstructing part of the view. This is because the engineers at KSC put it on upside down on the prototype craft. It should be fixed in the current version of the tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as docking procedure goes, it should be fairly straight forward if you have a good handle on docking and rendezvous already. The one thing that is different is how you know if you\u0027re aligned or not. As far as rotational alignment goes, you\u0027re going to just have to go by eye on that, there isn\u0027t really any other than \u0022it looks good\u0022. Which has worked just fine for me, it has given me really nice dockings where it just fits like a glove and there\u0027s no wobbling around trying to attach. To determine if you\u0027re aligned along the translation axis, there are a couple things you will need to keep in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The cockpit is located to the side of the docking port, so you want to aim a bit to the side of the docking port you are approaching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. On the cockpit where the canopy meets the panel, near the sides, there are two metal clip things. If you draw a line connecting both of those, that is your horizon line. Anything on that line is what the ship is pointing at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the .craft files, one with a launcher and one without.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/levb8bpfad91f58/LKO%20Tug%20mk%20V%20-%20Stock.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELKO Tug, with launcher\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/wacxjezljeqv0so/LKO%20Tug%20mk%20V%20-%20Stock%2C%20No%20Launcher.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELKO Tug, no launcher\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a quick search on the forum and didn\u0027t find anything else similar to this, so I hope you guys enjoy it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
