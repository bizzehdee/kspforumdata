There are obviously inaccuracies so I wouldn\u0027t exactly call it a replica but it looks very similar and is really fun to fly as well as being useful. \n\n**Mk3 Skylon SSTO**\n\n![eoPIalb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/eoPIalb.jpg)\n\n![012VI5t.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/012VI5t.jpg)\n\nThe craft is very versatile. There is a lot of room for extra fuel if you need more DeltaV, (Mun and Minmus orbital missions). It is easy to move fuel around to balance the plane with different payloads but honestly it doesn\u0027t seem to need it as the cargo bays are so close to the centre of gravity.\n\n![atJ4Rug.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/atJ4Rug.jpg)\n\nIt comes with a sample payload, a medium sized fuel station. (Hotkey 0 to deploy solar panels). You will need to use the whole runway to fly with this but once she is airborne she handles very well.\n\n![8KdjJ77.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8KdjJ77.jpg)\n\n![yD1mrYt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yD1mrYt.jpg)\n\nThe craft glides very well when coming into land and survives re-entry without flipping out provided you don\u0027t perform any sudden manoeuvres. There\u0027s plenty of fuel if you want to land with jet engines.\n\n![8qwGhGc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8qwGhGc.jpg)\n\n![RYGCNSh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RYGCNSh.jpg)\n\n![pdZ53yi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pdZ53yi.jpg)\n\n![VASDxFQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/VASDxFQ.jpg)\n\nWith sample payload - 374 parts - 150.7 tons\n\nWithout sample payload = 348 parts - 119.1 tons\n\nI had to use a lot of struts and bracing to ensure the thrust of the engines didn\u0027t rip the wings off.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

After all, even with that many hidden wings, I\u0027d bet you this flies more because of \u0022everything will fly if you put enough boosters on it\u0022 than because such a thing could fly. RL\u0027s Sklylon\u0027s fuel tanks are incredibly low-density, considering they mostly carry hydrogen. And still it would take off at about 300km/h.\n\nAlso, my Skylon is the first time I did a \u0022all tanks feed at the same rate\u0022 trick. And without clipping! So there\u0027s that. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nRune. Plus, it managed a respectable 25% of GLOW as payload with two intakes per engine."},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:52:25Z","Content":"It looks like a skylon that is for sure.

I just don\u0027t want to make it hard to get into orbit, (this one is currently very easy), keep it noob friendly."}]}
