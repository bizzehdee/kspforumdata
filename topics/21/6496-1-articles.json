It can land without assistance from its engines, is equipped with ASAS, and can be fitted with weapons as custom. For use on single-use cruisers [ones where the main section is not designed to land eg. orbital attack cruisers/things which are too massive for landing gear] or vessels whose crews need to survive for prestige, even if the war section is damaged or destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkthespy","CreatedById":7644,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-09T23:28:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDAYYYUUUUUUM.
