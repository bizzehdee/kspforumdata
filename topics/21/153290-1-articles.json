It is part science/math to explain the critical design challenges in various areas of the world\u0027s space programs. \u00A0This uses Real Solar System, Realism Overhaul, and Real Progression Zero to add more realism to simulations. \u00A0Roughly half the episodes are flight/gameplay and half are science-tech oriented (with some engineering thrown in).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you like it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParallax59\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS.
