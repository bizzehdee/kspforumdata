I was not elected, I just decided to do it. If you\u0027re unhappy with my decision, we can work something out. This is just my opinion, since there\u0027s no subjective way to judge \u0022Quality\u0022 of crafts.\n\u003E If anyone feels that their craft is missed because of any kind of time-zone difference, or any kind of difference in when spacecraft fridays is put up, tell me.\n\u003E \n\u003E If your craft is really good and was made before, and someone posts in it within that week, then it will be considered.

The more informal the better! I really like this about this thing, it\u0027s just a fun little \u0022hey, look at what you might have missed this week on the forums\u0022. If more than one people are doing it, the criticisms for favoritism and such (and the variety of crafts) gets short of addressed. And since it\u0027s informal as hell, you shouldn\u0027t feel left out if you don\u0027t make it. The only \u0022rule\u0022 would be to let the last guy that did it select the judge for the next week from the volunteers. And if the custom dies, it dies, probably because it\u0027s not doing its job.\n\nRune.
