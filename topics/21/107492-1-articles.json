Botany Bay! Oh no! We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got to get out of here NOW!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 - Pavel Andreievich Chekov\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKhaaaan!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 - James Tiberius Kirk\n\nThis is a Kerbalised version of the infamous SS Botany Bay, the nuclear powered sleeper ship launched in 1996 carrying the evilest and coolest antagonist of all time.\n\n[DOWNLOAD](http://www.whoshotdk.co.uk/KSP/Ships/VAB/SSBotanyBay/BotanyBay.craft)\n\nYou might need to right-click that link and use \u0027Save As\u0027 or similar.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nAs reported by MechJeb (MechJeb not included):\n\nTotal Delta-V (with launcher): 6,122m/s\n\nTotal Delta-V (sans launcher): 2,487m/s\n\nLaunch mass: 150t\n\nDry mass: 40t\n\nPart count (with launcher): 151\n\nPart count (sans launcher): 80\n\nCONTROLS\n\n[4] Antenna\n\n[5] Toggle Solar panels\n\n[9] Cargo bay doors\n\n[ABORT] Nothing, augmented Kerbals don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t run away from disaster\n\nASCENT PARAMETERS\n\nIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just as well this ship is manned by a group of genetically altered Kerbals with superhero strength and intelligence - as you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll need those superior skills to get it into orbit. TAKE IT SLOW and don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t start your gravity turn too early. You *might* need to finish your orbital insertion burn with the Botany Bay\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s own nuclear engine.\n\nMechJeb can get this thing to orbit too, though in my experience I did at least one cartwheel on the way up ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nDESCENT PARAMETERS\n\nThis ship isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t designed to re-enter the atmosphere but the lower cargo hold does contain an atmospheric drop-pod, so that you may unleash Khan on the unsuspecting planet at your leisure. The drop pod has four RCS thrusters and a Delta-V of 641 so who knows, perhaps you can land on a non-atmospheric body too.\n\nNOTES\n\n*What, no fairings?!*\n\nAccording to a photograph of the launch of a DY-100, the ship was not snug inside a payload bay but rather just sat nakedly on top of some kinda rocket with six boosters. So I decided to stick to that profile as much as possible - though I did add a few reaction wheels and some canards to the boosters to allow for some control during ascent.
