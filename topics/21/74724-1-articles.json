Trying to climb too quickly and not getting enough horizontal velocity will send you straight back to the lower atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop speed on pure jet power: Clocked at 2230 m/s surface speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V after reaching orbit: Up to 7110 m/s with standard fuel configuration (assuming you use exactly 25% of the jet fuel during launch and take 60 m/s to circularize orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGround thrust: 5.28 MN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum jet thrust: 9.6 MN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace thrust: 720 kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace thrust with safety disabled (lower Isp): 1520 kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowerplant: 48*Radial Turbojet Engine \u002B 4*NE-800 NERVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGround TWR at standard fuel load: 0.84\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum TWR at standard fuel load: 1.55\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace acceleration, assuming 600 tonnes reach orbit: 1.2 m/s^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace acceleration, safety disabled (lower Isp): 2.53 m/s^2 (in case you want to \u0022land\u0022 it on the Mun or something).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace acceleration, empty: 3.05 m/s^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace acceleration, empty, safety disabled: 6.43 m/s^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECargo bay: 29 meters long, comfortably fits 3.75 meter parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass upon reaching orbit: Ideal=589 tonnes.
