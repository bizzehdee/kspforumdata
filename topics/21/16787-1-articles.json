You also have all your laterally attached tanks attached to each other with fuel lines. This is unnecessary as they will use fuel at the same rate if they have the same engines. Also, your main center engine is gimbaled, so there is no need for the lateral stage to have gimbaled engines as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s what you do. Swap out the gimbaled engines for the LV-T30 engine which has 15 more thrust each for the same fuel cost, and they weigh less too. Then, run your fuel lines from the lateral tanks to the center tank. Your lateral tanks will all run out of fuel at the same time while keeping the inner tank completely full.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-13T19:45:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2012 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Ziff\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
