If you need to get a new color from it, put back the opacity to 100, and pick the color.. Make sure it\u0027s filled in and with as few outlines as possible.\n\nHere\u0027s an example of a Cathay Pacific B777 I did just today (which was the most painstaking and tiring Sketchbook project I ever did)\n\n![ZKobm9f.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZKobm9f.jpg)\n\nThe base image: \n\n![Cathay_Pacific_Boeing_777-300ER_(7055258465)_(2).jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Cathay_Pacific_Boeing_777-300ER_(7055258465)_(2).jpg)\n\nWell, of course.. you know the rest.\n\nCathay Pacific, your livery is a pain to draw."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T21:15:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E @Veeltech Sorry mate yours will have to compete with all the good crafts out there but not saying it\u0027s bad though (I cannot into SSTO)\n\nSooooooo...
