We are currently recruiting Engineers and Testers. We currently specialize in Mun/Minmus Landings or Orbits, we also will make Kerbin orbiters. We use mostly stock parts, but you can PM me if you want a custom order. If you post a reply there is no certain date the rocket will get to you and we will only send you a stock version (sometimes Mechjeb). We do not affiliate ourselves with space planes... yet. So PM me if you would like to join or if you would like to request a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: We will not answer orders for interplanetary craft yet.
