It can self-launch to LKO if you sip some fuel from the upper stage instead of staging, then refuel and launch itself to Tylo, then refuel and do the landing. Or be pushed there, since it is equipped for docking (\u0022a bit\u0022 light on RCS though, only 15 units so thread carefully).

But it\u0027s still quite transportable, and that margin means you don\u0027t have to start the descent form an extremely low Tylo orbit, or can screw up royally the descent and still make it. Bringing the mothership deep inside Tylo\u0027s well costs you, too, and with only 6.5-7km/s really needed you could use the other ~1.5km/s to brake the lander into orbit during a gravity assist of the mothership and later return to it somewhere else (i.e: aerobraking it into Laythe, but I would have to check how much a Tylo-Laythe transfer costs). We shall see what I can milk out of it in any case. Plus, the upper stage can afterwards be used as a single stage lander on pretty much every other body but Eve, that\u0027s nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the true reason it\u0027s so overbuilt is, since I don\u0027t timewarp unless I don\u0027t have anything else to test/build/try out, outer solar system missions are terra incognita for me, so I wanted to play it extremely safe with the first landing out there.

I came into Tylo\u0027s SOI with 25k left cause I didn\u0027t bother refueling from Dres (refueled on Gilly). The thing needs that much DV because Krag\u0027s planetfactory has some really tough stuff to get to. Ablate took about 20k lol. It makes Moho look like a trip to the Mun.

Most of my landers can claw themselves to LKO without staging or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if being in a really low orbit or high makes that much of a difference how much DV you need to get down. Like, at a low orbit you\u0027re whizzing around the planet real fast and have to kill a lot of horizontal, but high up you have the opposite problem and have to kill a ton of vertical without much horizontal. I guess because of how gravity works though it\u0027s better to kill horizontal than fighting vertical drop while slowing down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually came down to Tylo\u0027s surface from 100km up. I was @ 20, but had to move out and adjust my inclination to land somewhere specific. I was way too tired to spend another half hour working my orbit down to 20 again.
