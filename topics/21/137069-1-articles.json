He played KSP for the most part of it, and in the first section he tried to create a spaceplane that could reach orbit using the assistance of the stratolauncher. Now, not denying he did a good job. But when it didn\u0027t reach orbit, I just saw a bit of wasted potential. So I took a few hours to scrap together this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/SpUoE/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what I realised with Scott\u0027s design was that the efficiency and power were in the wrong places. You see, the stratolauncher was based on efficiently using fuel to reach 10k meters or so, then the spaceplane should detach and activate the aerospike, which powered it into space. Now, the problem with this is that the aerospike, although rather efficient for an lf\u002Bo engine, just isn\u0027t going to cut it. It has way too high of a fuel consumption for its size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here\u0027s what I did:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep one: Change out the landing gear. I don\u0027t really like to use fixed landing gear on spaceplanes as it ruins that sleek look they have, so I swapped those out right off the bat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep two: Electricity. The spaceplane itself didn\u0027t have any electric generation as far as I could tell, so I put an RTG in the nose and a small solar panel on the top of the cabin. I also attached two battery packs to the back underside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep three: The stratolauncher. So, as I said, this thing didn\u0027t need efficiency; we aren\u0027t going to be needing that in the end, it\u0027ll be jettisoned. So, I swapped out the intakes for shock cones and the wheesley\u0027s for panthers. I didn\u0027t lose too much efficiency, and as I said that won\u0027t matter; we\u0027re throwing away that entire bit anyway. And for safety, I plopped in a couple more units of fuel into the wings. Wider margin for error\u00A0I guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep four: The Spaceplane. So I recognized the aerospike as a problem right off the bat, and swapped it out for the terrier. That gives me efficiency, and since the stratolauncher will be giving me a lot more force into orbit than before, the spaceplane won\u0027t be needing the insane 180kn the aerospike spits out. It makes it to orbit almost like that, so I threw in a few Torodial tanks for good measure, used the offset tool to push it in a little, and that was that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep five: Oh yeah. It needs a name. From looking at the stratolauncher I saw similarities to the Ramnstein song Engel when performed live. The wing shape at least. So that what it is. The Engel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s it! I put a parachute on for landing, and despite how close together the back wheels are it seems to be pretty stable. I strapped a radiator to the bottom to help with re-entry, and it tends to take that quite badly, but I\u0027m not making something that\u0027s perfect; I\u0027m just finishing what Scott started! I\u0027ll try to leave a craft file below so you can use it yourself. I\u0027m sure with a little more editing you can give it docking capabilities. Thanks to Scott Manley for inspiring this project. It\u0027s been a nice little adventure for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe livestream (on youtube) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axSxIUHs_No\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axSxIUHs_No\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(Note: The link is bugged a little, it starts at the bit where the spaceplane building bit ends, so just send it back to the start.
