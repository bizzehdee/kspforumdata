TSTO maybe? (Two Stage To Orbit? But it\u0027s not 2 stages so...?) This is an evolution of my [Roamer piggyback interplanetary transport](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122162-Showcase-Show-me-Piggy-Back-ships!) system. Except with this, it can be launched from the runway on Kerbin. This allows me to send my spaceplane which doesn\u0027t have any jets into orbit from the Kerbin runway.\n\n[![O5PkSHkh.png](http://i.imgur.com/O5PkSHkh.png)](http://imgur.com/O5PkSHk)\n\n[![7YX8uBuh.png](http://i.imgur.com/7YX8uBuh.png)](http://imgur.com/7YX8uBu)\n\n[![XDcCz1Ch.png](http://i.imgur.com/XDcCz1Ch.png)](http://imgur.com/XDcCz1C)\n\nEntire album:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/rR8zR)\n\nOnce the jets run out of air, hit [9] to switch to ClosedCycle RAPIERs. Once the Jetpack is out of fuel, hit [0] to jettison the pack, which looks like so:\n\n[![EItWz2A.gif](http://i.imgur.com/EItWz2A.gif)](http://imgur.com/EItWz2A)\n\nThen the spaceplane is already at 60km apoapsis and 1300m/s, so all that\u0027s needed is to circularize using Aerospikes or Nervas. You do unfortunately lose the Jetpack\u0027s parts, but I think there\u0027s a mod out there that lets you recover stages, so you could attach chutes to it or something.\n\nCouple more tweaks and I\u0027ll post the upload in the next hour or so if anyone\u0027s interested.\n\n**EDIT:** I\u0027ve reconfigured the Jetpack so that it can now land on its own:\n\n[![yVV3W4Cl.png](http://i.imgur.com/yVV3W4Cl.png)](http://imgur.com/yVV3W4C)\n\n[![RQa5QNSl.png](http://i.imgur.com/RQa5QNSl.png)](http://imgur.com/RQa5QNS)\n\n[![LuuIBgDl.png](http://i.imgur.com/LuuIBgDl.png)](http://imgur.com/LuuIBgD)\n\nBecause I added the MK2 probe core, landing gear and extra fuel, it takes a bit more coaxing to get out of the atmosphere due to the extra weight. However, now using this craft along with the [Flight Manager for Reusable Stages mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292-1-0-2-Flight-Manager-for-Reusable-Stages-%28FMRS-v1-0-00%29), you can decouple the Jetpack, switch to it, land it, and then use FMRS to switch back to the spaceplane and get it into orbit.\n\n**Ascent profile** has changed due to the extra weight and I haven\u0027t figured it out yet.\n\n**Launching tips:**  \n\nFirst disable crossfeed on the docking port! \n\nHit the spacebar to start the jets and pull up (S on the keyboard) the entire way down the runway to keep you from drifting like crazy. \n\nWhile in flight, use the [2] action group to toggle the Aerospikes and get a bit of extra speed when you need it.\n\nAfter Jetpack separation, right-click the tanks on the spaceplane and turn on the o2 flow again. It\u0027s disabled so that the RAPIERs don\u0027t burn up the spaceplane\u0027s o2.\n\n**Action Groups**:\n\n[1] Toggle LANTERN nuclear engine on space plane\n\n[2] Toggle Aerospikes on space plane\n\n[9] Switch mode on RAPIERs\n\n[0] Decouple JetPack from SpacePlane.\n\n[DOWNLOAD link from Mediafire](http://www./download/fbury23ba2ne3jy/!Atlas_JetPack__R-REC.craft)\n\nRequired mod : [Atomic Age (For the nuclear engines on the space plane)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104855-1-0-Atomic-Age-Nuclear-Rockets)\n\nMod-less version will be uploaded soon, however, Atomic Age is the one mod everyone should have (only adds 3 nuclear engines).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T10:12:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 10:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xtoro**"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T02:42:55Z","Content":"What this is called, is a SATO, a Shuttle Assist To Orbit ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I wonder why not many use this concept when having trouble with SSTOs"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:14:16Z","Content":"I like SATO ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Unless the parts can be recovered it\u0027s only good for sandbox or science mode.

Yeah I kinda went a different route with Atlas and Roamer. The Atlas Jetpack gets ditched and falls back down to the surface with chutes to be recovered. The Roamer is what brings you from planet to planet and never has to come back down to Kerbin.

At this point, the Space Plane is still full of fuel because it feeds off of the Atlas during launch.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T06:59:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 06:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xtoro**"}]}
