View full album](//imgur.com/a/6b3Du)\n\nCraft file: [http://www.filedropper.com/peafowll1](http://www.filedropper.com/peafowll1)\n\nIt\u0027s designed to be a simple, stable, clean and well handling plane.\n\nHandy for retrieving a stranded pilot for instance.\n\nThe fuel is perfectly balanced by default from full until empty.\n\nAt ten tonnes it is, in my opinion, the heaviest a single engine VTOL can be.\n\nParts: 53\n\nMass: 10.1t\n\nAction radius: 475 Km (confirmed)\n\nSome tips:\n\nStart up - Press \u0022staging\u0022 **once** to engage horizontal engines.\n\nHorizontal takeoff - minimum takeoff speed: 45 m/s, rotate to 10 degrees pitch, tail strike angle: 20 degrees\n\nVertical takeoff - Press \u0022abort action\u0022 to switch between horizontal and vertical engines, hover is at 65% thrust (at full fuel load)\n\nHorizontal landing - Make final approach with about 10% thrust, vertical speed upon landing below 10 m/s\n\nVertical landing - Make final approach witch about 55% thrust, vertical speed upon landing below 10 m/s\n\nEmergency parachutes - Press \u0022staging\u0022 again to deploy the chutes when you panic and are too close to the ground to recover or are just lazy to make a proper landing...\n\nThe reason for the \u0022weird\u0022 action grouping and staging is that it makes it possible to use the plane in Career mode with a level 2 Space Plane Hangar.\n\nAs always with Jet VTOLs be **gentle** with the throttle when using the vertical engine.\n\nTry to keep the throttle around the hover point (2/3 throttle). Slightly below for descent, slightly above for ascent.\n\nAnticipate what the plane is about to do and watch that **vertical speed** meter!\n\nIf there are any questions, please feel free to ask!\n\nI hope you\u0027ll like it!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T14:49:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by T-Bouw**"}]}
