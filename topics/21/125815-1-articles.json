Equipped with 1 30mm chain-gun for A2A and destruction of light ground vehicles however this nothing compared to the 2 howitzers it uses to engage heavy vehicles from any range. No matter if you are 4 km or 500m this tank will kill you if you let it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAction groups:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1 Fires the selected weapon\u003Cbr\u003E\n2 Selects the next weapon\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDownload here\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]https://www.dropbox.com/s/h5pxv6xtevr70z7/Panther.craft?dl=0[/url]\n"}]}
