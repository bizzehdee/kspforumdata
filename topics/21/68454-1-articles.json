Restarted career for the ARM patch, and I thought I\u0027d set myself the challenge of landing a self sustainable base on Duna as soon as the tech tree allowed it. So here it is! Comprised of habitation for 4 Kerbals, with room for a further 2 in the Lab, and one observing and controlling from the central Cupola module. The base also has a docking-garages for two fully science-fitted out two-Kerbal rovers, and a docking port on the back of the Lab for expansion with future base modules. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy launch coincided with a solar eclipse, so I was lucky enough to snap this lovely shot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img716/9638/7hd5.png\u0022 alt=\u00227hd5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe approach orbit for the base took me on a route over the North pole, landing on the very edge of the snow line directly under Ike\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img819/972/m6up.png\u0022 alt=\u0022m6up.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially the base was sent up with just Jeb at the helm to set her down safely, while a transport ship with the rest of the crew was sent up on a slightly longer route\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img824/5241/gn8b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gn8b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final base layout (for now) once the transport ship had landed with the rest of the crew for the base later that week.
