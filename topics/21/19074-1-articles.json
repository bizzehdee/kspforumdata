I am not sure if this is because there are so many people designing ships and posting them or if there is a common logic to all the names given to ships that get posted. Now we could argue about who came up with the name first, who\u0027s ship is better; but that idea tires me. I honestly don\u0027t care about name overlap, what I do care about is someone posting a link to their ship in a post where I am trying to promote my ship. It would be like having a press conference to promote the Xbox, when Sony comes in and starts pitching for the PS3. While both products achieve the end result of entertainment, there is no possible way that the products are similar enough to justify Sony crashing an Xbox event.
