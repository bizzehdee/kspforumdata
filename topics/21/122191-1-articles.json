By having the landing legs on the side of the wheels, and just barely sticking past the tread while extended, it gives the wheels a lot of grip that they would otherwise be lacking. I\u0027m pretty sure the normal rules apply where a mega rover that is very heavy will need the heavier landing legs, while lighter ones can get by with the lighter legs. Hopefully this will help those that are better at making them then I am. And have fun playing around with this little guy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo move forwards and backwards; use Q and E to roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo turn requires a combination of W, S, A, or D depending on how he\u0027s sitting. It\u0027s easier to turn with the landing legs retracted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can run him around at up to 4x time warp, but warping faster then 2x increases the chances of the reaction wheels coming detached while traveling. Also, retracting the landing legs does increase his speed a little, but at the cost of him having almost no grip. I have done some playing around with it and this guy can roll over the service vehicles found around the science buildings. But he has a harder time getting over the larger fuel tank hauling truck. And the only thing that can stop this guy seems to be vertical surfaces, like buildings and the large fuel tank hauler.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-03T14:34:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2015 02:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ebetter pictures.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T05:17:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy do I hear jacksepticeye\u0027s voice saying \u0022stickybot!\u0022 in the same fashion as the he would with his stickybombs in GTA5?

It\u0027s adorable! Why don\u0027t you test it on another celestial body? Like Minmus, see if it works, if so then this thing seems VERY good at gripping, if not, then I suggest replacing the landing legs with landing GEAR (Like the ones on aircraft) it may give Stickybot a bit less grip, but the ability to break and halt to a stop would be useful. and try plopping a few RTG\u0027s in there!

The thing to note is not the machine as a whole, but how the landing legs sit on the sides of the reaction wheels. Just having them extend a little bit past the outside diameter of the reaction wheels allows them to grip the same way they do for a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I tried this was simple. A lander can land on a highly angled surface in the Mun, minmis, and other planets. And as long as you can keep it from tipping over, will not slide down the hill like a rover can. So if the landing legs can hold a lander in place on a slope, can it do the same for a round object being used as a wheel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out it can. As long as they extend past the outside of the object your using as a wheel, you\u0027ll still get grip. the legs will compress until your wheel touches the ground, in the case of heavier objects, but will still provide the grip needed. The longer you extend the legs past the outside of the wheel, though, the more power it will take to turn the wheel. Too far, and it becomes nearly impossible to turn the wheel at all with a heavier mega rover... Also by having it only just extend past the edge of the wheel, you reduce the chance of damaging the landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T20:09:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a variation on the theme I just made...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFPth-UOgyA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
