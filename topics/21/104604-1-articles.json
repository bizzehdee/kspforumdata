Here\u0027s a recent sandbox test of a Tylo lander that may be of interest. Ignore the transport craft in the images below, it\u0027s just a stand-in and I hyperedited it to Tylo orbit. In the actual Jool-5 mission I intend to put all my landers in Mk3 cargo bays on a large cruiser. [Here\u0027s my plan for the Laythe lander.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115736-Korigame-Stowable-SSTO-fits-in-a-Mk3-Bay%21?p=1840629#post1840629)\n\nDesign Notes:\n\nLoaded Mass: 26.8t\n\nCrew: One\n\nMain Engines: 3x LV-N\n\nTWR: 0.95 (Tylo orbit)\n\n![qzZkBMg.png](http://i.imgur.com/qzZkBMg.png)\n\nAn Incomplete List of Thing I Hate About This Ship:\n\nMk1 lander can on top of Rocko-32 tank is ugly and disproportionate\n\nLanding legs stuck on girders to clear giant LV-N bells\n\nLadders are a complete kludge (needed to get down/around the landing legs)\n\nIt\u0027s ugly. Did I mention it\u0027s ugly?\n\nIt will get even uglier when I put a Science Jr. on it.\n\nA Complete List of Things I Like About this Ship:\n\nIt fits in a Mk3 cargo bay.\n\nIt lands on Tylo and returns to orbit in one stage.\n\nMuch praise for the Constant Altitude descent method, without which this POS would not have a snowball\u0027s chance on Moho of landing.

Being non-atmospheric it should work fine in 1.0 as well. I\u0027ll just need to add an equipment bay for the science and hope that additional mass isn\u0027t a problem."}]}
