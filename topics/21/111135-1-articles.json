Everything else is stock. \n\nFlight profile is pretty standard; 1st and 2nd stage get you to LKO, with some fuel left in the 2nd stage to start your interplanetary burn. This can be important, as the interplanetary stage is tight on dV, and relies heavily on aerobraking at Duna to establish capture and orbit there. Once in orbit, the lander can be extracted and the crew transferred from the command module. A short de-orbit burn and parachutes, with just a short deceleration burn near the surface means you can get down to the planet in the lander with most of your fuel intact. It\u0027s a two stage lander, but the first stage is used for both getting to the surface and doing most of the work when returning to orbit, being jettisoned when out of fuel, leaving the lander can to complete the orbital burn and rendezvous with the command module. Once the away crew are back in the command module, the lander can be discarded, and the command module can burn for home when a transfer window comes up.\n\nLift off\n\n![dun10201.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/dun10201.jpg)\n\nSecond stage burn\n\n![dun10202.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/dun10202.jpg)\n\nInterplanetary stage arriving at Duna\n\n![dun10203.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/dun10203.jpg)\n\nExtracting the lander module\n\n![dun10204.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/dun10204.jpg)\n\nFinal burn for landing\n\n![dun10205.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/dun10205.jpg)\n\nOn the surface\n\n![dun10206.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/dun10206.jpg)\n\nReturning to orbit\n\n![dun10207.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/dun10207.jpg)\n\nRendezvous almost completed\n\n![dun10208.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/dun10208.jpg)\n\nBurning for home\n\n![dun10209.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/dun10209.jpg)\n\nHope they\u0027ve put the kettle on to welcome us back\n\n![dun10210.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/dun10210.jpg)\n\n[Craft download file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/345pqoutp9qgr60/Duna%20102.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:21:02Z","Content":"That\u0027s really compact, nice work.
