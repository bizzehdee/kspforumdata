I used clusters for the first stsges, as with the real design.\n\nI was essentially very proud of my work, although the part count isn\u0027t very friendly (315)..\n\nAnyways!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The APC is capable of carrying 10 Kerbals (8 passengers \u002B 2 drivers) and features closing protective blinders for the drivers (it still needs a lot of work look-wise). Unfortunately only 1 Kerbal can exit the APC due to blockage caused by the armour plates. The ship itself suffers balance problems if pitching the nose too high.
