This guy must be insane!\u0022, you would say. In fact, I am almost insane. I am teetering on the edge of boredom until I fall into a sarchasm. Yes, I am doing well. My space plane is insane, but strangely enough to that it works better than what I\u0027ve bargained for.

You should keep you vertical velocity low, and at 20-23 km, you should have a velocity of at least 1200 m/s. I\u0027m sure your spaceplane can do it. Great job building it, but you might need to brush up on piloting it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lone K.","CreatedById":82794,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T02:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, I still got lots to learn about piloting this stuff.
