What I do for reusable rockets is a two stage rocket where the first stage goes to space and the second stage to orbit. I just slap on 8 radial parachutes, a 1.25 probe core and a pair of radial batteries. I can recover the first stage for roughly 75% of the cash I spent on it 75% of the time. It only takes an extra 2 minutes per launch anyway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other way I did it was an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket like you said. I don\u0027t like SSTOs very much due to their lack of payload capacity. And its rather difficult to land anything tall on land. So I often just do the two stage, first recoverable stage rocket because its time efficient, I get my money back, and its easy to design. Simple as that. Run the maths if you want, but I\u0027ll stick to that as a beginner.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbolExplorer","CreatedById":177191,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-06T17:11:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntry this one i made \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Kerbolexplorer/Aurora-Launch-vehicle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Kerbolexplorer/Aurora-Launch-vehicle\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand if you dont have the DLC try this one\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Kerbolexplorer/Kencher-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Kerbolexplorer/Kencher-1\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif this crafts doesnt suite you il come with something that can help you!\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
