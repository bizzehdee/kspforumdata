program back in the early 1960s when I was\u00A0a kid.\u00A0 A friend bought me the DVD set of all the shows a few years back.\u00A0 I soooo wanted to become an astronaut back then but I eventually settled on becoming a scientist (Analytical Chemist) after my height (too tall)\u00A0and poor eyesight (myopic) prevented the astronaut dream.\u00A0 I would get so excited watching Fireball XL5 I\u0027d have to rush off to the bathroom at the 15 minute commercial break to go pee.\u00A0 (Silly now I know).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuture wishes (with some editing):\u00A0 I hope in a future version of KSP they allow typing of an identifier on the outside of the spacecraft.\u00A0 I\u0027d like to put a panel on the outboard engines with big XL# labels as IDs.\u00A0 Also I wish there was an easy way to \u0022cheat\u0022 on engine and fuel capacity values that just go with the current craft.\u00A0 For example, I\u0027d like to put a small engine on the back of Fireball Jr (really I\u0027d like to get three or four vertical thrusters plus landing gear that are hidden until used to have it land horizontally on the surface of whatever) so I could detach it and rear end down with landing gear on surfaces.\u00A0 I guess I\u0027d need\u00A0two very large new docking ports as well to\u00A0allow docking/undocking Fireball Jr\u00A0to the rest of the fuselage.\u00A0 The cockpit would have to allow setting a certain amount of fuel and different thrust/ISP values for the engine.\u00A0 There are probably mods to do this but I\u0027d like to stay as close to stock as possible; ideally all stock.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(This is my first posting to KSP Spacecraft Exchange, so here\u0027s hoping it all works.\u00A0 Keeping fingers crossed...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are the jpgs...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/610604005659096160/88EA5798FD01F4DA1AAAE19C6D296871DFA9F908/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/610604005659096160/88EA5798FD01F4DA1AAAE19C6D296871DFA9F908/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/610604005659094207/504B4EFE10C14ED6A03388C64A29F00A2983ED42/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/610604005659094207/504B4EFE10C14ED6A03388C64A29F00A2983ED42/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/610604005659098524/BE2E498FD493A8F6D25A978830265091BB3CB14A/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/610604005659098524/BE2E498FD493A8F6D25A978830265091BB3CB14A/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here are the two craft files...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/crafts/9634/edit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/crafts/9634/edit\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/crafts/9636/edit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/crafts/9636/edit\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-02T20:53:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2016 08:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by rnyboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EJust additional verbage\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceToad","CreatedById":63992,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T15:05:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKinda side note here, but it wasn\u0027t really considerate of them to name it the \u0022fireball\u0022.
