Its purpose was to search for life and research the history of water on Mars. It landed near the martian pole, and did science for almost 2 years before lack of solar power ended its mission in 2008. Hopefully this does it some justice. If you want a download, just say so and I\u0027ll put one up.\n\n**Craft Info:** 149 parts, 11.4 tons, and a *slightly* overkill 4169 m/s of dv.\n\nNow for some beauty shots!\n\n![tiNfeMl.png](http://i.imgur.com/tiNfeMl.png)\n\n![rmIOxIh.png](http://i.imgur.com/rmIOxIh.png)\n\n![pQtFCHo.png](http://i.imgur.com/pQtFCHo.png)\n\nReference image:\n\n![532701092013154211.jpg](http://www.stratacafe.com/gallery/doug_stevens/532701092013154211.jpg)\n\nThanks for viewing, and if you enjoyed this, feel free to leave some rep!"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T22:14:49Z","Content":"Very nice have some rep\n\nYou could improve the solar panels look by angling them slightly so that they don\u0027t texture overlay.\n\nAnd the struts on the landing parts might be placed first form there so that you can move them afterward for a cleaner look.\n\nAlso you can mirror this cable strut on 1 leg then duplicate the leg 4 times to get a perfectly even strutting.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T22:16:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RevanCorana**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T08:52:16Z","Content":"Very nice.
