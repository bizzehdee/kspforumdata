The Camel\u0027s Little Brother","CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T01:20:06Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T01:20:06Z","Content":"After several redesigns, test flights (both failed and successful), and the repeated pressing of the F9 key, I finally have it! The Sopwith Pup has been deemed worthy of public consumption!\n\n![AYd5JSI.png](http://i.imgur.com/AYd5JSI.png)\n\nI don\u0027t expect some people to know about the Pup, so in short, it was the predecessor to the infamous Sopwith Camel, the most successful Allied fighter plane of World War I. The Pup and the camel were largely similar, except the Camel had two machine guns, while the Pup was armed with only one. The Camels\u0027s engine would range anywhere from 100HP to 150HP, depending on the type, while the Pup featured an 80HP Le Rhone engine. The Pup helped turn the tide of the air war in favor of the Allies, and gave British pilots a valuable edge over Germany\u0027s Albatross and Fokker Eindecker fighters.\n\n![MhiwMRx.png](http://i.imgur.com/MhiwMRx.png)\n\nMy Pup is powered by two OMS engines at 86% maximum thrust, and seats a single Kerbal in its cockpit. It\u0027s airspeed is typically 20 to 30 meters per second.\n\n![kRU0Gqz.png](http://i.imgur.com/kRU0Gqz.png)\n\nA closer view of the cockpit and engines. The fuel tank is below the pilot\u0027s seat.\n\n![cLy8VZw.png](http://i.imgur.com/cLy8VZw.png)\n\nThe Vickers machine gun I am especially proud of. Although it does not actually fire, it\u0027s one of the best parts of the craft.\n\n**Here\u0027s the download link:** [http://kerbalx.com/crafts/2167](http://kerbalx.com/crafts/2167/edit)\n\nSome notes to remember:\n\nThis does not boast a tricycle undercarriage, so be careful on takeoff and landing. It will normally take off without any input from you.\n\nIt is still a little jittery, and is easy to stall when flying at such a low speed.\n\nIt\u0027s fuel supply will only last you two minutes, maximum. Lower the throttle when flying in the air, cut it for landing.\n\nThanks for viewing, leave rep and a comment if you enjoyed! I would love to improve this plane, so if you have an idea that would make it better, please tell me!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T20:48:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pTrevTrevs**\n  \nTypo correction, fixed link"},{"CreatedByName":"gGATORr","CreatedById":95469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T03:31:50Z","Content":"Great looking airplane, especially the way you made the machine gun!

Remove the /edit.\n\nNot quite sure what the problem was, but I removed the /edit in the link. Hopefully it will work this time. \n\nI\u0027ve started to work on the Pup MkII, which will have an LFO engine system instead of monopropellant. The only problem is that the fuel tanks are buried deep inside the craft, and it will be difficult to replace them. I may simply test the performance of my planned upgrades by building a new plane. Besides, The Pup needs a German plane for it to fly against...\n\nWhich would you guys rather have, a German plane (It will probably be a Fokker Eindecker), or an upgraded Pup?"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T08:47:25Z","Content":"Give us a link to the Camel! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T11:56:49Z","Content":"This is really cute! \n\n It reminds me I need to update my Bi-plane with teeny tiny cockpit."},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T21:11:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Give us a link to the Camel! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nWell, I haven\u0027t built a Camel yet, and I\u0027m not sure if I will, as the Pup and Camel are very similar. I may build a few more aircraft to make a sort of WWI Planes pack if people want it. There are plenty of other aircraft that look and function differently enough from the Pup that I would be willing to build them.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT-tXbLrLiMFmkqOXIlCC1SZAu4xiCqEqGI_oqhuaReh3JBjnsQDQ](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT-tXbLrLiMFmkqOXIlCC1SZAu4xiCqEqGI_oqhuaReh3JBjnsQDQ)![images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQNyuBiH2CqeZtgnTgv6YFhF0K0EIu_GiAt-5q5QNh7b9AQnPY7FQ](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQNyuBiH2CqeZtgnTgv6YFhF0K0EIu_GiAt-5q5QNh7b9AQnPY7FQ)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTGYPjhV152Q_Db2WbzTuOYGEd93NllzpGulX9ljqvf6_0ea5h-](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTGYPjhV152Q_Db2WbzTuOYGEd93NllzpGulX9ljqvf6_0ea5h-)![Bristol-Fighter.jpg](http://www.maxfordusa.com/images/Bristol-Fighter.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"AxleMC131","CreatedById":150186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T11:24:36Z","Content":"Wow, really cool replica! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Have some rep!\n\nGotta say, amongst all the people saying the best bit is the Vicker\u0027s gun, my favourite part here is the radial engine.
