That was replaced with a stock controller with sucuessful results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wFWmBhi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wFWmBhi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the next payload, a Stayputnik was used giving even better performance due to its lighter weight. This is something that can be landed on Duna. An extra Reaction Wheel is added on the second stage since the Stayputnik on board SAS is too weak to safely control launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EPjvXaq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EPjvXaq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third test involved placing Jeb in orbit having the same maneuvering capability as the probes. Due to that payload being the heavist, some of the fuel on the payload was needed to achieve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tIPGLRs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tIPGLRs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModifying the rocket with three small SRBs that dropped off at burnout allowed the payload goal to be achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZAadMVs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZAadMVs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll continue researching small efficient launchers given the two challenges for how far a Kerbal can go on 5 parts, and cheapest probe to orbit. That turned out to be possible with a single FL-T200 fuel can with SSTO completed easily\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ur2ROA2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ur2ROA2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/syqnIql.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022syqnIql.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-30T12:06:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2013 12:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T17:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese look really nice and sleek! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
