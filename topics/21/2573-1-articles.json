I tried to make a Jet carried by a Carrier-plane whereby the Jet stays under my control after being separated from the Carrier. Its a little messy in its construction (Booster between planes, different decouplers, starting Jeb-style deluxe etc) but at least it works and I think i might keep improving that thing. Maybe I can strap the Carrierplane on another Carrier Plane...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways - this is Version 0.1 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures - be warned, theyre a bit big...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i51.tinypic.com/2qi9qop.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222qi9qop.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying the Carrier with the Jet on can be tricky - after separation the Carrier does surprisingly well on its own, though.
