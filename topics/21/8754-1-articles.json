A fairly basic rocket, designed for Direct Ascent landing and return profile from the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst stage is purely to get out of lower atmosphere, don\\\u0027t bother maneuvering until second stage because you might be too heavy to make orbit then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond stage will get you to a high suborbital, use third stage to raise perigee out of the atmosphere. Then you are go for trans-lunar injection burn whenever you\\\u0027re ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHang on to the third stage, you\\\u0027ll need it to help brake into Munar orbit, drop the extra fuel tanks when they run out to reduce weight, and use the remaining fuel to start your decent. Should have enough fuel to help you do most of your decent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust before landing, drop the remains of the third stage and use the lander engine to slow and land. Take a look around and pat yourself on the back, then fire up your engine to get back into Munar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce there, line yourself up with Earth and fire the engines again behind the moon to head home!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the first rocket I was able to do a landing and return with, so it\\\u0027s probably overkill for the experts here, but not quite overkill enough that you can be completely careless with fuel either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry it out and let me know what you think!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: added a screenshot\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cthulufaic","CreatedById":6660,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-27T21:04:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPics maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
