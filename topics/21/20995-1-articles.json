It was always go to Duna, collect pebbles, throw pebbles, record distance pebbles fly, leave Duna. They could never retrieve the pebbles because they would get bored walking to the spot they landed. Werner suggested a way to get the pebbles back while keeping the kerbals entertained. He walked up to the president of KSP during a meeting about this topic and said \u0022What if we take the lander, and move it really fast.\u0022 The president laughed and responded \u0022How on Kerbin would we do that?\u0022 Werner simply said \u0022Wheels.\u0022 The concept for the KerbKar had been laid out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took years for the KerbKar to make it\u0027s first test. Even longer to get to Duna. During testing, it showed a range of 20 KM on Kerbin, and a top speed of 37 m/s. Finally, it launched atop a rocket powerful enough to send it to Duna. Later that year, the landing photos were transmitted back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q3AcM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q3AcM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IeYMC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IeYMC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5IUJy.png\u0022 alt=\u00225IUJy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MhGbZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MhGbZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dYpiW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dYpiW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"randyrules711","CreatedById":13988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T05:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll gladly post any other screenshots by request.
