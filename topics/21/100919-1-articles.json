We have several differing designs of engines to fit your needs. From big too small, we have them all.\n\n**Shaker: Radial** **Engine Line**\n\nWe have a selection of 5 different radial turbo shaft engines to suit your needs. They start with tiny and go onwards to absurd. All the shaker radial engines feature 0 too minimal turbine blade expansion, meaning blade knocking is nearly a thing of the past.\n\n**\u0022Mini Shaker\u0022 4-cylinder radial:**\n\n![4cylradialenginetop_zpsvrfvpvzx.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/4cylradialenginetop_zpsvrfvpvzx.jpg)![4cylradialengineside_zps2mmdhamu.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/4cylradialengineside_zps2mmdhamu.jpg)\n\nThis little 4-cylinder radial engine may be small, but it is also not big. What it lacks in size, it makes up for in sheer; \u0022This should work if we spin it fast enough\u0022. This little engine is well suited for lite duty use on small craft or as auxiliary engines to help stabilize larger crafts. With its patented \u0022We don\u0027t need more then 4\u0022 attitude, it is sure to find a home in your drone craft garage.\n\nPart count: 84\n\nWeight: 10.8 tons\n\n30 seconds of fuel included at no cost.\n\nDownload: [4-cyl radial engine](http://www./download/k92wjjw4jgrldhx/4-cyl_radial_engine.zip)\n\n**\u0022Shaker Light\u0022 6-cylinder radial:**\n\n![6cylradialengine_zps3ernih66.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/6cylradialengine_zps3ernih66.jpg)![6cylradialengineside_zpsfgnrftsg.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/6cylradialengineside_zpsfgnrftsg.jpg)\n\nThe Shaker Light is a light duty 6 cylinder radial engine designed to not be as small as a 4 cylinder radial engine. This \u0022Lets make it bigger then the mini.\u0022 attitude has produced a fairly reliable and moderately powerful engine that is suitable for many differing uses. It is not recommended to run this engine without having a load on the drive shaft or \u0022Unintended separation\u0022 may occur due to \u0022Over speeding\u0022.

A few little tweaks and tucks have made the engine slightly smaller as well. With it\u0027s 8 cylinders, it is 2 more cylinders more powerful then the shaker light, and double the power of the shaker mini. This is a much bigger engine all around then it\u0027s smaller brothers. With this size comes more durability from extra struts and reinforcements. This engine is well suited as a main rotor engine for heavy lift helicopters and for use in large craft of all sorts.

This engine was a complete redesign, from scratch, and not just 2 shaker lights slapped together. Honest. This engine is surprisingly small for the amount of power it can produce making it well suited as a primary engine for heavy aircraft of all sizes. The revolutionary \u0022cylinders on both sides\u0022 approach has yielded an engine that also runs surprisingly smooth. But the addition of extra cylinders has slightly increased its weight and parts count. But if you have the need of a truly big engine, look no further. Or maybe you will? Hmmm, this is probably the biggest engine we\u0027ll make, you can stop typing now. I said you can stop now... Hay! propeller not included...\n\nPart count: 169\n\nWeight: 26.5 tons\n\n2 minutes of fuel included for a limited time(he did what? again?

We thought we had made the biggest there will ever be. We were wrong! Kervin did it anyways. \u0022I bet I could make one even bigger.\u0022 he said. We all doubted him and laughed at the silly notion. An engine even bigger then the double 6. HAH! But then he went off and made this Monster. And now we have to try and get rid of... err... make this engine available for purchase. This engine is a true monster, following the; \u0022lets put cylinders on both sides\u0022 logic of the big 12 cylinder. Only this time, using the 8 cylinder layout. He\u0027s insane I tells ya! This engine is far too powerful for any sane kerbal to use. Without some weight on the rotor, it will easily tear its self apart. But with this power comes great responsibility... And the ability to spin true HUGE, Monstrous even, rotors. This thing laughs at MK3 parts like they were mere tinker toys, and burns the fuel to prove it.\n\nPart count: 254\n\nWeight: 35.3 tons\n\nlevel of insanity needed to use this engine: Extreme\n\ncomes with 30 seconds of fuel at no...
