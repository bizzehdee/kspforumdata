Meant to Help Kerbals maneuver through urban environments while sitting on top of jet engines. The idea was scrapped when the engineers realized that Kerbin had no urban environments. However, one of the volunteer test-pilots stole the schematics and set off to finish the project. Using parts from his personal junkyard, Jebediah Kerman designed and manufactured the final version of the X-1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoyed that little backstory. Now, for the words of the real developer. I live near an air and space museum that I visit quite a lot. On one such visit, they had a one-day-only exhibit featuring a craft that hovered by the use of jet engines mounted on the bottom. My first thoughts were \u0022That\u0027s Kerbal\u0022 and thus the X-1 project began.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9tSm7.png\u0022 alt=\u00229tSm7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PHPbP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PHPbP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x8Zd2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022x8Zd2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Do3sd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Do3sd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-17T23:54:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2012 11:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by randyrules711\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"that1guy","CreatedById":14276,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T19:22:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartan117","CreatedById":25092,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T23:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJeb finished the craft but Bob flew it?
