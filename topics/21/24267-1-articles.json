If so, I would recommend clustering aerospikes instead of either the LV-T30\u0027s, or even better, those inefficient mainsails (switch to LVT-45\u0027s then for control).

Each cluster is 1 mainsail with 6 LVT-45\u0027s ringed around. I burned up almost every liter of fuel just getting it into orbit, but now that it is there, I can fill it up in short order. I\u0027ve seen a few other posts where the tapered tail section from aircraft was used to add radius at the base of the fuel tank. I tried many times to duplicate it, but couldn\u0027t get them to attach. Then I put 6 large I beams around the base and then they snapped into place. The 2 side engines are attached to a box of I-beams that extend either side of the main tanks. I covered the area with plates and mounted the battery bank then attached the 6 smaller fuel tanks to the crossbeams. 4 of the smaller tanks feed the center tank and 2 feed the outboard tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
