Solar powered space planes are nothing ground breaking or anything, I\u0027ve done similar things before, but this one surprised me with its efficiency. I\u0027m always trying to make spaceplanes with lots of dv to spare, which usually requires nuclear engines, which adds weight, resulting in big spaceplanes. Using ion engines forced me to think minimalistically and voila! the solar spaceplane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://minus.com/i/DtAbNXaM5brU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.minus.com/jDtAbNXaM5brU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jDtAbNXaM5brU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing reaches a circular orbit of 77km with more than 10000 dv! Ion engines being what they are it\u0027s probably a challenge to take this craft to the mun or minmus, as burn times are pretty long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there it is. Easy to make too, just look at the picture if you want it (easier than downloading a craft file).
