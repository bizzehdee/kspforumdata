That is why it was heavily advertised as a 1.1 feature and then dropped from every single 1.1 release notes. ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif \u0022:rolleyes:\u0022)\n\n As a fix Squad had to disable them when they are clipped a certain amount into other parts to stop a phantom force. It is trial and error to get them to work. Make sure they are not too clipped and see if the wheels work. If not move them outward a little bit at a time and test them.\n\nIf your ramp is secured away from the hinge area you will need to strut it to keep it secure until it is released."},{"CreatedByName":"buhochileno","CreatedById":117167,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T16:54:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 23 hours ago, Frank\\_G said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks a lot! The answer is yes. It can land on Duna.
