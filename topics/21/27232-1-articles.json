Sam Kerby here, nice to meet you all. So i have decided i want to start making my own videos of the adventures that i have in KSP. My focus on these episodes will be more about the adventure and not so much about the building and launching phases. I only have one video at the moment, and i will admit i need some practice making videos and narrating. I am hoping to spend a lot more time on episode two and future episodes. So if you are interested in subscribing or commenting here is my first video. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/S2E0go1cLFI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you fellow Kerbals! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T12:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood luck with it.
