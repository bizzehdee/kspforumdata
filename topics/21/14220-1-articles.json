I only currently have two majorly sucessful designs, both of them based on different wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EDP-1 Destroyer\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowered by eather 2 or 4 engines, this testbed was designed to test the hell out of the forward swept wing made from stock parts (not the moded large forward swept wing by JellyCubes or the canard).

It dampens the pitch and roll though, so is better on a bomber than a fighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EDP-2 Lifter\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis aircraft is a basic flying wing. As with the Destroyer, the wing has a pitch and roll damping effect, so a better bomber than fighter. This wing though is the most efficiant I have found, having been able to fly from Kerbal Space Center to the other easter egg space center, and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WXFIv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WXFIv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally good wing design, but very hard to impement compared to the Forward swept wing of the destroyer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"red7paulbrennan","CreatedById":24479,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T06:23:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Every nice\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny chance at the .craft files :\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
