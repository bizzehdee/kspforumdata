Also i\u0027ve noticed that by having my lift engines angled like that, using the \u0022q\u0022 and \u0022e\u0022 keys to kill horizontal velocity was much easier and responsive. I\u0027ve also taken into account fuel consumption and the CoG (center of gravity) moving, with this craft you don\u0027t have to worry about that since even on a empty fuel tank the CoL (center of lift) is still slightly behind the CoG and more of less in the same position as the full fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tree_lord","CreatedById":125697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T04:58:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVTOL-SSTO Space Station Re-fueler design in the works.
