Now, if you were to build a fairing with 1x1 plates and then weld it into two halfs and name it correctly, FAR would detect it as a fairing and use it. You still need non-stock parts to do it, but there are ways to do it without (permanently) downloading another mod (welding plugin recommended to do this; plugin component can be removed afterwards).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
