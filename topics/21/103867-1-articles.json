We cannot assume that sentient life on other worlds would take the same form as our own. Research (aka. hypothesizing without any true evidence, and claiming to have said evidence anyway) into the possible reproduction process of a Kerbal has revealed that there is a high likelihood that pollen-based transfers of genetic material may be a key part of the process.\n\nThe lack of physical differences between males and females of the species, if they do physically exist separately at all, is also a good sign that there is something else at work here."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T11:08:25Z","Content":"Nice!
