In the near future we will be offering this as a gateway to other planets - spend 6 months on Mun or Minmus, spend 4 years on a trip to Duna. Perhaps one day even Laythe. The Possibilities are endless. The skies await you.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to build a space hotel in LKO complete with a vehicle to get tourists from Kerbin and back. The Hotel is to provide ample room (Hitch-hiker Compartment for two tourists each) and no need for them to use their jetpacks in EVA. At the moment the stock game cannot transfer crew from one capsule to another so a ladder system was needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried countless times to create an SSTO which will take a hitch-hiker capsule in to low orbit, rendezvous with the hotel and to dock the hitch-hiker capsule to the station with the option of leaving it there so inter-planetary vessels can grab the capsule and take it to wherever it needs to go without the tourists having to even leave the capsule itself. The SSTO then refuels at the station and brings a hitch-hiker capsule back to Kerbal Space Centre where it can refuel and pick up more passengers and take off again. Originally I tried a space plane, over and over and over again. 99% of them ended up as a fireball near the end of the runway or splashing in to the ocean. One the rare occasions I do get one past the island the fuel changes the balance and it flat spins in to the water. Not going to space today. Eventually I hit upon creating a rocket/ssto design which will lift off vertically using jets and use rockets once the atmosphere gets too thin. After about 8 different redesigns I settled on the one you\u0027ll see below. This first one is call DreamCatcher and the hotel has room for another to be docked at the same time so I\u0027m going to create a few more so they can be cycled (BlackCat \u0026amp; RabbitsFoot are currently under construction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeware this is going to be picture intensive, I was going to put these all in an album but I\u0027ll put some of the highlights on their own so I can go through the premier trip with you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6Nm0fya.png\u0022 alt=\u00226Nm0fya.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeet Tomler, Hans, Samlin, Nedfry \u0026amp; Sidfred Kerman. They have spent the week at the KSC and its late evening and time for the trip they have eagerly been waiting for (they took like two hundred photos of their tour in the KSC but I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d want to see those!). The buggy has come to pick them and their luggage up outside their temporary living quarters ready to take them to the DreamCatcher waiting for them on the launch field outside.

From left to right: Starboard docking port for larger craft and future expansion. Next we have the two parking docking ports for the SSTOs to connect on to once they have dropped off their cargo/hitch-hiker compartments. The next two ports are where the Hitch-hicker compartments sit, these can be stacked but normally there is only 1 on each side. These are connect via ladders to the passenger quarters which is next (top middle). Behind those are the orange fuel storage tanks \u0026amp; liquid fuel only tanks to resupply the SSTO\u0027s and interplanetary craft that visit. At the centre of the image we have a large docking port for expansion and at the bottom centre we have the crew quarters and Cupola C\u0026amp;C for the station itself. Tourists can visit this via the ladder system for some stunning views of Kerbin and an insight to the workings of the station. At the far right is the port docking system - 4 normal docking ports and 1 central senior port for large craft. This is provided for servicing the station as well as any other visiting craft - two of the docking ports are accessible via the ladders (one of which has been extended!). In the dark on the senior port is the station tug (rcs and probe body) there in case anything needs moving around! The hotel was named after my Wife who put up with my Kerbal addiction and watches Murder She Wrote in the other room. You always has to name something in your latest game craze after your SO - it goes a long way (Had a planet called Sarah-Jane in OGame when I played it too!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7YWIUOV.png\u0022 alt=\u00227YWIUOV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe back of the hotel showing the fuel tanks and DreamCatcher docked on its parking docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UpnYF49.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UpnYF49.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first brave tourist doing an EVA with the ladder system fully deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vXunJS3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vXunJS3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe network of ladders enables you to get to both SSTO hitch-hiker compartment docks, the hotel living quarters, the staff and C\u0026amp;C systems and the two port docking ports.
