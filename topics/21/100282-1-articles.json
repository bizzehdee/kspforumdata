How\u0027s the ride?"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T03:50:12Z","Content":"The ride was surprisingly good! Some tell me the rover wheels get punctured easily but in this setup the suspension seems perfectly soft and compliant, making for a surprisingly comfortable ride over all terrain. I haven\u0027t had a punctured tyre yet. The truck also survived an accidental drop down steep terrain (actually, the side of a kerbinside structure) without much damage, leading me to think that a Top Gear style durability test is in order. \n\nHowever, it being a truck, taking sharp turns at high speed is definitely not recommended!"}]}
