It turned out to be one hell of a tricky build. Simply due to my inability to be happy with anything I make!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI rebuilt and rebuilt, then rebuilt it again, better, cleaner and more reliable. It is now exemplary. I have tested it over and over again. In the first few versions I had a door to the hab that swung open by gravity and became a ramp for the rover inside to drive out and the crew to get inside the lower level of the hab. It was great, it worked every time and looked good too. I was not impressed enough by it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nas it did not close again which left me unsatisfied. So I began to think of a way to be able to open and close the door. I used the original doors swing mechanism, the now well-ish known method of using ant engines as a hinge. Even though I had created a different, smaller method of turning the engine into a hinge it was not even close to being good enough to open and close smoothly and reliably. It would get jammed and stuck as it swung.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then tried to have a door like a western saloon but the hinge did not like that at all. So I decided to create a door that was pushed upward and would close under its own weight. this would allow the hinge to work as it likes to and allow for a smaller mechanism as gravity would close the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was frustrating in the extreme. At first the door would open fine (I placed two of the smallest landing legs inside the hab to push the door open \u003Cem\u003Esee video\u003C/em\u003E) but it would get stuck open. Part of me wanted to give up at that point and just settle for a door that did not close. So I did what I do when I am stuck and walked away from the build. After a week I felt refreshed enough to tackle it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took over a week from that point to get it working. And work it does, every single time over and over again. It now stays central and does not jam under normal use. I took advantage of the smallest part with a collision mesh, the thermometers. I used these to create the moving part of the hinge and as \u0027stoppers\u0027 to prevent the door from swinging all the way up on Duna and to stop the door from closing inwards. You can see the mechanism working in one of the videos below. The secret to it was to minimize the size of the angles of the thermometer parts in the hinge. Four in a square was far to \u0027sticky\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI added four more to each side and that did the trick. it slides cleanly over the thermometers even in Dunas low gravity. It works best on Kerbin, but only as it closes faster. There are four AI pods for weight and two batteries that charge during the day and then power the door light at night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, enough about that damn door..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could technically call this a \u0027mini\u0027 craft pack as the scales are lower than they would have been IRL and the crew has been reduced to three to simplify the return journey pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough the actual proposed Mars Direct mission would have ISRU sadly the current parts are way too big for these craft. I will take another look at ISRU after the smaller parts are released. It would have made making the launch vehicle far simpler. As it stands now the Duna return vehicle has all of its fuel on-board from launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, on to some of the other unique parts of this mission pack. I have been using the no offset limits mod for a few months now and I have a million ideas of how to use it to improve my designs. I have, in this case, done just that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used it to attach the door to a docking port at the rear of the Hab rover bay that allows for a very slimline and hassle free mechanism. I have also used it to place the decoupler for the rover trailer below the hab itself so it falls to the ground and does not stay inside the hab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother aspect of Zubrin\u0027s proposed mission was to reuse old shuttle engines effectively making a launcher with offset thrust. In my earlier versions I had a version of the launcher that had this offset engine cluster. I managed to make a smaller version of the launcher, possibly the first launcher like this but the DRV was way too heavy and the launch vehicle did not have enough thrust after the boosters had gone and clipping the same engine inside itself just looked crappy so I ditched the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis Gif will give you an idea of what it looked like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/87YEIGb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002287YEIGb.gif\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/87YEIGb.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I went with a more conventional launcher, still modeled on the ARES V series of launchers that would be used in the real mission though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission consists of three launches, the first is the unmanned Duna return vehicle and then the second \u0027back up\u0027 return vehicle which will land within rover distance of the first. After these two are safely on the surface of Duna then you can launch the crewed hab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth the DRV and the HAB are designed to execute a powered landings after detaching from the chutes. The video shows this in detail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother part of the real mission that is missing in this on due to stock part limitations, is the tether that was designed to create an artificial gravity for the crew. I added docking ports so you can detach and dock the Hab to the transfer stage. This way you can use the left over fuel to assist with finding the landing site for the Hab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to make a cool video to show off this pack and I found a great video online called \u0027Mars direct in a nutshell\u0027. It is an edit of a longer film called \u0027The Mars underground\u0027. I removed the parts that my pack did not have but for the rest I recreated it using my Duna Direct craft. I used the audio from the video and just matched up the in-game visuals. I am only using Windows movie maker so I was quite limited in the kind of editing I could do. It\u0027s still a great watch though and shows exactly what can be done with my craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDuna Direct in a nutshell\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnvfMMLBqac?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will summarize a few important points if you want to fly the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E-Do NOT time warp with the DRV or HAB when moving in atmosphere!

It is removable and re-dockable. The mechanism, is an offshoot of my door mechanism and opens the door (lol) to many possibilities. I have made a video of some example craft I made using the trailer mechanism.

The separator is attached to the node of the cubic strut and the trailer part (the ant engine) is surface attached to the same separator. All you have to do to make the trailer is surface attach a part to the ant engine and build it from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you separate the stack separator the ant engine will fall into the little cradle made from thermometers. you are then free to drive around with your new trailer!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, I think that about covers it. The Kerbals have space to move around inside both the DRV and the HAB. There is a small one seat rover in the DRV and the ramp is deployed by undocking the little docking port next to the rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are some pictures of the mission and crafts.

As I spend a large amount of time making sure my craft are as good as I can make them. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would be very interested to hear about your idea for a lower part count door. If that is what you meant. As using the parts I have, you cannot remove a sinle part without it failing. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet me know where you saw that z-fighting mate, do you play with lower settings? Because if not, and you genuinely saw \u0026#39;horrific\u0026#39; z-fighting, the only other thing that can cause that is the symmetry bug. I know how to work around that and the craft on my HDD are bug free so I am very interested to know what you saw. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks again dude.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMJ[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh, the Z-fighting was mostly on the launcher, both in the SRBs and in the main tanks.

As it was not really visible on ascent and then staged anyway I was happy with it. I too try to remove it from my builds, it is an ugly phenomena. My MAV is heavy so needed the extra SRBs. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes sadly no ISRU but I will get around to adding it to my MAV, now that we have the nice small parts. This will allow me to reduce the number of SRBs required for launch. I think I will set it up so that the drill extends out of the second door on the MAV. That way it keeps its clean lines and that door has a use other than to just stand in.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a few other things that need to be added to bring it more into line with the proposed mission, I would really like much smaller \u0026#39;gathering\u0026#39; parts for the ISRU and something akin to KAS would be great. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet me know how you get on with your low part ones man.\n"}]}
