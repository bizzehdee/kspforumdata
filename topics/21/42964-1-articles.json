But I also wanted a rover where it could do something more than just gather data. So I went about making a durable rover capable of handling large loads for the most flexibility in the modules. It of course had to be as light as possible so i could actually get it to where I wanted to go, and I soon found out it also had to be balanced so that it wouldn\u0027t roll the craft while landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://sites.google.com/site/ouchsdownloads/home/downloads/Modular%20Rover.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Modular%20Rover.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd from above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://sites.google.com/site/ouchsdownloads/home/downloads/Modular%20Rover%20Top.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Modular%20Rover%20Top.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt comes with 1610 Power, 800 xenon, a headlight, 2 solar panels and 2 1x6 deployable panels and weighs in at only 2 tons but:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://sites.google.com/site/ouchsdownloads/home/downloads/Modular%20Rover%20Heavy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Modular%20Rover%20Heavy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep it can handle turning 90 degrees while moving 36 tons down the launch ramp and up the 2 steep rail ramps without blowing any of it\u0027s 4 light duty buggy wheels because of the way it was designed. The trick is that there are node joints where flexibility is needed and welds where strong joints count the most. Making for a very robust vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also well balanced which is crucial for low gravity roving.
