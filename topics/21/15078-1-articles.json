So I was thinking, wouldn\\\u0027t it be nice to have a new one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027d like to add a new feature to the new one, \u0027reviews\u0027, where I test out your stock craft and, if it\\\u0027s good, do a video of it. We could then have a \u0027Stock Hall of Fame\u0027, a section of the repository for very successful ships (all with video reviews).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve built a number of good ships in my time here, some of my credentials are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9764.msg144713#msg144713\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAurora Munar Fuel Tanker [0.14.3]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12624\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EB-52 Kerbalfortress [0.15]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=16817\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EB-2 Spirit of Kerbin [0.16]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I have a computer capable of handling almost any ship you want reviewed.

More advanced ratings would include the same factors being evaluated after landing at a standard location on the Mun, also by MechJeb.
