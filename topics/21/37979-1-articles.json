Small craft with small wings don\u0027t land on their gears well. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Neither do the parachutes treat the craft well until you can get below 60km/s, and this requires fuel for the landing which isn\u0027t possible yet. The idea of the craft is to bring a man up or return a man from a space station or other spacecraft orbiting between 80km-120km, with the station refueling the shuttlecraft. If I can design the landing better, the craft should allow a fully fueled starting descent from orbit with enough fuel to get back into orbit - a true Star Trek esque shuttlecraft. It also sports a computer core so it can pick up stranded Kerbals from the surface below and bring them either up into orbit and rendezvous, or back to the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are images of the Shuttlecraft Type I Prototype Mk 2 as it goes through several stages of development. Let me know what you think, or if you have any suggestions.

The Mk. 2 carries a docking port and RCS. It flies very well, very fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal is to complete development on this before .21 since if I can make it work without the new SAS (and it does so now very well), then it will shine very very very very well with the new SAS - it might even be possible to land the thing without chutes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk here is the Type I Prototype Mk 2a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/KAOuY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
