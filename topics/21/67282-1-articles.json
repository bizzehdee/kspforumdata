It will continuously try to slowly pitch down. Just keep tapping up and you can go on as if nothing was the matter. The craft can take off starting at about 80 - 100 m/s on the runway. While not loaded down, the A-7 Lance is an acrobat. When loaded down, you can still fly fairly well, but watch your banks. Pull up into your turns and periodically adjust the bank to stay level while turning (unless of course your goal is pitch down some in the bank). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAttack Runs\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the weaponry and \u003Cem\u003Eactually\u003C/em\u003E hitting things can be difficult, whether the ordinance is dumb-fire, guided, or simply released. Ultimately, learning the weapons themselves and practicing with them is the only way to get better with them. See the following tips on each weapon (and look into my corporation page in the sig as I post more and more of the actual munitions; I will release more detailed guides on how to use them as time permits).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ER-14 III Mischief Rocket\u003C/span\u003E - This is the Mk. III variant of the Mischief Light Rocket series. This weapon is dumb-fired in pairs. While it is actually controllable, since the weapon is paired, you can only really control one shot at a time...your choice I suppose. The rockets fly fairly straight (save for the occasionally ADD stray...\u0026gt;_\u0026gt;), so the best attack run I\u0027ve found on smaller targets is to come in low and fire at the edge of the roof of your target. For larger targets, just aim and shoot. Your craft\u0027s velocity vector and physical orientation are your aim, so give yourself lots of room and time for your attack run. Finally, when lined up and ready, make sure you are fully throttled and fire away! Range is something from 1 - 3km accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ER-15 Riot Guided Rocket\u003C/span\u003E - The complications in this weapon are two-fold: switching to the weapon and getting it on target. Press Space-Bar to release an R-15. Press \u0022]\u0022 twice to switch to the R-15. Using the navball and visual reckoning, turn the weapon toward your target. When pointing in the general direction, press Space Bar and make sure you are throttled some. You do not need full throttle until you know you are going to hit. While the weapon will do much more with a harder kinetic hit, it means nothing if you can\u0027t hit the target because it\u0027s going too fast, so take some time and practice hitting things. Anything that can be targeted should be. Remember to burn to rendezvous, like docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EB-C1 Cluster Bomb\u003C/span\u003E - This baby is simple and difficult all at once. To release the bombs, just press 1. All the bombs will deploy and go \u0027splode on something. Yippee! The bad news is that gravity and Kerbin\u0027s drag-o-doom makes it difficult to judge when to release to your target. My best advice is conduct dive bombs on your targets. Line up your vessel with the target and make sure you are coming down at your target, aiming as if you\u0027re going be \u003Cem\u003Ejuuust\u003C/em\u003E flying over the target. Release the bombs 400 - 750m from your target. You start to get a \u0022feel\u0022 for when the right time to release is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThanks for stopping by!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGet your A-7 Lance today!
