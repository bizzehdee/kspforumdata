Built to defend the airspace of the cold northern n\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4tion \u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6f Kweden, where young Kerbals are taught to fight polar be\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4rs and umlauts reign supreme, the KAAB 37 Thunderbolt is intended to serve where other fighter jets c\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4nnot: on icy windswept airfields, cracked asph\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A5lt roads, even dirt and gravel runways in the middle of the f\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6rest!\n\n*Inspired by the Swedish SAAB 37 \u0027Viggen\u0027 (Thunderbolt)*\n\n**Specifications**\n\nP\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A5rts: 93\n\nMass: 15.7t\n\nCrew: 1-2\n\nHeight: 4.7m\n\nWingsp\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4n: 8.3m\n\nLength: 12.6m\n\nPowerplant(s): 1x V\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6lv\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6 Modified, Double J-X4 Whiplash Turbo Ramjet Engine *(for realistic performance, I had to merge together two turbojets - no Z fighting though)*\n\nMaximum SL Speed: Mach 1\n\nMaximum Speed: Mach 3 @17.0 km altitude\n\nUtility Equipment: 1x External Fuel Tank\n\n**Operational Guide**\n\n**Commands**\n\n1 - Toggle engine\n\n2 - Drop fuel tank\n\n**Takeoff**\n\nTakeoff is a very straightforw\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A5rd procedure: just commence rotation as soon as possible. The KAAB 37 is \u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4ble to fly at very low airspeeds.\n\n**Flight**\n\nThe KAAB 37 is an extraordinarily stable fighter. It also turns rel\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A5tively well. As we say in Kweden: \u0022just en\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6ugh is best\u0022. Do not be afraid of exceeding the structural integrity of the aircr\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A5ft in high speed maneuvers - it\u0027s simply impossible!\n\n**Landing**\n\nDrop the external fuel t\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4nk before landing. Approach the runway at around 100-120 m/s, f\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6r the final approach, lower this speed to around 70-80 m/s.\n\n**Link**\n\n[http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230456-kaab-37-thunderbolt-stock-replica](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230456-kaab-37-thunderbolt-stock-replica)\n\n**Album**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
