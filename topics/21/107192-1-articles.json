There\u0027s ladders in the back to get back in to return home. The top part above the garage separates to leave the garage behind when going back to orbit. On reentry to Kerbin, the lander can decouples revealing a heat shield underneath. Drogue and regular chutes are on top of the can.\n\nThen there\u0027s the mining rig:\n\n[![yBT2H6th.png](http://i.imgur.com/yBT2H6th.png)](http://imgur.com/yBT2H6t)\n\nYes, it\u0027s a VTOL and works great with the low gravity of Minmus. It is also a rover so I can drive around to the best drilling spots. And if I happen to land on a slope, I can drive to a flat spot.\n\n[![jMU12Zah.png](http://i.imgur.com/jMU12Zah.png)](http://imgur.com/jMU12Za)\n\nWith all the XL panels, I can run all 6 drills AND the ISRU converter during sunlight hours. If that\u0027s not enough, the service compartment inside the cargo bay holds fuel cell arrays for more juice. During the night, I can run 3 drills all night long.\n\n[![aaX6DHZh.png](http://i.imgur.com/aaX6DHZh.png)](http://imgur.com/aaX6DHZ)\n\nIn less than 1.5 Minmus days I can have everything filled, mono, fuel, and the ore tank.\n\n1500 Ore\n\n850 Monoprop\n\n5602 LF\n\n6847 O2\n\nThen I fly up to my orbital refuelling station, dock, transfer, convert the rest of the ore to fuel, and keep just enough to land again. The big engine on the back is from Atomic Age, it\u0027s the lightbulb nuclear engine and is very efficient for lugging this full ship around orbit. Also made it easy to get from LKO to LMO by burning little fuel, but still having decent TWR.\n\nSpeaking of the refueling station:\n\n[![YlDcerGh.png](http://i.imgur.com/YlDcerGh.png)](http://imgur.com/YlDcerG)\n\nThe station holds 19440 LF and 23760 O2. I still have to send up a monoprop tank to attach to one of the docking ports, and maybe a xenon tank. But the station itself is simple.\n\nAnd finally, the little rover I brought up with the 2 Kerbals. I landed a few KM away so that both ships weren\u0027t loaded at the same time and drove over. It also has an ore surface scanner to find a high concentration on the way.\n\n[![C4uxyuyh.png](http://i.imgur.com/C4uxyuyh.png)](http://imgur.com/C4uxyuy)"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T02:39:04Z","Content":"![QdoTyF2.png](http://i.imgur.com/QdoTyF2.png)\n\nJeb seems happy to have arrived. After landing six and a half kilometers way on board the tanker, he had to drive across a 2km diameter crater to get to the wellhead.\n\nThis is the first two pieces of equipment for my Munar operations. The plan is to have many of these wellheads set down in everywhere (in a large area w/80% density for 3.4% total crustal presence) and ship the ore to a central processing \u0026 storage location via these tanker rovers. Each one can drain two wellheads from full before returning."},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T02:59:41Z","Content":"Need to build a Red Dwarf replica for asteroid mining!"},{"CreatedByName":"PB.Osiris","CreatedById":131431,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T16:18:14Z","Content":"Hey guys! Some really nice designs here.\n\nWith 1.0 I started a mining project, too. First I did some tests and these are the results. (just using mechjeb)\n\nFor all those with slow internet, i will just post the links.\n\nFirst of all, dedicated to great great Freelancer, a Refinery and Trading Station, called **Freihafen 1**.\n\nYou can find 2 ISRU Converter in the centre, driven by a Fusion core.\n\nFor supplies there are different types of tanks, including Xenon-Gas and ore tanks.\n\nEverybody knows, transfers take time, so every little trader out there can visit the crew areas for some drinks, gamble and more.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eqQorU3.png?1\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eqQorU3.png?1\n\nThe second craft is a probe called **Deadalus**. On the pic it\u0027s the MK1 version without own drive, created for scans on Mun and Minimus.\n\nIt\u0027s 100% self sustaining and searches Planets and Moons for ore. The MK2 version works with 2 Ion-Drives for deep-space missions.\n\n[http://imgur.com/6eFIzJ4](http://imgur.com/6eFIzJ4)\n\nThe third craft is also the fourth. It\u0027s the **Athene-Mining-Base**, a heavy, extreme deep drilling construction and the first of their type.\n\nSix drills can extract and storage over 10.000 tons of ore. On one of the docking ports you can see the low gravity frighter **Ares**, designed to transport\n\n2.000 tons of ore in a stable orbit, dock to a bigger frighter (next craft) and return to the mining base.\n\n[http://imgur.com/mEycwiO](http://imgur.com/mEycwiO)\n\nNow my last craft, the frighter **Mercury**. It can carry 6.000 tons of ore through space, usually to Freihafen 1.\n\nIts driven with a sixpack of nuclear engines. With Cpt. Lela on board, this Ship is just perfect for it\u0027s transportation job. \n\n[http://imgur.com/tt1Wstn](http://imgur.com/tt1Wstn)\n\nWell, that\u0027s what i constructed some weeks ago.

On the far side is a bolt on ore silo which landed with it\u0027s own little cart that enabled it to be moved and docked to the rig. On the near side is the fuel transporter (this is a larger version than I had originally). It lands nearby and the 6 wheeled cart drives under it and raises itself up on a number of medium legs to dock with the transporter (docks with 3 small docking ports). The legs on both the lander and cart are raised so it\u0027s lowered back onto it\u0027s wheels and can drive up to the drilling rig to dock. The small lander on the right is what the engineers arrived in and will enable them to get back to orbit when their shift is done. \n\nThe main rig is a bit top heavy and needs a very level spot to land, the cart is actually the first bit of kit to arrive so I could drive about and find a nice level spot to land the rig. I wanted it so the drills where mostly inside the craft when it folder up, and when deploy you\u0027d get a view of the drilling from IVA mode.\n\n[![wNapykdm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wNapykdm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/wNapykd)[![V4BgAqUm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/V4BgAqUm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/V4BgAqU)\n\nBut there have been some complaints that having a drill on the other side was just a little close to the door and could be a health hazard\n\n[![tKgiSa0l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tKgiSa0l.jpg)](http://imgur.com/tKgiSa0)\n\nThis was a daft idea and done just to see if it was possible; a VTOL drilling plane\n\n[![j4UaxaKl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/j4UaxaKl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/j4UaxaK)[![2NvslRHl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2NvslRHl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/2NvslRH)\n\nThe drill is at an angle inside the cargo bay (and only just fits like that), when the craft lands it kneels forward onto a set of landing legs and the drill is able to extend into the ground (all-be-it at a very shallow angle). When full of ore (it has 4 small ore tanks) it is only just about powerful to lift off. But it works, although I\u0027ve no system for connecting it to a converter, but it was just a proof of concept. I may make something based on this idea to use on Laythe."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T18:35:40Z","Content":"Moved to Spacecraft Exchange, the place for showcase threads."},{"CreatedByName":"Bluntie","CreatedById":91416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T18:59:05Z","Content":"Damn, guys.
