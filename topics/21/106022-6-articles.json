I had to restart the autopilot when the burn was about 5.0 m/s off from what was intended.  This is fine until the final velocity matching is needed, since the craft can\u0027t come to a standstill.  Of course, there is also the docking autopilot issues, but I did mention that in my previous posts.\n\u003E \n\nSo apparently MechJeb for 1.2 isn\u0027t out yet?

However, these are still dev builds; the build in the main page on Curse is the 1.1.3 build.\n\nEDIT: I recently switched to the latest build, and while it seems to work slightly better during rendezvous maneuvers, the roll controls are still *very* unstable when performing docking maneuvers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-22T05:16:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2016 05:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by squiddyjc**"},{"CreatedByName":"Naito","CreatedById":18126,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-20T16:40:50Z","Content":"So after a long hiatus, I present the Resolution, updated for KSP 1.4!\n\nyes shuttles are out of style now, but I still love them so here\u0027s another!\n\nMeticulously rebalanced all around:\n\n- Uses new 1.4 parts for proper size ratios between ET/Shuttle/boosters\n\n- Solved \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E launch oscillation (was due to change in stability algorithms or something, since the control nodes are always offset from the centre of mass it was messing up badly)\n\n- Fully certified for 36T of cargo with zero modifications.
