It turns out that they are quite versatile and can be used for many applications. Since they can fire and decouple simultaneously, only one click is required per shot, which makes them much easier to use as launchable rockets than the larger SRBs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is that the rocket attachment point is off the center of mass of the decoupler, but this can be overcome with some trial and error. These rockets are weight balanced and spin stabilized so they have reasonable accuracy. There are 18 missiles on this airplane for a total of 15 shots. The last 3 shots fire double for stability reasons. You will need a direct hit to damage other vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe takeoff speed is about 60 m/s and it is fairly tailstrike proof. If you have any stability problems, try disabling the front tank fuel flow before takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking about naming it \u0022Rocket Truck\u0022 but then people might think it\u0027s really a truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img145.imageshack.us/img145/9307/screenshot11b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot11b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8789/screenshot32ay.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot32ay.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img802.imageshack.us/img802/8264/screenshot50l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot50l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/5273/screenshot68l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot68l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/8667/screenshot92c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot92c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-12T23:06:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2012 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eelikay","CreatedById":49984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T01:53:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is pretty freakin awesome for stock parts!
