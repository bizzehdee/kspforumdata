Stock rewards low part count and minimal clipping, since every part not in a cargo bay is considered \u0022clean\u0022 regarding aerodynamic forces, and each open node is thus a source of drag. FAR rewards clipping, since it creates the voxel model and doesn\u0027t care how much you clip stuff inside.\n\nAll in all, building in stock is more complicated I\u0027d imagine, because you have a limited room budget, you can\u0027t just throw more stuff in and have to consider how every part contributes to the design. And some compound shapes just can\u0027t be done reasonably, and you are mostly limited to the set of parts Squad gave us, which do impose some limitations. BUT. When you make a stock design work, it can be just a beautiful as any FAR ship, with a fraction of the parts they usually take, which considering the performance of the game these days, it\u0027s a good thing in my book. And decently designed planes work just as \u0022realistically\u0022 in both systems, especially since 1.04. Or, you know, that is my impression from following FAR from the sides: it has a couple tiny interesting things (like area ruling), but it MUCH more exploitable than stock as things stand.\n\nRune. Take it all as honest curiosity, and you know, to each their own."},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T10:39:45Z","Content":"It\u0027s true, to each their own. \n\nI want fluid dynamics, I want to choose NACA airfoils, choose the number of compressor stages and even choose between jet fuel atomizers or vaporizers. The voxel system is a start in the right direction. FAR cannot see a wing as one unit yet, therefore building a proper airfoil is futile. But it will happen. There\u0027s a big difference between players who want something to work because they feel it\u0027s fun that way, and the players striving towards realism all the time. I like stock for most things, but was pretty upset when my turboshaft principle went down the drain when 1.0 arrived. The old Errordynamics were even farther from realism, but when you build carefully, you could achieve very realistic handling, except for the missing stall. Why I built those huge propeller planes? In the hope I could inspire people to do something different. I\u0027m waiting for a new plugin to mature. When it\u0027s ready, a bunch of freaks like me are going to build piston engines.\n\nBesides that, BUFF1 became really a problem with stock aero. Under FAR, the 12 basic jets gave it a comfortable Mach 0.85 at 33% thrust and a max flying time of 25 hours, but you need all that power to take off with 100t cargo. With stock aero, even with 12 turbo-ramjets at 100%, the top speed maxed out at Mach 0.4 and only a few hours flying time. That\u0027s too much a departure from my original design AND real life.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T11:10:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 11:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Azimech**"},{"CreatedByName":"ryan234abc","CreatedById":136492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:25:02Z","Content":"My God... 320 parts...
