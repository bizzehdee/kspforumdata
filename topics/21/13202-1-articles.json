I drew and I drew, each design worse than the next, very few ever making it into prototype stage, and those that did rarely causing a flicker of interest. I sat this way for dozens upon dozens of \u003Cem\u003Eminutes\u003C/em\u003E wondering just what to do! but alas, to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo calm my nerves and open my creative side I had a glass of chilled white wine, the cool liquid soothing all my woes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne, then two, then three bottles later and I finally had it! The design of the century! A durable craft to be looked upon as strong, yet dainty and agile to cause sighs of pleasure and merriment to befall those that were entranced by its gorgeous flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt had not one set of wings, for those are far too simple, and not two; this wasn\\\u0027t to be a craft for just any uncivilized person to use. Three was far too mainstream, barely adequate to serve as the tail. This vehicle was to be special, unique! 5 sets of wings vertically stacked for maximum euphoria! My masterpiece was far too elegant to suffer a high speed impact with the harsh world; a stylish parachute was a must have!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sat back and looked at my wondrous creation and knew that my purpose on this planet was fulfilled.
