I\u0027ll see if I can get it out by 7:00, but I can\u0027t make any promises.\n\u003E EDIT: I suppose I had better at least give a quick status update to make up for being late.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve got five potential selections so far, I would really like more, so if you know of a thread I probably missed (Maybe something that was posted on Sunday/Monday and is way down at the bottom of the page) be sure to send me the link to it so I can check it out. If I can get more, I\u0027m going to list the top five craft, as well as two honorable mentions. If I can\u0027t find any more candidates, I might have to pick a top three and two honorable mentions or just do a top five and forgo Honorable Mentions entirely. Another thing to know, I won\u0027t be listing two craft by the same builder in the top five/three list.\n\nNo rush. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Good luck BB coding.

Just remember to not turn too early and not too fast! Maybe see if mech Jeb will put it into orbit for you. Then you can focus on the docking and landing.\n\n I find the rocket a joy to fly, but if you haven\u0027t been into space for a while it may be tricky."},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T11:47:47Z","Content":"From observation it seems the testers\u0027 schedules are quite packed with awesome craft this week; I\u0027ll delay my craft release until next week (or can missed crafts make a guest appearance at the next SF?)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T11:49:51Z","Content":"If they\u0027re exceptionally good in the eyes of whoever is doing the next one."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T12:16:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E From observation it seems the testers\u0027 schedules are quite packed with awesome craft this week; I\u0027ll delay my craft release until next week (or can missed crafts make a guest appearance at the next SF?)\n\nThe only eligibility criteria is that it was released or commented on (no bumping) in that week, after that it is all the subjective view of that weeks maintainer.
