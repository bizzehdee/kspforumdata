Something like this is weird to recreate in KSP. I have made a small missile (of which have two versions) that does this (note: downloads are subassemblies):\n\n**1) Attach Directly to wing version**[**\\[DOWNLOAD\\]**](http://www./download/gkvx7uods1xrvja/Falling\u002BMissile\u002B%5BWing%5D.craft)\n\n![zhARf12.gif](http://i.imgur.com/zhARf12.gif)\n\n![VNFKb4d.png](http://i.imgur.com/VNFKb4d.png)\n\n**2) Cargo-bay; attach via node version** [**\\[DOWNLOAD\\]**](http://www./download/jxafsb7g4r9kawe/Falling\u002BMissile.craft)\n\n![hKguQ8r.gif](http://i.imgur.com/hKguQ8r.gif)\n\n![o2qE5lA.png](http://i.imgur.com/o2qE5lA.png)\n\nIn real life, the missiles have a delayed engine activation, which you cannot (modless) do in KSP. We have to activate the rockets, but have them blocked for a second, and then unblock them. [OKTO2](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Probodobodyne_OKTO2) overheats easily when fired at with sepetrons, thus, all that has to be done is have a main missile body with probe control, sepetrons, and torque(will explain later) and have a OKTO2 block the thrust of the sepetrons (after a couple seconds the OKTO2 will overheat and explode, thus letting the sepetrons thrust away.\n\nIf put a missile in a small cargo-bay (see second gif), the missile will most likely get caught in the back and break your plane and it will not be a good day. So I put a little rocket fuel and some rocket engines on it to fire it downwards. It will clear the bay no matter what acceleration or orientation. The fuel depleting will offset the thrusts a little and a reaction system will make it not pitch or yaw into the wrong directions when that happens. The torque is also nice to roll stability (it will make sure that the rocket engines always point up).\n\nI will probably make more missiles.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T16:14:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 04:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by manni01**"},{"CreatedByName":"dbmorpher","CreatedById":77927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T17:03:20Z","Content":"Cool design! do you know if they\u0027d work in FAR?"},{"CreatedByName":"manni01","CreatedById":109903,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T18:06:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Cool design! do you know if they\u0027d work in FAR?\n\nMost likely.
