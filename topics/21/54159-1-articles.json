There are no lights, no antennas, no scientific equipment.

It\u0027s asparagus-staged, but the central Skipper is held on by a Clamp-O-Tron Sr docking port. Fly a reasonably-efficient ascent, and once your apoapsis is where you want it to be, undock the central Skipper and complete circularization on the lander\u0027s LV-Ns. The result should be a mostly-full containerized Rockomax Jumbo attached to the bottom of the lander by a docking port, and the lander\u0027s tanks can be topped off from that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E On the test flight I threw together, the lander-orange tank combination made it to orbit with more than 8km/s of delta-V available, which is probably enough for the lander to tow its reserve tank to Duna, engine-brake into orbit, detach and land, return to orbit and reattach, go back to Kerbin, and engine-brake into LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/ksp%20shipshare/0.22/Duna%20Lander%20Transport%20System.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/ksp%20shipshare/0.22/Duna%20Lander%20Transport%20System.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mesklin","CreatedById":73898,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T05:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is medium Dune lander \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/228xl75l4539l5r/Cucumber%2520Tin.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022Cucumber Tin\u0022\u003C/a\u003E.
