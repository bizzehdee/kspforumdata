I didn\u0027t like the starwars ships i downloaded tested by Manley , so i\u0027m starting my new series, this is the first of the series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zzZu6ND.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zzZu6ND.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2lNDzS7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222lNDzS7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It also has horizontal landing/take off (the vertical ion thruster are bound to custom action 1 and horizontal 2) and like 100 lights that lag when you turn em on , so you can remove em quite quickly as they are paired. maybe a little too much rcs that also has a performance issue, so remove the ones you dont want. I really like the red ones for the \u0022blasters\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Except for the wings and engines which took a LOT of time to get right since the engines wouldn\u0027t get in a nice position , the rest is totally rearrangeable to your liking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i hope you like it and if not tell me what to change and i will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext one is Jedi starfighter with docking/undocking ring. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the mods i use i don\u0027t know if they all apply for this one tho : B9 aerospace ; procedural fairings ; KW rocketry ; IonHybElec ; Interstellar. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything from interstellar but i\u0027m not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext one is Jedi starfighter with docking/undocking ring.
