I believe my problem largely lies with the high AoA requirement at lower velocities I think, as it basically falls like a rock below 150 m/s; which is rather high to land at for someone who\u0027s never been good at landing in the first place. Having the craft fall through the landscape glitch at high velocities doesn\u0027t help the landing experience, either :/.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgbox.com/RMw8ZYYZ](http://imgbox.com/RMw8ZYYZ)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgbox.com/Dh8QAzQr](http://imgbox.com/Dh8QAzQr)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgbox.com/7BNTkM2e](http://imgbox.com/7BNTkM2e)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgbox.com/dkh3F8PK](http://imgbox.com/dkh3F8PK)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgbox.com/cWK0cK7r](http://imgbox.com/cWK0cK7r)\n\u003E \n\u003E Other than that, so long as you don\u0027t exceed structural tolerances, it flies quite well. Ironically, it even flies well in stock as well except for taking off.\n\u003E \n\u003E Would anyone have suggestions on how to improve its handling at low velocities? Or am I just a terrible pilot?\n\u003E \n\u003E Ideally it would retain it\u0027s overall shape and ability to reach orbit; I am able to reach orbit if I remove one of the rocket fuel tanks, though it\u0027s much more difficult.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks\n\nYou\u0027ve got some pretty significant wing loading going on there - good for high speed flight, bad for pretty much everything else. What\u0027s the takeoff mass of the plane, and what is the FAR analysis telling you about your wing area? How about the AoA at 0km and Mach 0.35?\n\nAn SPH screenie with your CoM and trans-sonic curves visible wouldn\u0027t go amiss in helping to diagnose any potential problems.\n\nI might suggest swapping out that Terrier for something with moar oomph (an Aerospike would do well if you\u0027ve got access, but even a Thud or two would do well - something that gives you more thrust). Just a thought.\n\nEDIT: More craptastic advice from the nugget. If you go to try adding more wing, start with a strake, maybe a Wing Connector C or D aft, and then put your Tail Fin ailerons there; you\u0027d wind up with a cranked arrow wing, which shouldn\u0027t affect the overall shape too terrible much but will give you some more wing. Start with that, and expand it out more if it\u0027s still not enough.

I ended up removing one of the rocket fuel tanks and vertically doubling up the \u0022tail fin\u0022 aileron at the end of the plane. It still falls like a rock at speeds too high for my computer to let me safely land it anywhere, but at least it works on the runways now. Though getting it on the runway early enough that it can slow down can be a challenge, but that\u0027s part of the fun! Overall I think it\u0027s the best spaceplane I\u0027ve built in terms of stability in FAR; certainly the best since nuFAR.\n\n[http://imgbox.com/FZuKHuTC](http://imgbox.com/FZuKHuTC)\n\n[http://imgbox.com/FFMBlEP5](http://imgbox.com/FFMBlEP5)\n\nAnother question: What is the reference area of a plane?

If you place them only on top you would only destroy lift and they will act at liftdumpers that you use on landing to help the plane being stuck on the ground. Placed only on top, in the air they will destroy lift and give a pitch momentum when you need to be as stable as possible on re entry. If they are symmetrical on pitch axe it\u0027s better. You could also placed them laterally on fuselage.\n\nThen about my re entries, i noticed they have been always easier and flyable with no spin and no flip every times i use a very flat angle , i mean entry trajectory begins more than 120 degrees of longitude before landing spot."},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T07:36:35Z","Content":"Well, I put those Airbrakes there just for this reason, to have an easier pitch momentum.

And while a Shuttle-style high-AoA approach works in KSP, it usually isn\u0027t necessary; you\u0027re coming in at 1/3rd of the velocity that the Shuttle had to deal with.
