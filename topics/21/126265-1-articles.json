You may notice that in the staging sequence the jet engines are activated first - seen as we have them we might as well get some use of them at launch to get the launch vehicle up to speed. Stage the jet engines, throttle up to max, hit action group 1 to activate the afterburners to make the engines spool up faster then hit stage again to light the main rocket engine. Watch the resource gauge and once intake air drop to zero hit action group 2 to turn off the jets. We won\u0027t need them again till landing time. Don\u0027t worry too much about delayed switching off jets causing flameout - the Mammoth engine has so much steering authority that it can compensate for any number of jet engine flameouts during ascent.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i65.tinypic.com/2vt5la9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222vt5la9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe SKRV has a take off TWR of 1.60 and being single stage this TWR steadily increases during flight, so an very aggressive ascent profile is needed - if you simply follow the prograde the booster will hit the 75km target AP extremely quickly. So active turn towards the horizon over and above the gravity turn.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i63.tinypic.com/30c9fro.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002230c9fro.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd here we have it, 75km x 75km orbit with 343m/s of delta-V left. I\u0027ve been playing with it for the last few days so I can get a fairly optimal ascent profile now. Conceivably I could put more than 25 tons into orbit but until you have gained lots of experience flying the SKRV I wouldn\u0027t recommend this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i64.tinypic.com/30vg4g6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002230vg4g6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is the 25 ton test payload in orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i68.tinypic.com/124elo7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022124elo7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow we get to the interesting bit. After releasing the payload and having made its way around Kerbin, it\u0027s now time to deorbit the SKRV and return to KSC. Having reached orbit with 343m/s of delta-V left with the payload attached I had more than 400m/s of delta-V after releasing the payload, resulting in this rather steep deorbit burn. Of course the steeper your reentry trajectory the more accurate your landing will be and less trouble you will have with reentry heating.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i64.tinypic.com/izp1u0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022izp1u0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDepending on your trajectory reentry could be pretty... exciting. When I was designing the SKRV I had lots of problem with the Mammoth overheating. I was able to overcome this issue by adding the airbrakes. The airbrakes serve to slow you down just enough in the upper atmosphere that peak heating no longer destroy your engines - in effect the airbrakes reduce the heat load from the Mammoth by spreading out the absorption of kinetic energy. Deploy the airbrakes once the deorbit burn is completed and leave them on as long as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote for very shallow reentry trajectory you may see the airbrakes heat up so much that they would reach max heat, before that happen retract the airbrakes so they can cool down a bit then deploy them again. The Mammoth engine has enough heat capacity that it can take the reentry heat for some time without the help of airbrakes. In this particular case since I have a rather steep reentry profile the airbrakes heated up to a max of just under 84% before cooling down. So I elected to leave the brakes out for the entire reentry.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i67.tinypic.com/2j4awhw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222j4awhw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt some point around 14km the turbojets will start to work. Now is the time to switch them on (action group 2) if you need to do landing site adjustments. In this case it was clear that I was going to overshoot KSC so I fired them at full retrograde. If you find yourself undershooting you want to set SAS to radial and fire the jet engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i66.tinypic.com/2vbwhtv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222vbwhtv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere we see the SKRV flying back to the KSC after overshooting the landing site. It can be a bit tricky to fly but basically it\u0027s not all that different from hovering across the surface of the Mun in a Munlander. From the smoke trail you can see I\u0027ve already built up forward velocity and I have the engines thrusting radial (skywards) to hover horizontally across the sky.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i67.tinypic.com/2i9tlop.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222i9tlop.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nComing into land at the KSC. Although it\u0027s quite possible to do pure powered landing the SKRV is equipped with four parachutes to help make landing easier. Once you are over a good place to land stage the parachutes, set SAS to radial, afterburner off and throttle down for a soft landing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpeaking of afterburner, the operation of afterburner is quite important to SKRV\u0027s hovering capability. Hovering with jet engine has always been a pain in the ass because jets with their turbines are very slow to respond to throttle input unlike rocket engines. When designing the SKRV\u0027s hovering system a stroke of genius flashed across my head - although jet throttle is slow to respond afterburner is instant. And so SKRV was specifically designed to use the afterburner capability to control the hover. The jets have been arranged so that at full throttle and with a nearly empty booster their TWR is just under 1. That means with full throttle thrusting radial the SKRV will fall slowly (but at an increasing rate). To hover stationary you simply pulse the afterburners on and off.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i63.tinypic.com/dqneo3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dqneo3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd here we have it, happy landing back at the KSC not far from where we took off.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote to subassembly users:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i68.tinypic.com/29lh9gj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002229lh9gj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor some reason subassembly mangles up the SKRV\u0027s fuel lines. If you are using SKRV as a subassembly do note you need to take off the nose cone of those 1.25m sections and reattach the fuel line so they run from the ring of 1.25m tanks inward to the center large tank. The 1.25m tanks are divided into two sets of six. Once you\u0027ve fixed the fuel lines you can reattach the nose cones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-14T13:01:31Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2015 01:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n.b.z.","CreatedById":130888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T14:47:19Z","Content":"\nVery nice.
