Set mechjeb to do a 15 degree turn with a start of 6 and end of 69km. She ran out of jets at about 28km, but with the full speed, apoapsis was already 38km. 75x75 orbit was achieved with 2400 dV to spare. Landing was a bit trickier without the forward control surfaces, but it can be done. Better balance on the remaining set of wings would help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggest removing those big scoops and using MOAR ramjets. The scoops become useless at about 12km up. In all, a fun ride and a good example of a lower jet stage for a good-sized payload. Cheers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
