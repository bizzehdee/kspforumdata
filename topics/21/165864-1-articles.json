Four Bumblebee radial engines give it excellent acceleration but also great use of fuel. For long range flights you\u0027ll want to lengthen the wingtip drop tanks with another Mark 0 each (and set the flow prorities) along with filling up the twin Vulcan pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMewt is Maltese for Death. Whose afraid of a Death Sparrow? Pretty much everyone it\u0027s aimed at in anger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMewt Sparrow is very amenable to field upgrades. Swap out the Bumblebees for a pair of Panthers and intakes. Replace the nosecone with a radome to support AIM-20\u0027s in place of the AIM-9\u0027s, and more. Want Vulcans in the fuselage instead of the Brownings? It can do that, just remember to change the ammo boxes. Alan Aerospace Recycling and Packaging will supply airframes minus engines and other equipment so the buyers may configure as they please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs equipped, it\u0027s ready for BDA dogfights. Drop the tip tanks when combat starts because they\u0027ll be almost empty. That improves maneuverability and adds a bit to top speed. You may have better luck removing the Vulcan pod or dropping it in flight due to the Brownings being able to fire nearly continuously VS the delays between bursts of the Vulcans. The B9 wings do seem a bit fragile compared to stock parts, but you could convert the inner wing sections to hold fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002237298172592_db48d49f4f_z_d.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 src=\u0022https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4366/37298172592_db48d49f4f_z_d.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
