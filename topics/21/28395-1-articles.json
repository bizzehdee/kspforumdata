You shouldn\u0027t have any problem getting this beauty in the air. I advise you start @ 50% throttle, and as soon as the front wheel picks up, toggle the avionics package (ASAS) because this plane generates a TON of lift. It has an identical service ceiling to the real thing, and matches its speed. It\u0027s the closest thing to a replica I could make, and I am very happy with how it turned out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little warning: don\u0027t kick the throttle up too far in hi-alt flight.
