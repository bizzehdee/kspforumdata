The *Bluejay* is is spaceplane, and the *Harrier* is the aircarrier. It is currently undergoing tests, but it is promising. It has good takeoff power, with minimal damage. It is well controllable, and has a top speed of 640 m/s.\n\n![aJsgy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/aJsgy.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T15:31:52Z","Content":"*Bluehawk-Harrier* version 2. The *Harrier* now has space engines, and the *Bluejay* comes with external tanks. This should allow space maneuvering.\n\n\u003E ![O1EFA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/O1EFA.jpg)\n\nVersion 3. Now with thinner wings inspired by VA\\\u0027s *Ibis*, a Munar spaceplane which was far more controllable in space than its predecessor the *Kestrel* which used a different wing design. This does make takeoff more difficult.\n\n\u003E ![sxGUq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sxGUq.jpg)\n\u003E ![FwIg5.png](http://i.imgur.com/FwIg5.png)\n\nVersion 5. Engines reconfigured, Globe SRBs swapped for two sets of smaller boosters. A lot of stage reconfiguration. RCS prevents overbalancing, twin space engines provide the thrust for the carrier, before separation at about 12 000 m/s. The spaceplane then burns into orbit. The spaceplane would appear to retain the fuel and RCS required for a Minmus landing, which was in fact the goal of the mission.\n\n\u003E ![Ta1Ti.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ta1Ti.jpg)\n\u003E ![imkuO.png](http://i.imgur.com/imkuO.png)"}]}
