In the midst of my learning the ropes, I had this crazy idea to create a contract that would require a player to fly to the island and pick up astronauts spawned on the airfield, and fly them to KSC, load them in the STS Astrovan, require that they be driven to the Astronaut Complex, and on to the launchpad, and load up and fly a spawned and waiting STS Space Shuttle to deploy the fuel pod and come back safely. I tested spawning the STS on the island to hillarious results. More testing will be required until I can get the massively complex STS to spawn correctly. If so I might require a mission to ferry astronauts to KSC2 and launch from there.

For now, the STS-7/E engines I can tell are really straining to lift the orbiter. I\u0027ve not been able to reach the 400km height I did in 1.0.4 and only seem to reach a little over half of that height now. I really want to play with the vectors though to see how many expensive ET SAS modules I can remove. If I can, it just might make flying the shuttle profitable in career... and if not, I will find a way to make it so by writing my own Contract Pack for Contract Configurator. Maybe call it Inigmas-STS-Pack or something.\u003Cp\u003ESince I love the solids so much, and they are something I am most proud of in developing, I think I will only release STS versions that only sports solids going forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know, Ingma, that I work \u0022on par\u0022 with your shuttles, so... my 2 cents:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- My own shuttle it is working perfectly as it was in 1.0.4, using Skipper engines as Orbiter engine. I had to rework the external fuel lines on the central tank, caused by the new pilon model, but it was a marginal change not changing a thing (and removed their decoupler ability, to avoid problem with staging) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I tested the new SSMEs (and the related engine mount): they are far more powerful than needed, with marginal differences in payload capability (this is related, now, to the cargobay dimension: we squeezed the max, with a single, long, cargobay, at 42t) or range. I found myself more successful once I lowered the SSME thrust at Skipper level (1 Skipper = (rougly) 65% SSME thrust) to be balanced with the SRBs stack (mine were built very likely as your solids assemble, at 80% limited thrust) to mantain the 3xengine Orbiter look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found the engine mount a bit difficoult to be balanced, now, if used with the 3 nodes available, just to keep simmetry working (and to not tweak any engine one by one) but I did a workaround about it: the upper one added on the upper node, and tweaked as single, then the lower 2 added as surface mounted on the engine mount, in \u0022mirror mode\u0022, to change on both the inclination)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPROs\u003C/strong\u003E: The look of the orbiter improves a lot: it seems a LOT MORE like the NASA shuttle. (SSME\u0027s flame is VERY LIKELY the real one *_* I like it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECONs\u003C/strong\u003E: if the SSME engine mount used AFTER the two mk3 monoprop tanks, the Shuttle\u0027s fuselage seems too long. I\u0027m not sure if clipping it \u0022inside\u0022 the rear monoprop tank, to leave it show just barelly from the rear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then having some issues on the SRBs separation moment: with the low gimbal Skipper, as soon SRBs are depleted (but also with my liquid booster version), the orbiter\u002B tank push more vertical, helping with its momentum to \u0022launch away\u0022 the spent SRBs...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... BUT the SSME high gimbal rate keep the orbiter\u002Btank a LOT more flat, orizzontal, trajectory: this always means SRBs to hit the wings (I copied your SRB\u0027s sepatrons configuration, up until now) even if adding to sepatrons more thrust. Probably are needed some more sepatrons, to the booster\u0027s base, pushing \u0022away\u0022 from the orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--- further reports will be added as more tests will be done ---\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-12T08:07:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2015 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Araym\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T13:05:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI HIGHLY recommend a redesign.
