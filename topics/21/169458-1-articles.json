My own yet-to-be-named kontraption uses a MK-1 sidecar design with a MK-2 main body and three rapier engines.It is, unsurprisingly, hard to control at low airspeeds or at high altitudes, but with the throttle up, engine gimbal and good pressure over the control surfaces give it a decent flight profile.\u00A0The first test flight ended with an overheat at ~1400 M/S and the second made an orbit and came back down beautifully. Unfortunately, asymetric braking lead to an accident on the ground upon landing and caused me to lose the first model. A second prototype is still under construction. I\u0027ll be testing it with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E by week\u0027s end.
