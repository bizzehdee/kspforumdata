I didn\u0027t like the starwars ships i downloaded tested by Manley , so i\u0027m starting my new series, this is the first of the series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zzZu6ND.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zzZu6ND.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2lNDzS7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222lNDzS7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It also has horizontal landing/take off (the vertical ion thruster are bound to custom action 1 and horizontal 2) and like 100 lights that lag when you turn em on , so you can remove em quite quickly as they are paired. maybe a little too much rcs that also has a performance issue, so remove the ones you dont want. I really like the red ones for the \u0022blasters\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Except for the wings and engines which took a LOT of time to get right since the engines wouldn\u0027t get in a nice position , the rest is totally rearrangeable to your liking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i hope you like it and if not tell me what to change and i will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext one is Jedi starfighter with docking/undocking ring. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the mods i use i don\u0027t know if they all apply for this one tho : B9 aerospace ; procedural fairings ; KW rocketry ; IonHybElec ; Interstellar. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything from interstellar but i\u0027m not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext one is Jedi starfighter with docking/undocking ring. And hopefully warp speed if i can figure out how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your feedback .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i hope you enjoy it and stay tuned for the next one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some more screenshots and the DL link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://mrbutterfl7.imgur.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://mrbutterfl7.imgur.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/p8e65lkpya838q3/Most_epic_XWING_openable_cockpit.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/p8e65lkpya838q3/Most_epic_XWING_openable_cockpit.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-22T13:39:29Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2014 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MrButterfl7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
