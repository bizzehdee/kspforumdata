[Optional] The capability of air, sea and land operation on Kerbin, for easy testing \u0026amp; potential Kerbin applications is desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease submit your proposals with pictures or videos of the LEV at all 3 modes of movement. Please also provide its key operational parameters (such as range \u0026amp; tested speeds at various modes), user instructions and the blueprint (.craft file). KASEA will evaluate all proposals and award a contracts for the design \u0026amp; construction of a prototype, to up to 3 companies. KASEA will then evaluate the prototypes and choose one winner, which will be awarded a contract to build at least 7 LEVs (4 operational vehicles for Laythe and 3 testing \u0026amp; training vehicles) for the initial phase of the Laythe Exploration Missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOffice of Spacecraft Acquisition, KASEA\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-23T19:35:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2013 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sturmstiger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"entaran","CreatedById":67823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T16:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re literally dreaming if you think you can solve all these points without breakage on Laythe.

KASEA believes the requirement for LEV is sound based on our research and experiments. For example KASEA already has a 3-man aircraft that can fly around Kerbin 3 times and can go more 20m/s on wheels, with as mass of 14 tons. While KASEA does not currently operate amphibious aircrafts, we have seem designs capable of over 200m/s on water from various \u0022challenges\u0022 in the inudstry. Thus we believe our modest requirement with water takeoff, landing and limited movement is quite achievable. KASEA is confident that our industrial partners can come up with proposals that exceeds the LEV requirement and looking forward to seeing them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-23T21:17:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2013 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sturmstiger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ixolate industries","CreatedById":59366,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T19:13:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to carry the aircraft, which could be an SSTO, on a large ship then just deorbit and land it when arrived at Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a good design and efficient flying it would also the be possible to return to the ship in orbit and take all the kerbalnauts back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sturmstiger","CreatedById":60543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T19:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ixolate industries\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ixolate industries\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould it be possible to carry the aircraft, which could be an SSTO, on a large ship then just deorbit and land it when arrived at Laythe.\u003Cp\u003EWith a good design and efficient flying it would also the be possible to return to the ship in orbit and take all the kerbalnauts back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaching orbit from Laythe or Kerbin surface is not a requirement for The LEV.

KASEA recognizes that some companies may be able to design the LEV with SSTO / space operation capability, and we welcome such designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
