It uses the B9 F119 \u0022replica\u0022 for engines, but they default to being throttled back to 65% so that it has a more realistic amount of thrust sans afterburner. They are also set to have thrust vectoring turned OFF at launch to avoid potentially fatal jiggle of the rear landing gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that I\u0027ve found it that it has fairly unrealistic intakes. Even though the ones I used are smaller than in real life, at service ceiling with 58% thrust (because of the over-aggressive curving far from sea level, I find that it is most realistic to set the thrust on the engines to 58 without afterburner, 83 with when at altitude, and 65/100 when ASL.) and moving at mach 1.8 (top speed and real top speed without engaging afterburners), It still pulls in around 600%-700% the required amount of air. Suggesting it should be able to operate well above the equivalent 12.5 km (5/8*20km) that it works at. It would appear that if the real thing is as efficient as B9 makes DSI out to be, it should be able to fly much higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/1X20J\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will note that the landing there is legitimate and took place at night with no lights on the first try, but I also found that if you land at high speed, or with too much pressure on the front gear, the plane tends to fishtail and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, take-off does not mean \u0022Pull upward until you escape the ground.\u0022 The control surfaces are set to very high pitch and if you engage the thrust vectoring on the engines before taking off, both of these forces will contribute to your back landing gears being crushed out of the way and the plane likely exploding. This didn\u0027t happen to B9 landing gears as much before 0.23, but now it is a very common issue, such that one of my previous hypersonic airliners/SSTOs that could transport 146 Kerbals to LKO now transports 146 Kerbals to a fiery death at the end of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I tested it to see what sort of G-load I could get out of it. It seems to be capable of \u002B10.5/-4.5 G under exceptional circumstances such as stooping and then pulling up quickly, but normal maneuvers can only briefly get past \u002B6 up to \u002B9. (Note that this may not be true for high-altitude stalls.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of stalls.... I tried stalling it several times, I once managed to even get it into a flat spin, but within a few seconds, I could easily escape from said spin and continue flying normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, kind of funny story, I flew it past the VAB and pulled up at the SPH, It bounced off the top at high speed (200\u002B m/s) and then hit the tower, all but an intake and the cockpit survived. I quickly used the torque to aim the intake to hit first, and managed to survive the fall and high-speed impact. Never mind blowing a $150,000,000 Stealth fighter to smithereens, I saved a Kerbal!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, extremely realistic functional F-22 replica that is extremely lucky with its SPH crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. This is a good demo of the fact that real planes have much lower TWRs than Kerbal ones. I\u0027ve seen many subsonic Kerbal Airliners with a better TWR than this state-of-the-art fighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also exemplifies that Kerbal craft are lighter than real ones, with over 11 tonnes of weight intended to do nothing but make it more realistic. (don\u0027t worry, the weights are really streamlined and dense and aerodynamic to stop adverse performance effects).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also open to constructive criticism and tips on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, in order to use it as if in combat with full afterburner, set the throttle to 100 ASL or 83 at 12.5 km. Otherwise, keep it at 65 ASL or 58 at 12.5 km. Oh, and don\u0027t forget. This thing wasn\u0027t designed for KSP, but it works well in FAR. It is untested and probably not very effective in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-28T20:33:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2014 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T11:36:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, I like how it can be reinforced to high heck and still be 57 parts with P-wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T12:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is awesome, though with those intakes it looks more like an F-35 with the engines of an F-22.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eorin","CreatedById":79133,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T12:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImho the intakes are wrong placed.
