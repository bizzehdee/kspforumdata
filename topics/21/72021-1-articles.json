So far 17 out of the 28 tanks are full. In the future I plan to add one more tank with some 1.25m docking ports and one Sr. port so that docking things to actually refuel is easier. I am also going to de-orbit the solar array, because it just jacks up the part count by ~ 100 parts, and isn\u0027t necessary. I also might de-orbit the core module and add some engines and take the thing to another planet, but maybe that plan will be saved for a slightly smaller fuel station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/jxOs5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

In my opinion the orange tanks are just more classy. Also, there are no Nasa sized docking ports (or at least i haven\u0027t found them in the tech tree, because i started a new career in 23.5, and haven\u0027t played sandbox, and I enjoy pacing my career, and focusing on the kerbin system and Duna to begin with)which means that the station would look really awkward with all the adapters. Finally, I\u0027m like 75% sure that i didn\u0027t have nasa parts when I started the station, and i\u0027m 100% sure that i wasn\u0027t planning on having more than the 7 tanks at first, it just felt like the obvious progression after I put the first segment on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
