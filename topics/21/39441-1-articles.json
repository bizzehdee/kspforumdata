Once the \u0022abort\u0022 action group key is engaged, a ring separator instantly severs the capsule behind the built-in reaction wheel while carefully-balanced Sepratron 1\u00AE solid rockets boost the assembly away from the craft.* At this point the craft can glide for short distances on the canards, giving ejecting pilots a chance to steer towards shore or a level patch of ground. Twin radial parachutes can be streamed with the \u00220\u0022 action group which will lower the capsule to the ground at 5.3m/s in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and gravity.**\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe recommend that pilots pull back on the stick at approximately 10m above ground level to ensure the capsule lands with the cockpit upright, but the capsule can land inverted and still protect the pilot. The capsule will also float after landing at sea, stabilised by the canards. The included nose gear retains its landing light, which can be used during night ejections.***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=39F4CB7CC4854302!338\u0026amp;authkey=!AFboEpztHmiHD7k\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EModel A1 Craft file\u003C/a\u003E Optimised for high-altitude, high angle-of-attack ejections\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=39F4CB7CC4854302!339\u0026amp;authkey=!ABc5SmJJnaqMg7o\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EModel A2 Craft file\u003C/a\u003E Optimised for low-altitude ejections\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(It should be public for read-only access: let me know if it isn\u0027t, as I\u0027m fairly new to SkyDrive.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -- Steve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* We recommend changing the \u0022abort\u0022 action group to add in the necessary commands to shut off all engines, to ensure that the craft does not ram the escape capsule from behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Not tested in other atmospheres or gravities. Not rated for \u0022zero-zero\u0022 ejection on take-off, but the capsule may still save the pilot in such cases. To ensure parachute lines are not severed by opening shock, we recommend they not be deployed at speeds higher than 200m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*** As lights drain power from the cockpit, we suggest limiting use of the light post-ejection to reserve power for the avionics and reaction wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-28T17:31:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2013 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Anton P.
