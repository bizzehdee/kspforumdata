On the one hand, the Longsword name is awesome... but on the other, this looks nothing like the Longsword (even though it\u0027s built on top of it and shares the basic powerplant), and is actually \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E more capable:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00220yVq59d.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0yVq59d.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n~50mT to orbit! That is a whopping \u0026gt;25% payload ratio, and the payload rides in style, inside a humongous bay sporting the latest in ramp technologies... just in case you want to load a nuclear cruise stage and use it without unpacking \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Plus now we support crew! The standard three can ride in style, taking care of the payload and performing any required science!... or rescue, whatever the case might be. Truly, a hammer that is just begging for a problem to solve. They all look like nails with one of these! And thanks to the efficient part count (130 not counting payload), and the ridiculously simple flight manual, a hammer \u003Cem\u003Eanyone\u003C/em\u003E can use. Don\u0027t believe me?

If nothing else, I can loft a few metric tons of ore up while I do something else... Thanks to the incredibly big payload bay, I just chuck modules inside until I have what I need, then complete with ore not caring much about the payload\u0027s CoM... if anything I have a care to put the heaviest things forwards. If the result is under 180 mT at takeoff, I know I am going to have enough to go up. I built with low density payloads in mind, because you are limited by room more often than not, in my experience. BTW, there is a handy unused node where the two bays meet to hang more than one payload without them having to connect to each other.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll in all, it is an incredibly useful \u0022can tackle any job\u0022 kind of bird. And sacrificing nothing to aesthetics! I took the \u0022old\u0022 Longsword and IMO improved the looks of the thing enormously, while actually \u003Cem\u003Esaving\u003C/em\u003E structural parts, and adding the tail ramp to boot. And the CoM/CoL balance didn\u0027t even take a hit! It still can do \u0022Kobras\u0022 on reentry to shed speed high up and experience a very cool reentry (even though it\u0027s frankly difficult to burn that nosecone off). I think this one will stay with us for a while now, I have no desire to try to improve on this any time soon.

To be honest, i\u0027d never have thought you\u0027d make a craft that big. In other news, the Foil recently saved a crew of 3 from the surface of Duna.
