Also included are the craft files and screenshots for each craft plus the craft files for my space lab and or station built from stock parts. this is my first post so no idea what to write here just thought i would share my designs with the world. Hope you enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station launch can be a little tricky so i included screenshots of orbit and trajatory map showing orbit distance to prove it can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso find included my fighter jet craft file theres probably a million of them already here but i like the look of mine so have fun. and who knows if my designs aren\\\u0027t rubbish and people like them i might even post my space plane designs. i have alot of designs prob around 100 i should probably get a life lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix Aerospace","CreatedById":26120,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-15T02:36:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E Congrats on your first post, and I must say, those are some nice super-heavy lifters!
