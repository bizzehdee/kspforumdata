It will stop off at several moons and planets along the way visiting various outposts making sure they are okay and providing assistance when required. Its fully supplied with Resource Scanning and Mining capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the image above from left to right:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane and Water scanning satellite - 1 Nuclear engine and 4 scanners - able to detach and manoeuvre in to its own polar orbit if needed and return to the vessel once completed its scan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonoprop Tug - Main work-horse of the vessel itself. Two large monoprops, two batteries and a probody wrapped in rcs thrusters. Mainly used to move tanks from the vessel to the mining lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up is the mining lander itself. Designed to take different combinations of tanks including fuel, water, kethane and even personnel (via hitch-hiker cans). Has two nukes and two LV-T30\u0027s to give it the lift it needs to get in to orbit - the LV\u0027s shut off once in orbit and the lander is then able to dock with vessel once its in close. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext is a lander passenger can - this consists of one hitch-hiker can but we can add further to the ship when needs arise. This can be connected to on of the landers pads so crews can make excursions to the surface to plant flags and fall over etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext is the main body - it consists of 8 sr docking nodes, solar panels, fuel tanks and a kethane converter. The converter is configured to convert kethane in to liquid fuel and water in to oxidizer. Makes the game just that bit more interesting! The docking nodes holds 4 water cartridges , 4 kethane cartridges and 4 fuel tanks. There are plans to swap this out for a 5 orange tank configuration with the docking nodes at a 90 degree angle pointing down the ship to hang the cartridges on to make it more \u0027streamlined\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly at the front of the vessel we have the command and control - 4 nukes to shorten thrust duration and a cupola cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vessel can store up to 32,000 litres of water, 32,000 litres of kethane, 18,480 litres of oxidizer, 15,120 litres of liquid fuel, 2,115 litres of monoprop and can be manned by up to 5 kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/5owyc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Its also the maintence that happens on the ship that gets me too - the ship drops in to orbit around a planet or moon - scans for resources then depending on the resources available a small tug launches grabs the relevant cartridges and plugs them in to the lander which then targets its landing zone drops down and fills up, launches, redocks, unloads resources and then gets its cartridges reconfigured again!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
