It was 90 parts, about 230 tons, and lifted a 45 ton payload to orbit, giving it a payload fraction of about 20%.\n\nIt has since acquired the nickname \u0022The Drag Queen\u0022.

I don\u0027t know if anyone has done this before, I\u0027m not that up on all things SSTO. There are a few guys who specialize in SSTOs. I apologize as I know only of one, [Rune](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/54000-Rune). There are others who are equally qualified though. I think you will need to pool knowledge to do this.\n\n You will have to use every trick known to reduce drag. Some ways are cheatier than others. Also, wouldn\u0027t it be easier if you massively reduce the size of the SSTO and just call left over fuel \u0027payload\u0027."},{"CreatedByName":"PhylumCnidaria","CreatedById":148609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T19:49:28Z","Content":"But that\u0027s the boring way of doing it!"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T23:14:58Z","Content":"You might want to see the [Stock Payload Fraction Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116729-Stock-Payload-Fraction-Challenge-1-0-4-Edition) thread.

I will add that there is a reason I stopped at 33% also, other than the roundness of the number. Well, two. First one is that on a long enough timeline, there will always be a kerbal that tops you in any given challenge. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSecond is, going over 30% requires *awful* TWRs, under 0.5 or so, that make the ascent both incredibly *boring* and difficult to boot! I mean, I like going under TWR 1 so you actually need the wings for something, and lifting a lot only using cheap fuel is nice and all... but I also enjoy not taking upwards of half an hour flying my SSTO to orbit, or having such a razor-thin margin that I can\u0027t reach anything over 70kms high, on a good day.\n\nRune. I guarantee you practicality will end up getting you to the same place.

MUCH bigger.\n\nAlso, does it seem to anyone else like cargo bays have an unnaturally large amount of drag? Like seriously.
