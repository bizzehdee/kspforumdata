After much anticipation and a couple of requests, here is the SSTO pack I promised, comprised entirely of old designs that I never got around to release in the end (I did test them on 0.24 and made some minor changes). Lets take a look at each one, shall we?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELONGSWORD\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you follow me and my SSTOs, you might have noticed that I always name those I release after pointy objects, particularly swords and such. Well, it\u0027s not that I didn\u0027t come up with the Longsword name in the line, but I was saving it for something truly special. So this is it, this thing performs too well not to give it the coveted name. Plus, it kinda fits, it\u0027s a general-purpose craft that is perfect to take a single kerbal around, yet it doesn\u0027t have any particular attribute in which it excels. A balanced generalist, IMO... but one that feels like a sports car in terms of performance and handling, and all of that looking awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/lTDBX14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lTDBX14.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lTDBX14.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t take you extremely far (though 1.2km/s in the tanks upon reaching orbit is nothing to be sneered at, you could go cismunar or set it down on Minmus), but it will do so in style. The TurboRAPIER\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 powerplant gives it awesome T/W on all stages of flight, being capable of verticlimbing and still having a more than respectable vacuum T/W while keeping engine mass to a minimum. And the atmospheric handling is just a dream, it handles better than the Dart even though it\u0027s almost twice as heavy! It also carries a STOVL rocket assembly to handle airless landings, and a cabin for passengers or as additional living space for long flights. Check it out, because words don\u0027t really convey the feeling of going under KSC\u0027s bridge before continuing on your way to orbit to rescue that stranded kerbal. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/GMvI2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

And in space, you have more than 3km/s to play with, and that\u0027s lugging all that excess liquid fuel around, if not things improve beyond the 4km/s barrier and start being quite ridiculous. Oh, and it is \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E a very fast verticlimber that allows for quick rendezvouses in LKO, that comes as a bonus because the turbojet comes in such a big minimum size (I want a 0.625m stock airbreather!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/L2jqa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

See, the idea going into this build was to make a big SSTO that looked good. Perhaps with a hint of the Valkyrie bomber in there. With a cool side-looking cabin to stick a shielded port laterally. But midway into the build, I started to think that with that much fuselage, I could explore the limits of the RAPIER engine. So, I exchanged the extra cabin for even more fuel, and I got a very good looking all-chemical SSTO that still managed to do 3km/s after making orbit! Considering the logarithmic nature of the rocket equation, that\u0027s impressive at least to me. It isn\u0027t lacking on T/W or wing loading either, I reckon I could slap a couple of drop tanks and/or ion propulsion systems and perhaps do a Duna mission from runway to runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/oezeCms\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oezeCms.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oezeCms.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr alternatively, You could get a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E cool looking two-kerbal transport that can take them to the Mun\u0027s surface without using nukes.
