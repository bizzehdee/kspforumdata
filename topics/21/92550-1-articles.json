Those look great! You could probably deliver them with a landing stage that holds the rover underneath it, fires retro-rockets to slow the decent to a hover about a dozen meters from the surface, and lowers it to the ground and detaches. Good luck with whatever that is!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T05:15:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eim playing with Deadly re entry and far it wouldnt work, i need housing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JacobT11","CreatedById":11673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T05:20:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could still use Xayven\u0027s idea.

At least they would get you up into orbit. Decend is a little tricky, but I think the structural fairing parts with inter stage fairings could be used to do it. Might not be easy though. You might want to land the delivery casing with radial attached engines on the tail and fall over on purpuse to release the rover that could be attached with a docking port inside. If you want to bring it back, you would simply drive back into the casing, dock it and use small engines on the side of the lander to flip the whole thing back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI once build a big rover with engines on it\u0027s back. I landed it without another craft. Drove around for hours (searching and finding the Armstrong memorial on the mun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ). And I brought the rover back to orbit without another craft. I used small engines to flip it back on it\u0027s tail so I could use the main engines to launch into an orbit. Drop tanks helped to keep the mass reasonable. Especially after landing I don\u0027t want to drive around with empty tanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T12:26:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022prophet_01\u0022 data-cite=\u0022prophet_01\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EProc fairings should do the job. .....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei could do this but i would wind up with something with a very high part count and KSP wouldnt be playable at that point theres a few outdated and very mod specific rover bay parts out there but nothing that can help me land these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eim honestly considering playing with stock aero because of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei felt like sharing my SSTO\u0027s \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/7nlyR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
