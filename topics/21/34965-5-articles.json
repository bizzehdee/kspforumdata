Made it to Duna with a nearly 20 ton lander attached to the front and still had almost 4K Delta-V left.

My \u0022Interplanetary Cruise Stage\u0022 is basically just a cluster of seven orange tanks with engines, and it gives about a .3 or .4 thrust ratio depending on the payload. The payload sits on top, but wobbles pretty bad. This is probably because I used the medium docking ports and not the large ones, I\u0027ll see if the next iteration fixes that. I put a docking port on each tank to aid refueling since it can be slow to maneuver- this way the refuel ship is pretty much lined up to some port or other no matter the orientation. I\u0027ve made it to Duna with this, about to reach Jool with another. Both should have enough fuel to return to Kerbin orbit and be reusable, I just haven\u0027t hit the return window to find out for sure yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a pic when I tried to chain two mission packages on top:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VOCrUXV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VOCrUXV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note it had the fuel/thrust to take both modules to Jool and return with one of them, but the wobbling caused SMEF (Sudden Massive Existence Failure) in this particular mission.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khobai","CreatedById":83366,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T22:19:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny chance of getting .craft files for your ships vanamonde?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T01:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a 100% chance of getting my craft files because I posted them here, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48610-My-roundtrip-ships-for-download\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48610-My-roundtrip-ships-for-download\u003C/a\u003E with instructions on how to get them to orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
