The astronaut was, in Yaeger\u0027s view, just along for the ride. On Faith 7, Gordon Cooper proved that wasn\u0027t true... but the phrase entered the lexicon anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes however, you want to be free from the responsibility of piloting a craft. You need a place in orbit to hang out. But those full-size space stations are difficult to build, and lag your computer far too much. Hence, I\u0027ve created this minimalist space station. Just 16 parts. Provide your own launcher. It\u0027s only five tons. A Rockomax Skipper and A Poodle can get it easily to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solar Spam in a Can\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1ilraXd.png\u0022 alt=\u00221ilraXd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original Spam in a Can wasn\u0027t pretty enough, so I replaced the RTGs with Gigantor solar panels. It\u0027s only slightly heavier, and can be put into the same orbit with the same launcher. You will be responsible for keeping the solar arrays pointed at the sun, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe .craft files:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/en9z2hxtaf4rgfx/Spam%20in%20a%20Can.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/en9z2hxtaf4rgfx/Spam%20in%20a%20Can.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are four versions of the Spam in a Can.
