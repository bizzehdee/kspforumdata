It is a spectacularly time consuming and tricking thing to do..\n\n So I really wanted to take a break and work on something new. I thought a Starwars snowspeeder would be a nice challenge to make small and detailed but still fly. So build I did. Sadly it\u0027s so small and detailed that it is only usable with infinite fuel, its that small. But worry not! It is mostly an exercise in design. It does however come with a special launching ramp for runway takeoffs. Simply detach it as you pull up. \n\nIt seats two, kinda.. They have stuff clipped into their bodies which I always try to avoid/minimize. As this is a design craft first I don\u0027t mind too much. More on that later. \n\nIt took me a while as I was really trying to think in new ways to use the stock parts. I put together a really cool cockpit canopy for the speeder. It really looks like a real metal object, and there is full clearance for the kerbals ample heads. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/I5yI8)\n\nIt is really fun to fly around if a little skittish! \n\nSo, on to the reason for the double post. Well, its that cockpit cover I made. I totally fell in love with the design having never seen anything like it made before. I had to improve it and use it again for something. So I stripped down the snowspeeder and rebuilt the cockpit to allow Kerbals to sit inside with nothing clipping through them.\n\n I was going for a rover, I made a speedboat too but it didn\u0027t work. It looked amazing though, like the one from that Thames river chase James Bond movie.\n\n I tested it and it looked awesome but handled like crap. The suspension was so stiff. So I attached the wheels to the \u0027go-to\u0027 bendy part, the ant engine and it transformed the buggy.\n\nThe wheels move and flex over every bump soaking up the terrain and making high jumps possible without breaking the wheels. I know people have made suspension before but I have never seen this level of suspension travel before. I love it so much I made a fun little video.\n\n It handles so well and is so much fun to drive. As a consequence of the ant engine suspension there are three/six rear facing rockets/exhausts that can bu used to massively boost speed before jumps!\n\nIt is deceptively detailed. The body is only just bigger than a Kerbal and the same for height. with that roof design it really looks cool. It isn\u0027t indestructible which is fun, see video. But it is very rugged indeed, soaking up massive hits and jumps, also see video.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
