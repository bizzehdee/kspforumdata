All of the previous Farnsworth SSTO\u0027s ***mostly***, or ***nearly*** worked. some of them almost made it to the highly acclaimed ***sort of worked*** status.\n\nThe Weasel features nifty improvements to previous designs such as but not limited to: \n\nWings, they seem to help keep the ground from hitting you after you leave it.\n\nFuel, who knew that you had to light things on fire to accelerate, interesting discovery.\n\nElectricity, we were shocked as much as you, lights don\u0027t stay on by themselves.\n\nRRRERT, we don\u0027t know what to call them so we made our own name for the Round Rubber Return Explosion Reduction Thingies. Some of our more intelligent engineers have started calling them Lando-Cal-Gear-z-ans, but I don\u0027t think the name will stick.\n\nAnyways, the specificity of the specifics on the Weasel are as such forth and so on.\n\n40 measly parts and 15.9 tons of flaming fun fully fueled and fired up.\n\nThe weasel was made to transport one kerbal and requisite toast fro and to, or to and fro (*depends on the direction your heading) the KSC to a LKO station with a moderate level of reliability and survivability.*\n\n*Every part should be easily seen and easy to duplicate from the pictures. There is some hidden fuel lines to feed the central tanks fuel to the terriers and a stashed battery, other than that it\u0027s just like it looks. Just keep in mind that the thing likes a low attitude flight out of the atmosphere, stay about about 15 to 25 deg.*\n\n![kaFg07F.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/kaFg07F.png?1)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

From there, level out to 15 to 25 degrees and hit full throttle-ness, the whiplashes give up around 22/23k, flip on the chemical eating terriers (***release the hounds!...or terriers***) and stay that way until the weasel is heading sub orbital going almost 2k per second. At 70\u0027ish km our engineers report that they are still going fast enough that they have to spend minimal fuel to make a pretty circle. \n\nThis is completely different to how the previous Farnsworth SSTO\u0027s flew pre 1.03. It took our engineers by surprise to see space easier to reach by not heading directly towards it. We have finally reached the conclusion that space can see you coming unless you sneak up behind it and wack it with something going very fast. Science!\n\nGood news everyone!\n\nIf you look closely you can see the terrier\u0027s hidden inside the turbo ramjet\u0027s.\n\nAlso of note, if you decide to build a Weasel please add a bit of dihedral to the main wing and tail fins. And raise the main wing a bit from the center of mass of the fuselage. It will help with atmospheric stability.\n\n![OjSGBjf.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/OjSGBjf.png?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr Farnsworth","CreatedById":147177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T15:15:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I look forward to seeing more toaster delivery mechanisms.

You\u0027re gonna go far, kid! My earlier stuff isn\u0027t half this capable... Also, try swapping the \u0022chemical eating Terriers\u0022 for some Mk. 55s for the next SSTO you build. I love the bejesus out of the things because they have a decent atmospheric TWR and they look pretty. They aren\u0027t as efficient out of atmosphere as the Terriers, but they help when lifting actual cargo."}]}
