It\u0027s a light, long-range space-plane, capable of occupying a range of roles from rescue shuttle to tourist jet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EDesign Philosophy\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Redstart was developed with several key concepts in mind, namely:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EIncredible atmospheric flight characteristics.\u003C/strong\u003E The Redstart was modified from a standard high-performance plane, meaning that its wing planform is designed with atmospheric stability in mind. As such, the Redstart works fantastically as a sub-orbital jet, and as is incredibly easy to land when the time comes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EUtility.\u003C/strong\u003E The Redstart is built around a probe core, meaning that it can be flown with or without a pilot. (Which means that if you wish to depart with a pilot you will need to move a Kerbal over from the launch pad - a vehicle for which will be coming soon - or use the fantastic \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/18-1-kerbal-crew-manifest/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECrew Manifest\u003C/a\u003E plugin). Eighty mono-prop and a balanced RCS system, and a Clamp-O-Tron Jr. mean that she\u0027s easy to dock with, and a carrying capacity to orbit of roughly 1.5 tons mean she can carry small probes and the like into position easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EEfficiency.\u003C/strong\u003E The main focus when designing the Redstart was to have a space-plane that didn\u0027t reach orbit with only a slither of fuel remaining. Thus, its main engine is the economical LV-N, and the craft is designed with just enough intakes to reach an adequate speed and altitude in order to use this engine effectively. Testing in order to improve the utility and efficiency took some time, but she now reaches and 80x80 circular orbit with 1200m/s~ of delta-V remaining, enough for trips within the Kerbin system without refueling, and after refueling has enough delta-V - 2495m/s - to make round trips to Kerbin\u0027s close neighbours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003ESimplicity.\u003C/strong\u003E Following the tried and tested design philosophy, the Redstart was kept as simple as possible to fly. Easy to get to orbit, and easy to maneuver when attempting to dock, the Redstart can be used effectively by those less comfortably with space-planes. Even in landing on low fuel, usually a curse of SSTOs, the wing design means the Redstart is very easy to pilot at both high and low speeds, preventing the problems that come from getting her feet muddy or wet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WHo8OHR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WHo8OHR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EFlight Manual\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPiloting the Redstart is very easy, and so odds are any pilot with an understanding of using trim and using space-planes will be able to get to orbit. However, a few points and precautions can help the efficiency and ease of use greatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAction Groups\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Toggle Turbojet engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Toggle LV-N engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Toggle intakes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackspace - Shuts off all engines and deploys parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe typical ascent plan I use is as follows: activate the SAS and throttle the turbojet engine to full; lift the nose (you can do this keeping the SAS on) at around 60m/s. Point the nose at 45 degrees, and use the trim to keep at that angle. Keep this heading until you reach 20,000m and then lower the nose to between 10 and 15 degrees (10 will result in more fuel once in orbit, but it can result in you passing the apoapsis and wasting fuel trying to regain altitude). You should be able to build speed easily until roughly 1500m/s, at which point activate the LV-N and angle the nose to 25 degrees. Wait till the turbojets starves and then shut it off and close the intakes. Upon closing the intakes the plane will try to drop the nose, so be prepared to catch this. (again, you can do so with the SAS on. Frankly, I rarely ever turn the SAS off). Once you\u0027ve shut the intakes pitch the nose up to 45 degrees again and then simply ride the LV-N until the apoapsis is above 70km, again, using trim (alt\u002BW/S) will help you maintain this heading. Shut off the engine and set-up a maneuver node to get you where you want to be. If done correctly you should get into orbit with roughly 1200m/s~ delta-V remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nzvVtO3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nzvVtO3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding is easy to do. However, when re-entering I heavily advice \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E to have the intakes open until you are below about 800m/s, as having them open will cause the plane to \u0027tailstand\u0027, and it\u0027s very difficult to recover from this. Landing can happen safely at about 60m/s on flat terrain, but of course you\u0027re always safer at around 20m/s. When landing, keep in mind that the nuclear engine sticks out a great deal, and so you need to be level when touching down or it will break off. Remember, if things go completely wrong you can always press backspace and your Kerbal (if you have one flying) should at least survive... even if the plane doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MYk5Y34.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MYk5Y34.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you all enjoy the Redstart.
