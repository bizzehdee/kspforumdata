I\u0027ve not had time to do anything but test solids at the moment. I\u0027m not a fan of tweakscaled stock parts, but I applaud the design of your wings! Very innovative. I actually took your idea and tried to come up with some mk 3 wing configuration. I came up with an AWESOME one but not realistic (hey it had unrealistic gaps with wings floating out in space, but who cares, right? it looked awesome!) I too four mk3 strakes along the side of the fuselodge and then spaced out the rear strakes and a mk3 wing to fit the standard NASA shuttle wing profile. Looked great. I didn\u0027t test fly it, but if anything it showed me that once Squad comes up with better fitting mk3 wing parts, they will look very awesome! Right now, mk3 wings are each like they were designed by a different subcontractor with no information sharing on final design. heh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to test your craft when I get a moment to install Tweakscale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022montyben101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022montyben101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAmazing craft!!! could do with some air brakes somewhere though!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir brakes?

The amount of struts to keep the clipped boosters from wobbling is exponentially increasing the part count. That, and with 8 solids per booster, I can design a single booster with 16 struts, but when attached to the main shuttle stack, the struts go all wacky and are impossible to fix without some weird bug that create 9 struts for 8 boosters, with the 9th magically appearing unconnected on the other solid booster. Very frustrating. I ran into this problem pre 1.0 so I figure it\u0027s a long running bug. I may have to report it if its not already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried to cover my booster stack with a single inline fairing, but to no avail either. For now the emptied liquid tanks act as a skin, but again it adds to the part count. Currently I\u0027m at 306-336 parts for the STS-5 with solids depending on solutions. Also the SRBs are too heavy for the three chutes to adequately recover them. Argh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRBs are just a part count explosion scenario at this time, no matter how much the cookie is cut. I thought I could reduce my wing part counts with the new aero, and I have... by about 20 parts bewteen STS-4 1.0.2 and the STS-5E Prototype (SRBs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efrustrating. but hopefully a solution will be found! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T20:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh god inigma, that sounds terrible.
