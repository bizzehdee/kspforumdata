Well unfortunately while I love building bases and stations, they all contain other bits from other mods as well. But then there would be the issue of you getting it to the Mun, I also assume you have HyperEdit? Either way, if it is a surface base you are after I would suggest the link below, they are way easier to assemble and deliver than USI stuff. Not saying that USI isn\u0026#39;t super fun and cool but K\u0026K makes it easier and personally I think more what you are after.
