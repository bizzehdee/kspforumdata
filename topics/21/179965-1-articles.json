Do whatever feels right to you. There\u0027s as much (or as little) to say about sharing craft with DLC parts as with any player mod, and look at how many modded craft are published every day.

The only prerequisite most of my craft have is the version of KSP they can be expected to work in, and even that annoys me, but I can\u0027t do anything about that. I can and do avoid mods. And DLC is really just a stock mod... one that needs to be paid for on top of that, so even less people are certain to have it. That will likely keep me avoiding DLC parts regardless.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI dislike many of the choices Squad made for this DLC. I accept that Squad deserves to make a living, and that current artists/devs adhere to different views than previous ones, but the end result is that I feel little draw to use or promote MH.
