I really like the learning curve in this game. First I was happy I could get my ship into orbit. Then I was happy I could get it back safely as well. Then I got to the Mun (but not back). Then I was able to dock crafts, build a space station and refuel my ships. Then I could get to the Mun and back. And my latest pride is Project Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt consists of one big lander with attached to it two crafts: one small ship and one rover. The small ship can be used as a one-man return craft. It can easily get back to Kerbin. You could even stop by the Mun if you wanted to. It also has a bunch of equipment used for testing. You could get it into orbit around Minmus and then land it again if you want to. The rover isn\u0027t really that great for the low gravity at Minmus. You have to drive really carefully. In case you flip over, it has RCS to get it back on its feet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the rover and the one-man ship are roughly the same weight, but at launch it\u0027s best to keep an eye on your navball because you might tilt over a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the three of them on Minmus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/4dZiX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224dZiX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main ship only has place for two, but you can always put an extra Kerbal in the one-man ship if you want. The main ship has parachutes, but the one-man ship has not (I forgot to add them). But because you have plenty of fuel left in the one-man ship, you should be able to land at Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main ship also has a big docking port at the top.

But now I just set target on the docking port I want to dock at, use \u0022control from here\u0022 on my own ship, then roughly put the two at the same angle and then just use the navbal with target mode. I don\u0027t even have to use chase cam. Can be confusing that sometimes left, right, up and down are inverted, but there is no left, right, up and down anyway in space. I just look at the navball, and I just \u0022slide\u0022 in place, at the end only at a speed of 0.2 m/s. Then I turn off SAS and the rest it does automatically. The only thing I have to watch out for is that my angle of approach isn\u0027t too horizontal. If I dock larger payloads, that can make the whole thing wobble too much to dock. But that is easily fixed by backing up for a moment, positioning yourself roughly in front of the target and then try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like designing ships as much as flying them, so I won\u0027t be using the Project Minmus design for interplanetary trips.

As long as it is roughly the same, and as long as it interesects somewhere (within the 50-100 km range would be good), then you should be able to dock. The further away you are, the more fuel you are going to waste of course. But 50km isn\u0027t as far as you would think. Thrust towards the target, be sure to thrust the opposite direction soon enough, repeat this a few times, and eventually your orbit will align by itself (naturally so: being in an orbit besides another ship means you are in the same orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I could get to the Mun, but not back.
