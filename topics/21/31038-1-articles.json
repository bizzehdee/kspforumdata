The Mobile Deployment Unit features a huge carrier vehicle designed to traverse a long distance. Once it nears your desired destination, decouple the buggy, extend the ladders at the rear, and EVA your driver. He can now board the MDU Buggy. Notes: Translation controls highly recommended by the BPA. It is unsafe to turn the buggy while moving over 8 m/s, and doing so will void the BluPlanet Rover Warranty. The warranty is also void if driven by Jebediah Kerman.
