Design requirements included:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehandle local planetary \u0026amp; orbit communications\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehave some long range to stay connected to the KSC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eenough propulsion to use one design to nail all inner-system planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, what I\u0027ve come up with is a satellite, that upon reaching a circularized orbit somewhere between 100 and 150km (depending if I launch directly from KSC, or use EPL to just build it at my station), can be aimed at any planet from Duna to Moho, set its flight computer, and then wait for arrivals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1RhT7Su.png\u0022 alt=\u00221RhT7Su.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI originally looked for a higher density battery, but Near Future is currently serving that role until I find something that offers better than 20k EC:1 mass, so this satellite offers 6800 energy in the main block, with the probe core and MJ controller offering a slight addition. Twin capacitor banks to provide extra power at need, with a total capacitor storage of 6k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELVN to provide primary thrust to get on course, possibly even all the way to orbital insertion, and then decoupled to reduce the mass. Designed to operate at a 250-260km orbit, for mapping with the onboard scanners.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommuncations provided by the onboard Communitron 32, twin DTS-M1s, and an 88-88 to stay connected to Kerbin. However, I am looking for some feedback to possibly finetune this guy to enhance performance, as I haven\u0027t really left Kerbin at all. 2 flights to Duna, and a low Kerbol orbit is the extent of my extra-Kerbin SOI flight experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
