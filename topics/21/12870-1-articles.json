I\\\u0027m honestly shocked it works at all, but it takes off in a snap, flies relatively well, and is land-able but requires a lot of persistence. This thing definitely won\\\u0027t get you out of the atmosphere, but it\\\u0027s a fun little toy, nonetheless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: When trying to land, be sure you\\\u0027re going sub-20 m/sec. The SkyStar tends to bounce due to the incredible lift as well as the 45 degree upward resting position. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny constructive feedback will be appreciated, as well!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DYJ","CreatedById":8636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T14:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, Welcome to the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust saw your youtube video (which you by the way are free to advertise on the forum), and your plane appears to fly remarkably well.
