Obviously you\u0027re going to need to know how to do orbital rendezvous and docking to build the ship. I also included a refueling pod you can launch and dock to the ship (although you will need to refuel several times to maximize the fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship can hold 8 kerbals (3 in each of the two capsules at the head of the ship, an additional two in the science lab) and can do all the sciences normally executable in space. The atomic rockets will burn for 51.7 minutes on a single tank of fuel. Haven\u0027t yet calculated how much delta-v it gives you, but if you\u0027re patient enough it should be able to take you places.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
