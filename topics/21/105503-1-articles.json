Congratulations, mr. troll. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n![Hkyj73H.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Hkyj73H.jpg)\n\n![AzTT886.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AzTT886.jpg)\n\nAnyways, here\u0027s my Boeing P-8 Poseidon. It\u0027s still a work in progress, with aerodynamic refinement on the agenda, but I think this thing flies well for having over 18,000 units of liquid fuel and only four jet engines. Heck, without the four missiles, it cruises at 180 m/s. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nWhile you\u0027re taking off, you have to wait until you reach 50-60 m/s and retract the rearmost impact gear. This will allow you to safely take off.\n\nAfter you read the instructions above, you can actually fly this huge jet: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/xtxd1fdq6wk3n2r/Poseidon%20Prototype%201_1.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xtxd1fdq6wk3n2r/Poseidon%20Prototype%201_1.craft?dl=0)\n\nI also fixed the slight issue of landing gear explosions in flight. Also, don\u0027t fly this thing like a fighter. It flies like the real thing, which is based off of a passenger airliner with an extremely large fuel load.\n\nIts armament consists of four supersonic cruise missiles, a MAD (magnetic anomaly detector) tail boom, and a small bomb bay for the yet to be installed countermeasure cartridge. \n\n![l4do529.png](http://i.imgur.com/l4do529.png)\n\n![dpU2Se6.png](http://i.imgur.com/dpU2Se6.png)\n\n![CFjAK4l.png](http://i.imgur.com/CFjAK4l.png)\n\n![PLwJra0.png](http://i.imgur.com/PLwJra0.png)\n\n![KEO1396.png](http://i.imgur.com/KEO1396.png)\n\n![iNfXrLb.png](http://i.imgur.com/iNfXrLb.png)\n\n![AFUmUS6.png](http://i.imgur.com/AFUmUS6.png)\n\n![X2o9Qjm.png](http://i.imgur.com/X2o9Qjm.png)\n\n![5IyrOGX.png](http://i.imgur.com/5IyrOGX.png)\n\n![67ewrqd.png](http://i.imgur.com/67ewrqd.png)\n\n![ZY2yqDf.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZY2yqDf.png)\n\n![JKfk0CO.png](http://i.imgur.com/JKfk0CO.png)\n\n![USkjzl0.png](http://i.imgur.com/USkjzl0.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"cathasatail","CreatedById":65597,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T06:28:54Z","Content":"Now that I like, functional, practical and a good representation of the real thing!
