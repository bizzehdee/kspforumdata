When rolling to point east-west, the ares pushes over to the right, an I cannot get it pointed straight. Second, when staging for the second stage, it\u0027s set to release the fairing covering the fuel, and I don\u0027t think it is meant to. And third, upon circularizing, it nearly shakes itself apart.\n\nNot unless it is in the book. \n\nI did notice some of these problems, was just glad to get it into orbit for the first time really. If you fix anything let me know so I can include you in the list, thanks for testing!\n\nI let it rise naturally on the SRB\u0022s and then pushed it gently over at the end.\n\nThe second stage is a bit wobbly right now.\n\nWhen I hit staged the second stage it was already around 30km up so the fairing was just deadweight by then."},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderSpock","CreatedById":147594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T17:07:35Z","Content":"It is in the book, if you haven\u0027t read it I won\u0027t spoil it for you.

It\u0027s close to the 2/3rd scale as well (it\u0027s 10m short, from the silhouette it\u0027s the upper stage that is short).
