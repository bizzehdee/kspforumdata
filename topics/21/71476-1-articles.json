I ended up using infernal robotics to create an array that is launched in a packed up configuration and then deploys using servos. At roughly 780 parts and 1000 tonnes at the launch pad with ~25,000 delta v (using the ionic thrusters from the near future mod) it\u0027s a complete dog to fly right from the launch pad until low solar orbit (which takes about 18 hours real time (at 4x phys time warp) to burn.
