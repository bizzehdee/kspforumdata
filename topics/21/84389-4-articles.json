(GitHub should go back to, at the very least, a single private repository. But, such is the nature of commercial enterprises.) You\u0027re putting KerbalX out there as a sharing site; not a personal repository. I believe your balancing of including the \u0022picture-less\u0022 uploads as part of a private craft repository is more than an acceptable balance. I can\u0027t imagine a craft taking more than 1Mb. (Yet, someone somewhere, I\u0027m sure, will create just such a behemoth to prove me wrong. Though I doubt it\u0027s ability to reach orbit.) Heck, the Endeavour from CSS just crosses 300Kb. If someone doesn\u0027t have the storage capacity for even a moderately complex craft (on their own system they really need to spend some $$ on some decent storage options. (1Tb drives run less than $50 now-a-days.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I would hold back on the search part. You can automatically flag an upload as a private craft file if it doesn\u0027t include a picture. Then restrict that craft from the main page display by simply referencing the flag. This would avoid the gaping holes in presentation which can detract from the aesthetics of the site. But, don\u0027t take them out of the search presentation.

So I just need to check if defaultscale is different to which ever one is the one that changes when scaled (I\u0027m guessing currentscale).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was telling Katateochi that when I first go to the site, the craft pictures are replaced by blue, green, or brown fields, and then the pictures display if I reload the page. Is anyone else seeing that? It might just be a Chrome thing, since I\u0027ve been getting errors from other sites lately as well, though this picture problem is something I\u0027ve only seen on KerbalX.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there is something odd in the way I load the images, I see a issue to do with images not being correctly scaled when the page first loads, then on reload (or running a search) they get fixed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that maybe you\u0027ve also got a specific browser issue going on and perhaps it\u0027s particularly effected by the images on KerbalX. Not sure thou, its a weird one!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T20:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would do it, but I don\u0027t like tea.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot like Tea!?!
