F-35 lightning. This is the SVTOL f35b version capable of vertical take off and landing. I won\u0027t lie it isn\u0027t the fastest cat on the block, but the basic engine is pretty underpowered these days. It\u0027s still incredibly fun to fly, and can maintain a very stable hover.\n\nI haven\u0027t figured out how to make the front engine doors yet, but hopefully those will come with further updates. I also plan to release the fully stock F-35a with no VTOL capabilities.\n\nThanks for checking it out.\n\nHotKeys:\n\n1) Horizontal Engine\n\n2) Vertical Engine\n\n3) Both Engines\n\n4) Move Rear Engine Horizontal\n\n5) Move Rear Engine Vertical\n\n6) Extend \u0022VTOL Intake\u0022 (Airbrake)\n\n7) Retract \u0022VTOL Intake\u0022\n\n8) Extend Flaps\n\nVTOL Transition\n\n1) Move engine horizontal (hotkey 4)\n\n2) Close Intake (hotkey 7)\n\n3) As the craft pitches upward toggle vertical engine (hotkey 2)\n\n**4) The rear engine is limited at 75.5 thrust to maintain hover.
