Your stuck with it blowing into confetti but you can place it anywhere you want, just wait until the text turns blue to lock it onto the next section of your rocket. If you have wobble problems just add internal struts inside your fairing section to stiffen it up."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T04:08:44Z","Content":"You sure can!
