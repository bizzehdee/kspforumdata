A suggestion for the nose cone is to use fairings, that you then use the rotate tool to make it look more like the real one\u0027s nosecone. It\u0027s textures are not the best, but for the shapes fairings are my best bet. I suggest you also place avionics inside it, as on the real one (I think) the radar and other systems are mounted in the nose cone, so it gets more realistic then."}]}
