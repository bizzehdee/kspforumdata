You go so far as to compare it directly to a \u0022cheat\u0022 (all infinite fuel users, please continue to do so if you have fun doing it). This subject crops up again and again in these forums ever since the spaceplane parts were released in 0.15 and someone figured out that \u0022hey, if I put more intakes on I can go higher and faster\u0022. Almost as if that were intended... I\u0027ll try to explain my thinking on this in this post, and it will be the last I respond to this line of criticism in this thread, so prepare yourself for a rant. I advise all who couldn\u0027t care less to simply ignore it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery part on a stock vehicle, weather it is clipped or not, (including all those intakes), is still calculated with regards to weight, lift, and drag. So as far as the game engine is concerned it isn\u0027t \u0022free\u0022 performance. I\u0027m sure those values could be tweaked for a more approximate representation of real life, and I have supported doing so. I look at the intake spamming (and other part clipping) as a stand-in for actual engineering. Until we get some approximation of real supersonic and hypersonic inlets and engines in this game (not likely), I\u0027ll design things that function is some comparable way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not denying that using jet engines at the edge of space is dubious. So is reentering the atmosphere in some rickety rocket held together with struts, or sending a kerbal to another planet in a cockpit with no discernible life support, or aerobraking a multi-ton interplanetary ship at 8000 miles per hour without any shielding, or bunching up 50 fuel tanks into a 300 ton asparagus lifter. It goes on and on. If we were to strictly stick with only things that are possible, then we would have a game about going to the moon, building a LEO spacetation, and setting up satellites / probes. And nothing else. We all exploit the deficiencies in realism of KSP to achieve whatever goals we set for our missions and designs \u003Cem\u003Eand have fun in doing so\u003C/em\u003E. Your designs are no different, and if you think that because when you slap a jet nozzle on the back of a rocket fuel tank, it is somehow more realistic because you only put \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E glowing blue air intake on the front, you are deluding yourself. It is a personal and arbitrary limit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not interested in any video game glory (or honor, lol) to be gained by adhering your particular arbitrary highhorse. Heck, \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E about my Tiny SSTOs (which is what seems to have insulted you so) was about breaking the limits of believably. THAT WAS THE POINT.
