While there isn\u0027t anything groundbreaking in the design, I was fairly pleased with how it came out.\n\n![ecDiPtr.png](http://i.imgur.com/ecDiPtr.png)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/VfUUT)\n\n66 tons, 132 parts without cargo. So far it can take about 10 tons to LKO, and I suspect more, if you can fit it in the bay and pilot well.\n\nAction groups:\n\n1 - toggle turbojet\n\n2 - toggle rapier\n\n3 - toggle nukes\n\n4 - switch cycle on one pair of rapiers\n\n5 - open/close intakes\n\n6 - solar panels\n\n7 - cargo bay doors\n\n8 - unassigned\n\n9 - deploy / retract escape pod landing gear\n\n0 - escape pod parachute\n\nabort - detach cockpit escape module\n\nFlight instructions are fairly standard, from what I can tell.\n\nPitch to 20 degrees, climb to about 10k. At 10k, level out (about 10 degrees), or even dive slightly, until you hit 500 m/s. Resume climb until 20km up (don\u0027t overshoot). Level out and build speed; you should be able to hit 1400 m/s or more. When you stop gaining speed, fire up the nukes and hit 4 to toggle one of the rapier pairs over to closed cycle. Pitch up and begin the climb to orbit. Hit 1 to shut off the turbojet when it flames out, the rapiers will switch mode automatically. Gradually pitch down as your velocity increases, and ride the nukes into orbit. You should have a fair bit of LF remaining, and on a good run, you may have oxidizer as well.\n\nA note of caution - it gets unstable if you try to fly at low altitudes at high speed when the craft is light. So don\u0027t try to just dive to burn off speed on re-entry, or you will be testing the emergency abort system.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/92cHRUn6wvw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/3LJohEf2KUU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/LqtoKmZ7w1I?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n[Download link](http://www./download/0rzuya7qqaf20e2/Hikaze_Mk1j.craft)\n\n![screenshot2564.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3333645/screenshot2564.png)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T02:55:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 02:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by drewscriver**\n  \nadded info, videos"},{"CreatedByName":"stardestroyer","CreatedById":106618,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T20:44:20Z","Content":"Love that escape moule! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"GarrisonChisholm","CreatedById":146403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:27:41Z","Content":"This is a beautiful ship.
