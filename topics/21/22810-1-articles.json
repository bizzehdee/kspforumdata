After all in real life space companies are generally separated into launch providers (who build and fly launch vehicles) and payload makers (SATCOM, GPS, space agencies, military, etc) who build payload and buy launch services. By having a family of tested and reliable rockets with well know performance stats ready to be tipped with payload we could save a lot of time that would otherwise go into building custom launch vehicles for each new payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I present the Zenith rocket family.

Now load up Orbiter 1A again, click on the purple subassembly button, browse to where you\u0027ve saved your subassembly, clock on it and load. Your mouse will now have Zenith III underneath. Attach it to the bottom of the payload.

The way I figured it, if the goal is to send the largest single piece payload possible on a given rocket one would aim for the lowest stable orbit possible. Once the payload is released into this low stable orbit you can then dock space tugs to it and take it to the final target orbit, where ever that is. 70km is too dangerous and unwieldy to use so I settled for a 75km orbit. It\u0027s possible to launch progressively smaller payloads to higher and higher orbits on the same rocket (eg, Nova launching the 70 ton \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24775-0-19-1-MOLAB-Heavy-Manned-Munar-Rover\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMOLAB\u003C/a\u003E to Munar orbit), but it\u0027s not possible to launch inert payload much larger than the one on the specification no matter what you do since you\u0027re left with only 5km to play with.
