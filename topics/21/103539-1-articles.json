I will add the downloads after school today but here\u0027s some pictures so you can get exited. I\u0027m also gonna release a 2.0 of the expeimental VTOL, a sea-biplane and a jet VTOL inspired by the osprey.\n\nDa Vinci: a rocket propelled plane based loosely based on one of Da Vinci\u0027s Quad wing designs.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

To land it simply hit backspace to deploy parachutes, cut thrust to 0, and deploy legs. (One use only craft due to lack of way to get back into the cockpit and legs breaking upon landing)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
