Fortunately, as of 0.10.1 this no longer actually ends your flight, but it\u0027s a bit annoying... 0.11 should fix it with dedicated RCS parts, hopefully!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter further testing, it can easily make circular orbit at about 80km with half a tank left in the K2-X upper stage, not to mention the full command pod tank. I\u0027d imagine it\u0027ll be able to send Kerbals to orbit the mun and return them safely to Kerbin. Not so sure if it could send an entire lander, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brovine","CreatedById":4666,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-17T08:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERCS module don\u0027t need a lot of parachute to survive landing - a couple of radial chutes on each should do the job, if dead crew bothers you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bigred2989","CreatedById":3056,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-18T02:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does the crew suddenly die after a few seconds of flight in the second stage?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feragorn","CreatedById":7549,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-18T03:42:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERCS modules crash.
