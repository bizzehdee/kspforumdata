I\u0027ve recently started to use KSP Interstellar again, so I thought it would be fun to see your contaptions maybe using warp drives, maybe fusion powered engines and maybe thermal turbojets? Maybe you have some cool millitary interplanetary troop tansport or maybe an antimatter refuelling space station around Jool? Show it off there (if you want to)!!!\n\nFor an example here\u0027s my WIP cargo lifting SSTO:\n\n![DSRwz2T.png](http://i.imgur.com/DSRwz2T.png)\n\nIt hs two 2.5m thermal turbojet engines combined with two fusion reactors of the same size. It passed it\u0027s first tests, I got it to the orbit but crashed on landing ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Othuyeg","CreatedById":105454,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T09:39:21Z","Content":"A sneaky thermal turbojet... with an antimatter reactor.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
