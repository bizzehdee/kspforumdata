Generally each model takes a couple hours to build, and then another hour or so of tweaking to get right. \n\nThat\u0027s if all goes well, of course. I have some planes that have taken over 5 hours to get flying right and they still aren\u0027t done."},{"CreatedByName":"Hummingbird Aerospace","CreatedById":187811,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-04T14:59:16Z","Content":"Finally some decent WWII models! I really like your cleveland, to be honest, it\u2019s probably the best stock ship on the forums I\u2019ve seen so far. Those fighters look brilliant. I especially like the open-cockpit design of your fighters. That final kerbpaint touch, although not neccisarily stock, makes everything look even better. I would install kerbpaint just to see your models. \n\nI have a suggestion, the Schwerer Gustav railgun the Germans used (a bit) in WWII. Maybe you could even incorporate a stock cannon into it!\n\nI don\u2019t know what \u002Brep means, I think it means good job, so \u221Erep!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-04T15:01:46Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2019 03:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Hummingbird Aerospace**"}]}
