It will save you hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the design itself, you are seriously lacking rocket power, or have an excess of fuel weight. May I assume some of the oxidizer is emptied?

I would just add boost engines for the climb to orbit, something like two LV-909s or four Rockomax 24-77s. That way you still get to use the nuke while not lugging a prohibitive amount of engine mass to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the engine configuration you have can also be made to work, you just need less weight in general.

If your AoA is that high, you probably need a little bit more wing area. That will help keep your AoA down, which will reduce your drag and increase your intake efficiency. You\u0027re getting up to pretty high speeds, but you should get a little higher in altitude too. Your picture of 1400\u002B m/s at 21km is great, you just need to get up a bit higher and you\u0027ll continue to accelerate. I think having a little bit more wing area will help with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, it looks like you have enough intakes and you have a high enough engine/mass ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s good to level out and accelerate at 25km like you did, but you need to then get above ~32km and your orbit will start to stretch out. If you can get your orbit stretched out then you can work your altitude a bit higher. Eventually you should be high/fast enough that you can fire up the rocket and point upward a bit more to get above the rest of the atmosphere. That will then buy you some time to use the LVN to finish the orbital insertion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find with dual TurboJet designs, it\u0027s tough to get a really good atmospheric circularization due to the asymmetric thrust issues.
