It has stable controls, have yet to get it to go into a spin, and it has a really low takeoff speed which is great for fuel conservation and no-powered landings. On full power it will last about 19 minutes flight time. It can barell roll and loop (loop is a gain and loss of about 3km) and it turns how you expect a jet liner to turn, maybe a little better. Running on jets alone, it wont make it much higher than 9k alt., still its fun to fly and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese images are after a successful test flight and landing.
