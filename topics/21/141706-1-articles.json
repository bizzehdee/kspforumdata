since I am totally obsessed over the Orion program from the 60s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also loaded up the Outer Planets mod, so I have Other Worlds and Outer Planets both integrated in and waiting for Kerbals to visit. \u00A0So I started trying to design a \u0022realistic\u0022 deep space ship to journey to Cercani. \u00A0I\u0027m not 100% sure, but based on armchair calculations, I think I can get the DSE-02 to Cercani in under 2 kerbin-years. \u00A0So that\u0027s the mission, and the goal: to load up Jeb, Bob, Bill, Valentine, and 20 of their fellow Kerbonauts and journey father than any Kerbal has ever gone before - and in the meantime, the successors to the DSE-02 can visit Jool, Sarnus, Urlum, Neidon, and Plock. \u00A0I haven\u0027t seen a lot of large deep space ship designs out there (when I say \u0022a lot\u0022, I mean more than 20), and none that looked the way I would design one, so I thought I\u0027d share it with folks in case they wanted to fly it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DSE-02 uses something like 14 mods at minimum, including one I just uploaded to Spacedock with a greenhouse. \u00A0Technically, it should also have the following patch put somewhere that Module Manager can see it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E// OKS Workshop mod\n\n//Add OSE Workshop capabilities to the OKS Workshop\n\n@UmbraSpaceIndustries:AFTER[UmbraSpaceIndustries] //Edit USI after USI has been processed\n@PART[OKS_Workshop]:NEEDS[Workshop] //Edit the part OKS_Workshop if OSE Workshop is installed\n//The Workshop OKS Module is smaller, less efficient than the Fabricator\n{\n  MODULE\n  {\n    name = OseModuleWorkshop\n    ConversionRate = 1.0 // How much of a parts mass needs to be processed until it is done\n    ProductivityFactor = 0.05 // How much units of the resource a processed per second\n    UpkeepResource = ElectricCharge // This resource will be consumed 1 per second during processing\n    InputResource = MaterialKits // This resource will be used to process the items\n    MinimumCrew = 1 // Amount of Kerbals needed for the Workshop to work\n    MaxPartVolume = 1000.0\n    Animate = true\n  }\n  MODULE\n  {\n    name = OseModuleRecycler\n    ConversionRate = 0.15 // How much of a parts mass will be recycled\n    ProductivityFactor = 0.1 // How much units of the resource a processed per second\n    UpkeepResource = ElectricCharge // This resource will be consumed 1 per second during processing\n    OutputResource = MaterialKits // This resource will be created \n    MinimumCrew = 1 // Amount of Kerbals needed for the Recycler to work\n  }\n\tRESOURCE\n\t{\n\t\tname = ExoticMinerals\n\t\tamount = 0\n\t\tmaxAmount = 200\n\t\tisTweakable = True\n\t}\t\n\tRESOURCE\n\t{\n\t\tname = RareMetals\n\t\tamount = 0\n\t\tmaxAmount = 200\n\t\tisTweakable = True\n\t}\t\n  \n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis MM patch allows the OKS workshop near the bow to act as an OSE worksohp for parts up to a volume of 1,000. \u00A0I didn\u0027t feel the UKS Fabricator matched the style I was aiming for on this ship. \u00A0Note that using this patch is kind of subverting RoverDude\u0027s intent re: part balance in UKS, so use at your own risk and discretion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe intent of the design is for a crew of 24, who live in the spinning centrifuge habitats, and work in the workshop, shipyard, command centers, and the Kerbitat near the stern (which is supposed to be the \u0022engineering\u0022 section of the ship. \u00A0Probably 4 pilots, 8 scientists, and 12 engineers. \u00A0Once the ship is underway, the crew would enter the DeepFreeze units and hibernate for a good portion of the 2 year journey to Cercani. \u00A0They\u0027d need to be woken up though, so perhaps a couple crew members would stay awake for the trip in case anything happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship uses Tweakscale on a couple of parts, most notably the inflatable heat shield on the front, which serves as a whipple shield to prevent cosmic dust from damaging the ship, and also allows aerobraking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may end up doing some YouTube videos or something of the trip, though I\u0027m not sure how to do that and have them be interesting. \u00A0We\u0027ll see. \u00A0Anyway, enjoy, and I hope that I\u0027ve posted something that was at least worth the read. \u00A0Hope you\u0027re all building some awesome spaceships/stations/spaceplanes out there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT - Oh, I forgot! \u00A0There are 2 main reasons I\u0027m using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130809-11-kerbodyne-plus/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbodyne Plus mod\u003C/a\u003E (other than \u0022because it\u0027s awesome\u0022). First, there are some excellent hypergolic RCS units with some real kick, which DSE-02 needs to turn in any reasonable amount of time. \u00A0Second, launching a Nuclear Pulse Propulsion rocket from the surface isn\u0027t politically tenable on Earth, and perhaps not on Kerbin either. \u00A0For Orion in the 1960s, an idea was floated to build a gigantic Nova booster to loft it to an altitude where it (Orion) could be safely lit off. \u00A0I\u0027ve taken that approach here, and have a Kerbodyne Plus \u0022Behemoth\u0022 cluster at the bottom to get things off the ground. \u00A0Otherwise the ship pogoes on the launch pad when the first NPU-500 detonates, and it destroys the launchpad.
