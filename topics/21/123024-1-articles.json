It was built with Duna in mind, carrying just enough TWR and Delta-V to get off that rock when fully loaded. It features eight drill-o-matics, four large holding tanks, and an ISRU, so you don\u0027t have to pay to land your ascent fuel. Eight Gigantors provide power to keep the drills going while the Sun is up. No provision is made for nighttime operations, so land at dawn and shutdown when the sun goes down. A Mk-1 lander can slung underneath allows an engineer to operate your drills with much greater efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen operated by a lvl 5 engineer, John Henry will fill its ore tanks fast! The design goals were to r@pe the land, look good doing it, and get away fast. John Henry has you covered on all points!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJohn Henry has two mod parts; an M1-SD1 dome tank at the top of each engine nacell (4x symmetry) and a Kerbodyne-SpaceY stack guidance system right below the holding tanks. The end user could easily swap mod parts for stock parts with little trouble, if desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with all craft, all warranties are void if you actually fire it up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/FmH2P\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
