View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea basically was that since I think I\u0027ve seen devs mention the idea of an \u0022enhanced IVA\u0022 feature, I could make a station that you can jetpack inside of. It has a column made of micronodes (coupled with generous strutting) to keep the whole thing together without taking up too much space. There\u0027s 2 capsules with the doors pointed inside and 2 single-use doors that essentially are panels glued to radial decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be neither that well designed or anything new, but the chamber\u0027s purpose was to test the idea of getting into making a part pack of rooms, hollow tubes, windows, hatches and permeable docking ports for space stations. Stock stations in KSP (beside fuel depots) are usually of little use and to be honest, this part pack alone wouldn\u0027t help with that. However, it could make building bases and stations a bit more interesting!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile making it only a part pack may be of limited interest, I wonder if by also writing a plugin with it there would be interesting things to try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, Feel free to share your thoughts, ideas and/or suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPS: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003EList of my \u0022ideas\u0022: In some of these pictures (these with the borders) I am using the first person view of lazors system. It handles better than I thought it would, the only problem in it is that while looking left/right is easy, I cant look down/up. A mod like I\u0027m discussing would be interesting if combined with a life support mod, where you would need to keep chambers pressurized. You also could make various instruments that need to be in the line of sight of a kerbal to be read, or you could just make a radiation shielding mod, that would simply use the solar panel game mechanic, only in reverse.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-10T06:15:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2014 06:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by z26\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harald705","CreatedById":93266,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T07:03:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice work there z26!
