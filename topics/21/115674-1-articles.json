I\u0027m aiming towards interplanetary rockets and base modules. My first design is a centrifuge that can go to Mun, Minmus, Eve, Duna, and maybe Ike, Jool, and Dres. It includes a lander with parachutes, RCS, and infinite electric charge. The main craft with the lander has 4,358 delta-v. The monoprop is for rotation, the pods for habitation, and lander is for exploration (rhyming). Of course, you don\u0027t have to use the lander. You could dock whatever you want to it! Turn it into a station! \n\nNo pics no clicks.\n\n![vq9PoLO.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/vq9PoLO.jpg?1)\n\nDownload!\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/e9hfp5ekojbbkay/Yuri%27s%20Centerfuge.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e9hfp5ekojbbkay/Yuri%27s%20Centerfuge.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T01:44:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 01:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HoloYolo**"}]}
