A stop that flys on its own. I present you with the hypothetical craft: Albo-356. Alba-356 is an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSto\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is based off of the Albatross. You can find the craft in the game. The craft instead will have rapper engines and rocket fuel. And more evelons. I find that the Albatross\u2019s design allowed it to fly with out any pitch. This was mind hogging and after playing I came up with the idea of making a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESsto\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E just like the Albatross. I haven\u2019t tested or made the craft yet but I plan to do so. You may ask we didn\u2019t I use YouTubers sstos. Well. There hard to fly and there complicated. So I yet to design and image an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESsto\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to fly.

Tell em if the craft works. If it doesn\u2019t.

You mean that it takes off the runway without any input? That\u0027s because it has a built in pitch of 7\u00B0 on the runway due to the placement of its landing gear\u00A0and 4\u00B0 wing incidence on top of that. So yeah, you\u0027re not going to need to pitch up when your wings already have an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E of 11\u00B0. It still requires lots of pitch control once airborne.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest way to get a plane to require barely any pitch control is to put the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E right on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and use wing incidence.

Yeah you can make it work, but you could make it so much better as an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E by using less wing and surface attachments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-01T22:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell the wing area is important to make the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E easier to fly.

Drag makes you waste fuel and wasting fuel makes you not go to space. Built-in angle of attack on wings adds lots of drag at high speed, so many\u00A0SSTOs usually don\u2019t\u00A0use much/any wing angling and instead just use\u00A0the angle of the landing gear (or running out of runway) to pitch up on takeoff and then push\u00A0to gain speed as fast as possible to reduce the angle of attack needed to climb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Albatross is a subsonic, high lift seaplane and really not suited for converting into an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. A better choice would be something like the Ravenspear Mk4 or later model Aeris jets (I think at least one of those is a spaceplane already but may require tweaking to be a usable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E) as it\u2019s easier to make an already fast plane faster than a slow one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want a useful, low tech and low cost \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, check this one out:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Kronus_Aerospace/Kronus-LowTech-20-Ton-SSTO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Kronus_Aerospace/Kronus-LowTech-20-Ton-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s\u00A0easy to fly, requires only level 2 buildings (very useful when a level 3 R\u0026amp;D upgrade to get the fancy ramjet\u00A0and RAPIER costs over 4 million!)\u00A0and\u00A0has become the workhorse of my current career game due to its amazingly low cost per ton of payload to orbit-\u00A020 tons to 100km\u00A0for under 5k funds per flight with plenty of scope to carry bigger payloads and/or to higher altitudes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IronMaiden","CreatedById":193062,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-02T18:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, wing area is very important, but the Albatross\u0027s is way overkill.
