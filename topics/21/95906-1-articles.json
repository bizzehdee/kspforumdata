I present: The KSS Gull-Class Utility Transport (UT). This craft is an SSTO that can transport midsize loads into space in its cargo bay, and a crew of six Kerbals in addition to a pilot and engineer. A dorsal docking port provides access to space stations. The ship has enough fuel to take its load into a 100km orbit, with just enough fuel to return to the KSC if you use the monoprop to deorbit. Also, for in-atmospheric emergencies, the spaceplane does come with an emergency abort system, which will pull the cabin and crew compartment away from the rest of the craft and activate parachutes which will slow the craft to a safe landing and recovery velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly mod used for this particular craft is B9 Aerospace - at this point I\u0027m only using stock aero, but will move up to FAR when I feel more confident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/9XT97\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
