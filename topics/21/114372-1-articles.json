My problem is that I hate giving up... why it wasn\u0027t needed was because I wanted one of these for orbit around Kerbal and another for the Mun. In the end, I launched two smaller stations which did the job. The big station looked like it would shake apart with oscillations if even a small supply rocket docked with it.
