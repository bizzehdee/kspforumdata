When your liquid fuel hits ~470 turn on the LFEs and ride about level until your jet suffocates, bring throttle to full, and kill the jet engine \u0026amp; close the intakes, then pull up to ~45 degrees until around 36km. Just like the other Sparrows, this has a \u003Cstrong\u003Every tight fuel margin\u003C/strong\u003E. It\u0027s very stable to fly though, though it needs a smidge of trim to stay perfectly level after take off, but you\u0027ll adjust the back before you engage the LFEs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/qosoj23ak7eeani/KH-X_FatSparrow.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload .craft file here\u003C/a\u003E (MediaFire))\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-11T03:07:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2013 03:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by zombiphylax\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T14:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou lie!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbals would not have re-enforced the wing roots until tat least the SECOND test flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, well done. \u002B Rep\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zombiphylax","CreatedById":5471,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T00:18:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was honestly around the 4th or 5th test flight... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the rep!
