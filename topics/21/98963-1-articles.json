I decided to design a spacecraft today, one that would be able to fly at incredibly low speeds. But once I finally finished it, I discovered some interesting side-effects of the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VTB84kH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VTB84kH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like it would maneuver like a sofa, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWRONG!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought that too, but this thing is RIDICULOUS. I put it into a turn just above KSC to see how bad it was, and I got this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AVRolmz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AVRolmz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E36.5 Gs. And all stock too. With only \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E engine, at no more than 200m/s on a horizontal prograde. The record in a challenge on these forums a while ago was 23g. Pssh. That\u0027s nothin\u0027. It also flies slightly upwards of where your craft is pointed, which is fun. No only can it pull INSANE Gs, you can also do this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Gt6HAVb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Gt6HAVb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMash whatever key you have bound to stick-back, elevators up, whatever you want to call pulling up, and it will spin 180 degrees and will almost come to a complete stop midair (since the engine is pointing prograde), and you can do crazy tight turns like this one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I decided I would see how much it could lift with the angled lift surfaces and all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YzBK60x.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YzBK60x.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a 7.22 TON(\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ENE?\u003C/span\u003E) module (modded, but it\u0027s just what I had on hand that was heavy, the actual aircraft is stock). The craft weighs 7.4 t, so it can lift a LOT of weight (I think that\u0027s a lot, it seems like a lot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMajor flaws? Just fuel balancing, since all of the fuel is right on the nose. This can be remedied with more fuel, balancing skills, and maybe alt\u002Bf12, if that\u0027s your style. I\u0027m bad at all of those, so flights are currently limited to only a moderate time of brain-melting Gs. Oh, and don\u0027t forget SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all, it\u0027s just a CRAZY aircraft.
