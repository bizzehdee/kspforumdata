Hit 45degrees at ~28km up, and slowly bring your nose toward the horizon. Should have 1/3-1/2 of a LFT, as well as about 1/2 of each jet fuel tank. Has RCS for orbital maneuvering.\n\nLet me know what you think!"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMunRules#1","CreatedById":17298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T22:30:41Z","Content":"Took it up following your flight plan and it worked pretty well. I got it into orbit with plenty of fuel to spare like you said. Reentry was smooth but it felt a bit wobbly flying with a joystick. Would have been nice to have some kind of ASAS. Otherwise, nice job. I\\\u0027ve been looking for a small space plane orbiter like this."},{"CreatedByName":"RayneCloud","CreatedById":11227,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T22:59:29Z","Content":"Really good work on this one bud. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"zombiphylax","CreatedById":5471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T02:48:11Z","Content":"Thanks guys! I agree, it would be damned near perfect with some SAS, I just couldn\\\u0027t figure out the weight loss while including RCS. this weekend I\\\u0027ll try again."}]}
