The \u003Cem\u003EIbis\u003C/em\u003E-type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhilst the prototype Ibis was a total failure - with as much stability as a mental health patient in a heavy-duty padded-wall affair of a cell for a good reason - the complete version has shown itself not just able to carry itself to 35,000 metres and drag itself into a decaying orbit needing constant attention of the crew, but to be able to power up to 45,000 and rising before ploughing with ease its way into a perfectly stable 115,000 metre periapsis orbit. All that with two and a quarter tanks to spare, an entire three quarters of a tank more than the \u003Cem\u003EKestrel\u003C/em\u003E, which must use more fuel to pull itself around. The vessel sports the same high-power gimballing engine as the \u003Cem\u003EKestrel Responder\u003C/em\u003E, which itself proved slightly better at lifting both heavy objects and itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lets not forget reentry. Whilst parachute drogue systems and final Advanced Decent Heavy chutes have yet to be added, the \u003Cem\u003EIbis\u003C/em\u003E boasts a much larger wing surface area than the older \u003Cem\u003EKestrel\u003C/em\u003E. And its smaller weight gives it less to be concerned about during touchdown. For munar landings, like the \u003Cem\u003EKestrel\u003C/em\u003E, it carries an extensive RCS network, which should also assist during maneuvers and act as turbulence suppression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SIVWp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SIVWp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/16vDY.png\u0022 alt=\u002216vDY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-14T12:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ipFQb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ipFQb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/No9lX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022No9lX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spandaxe","CreatedById":11527,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-14T12:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve expected EVE\\\u0027s Ibis. ):\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-14T14:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERed, y u no make VTOL/gliding capabilities to land?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EY U USE PARACHUTES\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-14T14:28:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEVE names a lot of ships after birds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo do modern day militaries.
