Now we have this huge ball of ressources around Mun. The PB Mining Corperation now uses this event to demonstrate their new Combination Mining Base System.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst we sent up one of our standard 6x drills and a construction drone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that we designed an engine bay, including 2 small reactors for the power supply, 2 cooling sails and an controlroom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOre isn\u0027t that much fun at all, so we brought up a refinery, including 2 large reactors for fast conversion of ore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that we delivered the docking ports. We have the possibility for 2,5m modules like ore tanks to put in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur future Plans are a Station for research, housing and tourism near Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPictures of this project can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/IKI0d\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/IKI0d\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-17T13:36:08Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2015 01:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB.Osiris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castille7","CreatedById":101668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T22:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice work, it looks very well planned. This should also make a really nice refueling station\u00A0rather than having to launch more fuel to a station for refueling.
