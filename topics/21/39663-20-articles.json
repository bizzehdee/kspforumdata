So why, and how do you go about keeping it from happening? The short version of the answer is \u0022if you use a connection node twice, it will stop letting fuel pass through\u0022. And that\u0027s pretty much the \u003Cem\u003Ebest\u003C/em\u003E explanation, too. Nodes are the green thingies that show up on the VAB whenever you grab a part, BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s explain with an example, in this case that VTOL engine mount you are talking about. The first cubic strut is connected by surface attachment to the tank, so no fuel routing issues there (surface attachment always works). The second is attached to the free node of the first (actually, since it attached with surface attachment, it has TWO free nodes), and the next attaches to the one that remains free. So on and so forth, until you get to the engine which is also attached to a free node, ergo, no fuel pipes required. If you attach intakes to any of the cubic struts, though, the fuel flow will break and you will need to add lines to bypass the block. Now this means that there is another way to do this: You could start the strut column from the underside, put the engine clipped through them, and it would still drain fuel OK if it was stuck to a free node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou guys also use a lot of clipping techniques here, so perhaps a tiny bit of comment on that is in order: \u003Cem\u003Ethe only real difference between turning part clipping on and off is that you can use non-free nodes and therefore screw with the fuel routing\u003C/em\u003E. That\u0027s right, everything else can be clipped just the same as if you had the \u0022cheat\u0022 on, thanks to the three part clipping bugs the UI has: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- The game only checks collision meshes intersecting, so you can put a part inside another without the game knowing you are \u0022cheating\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- The game only checks the collision meshes of the craft and the root part of what you are attaching, so if your cubic strut will fit, it doesn\u0027t matter if it has a gazillion tanks and engines hanging off it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- If you put it someplace else and then move it around, the game doesn\u0027t refresh the clipping/not clipping status of the part you are holding until it is no longer in contact with the craft at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, another final point to avoid construction bugs: sometimes, when you drop a part into the ship connecting to a node, it will pick a weird parent (that\u0027s what happens when later, you take out a random part and some other part that isn\u0027t even touching it comes off with it). Why, and how do you stop it from happening? Well, have you noticed how some parts highlight a bit when you are about to drop another part on them? That\u0027s the game telling you which part it thinks it is attaching the next one to. The future parent part, in other words. So take care when dropping parts in complicated builds, and know that it helps a lot to place them if you grab them form somewhere close to the node you are going to use to connect them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, \u0022part clipping: on\u0022 only means you build with much less hassle, once you know the UI quirks in the first place, for all those who think it is the ultimate cheat. It really doesn\u0027t let you do much you couldn\u0027t do another way.
