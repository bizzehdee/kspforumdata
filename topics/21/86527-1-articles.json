I had to cheat a bit because KSP aerodynamics, but only a TINY bit (two clipped control surfaces on the back to bring CL backwards). Other than that, no hidden magic: two intakes, two fuel lines, no other clipping at all anywhere and just a couple of struts to keep it firm. And it draws fuel perfectly fine! CoM doesn\u0027t move at all during all the flight, and cares not about the payload you put in there since it\u0027s right in the middle of the bay. The 5.1mT test payload means that for very little fuel, you can lift a considerable fraction of your takeoff weight to orbit (\u0026gt;25% of GLOW as cargo!). The only difficult thing about the design was actually lifting off: rotation speed might be ~70m/s, but actual liftoff with the clearance it has takes about 105m/s, the clearance to get enough angle of attack is a couple millimeters (if the tail wasn\u0027t raised, you wouldn\u0027t be able to take off before the lip of the runway), and I was insisting on doing it by hand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery true to the original of course, which also has an insane wing loading when full, and taking off at similar speed! Which might be great for the replica part, but the number of tailstrikes before I convinced myself I just wasn\u0027t a good enough pilot was horrifying. In the end I added an extra wheel on the tail to make it impossible to leave parts on the runway... fortunately for my test pilots it\u0027s unmanned!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, I did it mostly because the new parts were screaming at me to do it.

I suggest you try with smaller loads until you get the hang of it\u0027s airhogging altitude and profile (when I rebuild it of course, although it still kind of works, I just have to move wings around a bit to get the smooth lines back, and probably a bigger cargo bay if I mess with the engine pods).

But my wing loading is already through the roof, and even though they have a (very) long lever arm, those canards don\u0027t provide that much torque (and are the only control surfaces visible with pitch control enabled). The rear winglets (which are no longer visible, BTW) not only bring the CoL right behind the center of the bay (where CoM is through the flight), they also increase pitch authority greatly so it can maintain 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA AoA\u0027s on SAS without sliding, AND bring up total lift, making it able to lift off before the lip of the runway. I already have a takeoff speed of over 300km/h...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the angle itself, yeah, theoretically that would make sense. As well as angling the engine and intakes, and the wing itself while we are at it. But not only would I kill the looks, those kind of tricks have to be tailored to a specific flight condition (low speed-low altitude or high speed-high altitude). Some are dominated by thrust, some by lift, and it is literally impossible to balance for both even in RL. Which is why I went with the totally doable, 100% symmetric KSP vibe that never gets you any unwanted torque. Not realistic, but then again KSP aerodynamic model.

So thanks for the screenie, and I hope you have fun with it! As to intakes, I actually have to engage in a bit of a test program myself... I have a hunch something changed with the last update, but I haven\u0027t had the time to check with a model I already know the performance of. Used to be the more intakes you had, the more performance you got.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. More on that later!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
