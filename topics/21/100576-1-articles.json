I\u0027ve actually built some versions, but none were as ridiculously stable and maneuverable as this one. You really have to try it out for yourself to see how good this thing is. Without SAS enabled, it will pitch down, but that is normal, but since it\u0027s thrust that is turning, flying upside down will make it pitch up. As these things go, this replica is pretty fast (you can see some mach effects in the second pic). It has the big machine gun it is known for in the front ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n[**DOWNLOAD**](http://www./download/97e4lhluqncackw/A-10\u002BWarthog.craft)\n\n![0DmV02p.png](http://i.imgur.com/0DmV02p.png)\n![YGg1YRn.png](http://i.imgur.com/YGg1YRn.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T01:17:02Z","Content":"Looks pretty cool, I wonder how it would do with the BD armory 30mm cannon.

Yes I have (stock, I don\u0027t really use mods), and it worked out fine. I used SAS, haven\u0027t tested without, so that might be an issue, but I doubt it. You\u0027d probably just pull down a little quicker.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-24T14:32:38Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2015 02:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by manni01**"}]}
