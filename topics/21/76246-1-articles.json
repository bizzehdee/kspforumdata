My advise is keep the nosecone pointed to the stars and you will be alright. If all else fails there is always backspace (followed by 0 and 9). Start your gravity turn at 7.500m (to 70 degrees) at 15.000 (to 45 degrees) until your periapsis is 50.000m, then start following the direction marker until you have reached your preferred orbital height, 85.000x85.000 works well for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the ALSEP from under the LEM can be a hassle.
