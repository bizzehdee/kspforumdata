Complete with SLS booster, Block I ICPS \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Crange extender\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, ATV derived service module and Orion capsule.\n\n[DOWNLOAD](http://www.whoshotdk.co.uk/KSP/Ships/VAB/Orion/SLS-BlockI-ATVSM-OrionMPCV.craft)\n\nRight-click the download link and use \u0027Save As\u0027 or similar.\n\nTLDR? Just read this important bit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\n**Separation between ATV-SM and Block I \\*may\\* be a tiny bit quirky - nothing real bad should happen but you might have a minor space-tussle as the engine fairing of the ATV-SM clips the discarded Block I. Quicksave before separation if in doubt!**\n\nStatistics\n\nSubject to change.\n\n**Tonnage:** 54t dry\n\n**Parts:** 190\n\n**After SLS \u0026 LES separation; Delta-V:** 2,652m/s\n\n**After Block I separation; Delta-V:** 1,360m/s (approximately 20m/s out from the real thing, according to Wikipedia)\n\n**Total Delta-V:** 7,114 m/s\n\nLaunch parameters - 200km circular orbit\n\n1. Enable SAS and launch\n\n2. Begin gravity turn 45deg east at 7km\n\n3. Stage - Drop SRBs when empty\n\n4. Action group 0 - Discard the LES (non-abort)\n\n5. Stage - Drop SLS booster when empty\n\n On decouple, give a quick squirt on the engines to ease the Block I / SM / MPCV out of the booster fairing\n\n6. Circularise your orbit with the Block I engines\n\n7. Action Groups 4, 5, 6 - extend antenna, solar panels and switch on the lights\n\nLanding parameters\n\n1. Perform de-orbit burn\n\n2. Decouple the ATV-SM\n\n3. Deploy drogue chute at appropriate altitude - i.e its up to you\n\n4. Deploy main chutes at appropriate altitude\n\n5. Land (speed approximately 7m/s).\n\nAction Groups / Controls\n\n**[4]** Toggle ATV-SM antenna\n\n**[5]** Toggle ATV-SM solar panels\n\n**[6]** Toggle Lights\n\n**[0]** Eject the LES (non-abort)\n\n**[ABORT / Backspace]** Eject the MPCV with LES\n\nNotes\n\nThe booster fairing remains on the SLS booster. I did this because A. I hate tons of debris floating around, B. It helps keep part count down and C. Emerging from the fairing like an apprehensive mouse from its hole looks cool.\n\nThis version of the SLS booster can put you into a 100km circular orbit with a couple of DV to spare. In real life, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d drop the SLS booster before circularisation and use the Block I to circularise. Aiming for higher orbits *will require* some help from Block I. \n\nThe CM has RCS thrusters so you can do a bit of maneuvering even after ATV-SM separation.\n\nI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to improve this at some point into a Mark II version. If you know a bit about Orion and can see something particularly wrong with this craft I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d be happy to hear some constructive criticism. Obviously the scale is smaller than real-life, but I can live with that as I want to keep the part count down. I realize the fairing is wrong too - I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m waiting for KSP 1.0 with its procedural fairings to help fix that issue.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
