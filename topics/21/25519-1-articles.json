Compared to the Skeeter jet fuel capacity has been reduced from 320 to 160 while the amount of rocket fuel has been increased by 400 units. This will still give you more then enough jet fuel to make it into orbit without wasting oxidizer, while the extra rocket fuel means that the R-type has excellent space based performance not far off the Minnow. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cwAiZk4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cwAiZk4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs well as fantastic SSTO performance the R-Type also comes with a powerful launch vehicle and landing gantry that will let you ferry your R-type to the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike, Gilly and beyond.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kOG7iMC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kOG7iMC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter touch down the Landing Gantry can be dismantled, clearing the way for your ascent into the heavens.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z0b4cVu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Z0b4cVu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VOqllBa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VOqllBa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yaSbSxr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yaSbSxr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E If launched from the surface of Duna the R-type can return to Kerbin with a reasonable amount of fuel left over.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2auuoCY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222auuoCY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EINSTRUCTIONS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDownload the file from here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://snk.to/f-cduio5ic\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://snk.to/f-cduio5ic\u003C/a\u003E and unzip the contents into your space plane folder.

Once you start picking up speed you\u0027ll feel the nose start to drop down, you\u0027ll need to compensate for this by pulling back on the stick, once you hit thinner air the controls will return to normal. At 25,000 meters you\u0027ll have to start reducing throttle, keep the jets going as long as can but once they run out of air turn them off, fire up the rocket engine and set full throttle. Keep on that 45\u0027 angle until your speed hits around 1500 m/s, then pitch flat to the horizon and keep the rocket motor burning until you clear the atmosphere. Once in orbit you can switch command over to the docking port and round off your orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETAKEOFF PROCEDURE - LAUNCH VEHICLE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELift off with full throttle and leave it there for the whole takeoff run. As soon as you\u0027re able to, switch command over to the docking port on top of the R-type. It\u0027s a bit of a pain but after each stage KSP swaps command back to the cockpit, the best way to deal with this is just to right click on the docking port, and as long as you don\u0027t click the right mouse button again, the menu will stay up, allowing you to easily swap command back over after each stage. At 300 m/s pitch over to a 45\u0027 angle on a 90\u0027 heading. Once you reach 20,000 meters press 1 to shut down the jets and space bar to fire up the atomic engines. After you eject the side mounted mainsails pitch flat to the horizon and build up speed. Once the last of the mainsails are ejected you have the option of shutting down the poodle rockets, and using the stage as a long range drop tank for your atomic engines. Unless you\u0027re planning a trip to Jool this isn\u0027t necessary for most missions. As for the landing gantry it isn\u0027t what you\u0027d call agile, so just make sure you take your time and find a nice flat spot to land. If you\u0027re touching down on Duna you might need to use the R-type\u0027s rocket engine to give the gantry a bit of a boost.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELANDING BACK ON KERBIN\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI think KSP\u0027s flight dynamics are built with space planes in mind, which is why the flight model behaves pretty strangely with my drop ships, especially when it comes to air intakes! Despite all the intakes on the R-type supposedly producing no drag whatsoever during ascent ?!? there\u0027s something that keeps wanting to drag the nose down but I can\u0027t work out what it is, I thought it might be the cockpit but in this cast it\u0027s right at the back, and I would have thought the ship would pitch up, not down. I know it\u0027s not a center of mass issue as like all my vessels I\u0027ve spent a long time balancing the R-type in a vacuum, anyway, if anyone knows the reason I\u0027d love to hear it. Where was I? Oh yes, landing can be a bit of pain, for a start the R-type seems determined to re-enter the atmosphere arse first (??). My advice is to just let it fall and fire up the jets when you get down to around 5000m and regain control. With fuel tanks mostly empty the reduced weight means that the nose will want to pitch down even more then usual, as long as you keep your speed low it\u0027ll be fine but if you go too fast you may find the controls lock up and you\u0027ll end up in a death dive. Once you\u0027re close to landing activating the rocket engine will help get rid of the jet\u0027s throttle lag and let you bring her in for a nice smooth touch down.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uRr23Bz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uRr23Bz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEnjoy!\u003Cbr\u003ECupcake...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malakai030","CreatedById":58141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T15:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I feel a bit impressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClever design, very creative, great functionality, nice lander, cool presentation.
