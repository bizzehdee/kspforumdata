It worked but the landing gear was too low and it still tended to pitch slightly up (see first picture of three engine jet in album).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to fix the landing gear, but that tended to damage the jet\u0027s balance even more. I finally removed the two bottom engines and made it a single engine (See second and third picture of album.) That was better as presumably because the CoM and CoT were closer together. I had issues with it going into a death spiral when ever I tried to brake after leaving the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then created my last revision, (see SPH screenshots and shots of it in flight) which was an improvement as I could keep the death-spiral under control and once or twice regained control. When I finally regained control with it facing the KSC and killed the engines to land I was about to overshoot the land. I had to turn and death-spiraled for the last time (See last photo.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anything obviously wrong with the balance in the photos from the SPH. I will try to upload the latest model and maybe the one before it to the space port, would anyone be interested in looking at it to see what I did wrong and whether the design is salvagable?
