To everyone, as this is my first post. I bought KSP as of 2 days ago, and I thought I would upload my first actual creation, that I would deem \u0027Succesfull\u0027 myself. (At least.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s nothing serious, but it\\\u0027s fun to play around with. I know the rule \\\u0027No pics, no clicks.\\\u0027 but I can\\\u0027t upload any pictures, in all honesty. I am playing on an emergency-solution laptop, and has a bunch of graphical errors. (Stretching textures, random glitchy \u0027holes\u0027 in objects.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s a Space plane, my first one. After messing around with rockets for a while in the demo, I bought the full game and saw you could build space planes. So I created this. Took me several hours. I think I sat from 22:00 one night untill 04:00 In the morning, where I was applauding myself for my glorious work. ;P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it needs around 100 M/s in order to lift off, and has can easily reach 170-180 M/s in air. However, it\\\u0027s a pain in the butt to land, and I suggest you are pretty careful at that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me what you think, opinions, tips for modifying it etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purple100","CreatedById":10989,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T16:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are some screenshots of the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.tinypic.com/qpf9xd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qpf9xd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i50.tinypic.com/35i115t.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002235i115t.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KuddlingKiwi","CreatedById":28901,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T16:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks a heap for uploading pictures of it! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Twinky827","CreatedById":17455,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T16:38:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESir.
