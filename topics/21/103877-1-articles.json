My full-size Falcon 9 and Dragon V2 replica!\n\nLaunch album:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/MF3Og)\n\nThanks to Zucal for the engine pods and to RevanCorana for the lettering!\n\nIt is very hard to land the first stage, but if you want to try (If you do get it to work post the images here! I want to see.) stop burning when you have 1,000 m/s of delta-v and then boost back. Good luck!\n\nThe real falcon is 3.6 meters in diameter. This is 3.75 meters.\n\nLanding the capsule is fairly easy, remember to extend the landing gear.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n[Download](http://kerbalx.com/Mad_Rocket_Scientist/Full-size-Falcon-9)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T21:09:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 09:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mad Rocket Scientist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Zucal","CreatedById":139764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T01:51:35Z","Content":"Wow, that capsule\u002B trunk is pretty... really nice job, and plus rep!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T20:24:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wow, that capsule\u002B trunk is pretty... really nice job, and plus rep!\n\nThanks!\n\nI wish the solar panels covered the trunk better."}]}
