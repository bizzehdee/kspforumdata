Now, watch your vertical speed rise like crazy and when the jets finally give out again (at around 30kms), then turn them off and throttle back up, while lowering your attack angle to get just above your prograde marker. and continue insertion.

You see, by the time you light them, you are almost out of atmo, so the high atmospheric isp is pretty much wasted, and the slightly higher vacuum isp is not enough to justify their lower T/W. Besides, even though it would fit (place it somewhere first, then move it), you would lose the thrust vectoring, and the plane would likely turn uncontrollable on rocket power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T17:55:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys! I\u0027ve noticed that the Gladius is one of my best-sellers (200\u002B downloads), so I figured I would give you guys some sort of an update. Remember the \u0022challenge\u0022 I left you with at the end of the video? (If you got to watch that far, that is) Well, it\u0027s kind of impossible, turns out that after TMI, there are like 50l of fuel left in the tanks. Definitely not enough to brake at munar orbit and then return the bird to Kerbin. So, I came up with some fancy tricks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/wo5pNgr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wo5pNgr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wo5pNgr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, that\u0027s right, that is the lander detached just after the TMI burn. And I\u0027m not crazy! Well, not completely. Midway to the Mun, I have planned to do a tiny burn (~20m/s according to the flight computer) that will make me miss the Mun and fall back to kerbin with a periapsis of about 30 kms, enough to aerobrake my way to solid ground. Meanwhile, the lander will perform a different correction burn, to basically bring the Mun periapsis as low as I can (I think I\u0027ll shoot for about 5 kms), so the braking burn takes me as little as possible (because Oberth and stuff). This is a one-way mission! Mostly because the lander has about 1km/s delta-v, which is nowhere near enough to take off and return after low munar orbit insertion burn and landing. Though I guess I could refuel it at my munar base and return it to orbit... small problem, it doesn\u0027t have chutes to come back home. I guess we will have to think of something. In the meantime, Dudbur is ecstatic that he gets to go the Mun in such a fancy way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a bonus, some nice pictures of the tanker coming back to Kerbin to a runway landing: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ptcqXbS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ptcqXbS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ptcqXbS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/qePj3nT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qePj3nT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qePj3nT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/QNObzvv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QNObzvv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QNObzvv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome further notes: Deorbit burn from a 100km circular orbit took about 20l of liquid fuel and the corresponding oxidizer, though just for kicks, I found that you can also lower periapsis to 50kms with RCS alone. \u003Cstrong\u003EWarning!\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve found out you need a slight touch of engines to bring descent speed into something survivable, so keep about 5l of fuel to perform a safe landing at \u0026lt;10% throttle, I kept 10 and had enough to correct an overshoot and fly by KSC once, with fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
