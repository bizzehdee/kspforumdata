Nothing fancy. But i quickly realised that it is really good for training purposes in KSP1.0. \n\nI only managed to get twice in a 90km orbit around kerbin, after 15\u002B launches and failed most of the time to achieve an orbit at all. \n\nMaybe i am just bad at this game, but i am playing since .19 i think, so there is at least some basic knowledge in my head ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif). \n\nWith this craft you have to burn and ascend very effective(i think ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)) in order to achieve orbit. \n\nI managed to have 3-5 units LF(and equivalent oxidizer of course) left in 90km orbit, so there is not much room for error ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnyway, try out for yourself if you like. Thought it might be useful to others. Have fun. \n\nDear Mods, if this doesn\u0027t justify a single thread, please merge.\n\nGreetings TothAval\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/0faxaprxtkd4c1l/SC-01%20Sparrow%20TV.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0faxaprxtkd4c1l/SC-01%20Sparrow%20TV.craft?dl=0)\n\n![STlcprV.png](http://i.imgur.com/STlcprV.png)"}]}
