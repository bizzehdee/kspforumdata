So here\\\u0027s my shot at stock-parts mashed into a Launch vehicle. I modeled it loosely after the Delta IV rockets. and it works wonderfully using the AR202 auto-ascent system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has (4) strap-on solid boosters, that fire in pairs, followed by (2) liquid fuel strap on boosters, and a Liquid fueled core that fire as the \u00271st\u0027 stage, followed by a single gimbaled Liquid fueld engine for the \u00272nd\u0027 stage, and then finally a smaller ascent / descent engine with a small tank on the lander / crew stage with 8 landing legs for redundancy / durability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrtwinS","CreatedById":19144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-20T14:59:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple but effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lander you say? somehow I dont think you can make it to the moon with that vessel... what is the highest orbit you have reached with it (\u002Bsafe return)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think you might be better of if you fire all 4 thrusters from the beginning, the first few km are the hardest to do, getting your rocket speeding fast will probably save you precious liquid fuel later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, welcome to the forums, and KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverbreez","CreatedById":19459,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-20T16:57:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve taken it to LKO a bunch of times, and also given the auto-ascent gets you into orbit well I\\\u0027ve had enough fuel in the gimbaled stage to do a TMI Burn ..
