Seeing how close I can replicate the Saturn V rocket without actually downloading a mod that gives me an EXACT Saturn V. The result is the \u0022Vulcan\u0022 series. What project of mine will not be is an \u0022EXACT\u0022 replica of the Saturn V. An exact replica requires real world numbers and figures. Since the Kerbal system is scaled down, and KW parts differ from RL parts, an artistic license will be taken. There are currently two things that WILL NOT be replicated in exactness, and that will be the number of engines and three various stage diameters. KW does not currently have any 5m parts, and TBH, you dont really need 5m parts unless they include ALOT less fuel. Otherwise, you could probably get to orbit on 1 5m stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with that said, on to flying this sucker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstruction Manual (you may not be going to the Mun otherwise)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Much like the real life Apollo rocket, this massive contraption is capable of getting you to the Mun and back, or Minmus if you are daring enough. Warranty void if it includes the numbers 1, 12 and/or 13. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight Instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Vulcan Mk II is a two stage rocket capable of reaching even Minmus with a separate Command Service Module and Munar Excursion Module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Due to limited fuel, this rocket requires an ascent profile using 4.9 Km/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV or less. This is to avoid leaving debris in orbit from the second stage. If a probe (such as a Mechjeb AR202) is placed on the second stage, its engines can be fired to bring it smashing into the Munar surface, assuming its pointed retro grade prior to remove the MEM. Otherwise, ensure a sufficient trajectory to bring it re-entering Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch Instructions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Enable ASAS and activate engines and bring to full power gradually. At 50% throttle release the upper launch clamps, upon reaching 100%, release the lower four holding the rocket to the pad. After clearing the tower start your roll program to the 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 mark. Once that is complete pitch over 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and hold until reaching 8.5Km. After passing 8.5Km, pitch over to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and hold, until AP reaches 30K or better. Staging should happen shortly after passing 11Km altitude. Second stage separation is handled by four Ullage motors, fired after the inter-stage coupler releases. After motors have fired, activate the Maverick-V Engine and continue ascent. After confirming a good engine start, jettison the Launch Escape System (hotkey 2). As you continue to climb, start throttling back to keep your AP from getting too far ahead of you. Continue to your parking orbit (125km is good). Stabilize your orbit as needed. After your orbit is established you should have 1.2 Km/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Once your planes are aligned with your target, set up your TMI node, and execute it. Use a FRT for best effect (tip, use your RAD\u002B handle, and time of the node). Once you have finished your TMI burn, you can go ahead and dock up with the MEM. Release of the CSM is achieved by Hotkey 3. Proceed to dock up. Once you have captured the MEM, point the engine of the second stage towards its retro grade and extract the MEM by using Hotkey 4. An electrical uplink is provided from the MEM to the CSM which allows the MEM solar panels to recharge and power the batteries on the CSM. After deploying your solar panels, Move the linked CSM/MEM out of the path of the second stage and fire the second stage engine long enough to bring it smashing into the Munar surface. Continue on to your Munar Mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The MEM has enough fuel to land gently, and more than enough to link back up to the orbiting CSM. After linking back up, time your Ejection burn to land you in an ocean and enjoy the ride home. your Kerbin PE should not below 19km as G-forces WILL exceed 5g, due to entering Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at over 3.2 Km/s. Entering the atmosphere voids the heatshield warranty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/YmKno\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

No, the S-IVB stage cannot be tapered unless you go with a Mk1 Landercan. This is due to the MEM\u0027s landing legs protruding outside the 2.5m Interstage. If someone could design a lander in the 5.5t range (there is no current margin on this, 5.5t or less) or provide tips, I\u0027m willing to listen. Believe me, I\u0027ve tried, due to just how heavy 3.75m tanks are. As for the guts, I\u0027m planning on doing some further tweaks (including 4x2.5m engines for the first stage) and will get some pictures.
