The \u003Cem\u003EEndeavor \u003C/em\u003Eis the first manned mission planned for a trip to Duna and back to Kerbin. Piloted by Jeb, Bill, and Bob, \u003Cem\u003EEndeavor\u003C/em\u003E is planned to arrive at Duna in one to three years. So far, the \u003Cem\u003EEndeavor\u003C/em\u003E has reached phase one of the mission, and is awaiting the trajectory burn to Duna. From there, any adjustments will be made within a few hours of the encounter. Then, the \u003Cem\u003EEndeavor\u003C/em\u003E will burn into orbit, drop the landing vehicle, from where the landing craft will land, burn into orbit, and rendezvous with the \u003Cem\u003EEndeavor\u003C/em\u003E, and will begin phase two of the mission. \u003Cem\u003EEndeavor\u003C/em\u003E will ditch the landing vehicle, burn out of orbit, do a trajectory adjustment, and return to Kerbin from there on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeginning of Phase One:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/7yg1u\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
