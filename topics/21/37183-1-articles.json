Something new for the VAB... a SSTO! But this time fully VTOL. I\u0027ve been using a B9 version for some time, but I always wanted to try it in stock, and with more efficient engines. The result is cute, in an utilitarian short of way. And yes, those are a lot of intakes. Without further due, let me present you the Pike SSTO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Cxa6Uvj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Cxa6Uvj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cxa6Uvj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd looks aside, performance is quite amazing. It is a true airhogger, milk those engines without worries since the center one will flameout first, at about 1,700m/s and 30kms up or so. When you can\u0027t keep it lit anymore, you can continue on nukes alone to orbit for maximum efficiency, but if you need a bit more oomph to land on, say, Duna, the boost radial engines will take your T/W to something close to one on kerbin. Everything action-grouped as usual, so take a look at them before flying, and chutes to ensure a soft landing where there\u0027s some atmosphere to help... and that you land with the landing gear pointed the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDOWNLOAD:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/8s78zvq00kj8u2o/Pike.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/8s78zvq00kj8u2o/Pike.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/n65Z2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Much lighter, with about half the rocket fuel. His fancy anti-flameout system looks impressive, but you waste a good chunk of the turbojet\u0027s thrust (to be precise, 1-cos(the angle they are at)) while the single centered engine works just as well as a warning if it flames out first. I\u0027d say between that and the inefficient intakes he uses, I get the higher delta-v. His does use slightly less clipping, and his is easier to tow and such, being much lighter (half the nukes, half the fuel). But he has no emergency boost system, so T/W must be horrible; and I would be surprised it can land on, say, Duna, without issues, while mine should be able to take off from there. So in my case one size is meant to fit everything (minus Tylo and Eve, of course). As I said, there are differences, so go ahead and pick your favorite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe VTOL designation is a bit misleading.

Now that you say that, there is some nonsense in the wiki about VTVL being about rockets. Don\u0027t take me wrong, I am the first to make differences between rockets and planes, and why they shouldn\u0027t be confused. But using two different acronyms to say the same thing... it\u0027s definitely not how I learned the stuff, but I learned it in Spanish anyway. So, let\u0027s do one thing: call it whatever you want, and I\u0027ll do the same, since we both understand each other \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zombiphylax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zombiphylax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooks nice, I don\u0027t do intake spamming usually, but you blended it into the design well.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! There is some shimmering going on there that you could get rid off by reducing the number of intakes to something reasonable like 12, four per engine (3 on each strut pile, so they don\u0027t overlap, instead of... 6? 8? Some stupidly high number that was a bitch to select for the action groups). But then you would definitely need the boost engines lit to make the climb out of atmo, Delta-v would suffer greatly, and all that. The way I see it, since you have all the drag and weight, the problem is having poorly implemented intakes, really. What we would really need is to spend the weight in fancy precoolers, like skylon. If you translate the takeover speed to mach numbers \u003Cem\u003Eat sea level\u003C/em\u003E, 1,700m/s is mach 5, which is about skylon\u0027s takeover speed (regular jets start melting at about mach 3, which translates to ~1,000m/s \u003Cem\u003Eat sea level\u003C/em\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
