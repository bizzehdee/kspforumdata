The SpaceY version is about six tons lighter, which means more payload capacity and a more generous delta-V budget for soft-landing.\n\nNo pics, no clicks?

I really appreciate the feedback!\n\nIn testing the stock version can get to a 250 km orbit with the 8.25 ton payload, and have about 500 m/s in delta-V left for deorbiting and soft-landing. Under 500 m/s, you increase the risk of not being able to soft-land adequately.\n\nThe SpaceY version, as I mentioned, is about six tons lighter, so you can definitely carry about 14 tons to the 250 km orbit and still have at least 500 m/s left.\n\nAlso, there is every chance I was not using the most efficient launches possible. I was tweaking MechJeb\u0027s ascent curve and it might be too low. It\u0027s something I can look into anyhow.\n\nAnd, this is with stock aerodynamics as it stands in 0.90.0--obviously, with FAR, NEAR, or KSP 1.0\u002B, the delta-V will probably be higher due to better drag/lift calculations."}]}
