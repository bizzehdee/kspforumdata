The aircraft is not very stable so it requires the SAS to be on at all times. On take-off, with the SAS on, just hold down S to pull up and it should eventually lift off, even if it comes of the end of the runway. Then when approaching splashed down pod, turn off the engines and press space, the wings will detach and the parachutes will deploy. Then put the engines back on when descending in order to land horizontally.\n\nImportant info:\n\nThe craft is a concept really and it works to an extent.\n\nYou can develop the craft if you are good as I am not that good at developing craft ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nKEEP THE SAS ON AT ALL TIMES\n\nRead the instructions above if you have not already\n\nThanks, here are some images\n\nThe images may not work! I am new to this, if not then I will attempt to fix them\n\nShe takes a bit of encouragement to get off the ground!\n\n\u003E ![tbV0W1](http://flickr.com/gp/79034796@N05/tbV0W1)\n\nAnd we are off!
