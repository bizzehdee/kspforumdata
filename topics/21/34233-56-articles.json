All craft function with teh stock game, no mods, no edited ISPs, no edited thrust of engines, ect. All craft are either SSTOs or have a launch vehicle, and are simple enough to get into orbit, that you can easily place bob in the pilot seat (ofc bob will inevitable get you killed as a pilot, but it has nothing to do with rocket design). Most of them use 40-50 impact tolerance parts, so the armor is above average against weakish torpedoes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI technically have all this done, but for now i need to update my fleet to 0.90 specifications, and need to do some part cutting (with new features of the editor, i dont need to spam cubic struts anymore).

I am the CEO of Icepack Spacure Industries or I.S.I. and this will be my first craft submission, but most certainly not my last! We at ISI have been developing crafts since a few months before the questionable Spirtwolf/ Hanland confrontation over Laythe. This confrontation was perhaps what caused the biggest, and most decisive change in company policy. ISI was originally a small and neutral company, dedicated to exploration and scientific discovery. In order to advance the scale of this goal ISI put a staging satellite on the far moon of bop, far away from any of the major corporations. Due to this distance this a very desirable site for ISI to be able to continue it\u0027s activitie\u002Bs mostly undisturbed. Although Hanland had other ideas apparently, and during the build-up before the Laythe confrontation, quitely took the station, it\u0027s resources no doubt one of the reasons Hanland was able to massive such a large fleet. While they had planned to make the space\u0027s destruction an accident they were unaware of the hidden security cameras, with a live stream straight to ISI. In other words the crews murder was broadcast straight to the KSC.

Next simply fly until your ap is at the 80k mark, watch your engines at this point as they shouldn\u0027t overheat but hey, you never know. Switch to full throttle once the external engines are gone and you can shred the shell whenever after that. The only reason I\u0027m including this tutorial is that I don\u0027t know how the launch stage will work using any other launching method, it shouldn\u0027t have any issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProof of flight: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/znQ8A\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/znQ8A\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KarmaLarma","CreatedById":123312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T03:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all- welcome back Macey!

We specialize in advanced low part count ships, tanks, bases, and a variety of other craft, most of them military focused. After an unprovoked attack on a recon vessel sent into the jool system, AKS did some research and discovered the 2 main factions that were operating in the solar system, and based on their reputation, concluded the Hanland was the most likely cuplrit. While no hard evidence was found, AKS found Spiritwolf\u0027s ideals far better then the somewhat nefarious Hanland, and decided to ally themselves with SW. Although a waring race equipped with massive fleets, AKS does not go out of their way to start fights, and for now our policy if defensive in nature, especially in the kerbol system as they do not yet have the resources to field a full fleet and are limited to a handful of warships that were brought from their own galaxy. Also, while we are in allegiance with SpiritWorf as a corporation, many of our vessels have, despite attempts to stop it, ended up on the black market available to anyone who has the money to buy them (all craft labeled with [AKS] are only available for AKS to utilize, craft labeled with [Export] are sold only to allies of AKS, and any unmarked craft are black marker availeable for anyone including Hanland to utilize as they please).*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllegiance- Spiritwolf (although this particular vessel can be used by any other faction since its available on black market)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart count- 400\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file- \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/ll75fnw0cwl77p7/BC-304\u002B%27Korolev%27.craft#39;Korolev.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/ll75fnw0cwl77p7/BC-304\u002B%27Korolev%27.craft#39;Korolev\u0027.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperation Manual\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-1 toggles primary engines (skippers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 2 toggles secondary boosters (LVTs), these are mostly used when max thrust is needed, but they have very small fuel tanks that need to be manually refilled when empty from the main tanks. ISP is the same as the main engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- stage 1st engages engines, then decouples the weapons bay cover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, now for some details about the craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a full detailed IVA (not one of those simple cockpit IVAs, i mean an actual IVA thats modeled inside teh ship for kerbals to move around in). It has a bridge, comm center, living quarters, weapons station, engine room, 2 fighter hangars, all accessible to kerbals from any part of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow because of the fact its both very large (compared to my usual craft), and also has that detailed internal, it is exactly 400 parts. This is over the 300 limit, but i didnt exactly design this to take part in massive battles, more like a command vessel or something behind the scenes where you can film the kerbals doing well whatever kerbals in charge of a battle group do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be armed with 8 1.25m guided weapons right out of the box, and has room for 4 smaller fighters (something like macey\u0027s mosquito class or similar). The small docking ports intended for the mosquitos can be replaced with 1.25m ones if you want either more missiles, or docking larger craft (the bays arent carrier sized but they arent exactly small either). Does not ship with any missiles due to the already highish part count (if you want missiles to ship with it please just ask me to upload an armed variant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines are honestly an afterthought, and the thing has TERRIBLE range (it was never designed to actual combat), but it can and will fly on engines, and its actually quite stable and pleasant to fly (not too wobbly, sas works, plenty of attitude control). The engines are 2 skippers and 4 LVT-45s powered by 4 FLT-400s and 2 X-200-32s, its not much but again, i wanted the ship to be moveable on its own and engines werent much part count to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, this thing is designed purely for cinematic purposes, but i suppose you can technically do combat in it (it has pure wing armor on a girder frame. Its very tough to cut in half or do massive damage to it, but even single small ibeams will do some damage every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the provided version is either gravity hacked or Hedited into orbit. AKS has a base on dres right now (and plans to have most of its operations conducted from there), so i just assume it was produced there and launched not from kerbin. I am working on a launcher for it, but i have a few other ships i need to get done 1st, so if you are interested in a 100% legit launched version then just reply here or send me a PM, i can do it but only if you actually request this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T22:13:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hawks Of Hazard","CreatedById":140333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T22:49:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do realize that Macy has come back, and I will post some ships in the hope that they go to macy or hanland but I was hoping to get some ship submissions for MY new Kerbals At War series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you could please do that it would be wonderful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: email is \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#775240351807031e1819524033\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u00226e060f19051d0108060f140f1c0a2e09030f0702400d0103\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3d6c4b19c83879a9c9dd6c4b7\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u0022ff9d939e9c94979e88949b908891cbc7bf98929e9693d19c9092\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
