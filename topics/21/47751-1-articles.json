Since then it has undergone countless tweaks and flown to orbit dozens of times. During the process of converting the hypersonic test vehicle into an SSTO, some major design constraints became apparent. For example, the Sanzuwu was conceived from the outset to have a low wing to shield the delicate engine structures from re-entry heating, but this led to instability at high alpha. Only after rearranging the fuselage and adjusting the wing shape was this problem minimised. The engine pods themselves also required a great deal of attention in order to ensure the fuel flow worked correctly, and having them so far forward led to more stability issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter doggedly refusing to give up, I can now say with great confidence that the Sanzuwu is one of the most flyable SSTOs out there.

The wing was placed before placing the landing gear (because as we know, gear is massless and does not induce drag outside of the SPH) so that the direction of lift passes through the CoM ball but slightly infront.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI allowed both aircraft to get airborne before trying any manoeuvres. There was a difference of about 20m/s between taking flight as the gear is placed slightly differently. I waited until they were both doing 130m/s in level flight and then kept my finger on the S key to perform a hard pitch up without fine controls on. The high wing initially pitched up fast but then the rate of turn slowed as the direction of travel lagged behind where the nose was pointed. At no point did it flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried exactly the same thing in the low wing.

With the addition of this T-tail, the low wing test aircraft became controllable and was able to pull much tighter turns than the high wing (with or without the tail). Note also that the engines had to be moved to bring to CoM further back as I didn\u0027t want to have to move the wing section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uQ2EuOO.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uQ2EuOOl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uQ2EuOOl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HZHLhbT.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HZHLhbTl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HZHLhbTl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I tried a low stabiliser placed on a length of massless cubic struts. I also removed the front elevators that can be seen embedded in the wing in the first two pictures in order to bring the direction of lift further back so that I could compare it to the previous T-Tail version without moving the main wing.

Originally I thought that having a pair of elevators on the leading edge of the wing as well as the trailing edge would act the same as having trailing edge elevators and a separate pair of stabilisers, but they obviously don\u0027t. This then is what\u0027s causing some instability at high rates of turn in the fully fuelled Sanzuwu.

Behold, the LowHigh:\u003Cp\u003EThe only difference between these two craft is that the body was rotated exactly 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. The wing was placed before placing the landing gear (because as we know, gear is massless and does not induce drag outside of the SPH) so that the direction of lift passes through the CoM ball but slightly infront.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI allowed both aircraft to get airborne before trying any manoeuvres. There was a difference of about 20m/s between taking flight as the gear is placed slightly differently. I waited until they were both doing 130m/s in level flight and then kept my finger on the S key to perform a hard pitch up without fine controls on. The high wing initially pitched up fast but then the rate of turn slowed as the direction of travel lagged behind where the nose was pointed. At no point did it flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried exactly the same thing in the low wing. After getting past about 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 it flipped over uncontrollably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem is clearly caused by not having a separate stabiliser. With the addition of this T-tail, the low wing test aircraft became controllable and was able to pull much tighter turns than the high wing (with or without the tail). Note also that the engines had to be moved to bring to CoM further back as I didn\u0027t want to have to move the wing section. I also removed the front elevators that can be seen embedded in the wing in the first two pictures in order to bring the direction of lift further back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I tried a low stabiliser placed on a length of massless cubic struts. The aircraft performed well, and although it didn\u0027t turn as fast as the low wing with high T-tail, it did not flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, I was correct that low wings are inherently unstable, but clearly this is only true when they don\u0027t have a separate stabiliser. Originally I thought that having a pair of elevators on the leading edge of the wing as well as the trailing edge would act the same as having trailing edge elevators and a separate pair of stabilisers, but they obviously don\u0027t. This then is what\u0027s causing some instability at high rates of turn in the fully fuelled Sanzuwu. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s much of a problem though as long as you don\u0027t pull any fast turns after taking off \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou just did quite the aerodynamic study there, good for you! Scientific method FTW. I learned all this in university, so I\u0027m glad KSP weird physics get to the same place. Pa\u0027s opinion is probably based on his huge SSTO\u0027s flexing to become dihedral wings, and all of them having a big stabilizing tail. Not a coincidence the tail contains what are called horizontal and vertical \u003Cem\u003Estabilizers\u003C/em\u003E in RL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and it\u0027s interesting that you got more maneuverability by keeping the unstable wing and stabilizing it with a tail: now you also know first hand why jet fighters nowadays have inherently unstable configurations, kept in check with modern computers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Not counting control surfaces, KSP\u0027s aerodynamic model gets way more hate than it should.

I did this because I needed to have the tail on a separate section so it could be rotated independently of the main body, and that required it to be further back. I guess the conclusion is generally correct though.
