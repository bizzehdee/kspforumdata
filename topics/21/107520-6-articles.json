Every pound saved on the external tank was an extra pound the shuttle could bring to orbit, so it was one of the places NASA did the most weight reductions on.\n\nWish I was old enough to remember the first launches =)"},{"CreatedByName":"MikeFox1","CreatedById":112011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T15:17:54Z","Content":"Falcon 1\n\nFalcon 1 was the first SpaceX launch vehicle to reach orbit.
