I built it with FAR installed (I\u0027m assuming it would work with stock aerodynamics as well) with all stock parts, no mods needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe handling is kind of wonky at low altitudes and speeds (if anyone can recommend a fix for this it would be appreciated) but it is stable at hypersonic speeds around 20,000m. Jet engine flameout around 25,000m, top speed around 1500m/s. Has enough fuel to circumnavigate Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the engine nacelles are empty fuel tanks, when they\u0027re full it moves the CoM too far back and you can\u0027t get in the air without flipping. I was too lazy to swap them out for the structural fuselage or something similar and just drained the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOWNLOAD (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78894495/SR71.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDropbox\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78894495/screenshot4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78894495/screenshot5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78894495/screenshot3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T02:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first step in improving the handling would be to sharply reduce the size of the chines.
