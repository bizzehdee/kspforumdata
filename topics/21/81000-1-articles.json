I ran out of power before the end, but the periapsis was 68,000m, which was easily corrected on the second orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManeuvering in orbits is pretty easy though. I docked it with an X-3 (another SSTO) in 100,000m orbit (the X-3 had to do the RCS, though) intending to rendezvous a tug with both of them and pull them to a refueling station. It was too buggy for that, so I deorbited the tug, separated the X-3 and Sunfish, and brought both of them to the station under their own power (the tug idea was really just for fun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-G\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHum, didn\u0027t knew that. Now how the hell did \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E learn it? Good thing I also described the whole thing. Anyhow, the little guy I showed on the last page can push an apo of \u0026gt;140km just on the jets (doing about 2,400m/s at ~50kms) so yeah, judging by your ascent description, you are suffering form either a fat ass, a lack of intakes, or both. And it probably isn\u0027t the fat ass, because I burn less than 100 liquid fuel units out of the 360 that carries, meaning I lug quite the excess mass into orbit. The quantity of xenon burnt is kinda irrelevant, so multiple trip capability. I\u0027m putting together some pics for a \u0022Forgotten SSTO pack\u0022 I\u0027m getting together, so here goes one that shows a lot of juicy information from just before the jet gave out (4:1 ram intake/jet ratio, my standard)... and another, because I like it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/SQzFDyS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SQzFDyS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SQzFDyS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/sNPLOOD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sNPLOOD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sNPLOOD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

However, I noticed that the chassis I built had really interesting aerodynamic properties. It can glide essentially indefinitely, kinda hover in the air, turn very quickly, and is very stable. It\u0027s not very unique-looking, but it flies the best out of anything I\u0027ve ever made. So, I swapped out the RCS tanks for a jet tank and immediately produced the following SSTO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i739.photobucket.com/albums/xx36/geometrian/Image1_zps894981ab.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Image1_zps894981ab.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent is fairly standard, except because it is so light the jet can do almost all the work.

The Cicada\u0027s got a respectable 7.5km/s dV@LKO with full RCS tanks. I haven\u0027t really looked at an extended range variant, there\u0027s definitely the hardpoints to mount a couple of fuel drop pods to get range out to about 20km/s dV@LKO.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a very stripped back design for experienced pilots only. Very high wing loading for those who can efficiently and precisely cross-range back to base with an accurate swoop and landing flare. Its extremely limited RCS translation range means you need to be comfortable docking without RCS . It\u0027s best to take off from Kerbin in the afternoon or evening but, the RCS thrusters will put you into orbit without the aid of sunlight, which is more efficient for long distance travel anyway. You can effect landings on the smallest of bodies within the Kerbol system but, it\u0027s not designed with planetary landing in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/IGiaS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/IGiaS\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103197430/KSP/Cicada_1-0.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECicada v1.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotally reverse engineering this!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mesklin","CreatedById":73898,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T07:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIon SSTO \u0022Mun Flea\u0022 with Mun landing possibilities, 5.2 t start mass, ion dV ~4500 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/bHe1m\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
