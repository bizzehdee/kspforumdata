Trying to support from the centre section each outer section is secured by a single radial arm, if you were to support the outer section the inner would be secured by all 16 radial arms. A massive difference in strength and rigidity. If most of the mass is at the centre can you redistribute some of it to the outer sections?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere are the launch engines to go? Engines on the outer ring have the advantage mentioned above and should be capable of straight lifting you out of the worst of the atmosphere, say 36km. There is also space for a lot of them, thankfully all perfectly balanced, another reason to move as much mass as possible to the outer ring.

I\u0027m not even entirely sure how I\u0027d go about rebuilding it into a compression structure (as would be required by mounting the engines on the ring).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might give it a try, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T17:34:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chaosratt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Chaosratt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHonestly I would look into Orbital Construction mod.
