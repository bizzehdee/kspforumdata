I have the thin 2-1m adapter leading to 4 docking ports which are docked. Then the other 4 ports are attached to another 2-1m adapter which leads to another on. After that cube octags lead to the engine. All of those are able to crossfeed but the engines get no fuel. Please help. Also all 4 ports are docked. If you want to take a closer look at it you need.

A quirk most of the adapters and splitters share\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would save a pile of parts if you installed the engines directly to the orange tank, but baring that, have the engines mounted to the smallest of the silver 2.5m tanks with the same docking port configuration to connect to the main ship should solve it.

You need to run 4 fuel lines from your orange tank to the base of the 4 nuclear engines. But I\u0027m guessing that the engines are docked with the tank later on... which means that your current configuration will not work... that said... if you run fuel lines from the docking ports to the engines, and fuel lines from the tank to the docking ports, you should be able to bypass the fuel crossfeed bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just tested it and verified that you just need to run fuel lines from your orange tank to your docking ports (on the fuel section) and then run fuel lines from your docking ports (on the engine section) to the engines themselves and it will work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-22T09:04:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2013 09:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Scoundrel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T08:45:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScoundrel I assume you skipped over the fact that you can\u0027t add fuel lines in EVA?

As his engine section is non-functional, his only recourse is to relaunch those two parts and re-dock them, hence the posted suggestion of how to implement the solution to his engine problem. You are, of course, correct in that attaching the engines directly to the tank would have been the best solution, and my preferred one, but it wouldn\u0027t have solved bigpapabearxx\u0027s question, which was how to get his tank and engine section functioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if I am incorrect in my assumption, then I apologize to everyone, and respectfully bow out of the conversation.
