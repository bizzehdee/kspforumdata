This craft would be perfect for the attachment of a parasite rocket (something I\u0027m experimenting with myself as we speak) as well as for just general high-performance fun. I\u0027m really surprised an aircraft with this big a wing was such an unexpected success as a high-speed, edge-of-the-earth transsonic plane. If you\u0027re really patient and skilled, you might be able to fly her as high as 25000 meters without stalling her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to modify and play with this craft as much as you please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownload Link:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/rzbz35xry0uemd7/Buffalo-HA.rar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rzbz35xry0uemd7/Buffalo-HA.rar\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImgur gallery:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/s524F#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/s524F#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nephf","CreatedById":66354,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T14:55:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E80 kilometers? that\u0027s quite a lot!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chunkblaster","CreatedById":44268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T22:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThrow a couple of small rocket fuel tanks and a nuke engine or 2 on and you got yourself a lovely SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetman123","CreatedById":27597,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T23:32:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chunkblaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chunkblaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThrow a couple of small rocket fuel tanks and a nuke engine or 2 on and you got yourself a lovely SSTO.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust what I\u0027m experimenting with now!
