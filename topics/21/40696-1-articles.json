I crewed the station with six kerbals, but had no way to return them in event of a crisis- such as what happened when I retracted all the solar arrays for my docking manuvers (As I usually do) And. Er. Forgot to redeploy them, meaning the station (Which had minimal battery capacity) was unpowered, unmanuverable, and running out of air. (I use IonCross\u0027 GREAT mod.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I needed a way to evacuate all six Kerbals, attach a battery module, and return all six Kerbals. The result of pulling out my hair was this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing KW, NovaPunch, TT\u0027s wheels, and Ioncross...

Has a delta V between 1200 and 1800 depending on where you are in atmosphere, two RTG\u0027s to provide power, two RCS tanks (one on either side) and space for six Kerbals. At the center there are two of the IonCross 1m Ox canisters as a spacer. I admit I used the \u0027allow clipping\u0027 to get the two command pods to align like that but everything else is honest. The ladders facing \u0022up\u0022 perfectly slip into a 2m ring of horizontal stationary ladders- meaning the crew never have to use their EVA thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T19:57:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 07:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tassyr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDropbox sucks.
