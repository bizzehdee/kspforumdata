Its habitation modules are arranged as collumns of three under tri-couplers arranged in a triangle around the engineering section. The fuel tanks and their adaptors have been converted into wet workshop habitation areas. Power is provided by a nuclear reactor built from a NERVA engine, which is mounted underneath the engineering section. Emergency power is provided by three converted communications satellites. The engineering section is comprised of three \u003Cem\u003ESCIENCE\u003C/em\u003E modules. There is a crew of three, though the station is fully automated. The command pod can be jettisoned to reveal a docking port for rescue vessels in case of extreme failure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eran100","CreatedById":17678,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-03T15:46:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0_0\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-12T19:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELand it on the Mun and claim your rightful place as the next Gabyalufix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-12T21:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Elven_sword\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Elven_sword\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand it on the Mun and claim your rightful place as the next Gabyalufix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may need more efficient engines for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
