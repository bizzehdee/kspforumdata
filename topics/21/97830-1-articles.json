They are ideal as trainer SSTO\u0027s, due to exceptional handling and large margin for error. Experts will also enjoy their sport-like designs and maneuverability, while also taking advantage of decent range and abilities of these craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Idon Series is composed of 3 models: Model A, Model B and the Model C. Each Model also has two subcategories, being Citizen and Utility. However, the Model C has three subcategories, the third one being Crew Bus. So far, the Model A is the only model in production. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have been warned: These crafts contain very heavy part clipping and are made for fun and enjoyment, not realism. In saying that, you could ration that these are highly advanced spaceplanes built on metallic hydrogen rocket engines and triple-mode jet, ramjet and scramjet air-breathing engines. Anyways, have fun! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIdon Model A \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Model A is the cheapest and smallest of the Idon Series, featuring an agile and sleek exterior.

It flies with ease, and is capable of flying into a 150x150 orbit and back to the space center with fuel to spare. Flight profile is easy: Just use the turbojet to reach near orbital speeds (1800-2000m/s), then switch over to the rocket drive to circularize and maneuver in space!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: $33,658\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction Groups: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] Turbojet \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[2] Rocket Mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/vovGf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
