This plane will last for ages on the VTOL fuel if you wish to just cruise around and hover, and once the VTOL engines eject you have plenty of fuel and speed to get into a low orbit if you wish.\n\nBoth version of the plane are highly controlable and it has 2 sets of landing gear, one for VTOL and the other for the jet.\n\nA cool feature that I found was cool about this design is that it will flare before landing so you can have one hell of a smooth landing 8)\n\n**(Note: Make sure you have SAS engaged for the first few second on take-off)**\n\nHere are the Pics:\n\n\u003E ![7256833186_9c677d301f_b.jpg](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7078/7256833186_9c677d301f_b.jpg)\n\u003E ![7256834430_0c04669a62_b.jpg](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7099/7256834430_0c04669a62_b.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![7256832260_076d78d946_b.jpg](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7235/7256832260_076d78d946_b.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![7256835224_9499b61ac1_b.jpg](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7074/7256835224_9499b61ac1_b.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![7256836300_ecc52e4086_b.jpg](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7241/7256836300_ecc52e4086_b.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![7256830940_017a41dae8_b.jpg](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8014/7256830940_017a41dae8_b.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"TerranCmdr","CreatedById":23552,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T18:47:37Z","Content":"Nice design!\n\nI hope you know the intakes don\\\u0027t do anything. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T18:50:53Z","Content":"They will eventually, and woe betide any aircraft maker who fails to add ducts to their favourite planes ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThe 2 small cockpits look like they have slots for air to go in though, I wish I knew if they will be classed as intakes or not."},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T19:01:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The 2 small cockpits look like they have slots for air to go in though, I wish I knew if they will be classed as intakes or not.\n\nIf not, you could still add an intake part module to them, I think engines will have a limited intake function too."},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T19:02:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The 2 small cockpits\n\nDo you mean \\\u0027engine nascelles\\\u0027?
