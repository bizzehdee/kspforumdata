The central section can be ejected off the main body of the craft and has the majority of the batterys, a science lab, all the science stuff needed and 8 crew. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth main ships come with either nuclear power or main rocket power depending on whether it needs to be quick or if I need to conserve fuel to give options for speed etc (although I like to think of it as impulse power and warp speed ^^)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole thing can be viewed at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/OEU5BThnHsc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/OEU5BThnHsc\u003C/a\u003E where I give a full demonstration of fuel efficiency of all parts and talk about it more in depth, giving a full talk on life of engines, show how long each part will take at full nuclear acceleration to reach duna and give a good look at it in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for checking it out, let me know what you think, its a work in progress and this is the mk2, my next will maybe have a bit more fuel, some changed to the pods to allow the kerbals to sit on or get in them and flip the probe parts around so that they work properly (currently you need to accelerate backwards due to them being fitting the wrong way around) and im sure I will think of some other stuff to change, its a pain to get into orbit of kerbin atm with 100% fuel in the main ship so whatever changes I make for the mk3 will probably be final. Any tips are very welcome!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main showcase of the stuff starts around the 10 minute mark, until then its talking about the ship and showing some of the stuff on it but if you want to skip straight to the showing of the main tests etc, skip to 10 mins \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/OEU5BThnHsc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrew123","CreatedById":46719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T01:17:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImpressive, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of ONI\u0027s black projects.
