Only mod used is mechjeb and is pretty much required for something this size for my computer to perform the ascent for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to some botched math I had believed that the large tanks were better than using the smaller tanks so it\u0027s a bit of an odd design, but it\u0027s worked for what I\u0027ve tried so far. It will leave some spacejunk in orbit around the star/kerbol, but most of the early stages are gone before an orbit is establish around kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo pilot I manually stage so that I can power up the outer turbojet engines before releasing the stabilizers and starting the rocket engines. Mechjeb\u0027s auto throttling works fine for this, the engines go a little past 50% overheated but haven\u0027t ever overheated for me. The rocket starts so high off the ground via stabilizers because it would collide with the launch tower if near the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t the best of designs but I\u0027ve been able to reach a low duna orbit with ~2.5 rockomax x200-32 (big ones) left of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kjUYe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kjUYe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xJSXO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xJSXO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YjWdm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YjWdm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH]33486[/ATTACH] \u0026lt;- This one, not sure how to get rid of other one that is 191.9KB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably a bit much, but I prefer overdoing it to underdoing it.
