The second stage features 2 Orbital rockets which can be used to do orbit movements and transfers as well as a re-entry to kerbin. The third stage consists of 3 fuel tanks and a Turbo Jet Engin which is capable of traveling long distances, also as a bonus a fuel line between the 2nd and 3rd stage allows you to add extra fuel to your 2nd stage orbit rockets incase you run out or wish to reach higher orbits. My shuttle also has RCS thrusters and a Grabber feature at the front of the shuttle to allow rescue missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis Space shuttle is best flown with Mechjeb linked here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=14066.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=14066.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb is not required although it makes flying extremely more simple and is more useful during flying in the 3rd stage with Kill Rotate, but the plane aspect of KerbinHope is extremely stable even without Mechjeb/ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S: On landing make sure you dont pull up too much and keep the throttle at around 20-30% otherwise you may hit the engin off the runway.

So unfortunatly No this is not the most practical design and i dont spend ages with mathmatical equations to make it work perfectly, and anyhow. If the rocket isnt efficient that makes it as Kerbal as possible in the thought of. If we cant lift the payload due to its weight.
