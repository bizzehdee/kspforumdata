So. The Odyssey was born. The craft went up completely empty of fuel except for the Lander mated to the tail of the ship. The Lander is designed to detatch from the tail, maneuver up to the R2 Science Pods, land, and return to the mothership. The R2 will be re-docked with the node and the lander will return to the tail. The Cruiser then can break for the next planetary object. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain engines are 12 Nuke engines and there are 11 full fuel pods.
