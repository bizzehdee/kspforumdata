I\u0027ll post the planes I made here, so others might be able to access it. I will try to finish a plane per week, as the title suggests. Feel free to request anything you need in the replies.\n\n* * *\n\nCurrently, I am not working on a project, so If you request something, I can get to that.\n\n* * *\n\n**Week 1:**\n\n*Requested by:*\n\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/39703-Veeltch\n\n[Veeltch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/39703-Veeltch)\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/39703-Veeltch\n\n*Requiements:*\n\n-SSTO\n\n-Can carry the crew of 4 kerbals to Laythe\n\n-Use turbojets. No RAPIERS.\n\n-Sleek\u0026Stylish\n\n*Extras:*\n\n-Lighting\n\n-Docking-capable (\u002BRCS)\n\n-Proper maneuverability\n\n*Description:*\n\nBecause firstly, only turbojet-nerva combination was allowed, I had quite a few attempts to build a such craft. After the requiements were optimalized, the 8th setup did make it to Laythe, but quite hardly. So if you don\u0027t manage to have a perfectly efficient orbiting, a perfect launch window, perfect aerobraking, you might not get to the destination, or even to the planet. Feel free to use the docking ability to refuel the craft, or remove it to improve the performance. Altough I consider it finished, I\u0027ll be still adjusting it, and it might get updated. WARNING! The vehicle is NOT compatible with the current version, due to the \u0022engine stowed\u0022 bug. I tried the fix, but id doesn\u0027t seem to work. So if this hasn\u0027t been fixed, remove the cargo bay from the back. Beware that the ladder is nonnected to that, so that might get removed too. I am making a video of a flight, including further details.\n\n*Action groups:*\n\n1.: Jet mode (toggle jet engines and the intakes. To avoid closing the intakes before flight, activate the turbojets through the staging)\n\n2.:Main rockets (the conventional ones)\n\n3.:Nuclear engine\n\n4.:Docking mode (docking port and assistance lights)\n\n5.:Solar panels\n\n6.:Ladder (at the very back)\n\n*Image(video soon):*\n\n![YUIw125.png](http://i.imgur.com/YUIw125.png)\n\n*Download:*\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xhc8cyeq5bn2s63/Weekly%204manLaythe%20Type%20%27I%27.craft?dl=0\n\n[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xhc8cyeq5bn2s63/Weekly%204manLaythe%20Type%20%27I%27.craft?dl=0)\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xhc8cyeq5bn2s63/Weekly%204manLaythe%20Type%20%27I%27.craft?dl=0\n\n* * *\n\n**Week 2:**\n\n*Requested by:*\n\n[nothingSpecial](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/121894-nothingSpecial)\n\n*Requiements:*\n\n-Space shuttle\n\n-Return-oriented\n\n-Mk.3\n\n-Very very small and stout\n\n-STS-like alignment\n\n-Orbital rendzevous\n\n-Docking\n\n-Cargo bay can be easily replaced with fuel tanks\n\n-Template:\n\n![pIlPv67.png](http://i.imgur.com/pIlPv67.png)\n\n*Extras:*\n\n-Lighting\n\n-Good maneuverability\n\n-Expensive vernors only on the shuttle; cheap 1-way RCS on the fuel tank (which cannot be recovered)\n\n-Removing the boosters won\u0027t break the balance (if you need less performance, for example for a light cargo, or no cargo)\n\n-Great stability, comparing to the alingnment\n\n-Airbrakes\n\n*Description:*\n\nBecause I wanted to have minimal size, but witouth an open cargo bay at the back, I had to add a fuel tank between the engine and the cargo bay. The normal fuel tanks were too large, so instead I used an RCS-tank, wich is shorter. As a result, orbital maneuvering is done with clusters of Puff engines. Because the Rhino engine at the back is unexpectedly heavy, in order to have a proper CoM-CoL alignment, my wings had to be placed further back. Because of the heavily angled wings, the stability is so high that the plane couldn\u0027t turn. I managed to counter this with BRUTE FORCE, by adding large control surfaces. This was a tricky part, and I tried EVERY possible alignment of the control surfaces. The best was BIG-S elevons at the ends, medium elevons at the middle, with both pitch and roll enabled, and nothing at the joint. Altough this provides great controll power, at low speeds the shuttle still can\u0027t fly. The solution is a very very steep descend path. This works until landing, where the large speed won\u0027t let us to land safely. To counter this, an array of airbrakes is clipped into the wings. Use them to slow down after you pull up the nose from the descend. RCS might be necessary right after leaving the pad, and when the large tank is low on fuel.\n\n*Action groups:*\n\n1.:Main engine\n\n2.:Docking mode\n\n3.:Cargo bay\n\n4.:Relase cargo\n\n5.:Solar panels\n\n6.:Ladder\n\nImages:\n\n![jX67EQZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jX67EQZ.jpg)\n\nCan carry about 6 tons of cargo (That\u0027s what you can put in there). Depending on your gravity turn, you can have 600 DV left after reaching LKO.\n\n![2g4xdam.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2g4xdam.jpg)\n\n![9TfGzlV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9TfGzlV.jpg)\n\n*Download:*\n\n[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhi8pfs21w0uosv/Weekly%20DwarfShuttle%20Type%20%27A%27.craft?dl=0)\n\n* * *\n\nAwaiting further requests.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T07:35:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 07:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T13:46:06Z","Content":"4-man, Turbojet\u002BLV-N SSTO.

Also, thank you for your compliments. One more thing: When building STS-like shuttles, I always find it VERY useful if I have enough fuel in the shuttle for most of the orbiting. The real STS just did a final circulization with the shuttle only, but I found out that having a larger fuel tank in the shuttle, for orbiting, improves the performance A LOT. Would you like somethink like that? or no. Also, would you like to have the rocket with it? Or just the pure shuttle.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-29T18:53:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2015 06:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin**"},{"CreatedByName":"nothingSpecial","CreatedById":118683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T21:42:28Z","Content":"Well, if it can be still small chubby funny shuttle - sure, why not!\n\nConsidering rocket...
