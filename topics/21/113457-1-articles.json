View full album](//imgur.com/a/MNkjV)\n\nI am currently working on a twin seater Eve mission to recover my stranded Jeb (marooned on Eve testing the single seater prototype) I am quite proud of I would like to share. \n\nIt is a work in progress cause due to time issues I could just run the basic Kerbin LKO tests until now and I did not bring it to Eve yet. Still, compared to my previous experiences I feel it is working so well I need some outer criticism to fix the issues I could miss. That\u0027s why a WIP. \n\nI feel it is not flawless: the concept is ladderless and legless so it has got some critical components that still may fail during the mission due to the extreme design and there are still several tweaks that might be implemented to improve the overall fuel efficiency.\n\nTake off is safe above 500m of altitude, you must keep an eye on the landing site you choose. \n\nCareful with slopes when you land, your landing base is quite wide but pretty fragile overall, be gentle.\n\nThe staging of the return RCS module must be manually operated. Keep the fairing, you will need it for the aerobrake at Eve. RCS tanks need to be opened up to operate the ship. \n\nSave the 2.5m tank for the final approach, you\u0027ll need it for the aforementioned \u0022gentle\u0022 landing.\n\nPressing B toggles (and does not lock) aerobrakes. \n\nYou **must** have RCS on at take off, it is fundamental to keep control (there is just one reaction wheel).\n\nThe craft is completely stock. \n\nBelow a few pics showing the current test flight and the download link.\n\n[*\u0022Delta Dart\u0022*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j1hubbijgc6z4nd/Delta%20Dart%20Eve%20rescue%20mission%20%28production%29.craft?dl=0)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Thank you and enjoy (yeah, well, fly safe...), I had really a lot of fun while designing it.\n\nEve pics coming soon (I hope...).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T08:54:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 08:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Signo**"}]}
