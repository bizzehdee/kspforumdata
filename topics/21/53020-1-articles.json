And after about 5 versions that jsut didn\u0027t make me happy. But what finally came out is not jsut good looking, but a treat to fly. Theres no combustion so she can fly on any planet with an atmosphere. She can\u0027t be put into a spin, and she can do a 180 in about 30ft. But best of all, being solar powered it has an unlimited flight range.

Finally, with all that battery storage, she can transmit almost endlessly, even while in the air. I did leave out the flight computer and the science bay, but mostly because they would have made the plane ugly. But you can strap the cone computer on her fairly easily if you really want to. I did it with radial decouplers and tiny fuel tanks, so I could drop them, or have them look like missiles. Just not be ugly.
