This is how the first test flight went, due to my utter ineptitude at flying and landing a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust going out for a test flight of the Arion Mk 2 with my friend Genesby Kerman! The Arion is supposed to be an SSTO. However, I only got to 14,000m before I ran out of fuel on the rocket engines. Well, now it\u0027s going to be an SSTC (Single Stage To Continent). Ok, running low on jet fuel as I finally spot a coast in the distance. Land ho! We won\u0027t run out of fuel over the ocean. Now be careful with the landing, Genesby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qTE1d2j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qTE1d2j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe gentle.
