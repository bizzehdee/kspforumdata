(As long as it doesn\u0027t have that Horus in it\u0027s mouth.) I got inspired to make a space warship when I waas rewatching Kethane Station, it weighs 69.3 tons and has 256 parts, it has two mini-LFOX missiles stacked on either side, two recycled posterus missiles on the \u0022eyes\u0022 and a big 1.25m Horus missile in it\u0027s \u0022mouth\u0022 at first, with the Horus is will creep enemies out, when it\u0027s gone it will distract them with it\u0027s cuteness! (Since the shielded docking port has no attatchment nodes, the Horus is attatched onto a cubic strut at first, so decouple node on the first Horus, after reloading it should be fine.) It has four Ion engines and three Nerva engines, allowing it interplanetary A.K.A slow travel, and propulsion and DV when orbiting a plaanet wth the Nerva\u0027s. Thanks for looking, here she is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/x4kqN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
