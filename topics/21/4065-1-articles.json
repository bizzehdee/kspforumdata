I used the LEM-5 lander legs by CaptainSlug. Aside of that, stock only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt handles fairly well, just a little oscillation after tossing the first booster stage, but that recovers soon after the second booster stage gets jettisoned. Orbit is achieved by the primary lifting orbital stage, TMI and munar-insertion burn is handled by the intermediate stage and the lander stage should suffice to land the rocket and get back into munar orbit. The length of the rocket makes it highly advisable to enable SAS and RCS during landing to let the ASAS handle the balancing of the lander. The RCS return stage has enough oumph to get the rocket back to Kerbin and get a nice and soft splashdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiggest drawback is the overall length which leads to fairly bad pitch/yaw handling, orbital maneuvers sometimes need RCS assistance to be successful, and which can cause heavy oscillation and even structural failure if hard pitch/yaw maneuvers are attempted. Once in munar orbit, handling improves considerably and the lander has a very good response rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry it and come back with some feedback, looking forward to it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tosh","CreatedById":11055,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-22T01:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\\\u0027Stock leg\\\u0027 can be built with two or three radial decouplers and a winglet.
