First time posting here, haven\u0027t done so on a forum in about forever, but I have been reading around here for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntroductions over with, let\u0027s get to the fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/inJQzPb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022inJQzPb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve always thought that the Delta II was a pretty cool rocket. And I haven\u0027t seen one around here. Which brings me... here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictured is the complete Delta II 7925-H, but it comes in subassemblies too, so there\u0027s the option to launch a 7920-H (without the third stage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it says, it\u0027s mostly stock, except for Procedural Fairings. This wouldn\u0027t be possible without procedural fairings. Besides, if you\u0027re not using Proc. Fairings, then... you need to. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E The SRBs have Fairing nosecones because anything else wouldn\u0027t look as good. Sure it\u0027s a waste of part count but... it\u0027s not like I built a Delta II Heavy for part count. Past that comes the 60-70 part Delta-K stage, then the 55 part PAM-D stage. So in total, it\u0027s somewhere in the mid-200s for the Delta II. Not too bad, but you better hope that your probe isn\u0027t too part intensive if you\u0027ve got a slow computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for its performance... it overperforms. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E At least the first stages do. The current setup can probably get 10-15 tons (compared to the actual 6 tons, I think?) to a 75km orbit without having to stage to the second stage. The large boosters are great for aesthetics, but they\u0027ve got way too much punch. First set is limited to 72% thrust and second set is reduced fuel. With a bit of tweaking, actual Delta II performance can probably be emulated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m lazy. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried the medium-sized SRBs, but they probably look incredibly short compared to the rest of the rocket. Maybe if that extra X200-16 is taken out, it\u0027ll make an all-around more accurate rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Delta-K and PAM-D I think I got close to actual performance, in terms of burn time, at least. They also look nice!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qDO4I\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
