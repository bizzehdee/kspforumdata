When this aircraft is first used, it may lean towards the front a bit. However, you will lift off with no problems (as long you are gentle). This is my first publicly released design to use canards (though I have used them in test aircrafts) as well as hardpoints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the screenshots of what the design looks like (using spoiler tags as done before to prevent it from eating up the page):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Falminstris1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Falminstris1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Falminstris2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Falminstris2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Falminstris3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Falminstris3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might also do a challenge sometime due to the fact I actually had an interesting experience with it. One flaw y\\\u0027all might notice is that there are too few fuel tanks to make around the world trips (on Kerbin of course). However, it is still great to fly around. In terms of landing, I was able to land with no problems. The design is also provided in the post for those who want to play with it or even tweak it to grant it more fuel. As stated earlier, I might even create a challenge surrounding the use of this craft. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-28T00:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice and steady, and faster than mach two \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bandock","CreatedById":28934,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-28T00:40:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Corona688. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing my fastest aircraft out of any one I built so far (my second fastest achieved close to or a bit over 600 m/s); that is why I plan to allow others to use this design for a future challenge I plan to put up (still under planning).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
