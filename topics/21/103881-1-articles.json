Now I have a smoother version. The aerodynamics are very weird in this one (maybe because I rebuilt form the old version, rather than starting from scratch). I had to put a heavy rocket fuel tank and align engines in weird ways and add extra wings. All this aside, now it flies stable, but not particularly maneuverable.\n\n[**DOWNLOAD**](http://www./download/tkv9rhpy4j47aka/Su-35%282%29.craft)\n\nIt also has missiles included in the download:\n\n![paszqRg.gif](http://i.imgur.com/paszqRg.gif)\n\n![JljX0qt.png](http://i.imgur.com/JljX0qt.png)\n\n![6aRsOVK.png](http://i.imgur.com/6aRsOVK.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T01:56:35Z","Content":"Very nice work manni."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T02:17:02Z","Content":"\u002BRep!
