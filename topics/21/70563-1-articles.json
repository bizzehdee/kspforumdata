All of them are designed to be modular, easily deployable by skycrane, and safe for their occupants. They range from 0.55 to 2.7 tons. Despite the rovers themselves being completely stock, they are best used with mods like KAS or Infernal Robotics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/lT1oW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Its low profile prevents it from flipping over at high speed, but it can still do so if you aren\u0027t careful. It can easily carry mission specific equipment on its upper frontal and rear plates, you can also cram things into the front. Most important systems are armor plated. The crew sit laying backwards on sponsons. It is highly unlikely that the crew will be killed if the rover flips, but possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.craft: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/qw0h00rcg8fbezj/R-1.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/qw0h00rcg8fbezj/R-1.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ER-2:\u003C/strong\u003E This is a light rover with a two man crew. It can hit only 9.4m/s, but it is extremely light. Really, its too light and slow to damage itself or its crew. You can probably mount mission specific equipment on the edge of the battery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.craft: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/vt5mry33g6p8r4w/R-2.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vt5mry33g6p8r4w/R-2.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ER-3:\u003C/strong\u003E This is a heavy rover with a four man crew. It can hit 21.5m/s. Despite being a \u0022heavy\u0022 rover, it only weighs 2.7 tons so shouldn\u0027t be too hard to transport. Both the crew and important components are armored, so it is likely to survive any crashes. It has a massive amount of area to mount mission specific equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.craft: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/8hh54hpgax6uhlb/R-3.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/8hh54hpgax6uhlb/R-3.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-26T05:16:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2014 05:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Uberdude9001\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
