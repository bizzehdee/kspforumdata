Due to the extreme power and speed of the round, it is unable to be fired in a stacked configuration, and thus uses a revolving spindle to load successive rounds. It should be noted that this is still a prototype, and as such, requires skill to get into orbit, though it is quite possible. Excerpts taken from it\u0027s launch manual recommend using a straight vertical ascent until roughly 8km, whereby weight imbalance in the fuel tanks will require using a controlled spin to maintain ascent vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b383/heeroyuy117/net2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022net2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b383/heeroyuy117/net4.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECargo Shuttle with 4 Satellites\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b383/heeroyuy117/net3.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECloser view of a Satellite\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b383/heeroyuy117/net1.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESatellites working together to target debris\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArtemis Necklace is the name for a planetary defense system formed from a collective of satellites armed with anti-ship laser cannons.

My latest version without a warp drive however, ends up using nearly half of that fuel just to get into a 100km orbit unfortunately, but that still gives it a considerable range. As far as atmospheric re-entry goes, I find if you decelerate and then fall capsule end first, you can pretty much maintain the entire ship in one piece all the way down, however with that approach you\u0027re obviously not going to be able to recover more than the capsule (assuming you jettison it in time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cypherwraith\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cypherwraith\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe sheer scale of these is mind-blowing.

The Revolver surprisingly only took about 4-5 tries with re-balancing the center of gravity between the fuel tanks and the rates at which they burn, but the Takemikazuchi\u0027s taken CONSIDERABLY longer. It\u0027s paid off though, and now you can try the VLS variant for yourself. I recommend setting the throttle to 2/3 power till the SRBs are all used up and then hammering on the throttle. It\u0027s not so much to save fuel as it is a waste of power in the earlier launch phase, and you\u0027ll want to save that delta-v for circularizing your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and keep in mind, if you rely on mechjeb for steering the Takemikazuchi, remember that the capsule on it is actually upside down, so you\u0027ll want to invert your pitch and heading figures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-18T04:36:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2012 04:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by HYuy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"botse","CreatedById":39993,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-18T14:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b383/heeroyuy117/rev1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rev1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eall you needed to do is make some mechjeb RCS pods with the round on them then stage them out in orbit and fire at will\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eall you need is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E /\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E | |\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B| |\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MJ\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B=RCS pod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ=mechjeb part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat is the firing bed so a smaller ship can get it to orbit and but this pod in to orbit so you get drone firing beds but that gets rid all of the fun of firing a 50 ton ships main gun so more fun so the RCS gun pod is for the ppl who wont to have a farst to build orbiter drone with a mac round on it to fire at there fros i well build a mechjeb ship to test the gun pod and well post if it goes well\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-18T14:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022botse\u0022 data-cite=\u0022botse\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat is the firing bed so a smaller ship can get it to orbit and but this pod in to orbit so you get drone firing beds but that gets rid all of the fun of firing a 50 ton ships main gun so more fun so the RCS gun pod is for the ppl who wont to have a farst to build orbiter drone with a mac round on it to fire at there fros i well build a mechjeb ship to test the gun pod and well post if it goes well\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...what?

What this means is that due to the ship carrying the round having very little mass in comparison to the round (at least in comparison to the full size cannon stations), the mini-firing platform would absorb a larger part of the energy of the round compared to normal, resulting in the round flying much slower than it could.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Capacity. The Takemikazuchi can carry 16 rounds in one go. Can you imagine trying to make a ship that carries 16 different small rcs units with rounds attached?
