It\u0027s a good habit I got, to manage it with some \u0022course correction\u0022, adding a couple of degrees more or less plotted on the \u0022Final Flight Path\u0022 line: if your launch is going too much higher angle of ascent, you will need MORE monopropellant to circularize... and this could lead to not having enough to deorbit safely (mostly notable with the 42 tons MAX payload)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the \u0022Final Flight Path\u0022 is too much negative, instead, you could not clear the atmosphere during/after Main Engine burn and Main Tank separation (on the Ascent path you will notice the line going \u0022down\u0022, back to Kerbin ground).

It\u0027s good to know people like it! It really did consume a lot of free time in January \u002715. The shuttle is designed on the shoulders of giants who came before me. Shuttle building was always the most difficult design challenge in KSP for years for many people. Only a few look-alikes were published here (I could only count two). Then Westi\u0027s shuttle was just simply a stroke of genius with his use of a stack of SAS modules. I ran with the mk3 parts, made a full STS size shuttle, learned from gliding attempts by Rune, and cargo attempts by Naito, and took all that they learned to the final level of a mk3 shuttle capable of orange tank lifting. And the idea to make all kinds of cargo modules for it too (and a video). Was a lot of fun. Now Naito, and finally a few others are keeping up the shuttle building race and exploring new ways to keep things efficient. I look forward to 1.0.5 and 1.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FCISuperGuy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FCISuperGuy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirstly, I can\u0027t express my praise for this shuttle and my gratitude for you having made it so well.

Naito pointed this out and was the first to adopt them, so I simply ran with his discovery during the update. They\u0027ve worked beautifully since. But it did lead me to finally develop the holy grail of SRBs that would lift the shuttle and 42 tons cargo to orbit. STS-7E is that magnum opus. I\u0027m looking forward to testing the new SSMEs, but as what happened with 1.0 mk3 wings by Porkjet, I don\u0027t have my hopes up that they will actually complement the design. We\u0027ll see.

I\u0027ve found that with my own flight profile, it almost doubles the delta-v on-orbit with an empty cargo bay, from ~500m/ to about ~950m/s; with a full cargo bay (containing my 25.1t station service module inc. engine and fuel), it gives the shuttle a reasonable amount of d/v (~500m/s), compared to an unusable ~200m/s or so without the pallet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/TF6Mu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
