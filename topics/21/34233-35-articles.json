I could have added better ones on but the part count reached just over 300 (about 305 including about 10 struts). Each reload (3 torps) has a tug system allowing it to be unloaded. I think its best to reload by using the fighter to dock onto the pile instead of using tugs. I haven\u0027t designed the staging to send it into space but testing it by editing the save file. So far, it needs RCS (got non installed) but the \u0022simulation\u0022 shows it works. Running this on my laptop causes a LOT of lag so it may be a bit painful to try to get it into space using staging. From the lag, I doubt that I can load the auxiliary tanks as planned. If I had a proper PC, this could be used as a carrier to dock modified Isprits on either the top (has small docking ports like a flight deck) or from the side (where them \u0022arms\u0022 are).

Frigates patrol ahead of a main body and act as eyes and ears. They are maneuverable, lightly armed and lightly armored. Cruisers are your jack-of-all-trades ship, and frequently were asked to patrol individulally, \u0022showing-the-flag\u0022, as it were. Battleships were the ships-of-the-line, and intended to toss as much shell-weight at other ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the torpedo was invented, and the Torpedo Boat - if they could get in close, they would doom a mighty battleship with but a few cheap Whitehead torpedoes. A small ship with quickfiring guns was needed - the Torpedo Boat Destroyer, later shortened to just Destroyer - which became the frequent hunter of Submarines, as well. Frequently, Sci-Fi gets this mixed up and thinks that a Destroyer is THE baddest thing in orbit, when the historical record suggests that that is pretty far from the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a sci-fi KSP type of setting, there are probably Frigates - lightly-armed patrol ships used to screen for the enemy in advance of a fleet; Cruisers - long-range patrol ships operating alone; and Battleships - large ships that form the core of a fleet action. The difference between a Cruiser and Battleship might not be that large, either - is it intended to operate alone or as part of a larger force? The loss of either would be a pretty big blow, as either would not be cheap to build, launch or operate. Frigates would be far more numerous, since you can afford to launch them faster, the loss of one isn\u0027t so painful and multiple frigates operating in tandem might be quite painful to deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s just my take on it. We\u0027re not even going to touch upon Auxiliary ships, used to provide consumables for the warships they follow around.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-04T00:52:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2013 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pvtnum11\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Edifferentiating cruisers and battleships\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kolt","CreatedById":67456,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T01:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are a couple of ships I\u0027ve been working on so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cykpIFQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cykpIFQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShip-\u003C/strong\u003E Merlin P-7a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECompany-\u003C/strong\u003E Drill Co.- Tartarus Project\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECompany Bio -\u003C/strong\u003E While the company\u0027s focus has always been interplanetary mining of resources, after the \u0022Laythe incident\u0022 happened between Spiritwolf and Hanland the board of investors felt that their assets could be at risk.

BlackMoon Defense Contractors are proud to announce the loan of one of our most prized spacecraft, the KSS Indomitable Long Range Scout Frigate. This excellent blend of a scout ship and cruiser make the KSS Indomitable a force to be reckoned with. Her primary role is to lead a fleet of slower cruisers and fighter squadrons into a new system, recon the immediate area, and provide fire support with her two, replaceable SRBAPM (Solid Rocket Booster Armor Piercing Missile) These are proven to take down even the toughest of Capital Ships, often disabling heavily armored dreadnoughts in a single shot. A secondary complement of 4 \u0022I-Beam\u0022 Missiles serves as a backup against lightly armored capital ships, or fighters. She is fully cloaked in armor, and can withstand most fighter-born missiles with little or no damage, however when it comes to capital weapons her small size and compartmentalized design are her only means of defense. Built around a 6-way adapter, the Indomitable can sustain a direct hit to any part of the ship from any missile. While that part of the ship will be annihilated, most of the ship will survive, adding survivability. For long range travel she is equipped with four Atomic Engines, and can easily reach any planet in the Kerbin System and orbit. However, for multiple consecutive missions it is advised that it is refueled via one of it\u0027s two open standard sized docking ports, or smaller mini-ports mounted on the engine armor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlackmoon has always helped other defense contract..., excuse me, other scientific research firms in their endeavors, and we hope that this act of friendship will lead to bigger and greater things in our partnership.

The changes made where the addition of a second layer of armor around the core of the ship, the addition of 4 external seats on the rear of the craft, the replacement of the LV-T30 with two LV-N rockets. Approximately 720 units of liquid fuel and respective oxidizer where added to accommodate these.

AlTi AD came from humble beginnings nearly forty years ago as a small aluminum cellphone case manufacturing company founded by Bradno Michael Kerman. The company slowly grew from simple cellphone cases to computer manufacturing, spots gear, and even a stylish clothing line, but remained a light weight metals fabricator despite the success of these other ventures. After twenty years AlTi Fabrication and Engineering Group, as it was called then, expanded to manufacture aerospace components for some of the top companies in the industry. Relationships with some of there entities grew and thirty years after its birth the company merged with Dina Aerospace Connections and a small defense contractor called Bitter Defense and Logistics, Becoming AlTi Dina \u0026amp; Bitter International Solutions. The name would change two years later when AlTi bought controlling interest in the company finely becoming AlTi Aerospace \u0026amp; Defense Solutions Incorporated or AlTi AD inc. Today under the direction of its third CEO Reannah Lee Michael Kerman daughter of its founder the company has made leaps and bounds in practical and even profitable space exploration. The corporation\u0027s most recent accomplishments include a permanent scientific research outpost on the planet Duna, as well as two high capacity fuel depots in orbit and a resource extraction rig near the rim of the northern icecap. AlTi AD inc. also boasts an effective logistics train capable of reaching the outer planets and resupplying missions on the outer rim. Comprised of several modular tug craft and even the Mammoth class super tanker this resupply and refueling system has proven to be invaluable in aiding the Corporation and her allies in pushing the boundaries of exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly in light of the incidents between the Spirit Wolf corporation and Hanland the AlTi AD defense department has seen fit to engineer a new line of SSTO multi-role attack fighter and a series of light and heavy capitol ships to protect its investments in orbit and beyond. The latest prototype to come out of the hanger is the OF-57 multi-role heavy attack stealth fighter. Named the Phoenix class the Mk I is designed as a low orbital intercepter armed with two linked missile hard-points that can be outfitted with a verity of light to medium yield ordinance for rapid ground to orbit response. The Mk I can also rondveu with a refueling module for long ranged strike missions or escort. The Mk II and Mk III are long ranged attack fighters designed to reach orbit without any modules or weapons dock with a station for fuel and armament and strike at a target from long range. These models are far more flexible than the Mk I with several hard-points capable of being outfitted with practically any sized weapon, but lack the response time for emergency interception. Rumors of a more efficient Mk IV to replace the Mks II and III have been confirmed but an even stranger rumor of a VTOL Mk V has yet to be validated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current liaison of international relations for AlTi AD inc. has been meeting with representatives form Spirit wolf to discuss the possibility of a mutual information and defense exchange possibly even joint expeditionary missions but nothing final has been agreed upon. For now we will just have to wait and see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlTi AD inc.

I cant put a screen shot up yet. I hope you guys like it there will be more to come after i get my computer fixed. I have 5 capitol ship designs i have to make videos for all can get into orbit all are 100% stock parts and only the carrier is over 250 parts. I also have all the aid craft to make proof and videos of as well as all the bases and stations I\u0027ve put up I\u0027ve got to now replace them lol. Ill also get the craft file as soon as i get an account up with a file sharing web-sight.
