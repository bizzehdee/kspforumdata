After building a couple of rockets that can get into orbit, I decided to try and do something more difficult. This little lander thing resulted. Originally I tried to cushion the landing of the command capsule with a mini liquid engine from Wobbly Rockets, but after some experimentation I found that on Kearth, wings=shock absorbers. They\u0027ll actually take a 30 meter fall if they hit the ground just right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI landed this on the water tower repeatedly, on the VAB, and on the spherical tank connected to the launching pad. I have yet to attempt a palm tree, but that\u0027s my next goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i149.photobucket.com/albums/s46/seamour2/screenshot1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i149.photobucket.com/albums/s46/seamour2/screenshot2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legoasaurus","CreatedById":2589,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-22T08:39:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EO.o you, my friend, have jjust won the game.On that note, I lost the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Condor","CreatedById":3686,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-22T20:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out the palms don\u0027t have collision detection, but that doesn\u0027t matter, because I just found something incredibly weird.
