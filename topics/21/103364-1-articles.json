I would love for someone to improve it.\n\nSmallFatFetus\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-04T03:53:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2015 03:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SmallFatFetus**"},{"CreatedByName":"JID00Gaming","CreatedById":134914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T06:09:56Z","Content":"how did u get the red stripes on the flaps?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tweety","CreatedById":115567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T06:47:32Z","Content":"All you need to improve this desing is switch out the engine for a turbojet and two of the tiny radial mounted engines at the back and I\u0027m sure with a bit of determination you could get to a trajectory that only needs tiny amounts of delta v to circularise.

This would be the first steps i\u0027d take at making a more capable SSTO. Switched the rapier engine to a jet/atomic combo (use action groups 1 and 2). Did heavy work on the back end to accommodate the new engine configuration. seeing as its heavier the center of lift needed to be shifted back and decided to cluster the intakes in the back while i was at it. Left the front mostly untouched but that would be the next area i\u0027d work on. Just did this rather quickly for fun. Use or discard it if u want.\n\n[Download](http://www./download/2ksncapublmgh97/X30\u002BSSTO.craft)\n\n[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Y8Jhlid.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T14:56:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E All you need to improve this desing is switch out the engine for a turbojet and two of the tiny radial mounted engines at the back and I\u0027m sure with a bit of determination you could get to a trajectory that only needs tiny amounts of delta v to circularise.
