II. It already meets all the requirements on paper, but the landing stage has yet to be tested in the field. It packs a massive 6.1 km/s of delta V and has loads of spare OOOmph during both descent and ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk. I iteration was carrying one X200-32 tank on top, but that meant to jettison it on touchdown and probably waste a lot of precious fuel, that could assist in the ascent phase. Also the Mk.I needed engines at the side, which had an ugly impact on the transport profile... The Mk. II now easily fits inside a Mk. III cargo bay and can keep all the fuel, until fully spent. On depletion, the side-tanks can be jettisoned without leaving any traces back on the lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original concept was done for the Jool-5 mission. After returning from Tylo, the separated ascent stage can be used as a lander for missions to Bop, Pol and Val, as it packs enough delta V to get down and back up from those moons at ease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a bit of luck, the lander will be released this weekend, but i make this dependent on how it performs during the test-landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fkGr3eL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fkGr3eL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a few shots of the lander cans it evolved from, during the last few months:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e5JCOHW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e5JCOHW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T17:51:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frank_G\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T12:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, that Tylo lander is gorgeous. Know that I am stealing some design elements at some point. I think I already repped you for it, didn\u0027t I? Anyhow, the second thing. That Mk3 storable SSTO. I took your idea (I had already built one, but never liked it), and dialled it to eleven, aesthetics wise. I was pretty inspired this morning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sUak2Z4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sUak2Z4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Yup, juice to spare once I added three more intakes around the RAPIER (those side intakes are puny!). Even with docking systems and stuff! Might want to give the tank combo a try. The only tricks I added on top was to sink the BigS strakes more by giving them 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA offset so their leading edge is straighter, the front control surface is disabled and there is another behind (otherwise control would be inverted), and most of the control work is done with the four flaps on the back, two for pitch and two for yaw. No other wing surfaces other than the wingtip \u0022tailplanes\u0022. It might be a tad light on liquid fuel, so drain oxi or climb steep as a bat out of hell. Oh, and the cockpit is inclined 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA downwards to make it look meaner, which has the incidental effect of making it lift off under automatic pilot if you lock it in prograde, and go into a nice climb without \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E control input.
