The airframe is just too old, and the expertise needed to extend the life just isn\u0027t there any more.\n\nIn the Red Flag exercises, the Vulcan had a very distinctive shadow that could give away its location . The RAF pilots worked out how to hide it.. They flow low enough to hide the shadow with the wing.\n\nI can remember standing on a hillside in Lincolnshire and looking down on a passing Vulcan."},{"CreatedByName":"Vagani","CreatedById":112067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:00:24Z","Content":"Heres an epic render of the vulcan made by starwhip, thanks man\n\n![1uR1gaO.png](http://i.imgur.com/1uR1gaO.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"erasmusguy","CreatedById":138404,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T16:37:21Z","Content":"Now this I like"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T07:37:24Z","Content":"It\u0027s beautiful!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vagani","CreatedById":112067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T09:22:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Now this I like\n\nSo do I ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s beautiful!\n\nThank you:)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Mania","CreatedById":146353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T13:27:14Z","Content":"I love how you combined all the jet engines into one to make it look better and like a modded engine"},{"CreatedByName":"Vagani","CreatedById":112067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T13:29:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I love how you combined all the jet engines into one to make it look better and like a modded engine\n\nyeah, its was completely unintentional, the engines were originally sitting on top of each other, but it didnt get enoguh power so i decided to make a subassembly and i was really happy with how it came out :)thanks btw"}]}
