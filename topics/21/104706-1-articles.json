The Trident SSTO, and the Trident Stardrive. Both can get into a stable orbit relatively easilly, where we you may dock the SSTO into the stardrive, and head for the stars (or at least a few moons and planets ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)). There isn\u0027t much more I can say about it. The SSTO tends to wobble around a bit when connected to the Stardrive section since they are only connected through a tiny clamp o tron jr port, so just be careful when turning. (I haven\u0027t broke it yet during any of my maneuvers, but it\u0027s always good to be careful).\n\nAnyways, here\u0027s the SSTO craft:\n\n[DOWNLOAD](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dpbpqun1csudjvi/Trident.craft?dl=1)\n\nand here\u0027s the Stardrive:\n\n[DOWNLOAD](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rk10sqp1fzc2ky9/Trident%20Stardrive.craft?dl=1)\n\nAnd here\u0027s a little teaser, enjoy ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![Trident.jpg?raw=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lvciu2hjvki1kk3/Trident.jpg?raw=1)\n\nP.S.\n\nDon\u0027t forget to try the Stardrive docking from inside the cockpit. It\u0027s easy and feels awesome ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T21:11:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angezerus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T21:17:13Z","Content":"Very nice, I like the \u0027stardrive\u0027 concept very much. \u002B1, may build a version myself!"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T03:45:30Z","Content":"Cool idea, not that i havent build interplanetary transfer rings before though.
