The only mod i have installed is mechjeb. once the boosters are separated you can press key 9 to extend the solar panels. key 8 extends the antennas and toggles science equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe center tanks empty in succession. once empty you can jettison one by one saving a total of 1.75 tons. it does however create a lot of debris for one mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eive had it as far out as jool, havent tested it for eeloo yet. the upper stage is a lander equipped with parachutes and thrusters should you wish to land. currently only meant for one way trips, working on a few versions which incorporates a hab module and docking capability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/uKk6y#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/uKk6y#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eship file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/g0dcpx4rvsmlp75/Ulysses%202A.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/g0dcpx4rvsmlp75/Ulysses%202A.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efeel free to modify but please give me a small shout on upon sharing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplease let me know how i did\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for looking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PIRATEONTHERUN","CreatedById":32233,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T18:59:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks good, but some photos in better lighting of later stages would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPIRATEONTHERUN\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
