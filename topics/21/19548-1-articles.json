Designed by the Norkerb Knavy Ship Yards (over a lunch break), the Kersarge utilizes the latest parts found lying about the facility, and anything that wasn\u0027t nailed down they could \u0022acquire\u0022 by midnight raids on government warehouses. Weighing in at 17 tons fueled, the Kersarge is the largest vessel yet built by the NKSY (and the ONLY vessel built by NKSY). Two turbine engines mounted in the rear can drive the Kersarge at an unprecedented top speed of 19-20 m/s, almost faster than a Kerbal can run (if Kerbals could run on water).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe USK Kersarge\u0027s flight deck (that large upper flat space) can support (maybe) small aircraft of the VTOL, STOL and helicopter variety, although objects hurtling toward their vessel at high speed tend to make Kerbal sailors very uncomfortable. Control is maintained by a highly advanced Kerbal Guidance System (Mechjeb) and is fully capable of taking the ship anywhere on the globe (literally anywhere -- without rhyme or reason). Several hard points have been included, enabling different systems to be mounted for a particular mission, including Rail Gun battery , Mini-missle System, and the new LAZOR AA system. The Damned Robotics Crane is mounted for astroknut and capsule recovery, usually without breaking if the astroknuts don\u0027t struggle too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe USK Kersarge will soon be undergoing tests to determine it\u0027s sea-worthiness, fuel consumption, and full range (or until it reaches the end of the world and falls off the edge). Future ships of the same class are planned for construction (if enough parts can be rounded up). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESister Ships Planned:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSK Khornet - KCV-02\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSK Krandolph - KCV-03\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSK Inkerpid - KCV-04\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSK Lake Kherplain - KCV-05\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022GO KNAVY!

As Tosh states in his INFO for the Seaplane Pontoons, they tend to roll easily on a gentle slope. This holds true for the runway and the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Starting out on the runway, engage the engines and get speed up to around 9 to 10 m/s. This is optimal for getting off the runway. The engines can be cut off if you\u0027re going too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I usually go off the side of the runway rather than the end. Seems easier to gently roll off one side rather than the end. See what works best for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You can cut the engines on/off to maintain speed. I usually drive down to the coast at a leisurely 8-12 m/s (usually being passed by grandmothers with baby strollers). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. As you get closer to the water, you will certainly begin to speed up because of the slope. Use the brakes (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CB\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 key) to slow down. A tap is usually good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Ease the ship into the water. I have entered at around 15 - 16 m/s and made it okay, but the shock is much greater at higher speeds. I\u0027m not sure what top speed the Kersarge can survive hitting the water, so I try to go in as slow as I can (1 - 12 m/s). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGUIDANCE: You can use the MechJeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CInstrument Landing System\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to set a course (not speed unfortunately).

Now, I just use the rudders to turn the ship in the direction I want to go and turn on the onboard SAS (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CT\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 key). I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure if MechJeb is at fault or I am.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFUTURE CONSTRUCTION: I\u0027ve included a truss connection point on the island where items can be attached. I hope to build a simple, single item island to replace the parts in use, retexturing it with the vessel number \u002201\u0022 on the side. I would also like smaller, ship type propellers and a small fuel tank to match the diameter. I experimented with a \u0022rotating\u0022 propeller for forward and reverse thrust, but the size of it and the fuel tank was too cumbersome. I also want to build a working elevator platform for the side of the ship. And stick cameras on the island for views of recovery and flight deck operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh! And I might even put one or two aircraft on her if they will fit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPROBLEMS: Lag?

Then smooth sailing. Also, it seems to lag badly at night. Do your launches in the daytime. Please note that my system is rather old also. A 470 one gig card and an intel duo chip. Not even an I5! People with better systems probably will not have as big a problem. Let me know what your results are!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines will sometimes not start: Seems that if you restart the mission, or end the mission, return to the SPH and Launch again the engines refuse to turn over.
