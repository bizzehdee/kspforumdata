Having enough wing to fly on low angles of attack all the way up to 10kms is crucial, unless you want to pay a huge penalty in TWR to go supersonic. If you can go supersonic and have \u0026gt;1.5km/s in the tanks, tough, you are golden, the only thing that changes form then on is the climb rate to get 1km/s out of the airbreathers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mikki\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mikki\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Rune \u003Cp\u003EI just visited this Thread the first Time and i must say your crafts are very cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt immediatly reminded me my SSTO i posted some days ago (winglets on wingtips an narrowed...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave to take a closer look to your ideas. i give you a heartly rep:wink:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
