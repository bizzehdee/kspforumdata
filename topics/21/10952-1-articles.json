I figured the U-2 was in good taste for ringing in the new release. I did the best I could, and it\\\u0027s pretty impressive for a single-engine aircraft. It peaked at about 17,810m (roughly 58,400 ft) without killing the engine. Its service ceiling is about 15,240m (50,000 ft), and is well above Mach 1, 430 m/s (961 mph). It\\\u0027s not ready for circumnavigation JUST yet. You\\\u0027ll max out @ roughly 25 minutes full-throttle, so be careful. ;D"}]}
