And then decided to improve it. Of course, Murphy\u0027s laws kicked in - and what I considered a few minor tweaks turned a decent flyer into a failrue. No matter how I try to tweak the winglets - it either fails to raise its front above the horizon, loses control and falls on its tail, or suddenly plunges at around 10 km as soon as I try to reduce the angle of attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship uses parts from the following mods: \u003Cstrong\u003EB9 Aerospace Pack\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/strong\u003E.

I usually managed to get at around 1000-1200 m/s before running out of air (measured air speed at turbojet intakes, as I don\u0027t really trust either of gimball\u0027s indicators)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u0026gt; At 22-23 km (or whenever your air intake drops around 0.60) switch the jets off and activate rocket engines from groups 2 \u0026amp; 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u0026gt; Return to 45 degrees angle of attack, use RCS to stabilise it if neccessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u0026gt; When you see apoapsis reach ~75 km, switch the engines off and wait until you reach ~65 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u0026gt; Leave only VOTLs on (as they have better specific impulse) and burn until you reach a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is WAD that you have little to no fuel upon reaching orbit. Any ship with standard Clamp-O-Tron docking port can dock and refuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d greatly, infinitely and totally appreciate \u003Cstrong\u003Eany\u003C/strong\u003E help. I really want to use this machine in my Munar colony program, and this issue stalls the whole project. Also I\u0027m not so fond on giving this up, as I really wanted to have my first functional SSTO operational as a part of it.
