Unfortunately on the descent my wing decided that it would give itself to the mighty kraken, leaving my ship spiraling out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily for me i always prepare for these kind of events with chutes, which worked but left my kerbals stranded and cold on the North Pole. I believe in rescuing all my kerbals, so long as its actually possible, so i built a recovery craft to do the task of bringing the 3 kerbals home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm sure some of you may have seen this plane around, but i never offered a DL for it, now i am.

I built a ramp with less then 10 parts thats used to get rovers and such items off the runway ASAP, it really helps out a lot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload Link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/23au896xs4eyjch/Rescue%20Polar%20Expidion%20Refueler.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/23au896xs4eyjch/Rescue%20Polar%20Expidion%20Refueler.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you guys enjoy these fine machines, The SSTK (Single Stage To Kerbin) aircraft can be converted to a SSTO by changing the tanks on the side to rocket mixture tanks. The Plane is more then capable with a few modifications to make it to orbit, however, it is really only good for ferrying kerbals to and from kerbin as its not built to carry a payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways guys, Enjoy the crafts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(P.S i know i spelled Expedition wrong..im not sure where the D came in at, but whatever \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Just rename it haha)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
