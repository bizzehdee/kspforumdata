The modmaker for KAX uses the old swept wings alot, so I thought I\u0027d try it with those, too. I think it turned out really well, the struts looks awesome ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) It has the gas guzzling radial prop motor, and the thing is so dang powerful on that light airframe, it works just as well as a helicopter. XD Liberal use of part clipping for unoccupied nodes and offset and rotation is a must, it works so well on detailed crafts. I also got it under the bridge, something I\u0027ve never done before ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nFirst time trying to embed an album...\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qw7Zu/embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n...Nope\n\nLemme try that again XD\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
