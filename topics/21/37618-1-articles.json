As you are using mods and would probably have Flight Engineer, MechJeb or another sort of info mod, you should make sure that you have 7000\u002B Delta-V, according to this [\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25360-Delta-V-map%5D\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25360-Delta-V-map]\u003C/a\u003E map the bare minimum delta-v required is 6210, you should always have an excess of that. Use the large landing gear and read some of the really helpful guides on how to land, basically have 100 m/s for every 1,000 meters above ground level, I think. There are some designs that could give you inspiration, particulary ones used to land large bases on other planets/moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
