My objective was to make an all LF SSTO. This happened while I was testing to see at what altitude the Nerv engine starts to become useful in terms of TWR and ISP. Turns out the answer is: much lower than expected, around 10km altitude. It Uses 2 Turboramjets and 2 Nerv\u0027s. The Nerv\u0027s are activated early to help squeeze more thrust out of the jets. It ends up going into low Kerbin orbit with around 1,700 m/s of Dv.\n\n[Imgur Album](http://imgur.com/a/JO8L7)"},{"CreatedByName":"Thingymajigy","CreatedById":136332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T04:06:06Z","Content":"You can embed your imgur album\n\nThe link is [http://imgur.com/a/](http://imgur.com/a/)**JO8L7**\n\nso:\n\n    [imgur]JO8L7[/imgur]\n\nWhat it looks like:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
