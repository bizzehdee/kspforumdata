Instead of using fuselages you use wings to get a more interesting shape. Also it dramatically increases the maneuverability of the plane. I wasn\u0027t intending on posting this plane on the forums but some people might want to see it. I am in the habit of clean lines and just using parts for there intended use, which is no fun. So hopefully I gave you some inspiration and you are already building a plane:D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, now to the pictures...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Y5NXw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see you get the shape without the weight. It isn\u0027t perfect but it is just an experiment. Also it is a really good dog fighter, which is its intended use. The speed gets up to 200 during turns due to the kraken. Also she lifts up by herself and is a bit of a SAS hater as she will pull up slightly. But the maneuverability is better than all of my previous fighters. I will let you figure out the rest of the flight characteristics \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest it out here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/2duwj118wos9vo5/AF-13C_Crotalus.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/2duwj118wos9vo5/AF-13C_Crotalus.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck-Jeb\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Megalodon 720","CreatedById":108146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T14:55:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENicely done, I see that you put winglets on the fuselage to give it a batter look and too add to the plane\u0027s manoeuvrability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did something similar here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKQYpV845vQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BriXman","CreatedById":89391,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T20:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice!
