I also think the plane was decelerating when the fairings released, that would explain the spread.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T17:58:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 05:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by R\u0026DD**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheTsar52","CreatedById":61707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T18:17:25Z","Content":"My most unconventional design that I can remember was a plan named the C-2 Rocket.

Great looking plane though. Is it inside the fairing?\n\nYes. here is a pic that explains more. This plane has the max load of 82.6tons LFO in MK3 tanks in the fairings.\n\nThe wings are swept up, the engines can be toggled asymetric verticaly to enable stable flight in any situation, hence the CoM and CoT differ while operation. I can show precise Pics if anybody is interested... the payload mount is also much variable, easy to do in SPH depending the size of desired modules/ tanks/ whatever.\n\nDepending on the size of the Load some 3 Part or 5 Part fairing is mandatory, RCS downwards gently while opening, before circularisation burn so they dont end up as orbiting trash (obsolete, thanks Captain Sierra)\n\n![eROrCMN.png](http://i.imgur.com/eROrCMN.png)\n\n![vkYuiaS.png](http://i.imgur.com/vkYuiaS.png)\n\nThe upper is the same plane body but with crewcapsule in front, 4 engines fewer, fewer LFO tank in front, depleted fairingmount detached and heatshield behind with airbrakes, after landing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T07:32:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 07:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mikki**\n  \nobsolete, typo:)"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T07:25:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E before circularisation burn so they dont end up as orbiting trash.\n\nstock fairings are non-persistent debris. They auto-delete after drifting a set distance away, or after unloading the scene, rendering the above step unnecessary. This was a gripe many people have with them and a key component as to why procedural fairings remains such a popular mod post 1.0."}]}
