Yes this is an original viper, not the reboot version, and was never intended to be an exact replica... more to just get the bird out of my system so I could move on to other projects. And it is a strange bird indeed. It does in fact fly not too badly, but I suspect there\u0027s some form of inertial coupling going on. I\u0027ve discovered a few other craft I have built since the viper have that issue as well. Ironically the new heating makes air hogging far less useful as I\u0027ve yet to get past 1200km/s without something blowing up, and the drag model makes it so you want to have less intakes rather than more.\n\nIt is both sad and refreshing that I must learn to spaceplane all over again lol. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)"}]}
