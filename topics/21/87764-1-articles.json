I find that much of the Sci-Fi ships technology matches the Interstellar Mod almost perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo without further ado, the NX01 Enterprise from Star Trek Enterprise. (Still Work-In-Progress)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I\u0027m still struggling with the Interstellar Mod, I still can\u0027t make the magnetic nozzles work for some reason, and I still don\u0027t know why some of the fusion reactors operate below 100%. Also so far the Enterprise has not enough TWR to even fly in the atmosphere, despite the ship in the actual series being able to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnterprise NX01 Version 3 (first version being figuring out the center of mass, second figuring out the functionalities with interstellar and now being simplifying the design)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3W7CYCw.png\u0022 alt=\u00223W7CYCw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jTMKwF0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jTMKwF0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The armor was a pain to build, and still not fully figured out. Initially wanted modular but not currently possible. I wish someone would come up with circular structural panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Nacelles currently are radiators and atmospheric scoops and antimatter collectors. I only just found out that adding more alcubierre drives increases amount of exotic matter, and therefore allows more access to higher speed warp. I can actually make warp coils with stacks of 1.25m alcubierre drives now (though the rings make it more like 2.5m) and make the nacelle functional (Now its just a radiator, atmospheric scoop and an antimatter collector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Impulse Drive currently 1 pair of fusion reactor and thermal turbojet and 1 pair of fusion reactor and quantum vacuum thrusters. First for combat speed, second for coasting. I know that I should tie the antimatter reactor with the thermal turbojet or replace all the fusion reactor but the actual design of the Enterprise has fusion reactors for Impulse and antimatter for warp, even though antimatter isn\u0027t actually necessary, I could make the ship go to warp just using fusion reactors. Also the plasma generated from both reactors (analogous to waste heat in Interstellar Mod) are used for the Impulse Drive, but in Interstellar engines have to be directly connected to reactors. I might just replace all the fusion reactors or remove that limitation on engines requiring a reactor directly attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Because of above limitation in using fusion power, the ship cannot fly in atmosphere. Laythe and smaller planets should be fine though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lower part of the ship makes it more of the refit version rather than the actual version but it was the best way to overcome the COM problem. Contains a refinery and a science lab from interstellar, with IR telescope acting as Main Deflector in the Star Trek universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Alcubierre Drive right now sticks out too much, so I\u0027m switching to stacks of 1.25m alcubierre drives analogous to warp coils in real design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still trying so simplify the design, hopefully the welding plugin will be updated for 0.25 and then I can make the armor literally out of 1 part, although in that case it still isn\u0027t strong enough to withstand an impact from BH armory missiles (no defensive shields, or hull polarisation from the series to reinforce armor...yet. Kerbal Joint reinforcement might serve as an analogy to hull polarisation. Any tips and tricks with Interstellar to make the ship much more closer to the capabilities of the series is welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso does anyone know how to make spoilers?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-19T06:56:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2014 06:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thesgsniper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdating Pictures\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ABZB","CreatedById":98947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T19:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis might be of interest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/640/Star-Trek%20Style%20Engines%20for%20KSPI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalstuff.com/mod/640/Star-Trek%20Style%20Engines%20for%20KSPI\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
