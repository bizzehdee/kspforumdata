The Artemis is based on DI\\\u0027s previous Quad tank design, but smaller with a reduction in weight and the introduction of landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DI-050L landing module has enough fuel to finish orbital insertion, complete TMI burn, munar entry burns, correction burns and enough fuel to land. After landing the minimal RCS is used to return home. This has the huge benefit of munar missions without any debris filling up kerbin\\\u0027s orbit. The module can be downloaded on it\\\u0027s own or comes with the DI-050 launch rocket to get the module out of the atmosphere. In addition the lander is light and powerful enough for practice on kearth (DI test pilots have landed the craft 10km away from the KSS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFinal note:\u003C/strong\u003E the lander module lacks ASAS, please regularly check attitude during burn phases to ensure craft remains in the correct direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u3aUN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u3aUN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo view other photos please visit the photo album here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/FlRC9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/FlRC9\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Twinky827","CreatedById":17455,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-03T15:41:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice you should build a rocket to go with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkshadow","CreatedById":14251,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-03T17:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Twinky827\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Twinky827\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice you should build a rocket to go with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, there is a rocket with it, I\\\u0027ve yet to upload picture of it.
