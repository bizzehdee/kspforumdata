The pointy nose was later trialed by NASA as a sonic boom reduction device (the [Quiet Spike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet_Spike)), while drooping wingtips to enhance compression lift at supersonic speeds appeared on the [XF-108 Rapier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_XF-108_Rapier) and [XB-70 Valkyrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_XB-70_Valkyrie) projects. \n\nThe Angel Interceptor would not be easily replicated as a stock craft, due to its unusual proportions. To closely mimic the shape of the original craft I used [Tweakscale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112693) to resize airfoils and structural sections to obtain the required geometry. I also deleted many subsystems not necessary for flight test in KSP, and simplified the powerplant; what appears to be two turbofans feeding their exhaust into a central ramjet would be an impossible propulsion system with our construction methods. \n\nOnce the craft was carefully shaped with utmost care, using a slight bit of unconventional assembly technique to line up some odd geometry, Valentina took the prototype to the skies where she reported subsonic handling was superb and not unlike a contemporary lightweight jet fighter such as the [F-5 Tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_F-5).\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/LxHDC)\n\nDue to some oddities with the KSP 1.02 flight model, supersonic flight cannot yet be safely attained and further flight testing up to the target top speed of Mach 3\u002B will continue once I setup the current version of FAR. \n\nFor some interesting reading, here is the canon specs of the Angel Interceptor from \u0022Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons\u0022.\n\n[http://www.spectrum-headquarters.com/angel_interceptor.html](http://www.spectrum-headquarters.com/angel_interceptor.html)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T10:18:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 10:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"Esme","CreatedById":107436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T15:41:21Z","Content":"Nice work!
