This would let you send your heavy LV-N engines up once, and reuse them over and over again by just leaving them in orbit. The problem was, it was a huge pain to swap the engines out by docking. I made a robotic arm for my Space Truck, but it was slow and hard to control because it tended to wobble badly, and it couldn\u0027t replace its own engines without getting even longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was already working on a station to hold the engines not currently in use, so I decided to make it into a full fledged spacedock. Here\u0027s what I ended up with as a small proof of concept. I used HyperEdit to get this into orbit, the full size version will either unfold using hinges, or be assembled in pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t pay too much attention to the time. I spent a lot of time trying to get good screenshots, it\u0027s really not very hard to swap engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/EJFSR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor future enhancements, I\u0027m going to add a second rear arm to hold the existing engine so you don\u0027t need to drop it and pick it up again. I also plan to make the drum replaceable. Using a standard docking port, you could plug one of the engines into the port that would normally connect to the spacedock, and fly it around. It\u0027s also going to be made larger, perhaps with multiple bays so you can leave a ship or two gassed up and ready to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was made possible by the fantastic \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-23-5-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Infernal-Robotics-0-16-5a\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInfernal Robotics\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53134-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-7-Pipes-as-fuel-lines-and-even-fewer-explosions!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Attachment System\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-27T01:53:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2014 01:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LaytheAerospace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot to mention KAS\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T10:31:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s really neat, have you thought about using the part welding mod in order to create a better looking space dock?
