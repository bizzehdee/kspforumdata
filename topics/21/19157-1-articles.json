There is now (there was not when the posted video was made) enough RCS to do some serious orbital maneuvering. To get to space, simply fly it at 60 degrees until 15km, 30 degrees until 70km AP and 10 degrees until 100km AP, from there burn the engines at 1% throttle until desired altitude is reached.
