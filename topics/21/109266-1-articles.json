Wanted to make a Skylab, but couldn\u0027t make a good Saturn IB? Well I\u0027m here to save the day! This clone of mine can fly by the Mun, and return! It uses fuel cells for power, includes monoprop to dock, has an abort system, and includes it\u0027s own launch tower (100% Stock). It\u0027s 114 parts (Launch Tower). \n\nPicture\n\n [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442734841](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442734841)\n\nYou fly this like any other rocket, however, it has a 2.3 TWR on the launch pad, so throttle down a little. Stage 2 comes in at around 20-30km, and that will push you most of the way. Stage 3 is the service module, the thing that flies you around in LKO, and brings you home. Tested 3 times, fuel levels adjusted, kerbals barely making it out alive (you should\u0027ve seen flight 2), and ready to fly!\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/jhqwewjbxszg6kv/Saturn%20IB.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jhqwewjbxszg6kv/Saturn%20IB.craft?dl=0)\n\nAnd here\u0027s the download for the Saturn IB\n\nHappy flying! Go make your darn Skylab now XD"}]}
