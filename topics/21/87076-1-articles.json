For all your extreme delta-v requirements, from moving asteroids around to delivering payloads to other planets, I present to you a flexible tank and drive system that you will be able to tailor for every need you can think of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lAeFust.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lAeFust.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, that\u0027s a tall rocket. But what the hell am I talking about? Well, the MPS is a modular system, so it obviously consists of modules. The idea is that for a given tank size (the standard is a Big Red, of course), you can strap as many as you need together and drop them as you use them. And of course it\u0027s the same with the engines: they are in individual pods you can move around, so T/W is also something you can tailor throughout the mission. The final module is to move the other pieces around (or, potentially, to tow \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E, including asteroids): a cute Klaw probe that provides amazing stability and control if attached in pairs around the CoM. Plus an adaptor on the nose for additional flexibility. Here, a closeup of how things end just before you circularize orbit and start thinking what you are going to use this for (remember to undock the cubic struts suborbital for a flush exterior without bits sticking out on the next load):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VpULLhv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VpULLhv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that picture in itself doesn\u0027t really shows the potential of the system, for that I have to show a couple other things, from fuel depots that are ever-expanding to massive transport motherships:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3S7sdTK.png\u0022 alt=\u00223S7sdTK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fAVposl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fAVposl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/34Ri8qr.png\u0022 alt=\u002234Ri8qr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as you can guess the possibilities are mostly limited by your imagination. I know \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E have been using the same fuel tank assembly for four updates now, and the last iteration of the nuclear drive pod is IMO a work of art: 11 parts, no fuel lines, and it still will draw fuel form any of the the three docking ports it has... (there are older iterations of the drive pods in the above pictures)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4HbIpyr.png\u0022 alt=\u00224HbIpyr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note on those, BTW. You can of course move them around, but I recommend using Navyfish\u0027s docking alignment indicator for that \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E, and doing it as little as possible. The problem is that if you dock them misaligned, you can pick up unwanted torques and rotations, and since you can\u0027t use gimballing due to the tractor nature of the system, it\u0027s bugs you even with very tiny misalignments unless you have plenty of reaction wheels to counteract. You can of course put them on the back with the front docking port, that\u0027s the main reason that 1.25-2.5m adaptor is there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course the Klaw pods add the ultimate docking flexibility: you can pull \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E if you drag it through its center of mass, and I don\u0027t think I have to show you how you can put one of the pods at the end of the adaptor. Plus, it\u0027s a very cute little subassembly with all the round edges and stuff, downright scary-looking when you reveal the Klaw next to a EVAing kerbal (for a proper sense of scale). Oh, and if the eagle-eyed among you notice they use the old size of reaction wheels, don\u0027t worry: I switched to the proper 1.25m ones when I revised the file for 0.25 compatibility and even more black and yellow diagonal strips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/AkabN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
