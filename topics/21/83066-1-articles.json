I don\u0027t follow the forums so I don\u0027t know if this has been done yet. It took a lot of tinkering with, but I was able to get it back with just enough fuel to do a successful suicide burn, since this has no parachute. Used countless amount of quick saves though... I didn\u0027t use mechjeb in the final test mission.
