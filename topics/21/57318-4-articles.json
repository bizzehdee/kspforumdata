Will you keep the current line of Munshine lifters intact? The reason I ask this is because many of the lifters just look \u0022cool\u0022 and using SLS style for everything wont be as fun.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a really good question. The fundamental design principle of the Munshine lifters has always been simplicity. We aim to create lifters that are light on parts and high on utility, shunning complicated staging in favor of putting your payloads into orbit with reliability and economy. This focus on function results in what I consider some very pleasing aesthetics, but those are secondary to the core strength of the Munshine family.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.23.5\u0027s improved joint rigidity will allow us to lighten our designs even more, especially where vertical \u0022stitching\u0022 is concerned. However, owing to our design principles, the SLS parts may well make a lot of our 50-tons and up designs obsolete. If a 3.75m two-stage SLS rocket can push 50\u002B tons to LKO at under twenty parts, that would blow an upgraded 60-ish part Munshine V out of the water by an amazing margin. So my current estimation is that no, we won\u0027t keep the current line intact. The lighter Skipper-based designs maybe, though the 2.5m SLS parts may render them obsolete as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course there\u0027s one increasingly important area of the game where the current Munshines could remain relevant: Career Mode. Assuming that the SLS parts will be quite high up the tech tree, the \u0022Low-Tech\u0022 variants of the Munshines will still be very viable designs. Looking forward to 0.24 I\u0027m hoping Munshine lifters will prove to be remarkably cheap too. And finally, there doesn\u0027t seem to be anything in the pipeline that will actually \u003Cem\u003Ebreak\u003C/em\u003E 0.23 craft so if you just want to keep using Munshines for their dashing good looks, there\u0027s nothing to stop you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wayfare","CreatedById":52072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T17:23:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Woopert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Woopert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh, and are there any areas I could help out with Munshine?
