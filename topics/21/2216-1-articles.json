I am currently developing a series of Stable Space-Craft/Jetty type of Planes. If you have any tip, idea, or guess of something that might add something more to any of the Releases, please, feel free to post down there. [glow=red,2,300]\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EOhh and, for the use of this Planes, you will need an edited S.A.S Module. One that allows you to let fuel go through the Module, no worries, i will post the download down there. Just copy the file to your \u0027Parts\u0027 directory, and Enjoy!\u003C/span\u003E[/glow]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first release is the \u003Cstrong\u003EGEAR Star Raider Jet-1\u003C/strong\u003E. It\u0027s very stable and easy to steer. When locking S.A.S On, it\u0027s pretty mutch like turning On the Auto-Pilot. I will be releasing different version of the Jet, ones that make him more fast, and others easier to steer. I will put the Download and a Image down there, since i\u0027m kinda newbie in this \u0027Forum\u0027 thing. Thanks! Leo, awaaaaaaayyyyy! |o/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGEAR Star Raider Jet-2 GL\u003C/strong\u003E (GL: Glidding Effect) it\u0027s up for download now! Hope you like, and give me some feedback on how you think you can improve the Jet. Beware that this Jet is mutch more \u0027Movement Sensitive\u0027 so... yeh... i think that says all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGEAR Blackbird Hunter F-14\u003C/strong\u003E up for download. This plane is very fast, and a little bit more difficult to steer than the Jet\u0027s, still, it\u0027s pretty easy. You can change the trusters order to whatever you want, so you can make the Fuel last longer. This plane is \u0027heavy\u0027, so keep in mind not to move very violently whily using the trusters at full. Leo, awaaaayyyyyy! |o/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGEAR Hawk-Eye KZ-6\u003C/strong\u003E can be downloaded above. Care for this plane, cuz it\u0027s got a hell of horse power. This plane is recommended for experience people, because if you try to turn violently with your trusters in max, or any near max power, this ship it\u0027s gonna \u0027puff\u0027 away from you. Beware, do not use maximum trust velocity while inside the Earth, it\u0027s very hard to steer the ship after that. I recommend you to just \u0027lock\u0027 the trajectory of the ship with the S.A.S Module right before launching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou can currently download C-7 Mods from here:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=1172.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=1172.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-08T21:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea but when you run out of fuel due to those badly placed SAS modules and dont have controllable fins... good luck gliding \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedShootLeo","CreatedById":48,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-08T21:14:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tought about that two, but somehow, it glides very good, i mean, if you turn on S.A.S in the desired position.
