I made the nose cones and nose cone adaptors fuel holding parts (with the same weight:capacity ratio as normal jet fuel tanks, it just looks better), and the intakes are modded to have a 2nd intake modulethat produces \u0022intakeAtmosphere\u0022 for use with an electric fan motor (not even used on the craft, so.... I close that 2nd module before takeoff, and they thus behave as stock intakes))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore tweaks to the design are needed, I will break the 40 ton threshhold and launch my Duna mission from it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T23:44:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot bad for a first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I would suggest. the wings could be moved back a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen balancing your Center of Lift, you should do it before putting the landing gear on.
