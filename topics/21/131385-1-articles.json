Maybe its the allure of a new challenge or the fact that my major is aerospace mechanics and I need to study.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless, I\u0027ve been looking into ways to make cheap, efficient, and\u00A0\u0022reusable\u0022 launch vehicles. My first initial thought was to asparagus stage everything, however in RSS this leads to large amounts of drag. I did some reading and came up with an engine dropping lifter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022img\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6KeAASk.png%5B/img\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b1YTL3v.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022b1YTL3v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nBUI0DI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022nBUI0DI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dub it the \u0022Delta I\u0022. Unfortunately, due to issues with mechjeb not recognizing the dropped engines as stages, I had to do some fun hand calculations. It has about 10k deltaV with a 5 ton payload attached; this means I can reach a 200-200km orbit if I time everything correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m more interested in what other people have built to accommodate reusability in RSS and RPO. I\u0027ve wanted to create a thread for awhile that showcases the most unique and efficient vehicles the community can design.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo please share!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-04T21:16:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2016 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by hikoriyami\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T01:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10k delta V with 5 ton payload?
