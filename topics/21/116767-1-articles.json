The stock flying Millennium Falcon has been ported to version 1.0.4 (the 0.90 version is also available). I\u0027ll let the craft speak for itself, all I can say is that it has been a great ride designing and testing the crap out of this ship, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Feel free to use it in any pictures/video, but just cite me as the designer.\n\nLatest updates and links to other Star Wars craft are on my [SHOWCASE](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/123914-showcase-pirate-space-industries-all-stock-designs-by-jolly-roger/) page.\n\nThe design didn\u0027t end up changing that much between version 0.90 and 1.0 - just the engines, antenna array and some gimbleys.\n\n![S4nQcK3.png](http://i.imgur.com/S4nQcK3.png)\n\nStill flies and shoots; jut doesn\u0027t get into orbit in V1.0.4.\n\n![e0C1m8H.png](http://i.imgur.com/e0C1m8H.png)\n\nI had to make some modifications for it to show up nicely in SketchFab\n\n[KSP YT1300](https://sketchfab.com/models/dc0e1843f34b44d394f6497adb84b460) by [Jolly Roger](https://sketchfab.com/jolly_roger) on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com)\n\n**Download the Millennium Falcon craft for KSP V1.0.5 -** \n\nNote: part count for this craft is 426\n\n* * *\n\nI created this video with the V0.90 version of the Falcon this time with music and proper editing - I\u0027m still working on another video for the latest version but I didn\u0027t want to wait to post the craft file so I will be coming out with another video later...\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/JPR6NeZ5TWI?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Download the Millennium Falcon craft for KSP V0.90 -** [**HERE**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nc46zzemb0lbs30/Millennium%20Falcon%200-90.craft?dl=0)\n\nNote: part count for this craft is 500\n\nJR\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-28T19:28:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2016 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jolly\\_Roger**"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T22:43:25Z","Content":"I guess it\u0027s star wars week up in here.

One of my goals in this game was to build a proper recreation, and I\u0027m happy with the result.

With this craft in particular, because it flies you need the performance. I\u0027m hoping V1.1 has some more optimization updates so I can capture some better video...\n\nJR"},{"CreatedByName":"lukethecoder64","CreatedById":148786,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T18:25:49Z","Content":"Mind = Blown\n\nAmazing replica! \u002Brep\n\nLuke"},{"CreatedByName":"Logan.Darklighter","CreatedById":7375,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T18:57:37Z","Content":"***KLONG!!!*** \\*\n\n(\\*Sound of jaw hitting deck concussively.)\n\nMy mind... it is BLOWN. \n\nHere - have some rep, you magnificent SOB! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Woksaus","CreatedById":148764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T19:09:48Z","Content":"Oooh, very pretty!

Not only does it fliy into orbit as an SSTO with 14 Kerbals on board, it\u0027s just a lot more fun to fly. Nothing against V1.0 I love the new additions to the game it\u0027s just that the areo in V0.90 is more entertaining to play around in.\n\nJR"},{"CreatedByName":"Woksaus","CreatedById":148764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T14:15:36Z","Content":"I like the way it handles, it\u0027s pretty maneuverable in atmosphere!"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T15:05:27Z","Content":"Congratulations!"},{"CreatedByName":"Lutheror","CreatedById":149092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T04:49:36Z","Content":"Woah!
