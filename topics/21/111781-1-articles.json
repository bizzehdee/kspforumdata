The real one has a cruise speed of 140m/s (507km/h).\n\nMass: 55t (a bit more than the real one)\n\nPart count: 490\n\nRequired mods: [77 Industries - R2800 Supercharged Radial Engine](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/879/77%20Industries%20R-2800%20Supercharged%20Radial%20Engine)\n\nand: [KAX](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/391/Kerbal%20Aircraft%20Expansion%20%28KAX%29)\n\nSuggested mod: [Take Command](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/776/Take%20Command)\n\nThe plane does not have a probe core.\n\nSuggestion: start the engines one by one (press action groups 1 to 4) with a few seconds in between. It will give a very rich sound!\n\nAction group 5: cockpit door.\n\nAction group 6: flaps.\n\nCargo doors, cabin doors and escape hatch don\u0027t work with action groups due to a bug in KSP 1.02.\n\nThe first seat is the flight engineer! Second and third are the pilot seats. I\u0027m not going to place all 55 seats again due to one ordering mistake!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T21:41:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Azimech**"},{"CreatedByName":"mariomario190","CreatedById":144932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:20:43Z","Content":"Nice!
