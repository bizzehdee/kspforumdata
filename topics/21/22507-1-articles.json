The mission could be fairly described as \u0022shambolic\u0022 and there were times when I despaired of ever making it home, but make it home I did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E For the first stage one needs to lower the throttle to 90% or 95% for at least part of the ascent; if one tries to go at 100% the whole way the rocket breaks apart\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E After first stage separation the rocket wobbles quite alarmingly; fortunately the SAS did its job, stabilising just in time for clearing the atmosphere and rotating to head due East\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Second stage separation is really quite beautiful, the three Rockmax stages drifting very slowly away in perfect symmetry\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Small burn at apokerb, just enough to lift perikerb out of the atmosphere, then munar transfer burn at perikerb\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E From a flyby trajectory I reversed thrust to get captured in a very high slow munar orbit, then bi-elliptic transfer to a low fast circular one (~400k), then just slowly burned into a descent. The ship has more than enough fuel for this but I was surprised how much I used; is there a more efficient way to land on an airless body?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E For this particular rocket one probably needs to choose a landing site facing directly towards Kerbin\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E I couldn\u0027t fit legs below the nuke, so instead came up with the crazy plan of descending under nuclear power to ~0, separating just above the surface (ideally low enough to then land on legs without needing to do a burn). In the event I misjudged it, separating at ~1500m when the actual surface was below 500m, and burned from my return stage for a ~3m/s descent. Had I got this right, the return might have been a lot easier\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The triumph of actual landing was short-lived, both because I wasn\u0027t sure if I could get home and because the ladder didn\u0027t reach the surface...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Full power on the ascent, switching off as soon as I\u0027m sure I\u0027m free of the Mun and heading for Kerbin. Or rather, past Kerbin\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E A cock-up with the time controls meant I did an extra Munar flyby before any more thrusting. In retrospect, I suspect this was rather fortunate.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E By now I\u0027ve got about 1/6th of a tank and my orbit goes no closer than 4Mm. I wait patiently for apokerb, doing a long minimum-power burn for maximum efficiency trying to ellipticise my orbit enough to get home. As the fuel supply dwindles away, a crazy thought takes hold; I minutely adjust my course, and I allow myself a little hope to counter the despair as the tank runs dry with perikerb still at 400km altitude.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E I circle once... I circle twice... and then the Mun is there and my flyby is everything I had dreamed of and more. The already narrow orbit becomes almost a straight line, perikerb down to 46km.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E I remember with a hint of worry that the atmosphere ends at about 35km up, but fortune favours me once more. Metre by metre my orbit becomes a descent, and all that\u0027s left to do is open the parachute at 1km for a gentle splashdown only a few hundred kilometers from the space center\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably routine for you guys, but I felt very pleased to have made it back from the Mun on just an LV-909 with a partially filled FL-T200, even if it did require two gravitational assists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext mission: Dun, I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?j6khdqv4hdpd66o\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?j6khdqv4hdpd66o\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bc6mRh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bc6mRh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eBy3A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eBy3A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7YBleh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227YBleh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-18T21:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, congratulations on making your first trip to Mun and back. It took me a while to get there at first, but when I did... it was a good feeling indeed. As you say, it is pretty much routine for me. In fact, I\u0027m currently testing out a heavy lander design that I hope to publish to my Shipyards here on the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Secondly, I couldn\u0027t help but notice that you said you\u0027d try for Duna next. I highly recommend you get at least a few more Mun missions under your belt, as well as a Minmus mission. It\u0027s good practice to project your orbit into an encounter, and Minmus will teach you about intercepting at non-horizontal inclinations. If you feel that you can and want to go to Duna, then I\u0027m not stopping you, but practice makes perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ll give you a tip though; You want Duna to be about 60 degrees ahead of Kerbin before you put yourself into a Solar orbit. That should ensure the best chance of encountering the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish you good luck on your future missions!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
