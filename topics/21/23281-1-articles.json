However, my guys are in need of a rover to drive, and I have failed to incorporate one into the existing vessel without making it a mess to fly and hurting its capabilities...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve attempted to build an unmanned vessel for a one-way mission to deliver the rover to whichever place the main ship is going... But the task is really tedious and frustrating. Just making the rover symmetric without using a week to build it seems almost impossible... I guess there are mods that could help with this? Thus, I am asking you to help me build a rover that can carry 1 or 2 kerbalnauts and that can with its delivery vehicle reach and land any of those Kerbol system bodies that have no atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve decided to test the whole 3-ship system first with a mission to Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus points if its easy enough to control/has enough margin of error to land in one piece and within walking distance, 0-2 km, of the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: I\u0027d love to have an unmanned, preferably stock, kerbalnaut-carrying, rover and its delivery vehicle that can preferably reach Jool.
