Currently there is 2 fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of this is to slow down the rocket so it can land somewhere, and if there is enough fuel, also use it later to lets say return to earth. (i might need to add an extra tank, 2 tanks for 3 engines isnt probably enough)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Starts the 3 solid boosters attached in the \u0027spaces\u0027 between the liquid engines (the closer-to-center positions of the tri coupler). These boosters extend a bit farther than the liquid engines and have the landing winglets (many of em) attached to them (i found this to be a nice way to do it, no radial decouplers for winglets now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). Theres also a second set of boosters above these boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are used to escape the muns gravity. I hope theyre enough as i have no idea of how much power is needed to escape...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Detaches the first 3 boosters (and the winglets that were attached to those) and starts the second ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Detaches the second set of boosters, leaving with only the main liquid engines that were started in stage 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Detaches the liquid engines and stuff leaving only the command pod and a single RCS tank\u002Bsome thrusters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI attached de lander... No rocket yet, but the lander seems to work ok-ish on earths (kerbin?) surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Saaur","CreatedById":4298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-13T16:36:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWOW that\\\u0027s some overkill!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get off the mun with just RCS if your lander is of a reasonable size (yours isn\\\u0027t).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waterlimon","CreatedById":16829,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-13T16:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYe but i wanted a big one :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough im not able to steer it at all in atmosphere, i think i put too many winglets there to soften the impact \u0026gt;_\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
