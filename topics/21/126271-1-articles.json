I am official in any way, shape, or form. If you\u0026#39;re unhappy with my decision, we can work something out. This is just my opinion, since there\u0026#39;s no objective way to judge \u0022Quality\u0022 of crafts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf anyone feels that their craft is missed because of any kind of time-zone difference, or any kind of difference in when spacecraft fridays is put up, tell me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf your craft is really good and was made before, and someone posts in it within that week, then it will be considered.

Flies great! Great looks! Easy to land too, but won\u0026#39;t take off from water with full tanks and that\u0026#39;s why it was uploaded with only one quarter filled. Stacking the Juno\u0026#39;s is a great way to overcome their static performance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[HR][/HR][B][CENTER][SIZE=4]\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeaplane Experimental S-EX 1 - selfish meme[/SIZE][/CENTER]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/smbjbb1.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother sea plane, I like this one because of it\u0026#39;s looks as well and the fantastic STOL capability - it nearly takes off at 25 m/s - from the tarmac.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[HR][/HR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[CENTER][SIZE=4][B]Transforming Shuttle - stardog573[/B][/SIZE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/f8MKvqo.png[/IMG][/CENTER]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI really like the concept on this one. It\u0026#39;s very kerbal because in this form it wouldn\u0026#39;t make it in real life, and that\u0026#39;s a compliment. I managed to get it into orbit, dock the rear and ... crashed it because the little amount of liqued fuel left wasn\u0026#39;t routed to the rapiers and the CoM was such that a nose up descent wasn\u0026#39;t possible. So I like the concept although I\u0026#39;m not sure about the payload fraction - more than a simple satellite is probably not possible at this time, and it needs just a little more work.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[HR][/HR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[CENTER][SIZE=4][B]Scott Manley class - zekes[/B][/SIZE][/CENTER]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nUGHUaf.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nInspiring and mysterious, like the best designs from the late nineties in titles like Descent Freespace. I tried it and ... couldn\u0026#39;t do anything with it except hyperedit it to space, my slideshow prevented me from really testing it but I think it\u0026#39;s obviously a good ship.
