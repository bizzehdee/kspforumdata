If a craft has KerpPaint modules but none of its parts are actually painted then it \u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E consider it a KerbPaint craft. I may need to do something like this for TweakScale aswell, to check if parts are actually re-scaled or not (but I need to understand more about how it changes the parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still need to add support for NEAR, but I need a craft that uses NEAR so I can poke around in it and see what modules NEAR adds. If one of you guys could upload a NEAR craft to the site and tell me so I can use it as a point of reference, that would great and would save me some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck your craft and let me know if you think any have been incorrectly marked as mod craft now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Wanderfound, your craft where the most effected by the changes, but I\u0027m fairly sure they\u0027re correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE - If you have the list of mods or the details info shown in the text (using the [mods] or [details] KerbDown syntax) they may not reflect the changes in the text as the text is only reprocessed when you edit it. If the mod list in the text is different to the one shown from the link in the header then just edit the text widget that has the mod or details info, ensure you change the text slightly (just add a space) so it thinks the content has changed and saves the page. Then the info in the text should be updated correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T02:02:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust deployed several fixes and some minor features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain functionality addition is that there is now a search interface on the mods, parts and users pages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also further improved the performance of the crafts search, that should be really quite quick now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve realised a problem with the PartMapper, it is mistaking a number of things for parts including modules and agencies. The result is a lot more \u0022parts\u0022 being listed on the site than there really are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI shall update the part mapper and then I\u0027m going to do a purge of all parts that are not currently associated with any craft. That will mean a big drop in the knowledge base part list, but it will pick up again pretty quickly. (this won\u0027t effect any currently uploaded craft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I do that, would those of you who have uploaded part-maps mind if I email you and ask if you could re-upload your partmaps? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also realised a dumb mistake I made in the detection of FAR. I made it so that craft with FAR modules got linked with a mod called FAR, not \u0027FerramAerospaceResearch\u0027, so there are two mods in the system which should be one and the same. That will be easy to fix thou and the only effect will be the change of name in some crafts mod lists.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
