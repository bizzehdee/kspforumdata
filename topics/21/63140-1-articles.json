It has enough DV in the main lifter to get to 300KM and a bit beyond \u0026lt;how far beyond is unknown as 300km was my target\u0026gt; Would advise if so inclined to first quick save when it coasts to its insertion burn, then stage out into its orbital insertion stage, that stage has more than enough to handle the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. IF you have Unbreakable joints on, this is the time to use the 0 action group and cut the explosive bolts, it will allow the debris to re-enter the atmosphere and self clean, if NOT using Unbreakable, disregard this tip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You should have ENOUGH fuel on the orbital insertion/orbital ops package to fuel up the 4 pylon fuel tanks.
