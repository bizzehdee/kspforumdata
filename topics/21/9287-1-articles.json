I found a description of something called \u0027Ed Keith\\\u0027s Innovative Asparagus-Stalk Booster\u0027 in Tom Logsdon\\\u0027s \u0027Orbital Mechanics: Theory and Applications\u0027 (1998). BTW, if you want to learn the maths and rocket sciences, this is a fun textbook.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, Ed Keith developed a concept that might be familiar to many of your designs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) seven cylindrical rockets mated side-by-side\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) all seven engines burning in parallel at lift-off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease see attached photo of page 144 of the textbook.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, he also proposed automatically pumping propellant from some of the rockets first, so two of the rockets could be discarded as soon as possible, followed by the next two, and so on, until you are left with the center rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this may not be new to some of you, but I thought I would take it to the next level with some comparisons of two comparable 21-tank designs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[list type=decimal]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]\u0027Simple\u0027 design with an inner-core of 3 fuel tanks and the gimbled liquid engine; the outer six boosters have 3 fuel tanks each, and the LV-T30 liquid engines. Core and boosters are activated immediately upon launch for max thrust; the outer boosters are expended at approximately 187 seconds of full-throttle. The core expends shortly thereafter, at approximately 214 seconds of full-throttle. Average Thrust/Mass is 31.29 for 215 seconds. [/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]\u0027Asparagus\u0027 design with same configuration, except fuel-lines added to pump fuel from boosters 1 and 4 to boosters 2 and 5; from boosters 2 and 5 to boosters 3 and 6, and from 3 and 6 to the inner core. The first two boosters are empty and can be dropped at about 55 seconds, the next stage at about 131 seconds, and the last boosters at about 262 seconds. Then you have the core, with all its fuel, still available for about another 214 seconds of full-throttle. Average Thrust/Mass is 22.99 for 476 seconds.[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the proper comparison of spacecraft performance? If I multiply the average thrust/mass times the duration, the Asparagus is 162% of the simple design. All from adding 6 fuel lines and some more-complicated staging! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (see attached .pdf for graphs)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I tested the two designs with MechJeb set to ascend to KSO orbit, about 2870km. The \u0027simple\u0027 design without fuel lines and more than two-stages used about 98% of the fuel to get to KSO. By comparison, the \u0027asparagus\u0027 design only used about 84% of the fuel. \u003Cstrong\u003EMore than six times as much fuel remaining - much more efficient!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[table]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign\u003C/strong\u003E[/td][td]\u003Cstrong\u003EStarting Fuel\u003C/strong\u003E[/td][td]\u003Cstrong\u003EEngines\u003C/strong\u003E[/td][td]\u003Cstrong\u003EFuel Remaining in KSO (~2870km)\u003C/strong\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]Simple[/td][td]21 x FL-T500[/td][td](1) LV-T45\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(6) LV-T30[/td][td]\u0026lt;0.5 FL-T500[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]Asparagus[/td][td]21 x FL-T500[/td][td](1) LV-T45\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(6) LV-T30[/td][td]~3.4 FL-T500[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/table]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA .pdf comparison chart of Thrust and Mass is attached, along with screenshots of Keo-synchronous orbit.
