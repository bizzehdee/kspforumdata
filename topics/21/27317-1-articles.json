Part count clocks in ~400 or so, but most of that is redundant struts and my laptop handles it just fine on launch tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasic instructions -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Group 0 (zero) toggles the gimbles on the outer stages. Tap twice after launch for a smoother ride.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Start your gravity turn after the second stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- RCS is there to help you make your circ burn on time. 180 tons is a lot to turn on just cockpit gyros. You can also use it a bit if you see you\u0027re having any trouble with your gravity turn, though I didn\u0027t see it did much there. Plenty of mono fuel for both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have about 400 dV worth of wiggle room for manual launches. I\u0027ve tested with 180 tons at both 75km and 100km, and 190 tons at 80km. Complies with the Clean Space Act regulations, you should have another 400 dV left for a de-orbit burn after dropping your load, just get it done before the batteries run out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?k2pu1isiuo3efi1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMammoth SHLV\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s22.postimg.org/7m9nmo2qp/2013_05_17_00003.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013_05_17_00003.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s13.postimg.org/hhrd14ax3/2013_05_17_00002.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013_05_17_00002.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubassembly and Payloader ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb launch stats - set max altitude at 75 to 100 km, start gravity turn at 12, end at 69, 40 percent curve.
