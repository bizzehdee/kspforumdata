Didn\u0027t visit other planets yet, barely had 2 mil funds stocked up, and I\u0027ve concluded that sending one way crafts would be expensive and hard to get into atmosphere with my current tech level, and with big lifters being too expensive. So I decided to make a reusable return Starship that can refuel in Orbit. This is my first attempt at something like this ever (Since I only ever play career mode), so here is my progress so far, and how I planned it to look like:\n\n![cguwA3.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img538/5687/cguwA3.jpg)\n\nThis is what I have built so far, the base in orbit, and the side docking ports for Nuclear Engines and liquid fuel tanks. A Duna lander/return craft is also ready and docked in this picture.\n\n![sMDGup.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img537/129/sMDGup.jpg)\n\nThis is how I hope it will look like when I finish it. With all these Nerv Engines, it has around 0.25 TWR, and a total of 7000 Delta/v with a 25 ton payload (Approximate weight of the Duna lander)\n\n![MER9iN.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img633/4038/MER9iN.jpg)\n\nHere comes the tricky part for me, this is how the engine part (One out of 12) looks like, and currently I\u0027m having trouble lifting it into Orbit. Its mass is completely uneven, and has a lot of drag. The Mk2 fairing can\u0027t close up the entire thing, and I haven\u0027t yet unlocked fairings Mk3, but even so I don\u0027t know if fairings help with uneven mass (I\u0027m guessing no).\n\nSo if you have any suggestions how to get these things into the orbit, any advice is welcome.\n\n![G48PFO.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img673/2100/G48PFO.jpg)\n\nThis is the look of my tech tree at the time of building/designing this vessel.\n\nThanks for viewing"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T03:23:29Z","Content":"I can see lots of better ways to do it but none that don\u0027t involve a complete overhaul (which would involve relaunch) of your vessel.\n\nMy best suggestion is to build the mk2 fuel segments with docking ports on one side and stack them right up against the main body, like this:\n\n![a4JcSFI.png](http://i.imgur.com/a4JcSFI.png)\n\nIf you empty that section 75-80%, it has a 0.85 TWR on launch. Once you get higher up and burn some fuel, you can get a 1.0 TWR (not that it will matter by that time). I didnt but you can shove a probe core, SAS unit, and monoprop tank on top of the adapter before the nose cone.\n\nEDIT: didnt explain why.\n\nYour current config is gonna wobble around because your girder bracings do nothing. Parts do not collide with other parts on the same vessel in KSP. My suggestion involves a multi-dock, which is harder to do but much much sturdier. It also provides you roughly the same overall fuel and less engine mass (8 Nervs are more than enough for that but don\u0027t expect super-quick burns).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T03:25:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 03:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra**"},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T04:31:01Z","Content":"Awww, they don\u0027t collide? Well, might as well scrap it now then. Trial and failure I guess. I\u0027ll actually just leave it in orbit and re-purpose it as a refueling station xD Or move it to the Mun to serve that purpose.\n\nI actually did try to place them up right at first, but had some placing issues. I\u0027ll give it another go. The craft you did looks lean and nice, however I still can\u0027t get it into Orbit in one piece (Even the side engines by themselves). I\u0027ll try grinding some more science and cash, and in the meantime I might try a non-return trip to Duna just so I don\u0027t have to wait as long.\n\nAnd double docking is... Surprisingly obvious, I feel stupid now. Thanks a lot.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T04:48:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 04:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Unfawkable**"},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T14:59:44Z","Content":"Okay, I still can\u0027t figure out how to build this thing, the attachment points are driving me crazy.

When you drag around the collection of parts, the fuselage is the root of that section so you can only attach by it. There are two solutions.\n\n1) build the section by itself, attach a probe core on top of the docking port, and re-root the craft to the probe core. Then grab the entire section, now treed as \u0027docking port-radial attach point-fuselage\u0027, and turn it into a subassembly you can then grab later and slap onto the mothership.\n\n2)build off the docking port on your mothership, starting with the docking port, then radial point, then fuselage.\n\nAlso, pro tip: standard clamp-o-tron docking ports will radially attach just fine, no radial attach point required."},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T15:13:31Z","Content":"Also had that problem with disappearing nodes while detaching in Editor ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nSome Suggestions: \n\n- Build in symmetry mode.\n- Start the radial stuff after the docking port with another docking port.\n- Use duct tape to tighten up that weak and wobbely docking ports.\n- Keep an eye on the center of mass to not shift to some side.\n- Cross your fingers!
