It has not been tested with a paylod heavier than 3 tons as that is as much mass I could reasonably fit inside the short cargo bay of the orbiter. It is also capable of flying completely unmanned Like the real life Buran.I advise that you to do your gravity turn in the craft towards the east as the is more landmass to the east which makes aborting a more viable option and presents more area for the boosters to land.\n\nAction Groups\n\n1- Toggles maneuvering engine on the orbiter\n\n2- Toggles cargo bay\n\n0- lowers landing legs on the boosters\n\nAbort- Detaches the orbiter From the boosters and deactivates all of the engines\n\n**Flight Instructions**\n\nLaunch\n\n1. Activate SAS and stage.\n\n2. Hold an upward attitude(It will have a tendency to pitch forward initially which is slightly stronger than the on board SAS).\n\n3. At approx 5 km the radial booster will run out at which point you hit 0 and stage.\n\n4. At 7-10 km depending on your payload you will begin a gravity turn by pitching it onto it\u0027s back.\n\n5. once the desired apoapsis is reached or the central booster runs out you stage again which will separate the booster.\n\n6. activate maneuvering engines on orbiter and circularize orbit.\n\n7. switch back to central booster then stage it and deploy the landing legs\n\n8. Wait for it to land and hope it landed on solid ground:)\n\nReturning very similar to landing most other space planes although do note that it is not the most maneuverable plane by any means.\n\nI would also recommend using [Kerbal engineer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-0-25-0-90-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-2-12%280-25%29-and-v1-0-15-2%280-90%29) or a similar mod in order to see your \n\napoapsis in the fight view.\n\nsome pics of the Kuran.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
