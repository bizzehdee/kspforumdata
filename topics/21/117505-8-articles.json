Top speed so far 35m/s, so here are some beauty shots.\n\n![eKaCdTA.png](http://i.imgur.com/eKaCdTA.png)\n\n![ouAIQhj.png](http://i.imgur.com/ouAIQhj.png)\n\nYou can see the crater I came out of behind the rover\n\n![qG2BoKR.png](http://i.imgur.com/qG2BoKR.png)\n\nJust after the roll, just lost the roofs, didn\u0027t even undock, the self righting system helped stop the roll\n\n![jzeVPCn.png](http://i.imgur.com/jzeVPCn.png)\n\nThe image is centered on the rover looking south, not much further to the end of the valley.\n\n![FDyhmwB.png](http://i.imgur.com/FDyhmwB.png)\n\nSo I could have gone straight south instead of going to the lowest part of the crater rim first and then turning south for the valley mouth.

Good to remember, leave base and head 180 degrees south to get to pathfinder.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-11T23:07:19Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2015 11:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by selfish\\_meme**"},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T14:41:53Z","Content":"This is awesome that you guys are doing this all stock, but if we could also make a modded version with KIS and TAC life support, along with some mod allowing us to grow crops in the hab, we would have a truly interactive story.

The batteries in KSP last about 5 to 10 minutes, so I need RTG\u0027s to make them last longer, so you can get an hours drive, then recharge. Overall I don\u0027t want people to have to drive the rover too long it can be a bit boring. That was my longest rover trip to date, just to get to pathfinder. The leg to get to the DAV is currently three times that.\n\nEdit: after getting past 10 minutes the urge to do donuts or something equally stupid faded.

We cannot use any part of pathfinder to complete the journey, it\u0027s only symbolic. That may be true now, but in the future with 1.1 we are going to have ranged antennae. This means the DAV and Pathfinder will have the only antennae that can talk to Kerbin or a satellite in space. So? Well I am thinking ahead to when maybe this scenario involves tasks (contracts) and information is provided via radio (maps maybe?).\n\nSo what do you guys think, keep the pathfinder side trip or leave it out for now?"},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderSpock","CreatedById":147594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T23:33:52Z","Content":"Keep it"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T00:40:00Z","Content":"Actually it could be optional as long as there is a couple of hours more than the quickest short trip before the launch window, which you can timewarp through."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T15:00:40Z","Content":"So I made it, trouble is no anomaly.
