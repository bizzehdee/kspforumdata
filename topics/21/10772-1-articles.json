Yeah, it\\\u0027d be easier if I weren\\\u0027t so OCD about landing gear placement, or if the gear were just a little longer, but as it is, it\\\u0027s either adding canards up front to provide a naturally lifting nose, or wait until your engines won\\\u0027t smash into the ground. The C7 SAS helps with a gradual accent though. Your little fighter handles a lot better than this though.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E On performance, I found it lacking!\n\u003E \n\u003E Difficult too land/take-off, VERY lazy too turn, always needed too fall off the runway too take off, sensitive too land!\n\u003E \n\u003E Always found myself ripping the engines off...\n\u003E \n\u003E Still was fun, an VERY Kerbal like...

It seems they tweaked the atmosphere again, or maybe the official wings vs. the original mod\\\u0027s wings, but this plane used to handle a little better (not much), but my X-31 clone is no longer able to perform the Herbst maneuver, it just goes into a series of Kulbit\\\u0027s."},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T16:38:56Z","Content":"Make sure to test this plane at higher altitudes, guys, the engines on it aren\\\u0027t meant for low altitude flight."},{"CreatedByName":"Cezary","CreatedById":5396,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T23:13:09Z","Content":"Outstanding design.
