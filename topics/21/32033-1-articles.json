I\u0027ve been staring at my own creations for so long I\u0027ve forgotten what else might exist out in the world of other peoples designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut first, here is the station I designed and refined down into two parts (not including the fuel tanks which were the most troublesome to get up there with fuel in them), 8 rendezvous launches later we have....The KSS Achaea!

Those are my prototype Kethane rovers Mk1 and Mk2. The Mk1 is using a serious ton of direct port RCS valves on the under side to compensate for its \u0022rear first\u0022 landing method which will involve what I expect to be a pretty violent last minute nose down. At any rate! I\u0027m dying for some inspiration on how to improve on these designs, the rovers aren\u0027t practical at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a better picture of the rover in the VAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d20/GateCrasherVI/screenshot92_zpsb19442f9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot92_zpsb19442f9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has any pointers or ideas they\u0027d like to share I would greatly appreciate the input. I\u0027d like to avoid just scavenging other peoples designs. I was hoping to just get a bit of input / reference illustrations about my design if anyone sees something that to their eyes is obviously going to be trouble for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh! I might add that the launch vehicle \u002B whatever I\u0027m putting up into space has been on average around 375 parts.... I need a much more part efficient launch vehicle.
