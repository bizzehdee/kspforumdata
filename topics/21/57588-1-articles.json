As you may know, the Jebi and the Kith have recently broken out in war. There have been multiple shows of superweapons including the one I\u0027m showing you today. Of course this is a miniature version, but it does work! With over 500 parts, it won\u0027t even lag your komputer. This replica includes opening ion cannons that have knocko- I mean realistic ion drives inside. This ship is powered by many RTGs and a small probe. It has a very nice acceleration, at about .2 m/s!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for no pictures yet, haven\u0027t gotten around to doing that.
