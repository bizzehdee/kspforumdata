I expect us to lose the occasional ship to the terrain tearing issue on Minmus, but we\\\u0027ll take that risk I guess.\n\nI\\\u0027ve made a few changes to the rules to try and make things more fun and limit the delays between turns, please take a look at them and make sure you\\\u0027re clear on them. I think it will help overall, but please suggest changes if there\\\u0027s anything that would be fairer without being a nightmare to keep track of!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E sal\\_vager - StarSpark II SSTO - Abandoned Launch Facility(1) - Kerbin\n\u003E \n\u003E sjwt - Star01 - Targuete(1) - Mun\n\u003E \n\u003E trbinsc - Minimus - Eceron Station(1)\n\u003E \n\u003E Apotheosist - Mun - Targuete(2)\n\u003E \n\u003E basbr - Mun - Targuete(3)\n\u003E \n\u003E khyron42 - Mun - Targuete(4)\n\u003E \n\u003E sal\\_vager - Minimus - Eceron Station(2)\n\u003E \n\u003E Newt0570 - Minimus - Eceron Station(3)\n\u003E \n\u003E Salda007 - Minimus - Eceron Station(4)\n\u003E \n\u003E Apotheosist - Minimus - Eceron Station(5)\n\u003E \n\u003E khyron42 - Kerbin - Abandoned Launch Facility(2)\n\u003E \n\u003E Tim\\_Barrett - Minimus - Eceron Station(6)\n\u003E \n\u003E Salda007 - Abandoned Launch Facility(3)\n\u003E \n\u003E zekes - Abandoned Launch Facility(4)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nIn Progress:\n\nApotheosist - not chosen yet..\n\n\\*new bases accepted at Kerbin Mun Minimus\n\nUpcoming Flights:\n\nStogas - Minimus - Eceron Station(6)\n\nNutt007 - Mun - Targuete(5)\n\nSalda007 - Mun - not chosen yet\n\nIf you are defining a new landing site on your turn, after landing I recommend that you submit it as a place name to the [Kerbin Geographic Society](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=11388.100) thread over in General Discussion.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1. All flights must be flown with the latest KSP build, Presently KSP 0.15, no mods\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. All flights must be requested in advance, to be added to the upcoming flight List. You need to specify additional details:\n\u003E \n\u003E  - If you plan to add to a craft one of the existing bases, specify which base your flight is planned for.\n\u003E \n\u003E  - If there is no base yet on your target planet/moon, or if the existing base already has at least 5 craft landed there, you can specify \u0027new \u003Cplanet moon=\u0022\u0022\u003E base.\u0027 Land at a location of your choice, and provide the name for the new base when you post your save. Exceptions to the 5 craft rule can be made if a landing site is too hard or too laggy before there 5 craft there.\u003C/planet\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  - Instead of launching a new craft you can plan to move one of your existing ones from one base to another. Specify \u0027\u003Cbase name=\u0022\u0022\u003E to \u003Cbase name=\u0022\u0022\u003E transfer\u0027 on your flight request.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. I\\\u0027ll send you a PM and post in the thread when it\\\u0027s your turn to go. If you see that the person before you in the queue has posted their save file and I haven\\\u0027t gotten the notice out to you yet, definitely go ahead and start your mission!\n\u003E \n\u003E 4. At the end of your flight please post your persistent.sfs file as well a picture of the base.\n\u003E \n\u003E 5. If you do not post a file within 48 hours, you get bumped down one spot on the list. If you do this twice, you are removed from the list and must request a new entry.\n\u003E \n\u003E 6. If you screw up, you can try again in the same turn, but cannot get an extension on the 48 hours. If you\\\u0027re unable to fly and notify me ahead of the 48 hours it will help keep things moving along for everyone else, but rule 5\\\u0027s \u0027two reschedules deletes you from the list\u0027 will still apply.\n\u003E \n\u003E 8.
