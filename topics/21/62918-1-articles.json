In the center you can see the node module with the upwards-facing cupola, and connected to it are a fuel module (the big red), a hab module (the one with the antennas), the lab module, connected to it an obsolete Mk I Shuttle (lacking atmospheric propulsion, I kept it for servicing this airless moon), and behind the tank you can barely see the pressurised rover capable of hunting for biomes with a full science suite, and below it the construction rover you use to move modules around. To show a bit about how the base is actually put together, suffice to say this is how you manage to move full big reds on the upright position, and handle regular base supply on a fully stock game (I personally refuel on a not-supplied custom kethane module). Basically, you put the construction rover under the landed modules, and if necessary add stability with the pressurised one to drive it to a docking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/CnqzLwF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CnqzLwF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CnqzLwF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, that would be the basic one, with one module of each. And how would you expand on it? Well, doubling on the non-science modules (of which you only need one copy) can\u0027t hurt, and it\u0027s what I did on MunBase:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/erEwBfY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/erEwBfY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022erEwBfY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo Habs, two Nodes, two Fuel Dumps, and the single lab and pressurised rover (two construction rovers, though). Plus my personal kethane module, as you will see in the pictures, and with the same obsolete shuttle and KAS parts, but you get the idea on how the boundless expansion works, right? You always end up with open ports, and the different configurations are endless. The pressurised rover, BTW, is equipped with rocket engines and fuel, not only for short hops on low gravities, but also to be able to refuel the shuttle from the base tanks. In a stock way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E (If you aren\u0027t a good enough pilot to try to dock it to the base, which few are, that\u0027s very very handy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ok, that\u0027s all fine and dandy... but just how exactly do you land those modules? You seriously have a dedicated launcher for each?\u0022 ... I hear you think. Well, this is where the \u0022two different building methods\u0022 comment applies. I should have said \u0022delivery methods\u0022, actually. See, I first built a rocket to launch a bunch of modules in one go. A very ugly, jumbled together rocket, with excess delta-v, and upper stage that doubled as universal skycrane and could be refuelled, and ugly as sin. It sometimes fails spectacularly during liftoff even! Very kerbal. That is how I built Munbase in three launches, two of the file I labelled \u0022Base Basic Pack\u0022, which has the Node, Hab, Fuel Dump, and construction rover; and one launch with the \u0022Base Science\u0022 file, which carried the lab module and the pressurised rover. Pretty functional, and it did the job. It is expedient and I anticipate it will be the most used one. This is the biggest thing to launch of the files I provide, and paradoxically the easiest way to expand bases, because quickload and exploding runaway boosters are cheap in KSP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/L6W7XEj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L6W7XEj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L6W7XEj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, once I got that to work (mostly), I started to get fancy. I though to myself this may be a very convenient way to set up a test munar base, but it would be a very big bother to, say, resupply one on Laythe. You would have to refuel it a lot of times to get the modules there, including on Laythe orbit, and end up with too many copies of one module and not enough of others. No, the best way to go about this would be a single-stage skycrane, that could accept any kind of module, especially a Fuel Dump, and deliver it (relying heavily on orbital refuel, I\u0027m not that crazy) to \u003Cem\u003Eany place where you could ever want a base\u003C/em\u003E. Tall order, and I knew before I started that I wouldn\u0027t be able to get Eve and Tylo in there. But I did manage to get a skycrane that can lift either a big red partly fuelled, or two of the other modules, form kerbin to orbit in a single stage. And it looks awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/6BnKiOM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6BnKiOM.png\u0022 alt=\u00226BnKiOM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis here is the \u0022Skycrane\u0022 file, and it could deserve its own post by itself. Its alternate configuration you will have to build yourself from the other files, one with the Hub\u002BHab\u002BRover bundle (which weights pretty much the same as this light lab\u002Bpressurised rover pack), and the other with a Fuel Dump. Fun fact: it does not, in fact, have T/W\u0026gt;1 on jet engines, you need to turn on the spikes to lift off after you spool up the jet engines. Once you get to 2000m, toggling on and off the spikes to remain under terminal velocity, turn them off and turn the nukes on: they have higher isp by then and are enough to keep accelerating slowly. From then on airhog your way to just-before flameout as you would with another SSTO, then its away with the jet engines and in with the aerospikes. Complicated as boop, but it works beautifully. It\u0027s either a rocket-assisted airbreathing SSTO skycrane, or an airbreathing-assisted rocket skycrane. In any case, it looks cool with that trilateral symmetry and clean lines for such a big clearance for payloads, and it can drop any of the three bundles in any place with atmosphere (and many without it), and make it back to orbit from all but Eve and Tylo. A feat, IMO, and it means I could slap the \u0022reusable\u0022 sticker on this. Oh, it\u0027s equipped with a universal docking port, BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, that makes three files out of six. The other three? Well, two are the other bundles you can take with the skycrane (Hab\u002BHub\u002BConstructin Rover, and Fuel Dump), only mounted in a much more reasonable 50mT parallel-staging crossfed rocket. What other would call \u0022asparagus staging\u0022. To save a lot of time and lag, and to keep on reusing the same skycrane to drop modules on an expanding base. Also, they are the perfect file to get any of the individual modules to convert into a subassembly or modify. Convenient, right? Something had to be! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last but not least, this should definitely get its own post, but I am giving it away with the pack just so you have all the pieces together. A six kerbal, VTOL, airbreathing SSTO with enough delta-v under rocket power to SSTO from Duna and capable of docking to the base modules or be refuelled by the pressurised rover... ladies, gents, and kerb, I present the \u0022Heinlein\u0022.

As to assembly in the field, I have tried messing with leg suspensions, and they help to slightly tilt modules (to raise or lower the target docking port as neccesary), but usually the real trick is to use the pressurized rover also, not only the construction one. That way you have a very stable contraption, and you can push hard enough to tilt the target module, maybe even make it jump. Sometimes you can even play with raising and lowering landing legs, to make things jump... the docking ports have a tendency to line up perfectly on the way down due to the magnetic force. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, lots of quicksaving to avoid \u0022accidents\u0022, and a bit of luck, and even the most recalcitrant modules will see the wisdom of hooking up with a bit of patience.
