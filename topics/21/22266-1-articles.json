Its a little tricky to launch tho it has JUST enough fuel to achieve about 98km(ish) orbit and then a de-orbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo solve the tank/weight/spent fuel/flipping problem, I staged four Mark 55 radial mount liquid engines to go off in pairs to compensate for the balance being thrown off. They need to be fired at the right time (not too early) to maintain center of thrust. Be sure to dump ALL stages BEFORE the large tanks completely run out of fuel. Should be during your burn to circularize orbit. You can use whats left to start the burn just make sure RCS is on and you kill it when those tanks are dry. Do NOT attempt to thrust with the radial engines attached after you dump the tanks. Not only is it uncontrollable but it will leave you without enough fuel for re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be posting a video of the launch and return at some point. I understand that this ship dosen\u0027t really serve a purpose yet tho I hope in future releases it will be able to carry things to orbit. Also, PLEASE feel free to edit/improve/make suggestions on this design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/uRdUk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/uRdUk\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edownload:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?aknjd9um2ck7lp4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?aknjd9um2ck7lp4\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fuflang","CreatedById":18629,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T21:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.
