The one that came out looks a little like an F-14. Its good fun to fly, pretty quick and responsive. Really easy to take off, it will jump off the tarmac before the first set of chevron thingys at the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=34896\u0026amp;d=1350478596\u0022 alt=\u0022attachment.php?attachmentid=34896\u0026amp;d=1350478596\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know how to host .craft files yet but it is simple enough to put together, just used 2 delta wings with a rotatron under the top one and a long wing on that. Also used the double splitter thing I downloaded for the engines. There are some radial paracutes from NovaPunch but they aren\u0027t essential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is kind of hard to land, you need to come in very shallow so the engines dont clip. And it bounces really high a few times but I dont know how to stop that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-17T16:21:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2012 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J_Man_X_663","CreatedById":29355,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-17T13:16:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood job mate, looks really flash\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the great work!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
