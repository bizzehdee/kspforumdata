This is a huge \u0022OH\u0022 moment because my shuttle is 137 empty- that\u0027s almost twice the weight. I looked into it and I realized it\u0027s due to the fact that the 600 done wing parts in it weigh .1 tons each, which adds up to over 60 tons alone. This explains a lot as to why my shuttle is not only underpowered but also under fueled. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, and due to the fact that 1.0 is going to kill what\u0027s left of the shuttles flight profile, I\u0027m going to build a \u0022lite\u0022 version of the shuttle. It will be single winged (unlike the heavy double wing now) and less wing parts overall. I will also try to rework the main tank and SRBs to be more efficient/ more realistic weights. The end product will probably not ge attractive or realistic looking, but it hopefully will work in RSS and regular KSP, just like the real shuttle, as well as be more part count friendly. But this version will still stand as the \u0022replica\u0022 just because it is so pretty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T01:24:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, so the first page has been changed some.

That means updates on SRB, Orange tank, and most importantly the orbiter. The orbiter will probably have to lose it\u0027s double wing, or at least shave a lot of parts off to lower weight. We also have to deal with the lack of thrust now that the KR-2L is less powerful than before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll right first part of the rework is done - I took the old Mk1 shuttle and ripped half the wing off, saving some 250 parts, and then I reworked the fuel, wing, and landing gear (I love the new ultra-sized but it\u0027s still a bit small).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot kidding, the glide angle is 30 degrees, and if you go under 20 m/s you end up falling like a brick. Comfortable glide path was found at around 60 m/s with one exiting flare at the end - I dropped it from 200 feet for the test, just landed on grass, it survived rather well. Total weight is still a bit high for what I\u0027d like, but it\u0027s way less than the old one, and less part count means the whole package might be sub-1000 parts.
