You see I set up a colony in a previous version of the game and now in version 1.0 the rules of the universe have changed and none of the return vehicles work any more. I\u0027ve ported the save file to version 1.0 - [you can download it here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4us3z6uekxplyu5/AADbyRlfD7vSdPAbWPpLmmOMa?dl=0) to see what I\u0027m up against (it\u0027s a sandbox game). So I guess my question is: **What is the smallest craft that you can get into orbit from the surface of Eve with one Kerbal on board?**\n\n![E3aYnRk.png](http://i.imgur.com/E3aYnRk.png)\n\nAll I need is a craft that can drop down from Eve orbit to the surface and return back into Eve orbit with at least one Kerbal on board. It doesn\u0027t need to be an SSTO, just something small and compact. My poor Kerbals are going stir crazy and want to get home!\n\n![03Y3vnF.png](http://i.imgur.com/03Y3vnF.png)\n\nJR\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T22:01:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jolly\\_Roger**"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T22:59:05Z","Content":"[Foxster](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125127-EZ-Eve?highlight=Foxster) has some pretty small ones, actually [this one](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120556-Eve-Bootstrap-lander-and-lifter-%281-0-2%29) is a lot smaller, you could use [mine](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123380-SMA-Bare-Minimum-Superseded-Prototype-Eve-Lander-and-Return-Vehicle?p=1977728#post1977728), but it needs tweaking\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T23:13:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 11:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by selfish\\_meme**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T23:59:45Z","Content":"This exchange of spacecraft has been moved to the Spacecraft Exchange."},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T00:15:07Z","Content":"This is the lightest one I managed to build. 90 tonnes or so at atmospheric entry, 60 something at take off.
