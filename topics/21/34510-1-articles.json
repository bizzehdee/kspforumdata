That is a real achievement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe falcon has both radial symmetry (best for the VAB) and Bilateral symmetry (left/right mirror, best for the SPH), and to top it off, has an extremely asymmetrical element hanging off one side, which makes ballancing everything pretty much impossible without adding a ton of dead weight as counter ballance on one side.
