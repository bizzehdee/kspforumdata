It is simply physics. For a rocket to produce thrust it requires some matter to be ejected outwards at a high speed. What is happening here is a lot of mass with a lot of momentum is imparting its kinetic energy onto the Kerbal. A similar effect can be seen when you decouple a stage in orbit and then throttle up an engine (that is is in front of it). This will push the decoupled stage backwards and often make the spent stage rotate."},{"CreatedByName":"KHTRE","CreatedById":116108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T13:18:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is not a bug.
