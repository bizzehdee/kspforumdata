And you know what: It actually has some cool features, like a ramp with a smaller rover and another of my Ion Bikes.\n\nFor the ramp I used a bearing I made out of stock parts and monoprop engines to get it back up into the cargo bay. No docking ports or grappling hooks to get it back together with the main craft because then the bearing would clip through the other parts and would no longer work. But if you close the cargo bay, it stays in place ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVtZ9V1RIg0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
