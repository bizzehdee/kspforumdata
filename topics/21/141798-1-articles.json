It was mk2 part size and had 4 ramjet engines. It has to have a heat shield on it because it goes so fast...\u003Cbr\u003E\nLater I slapped a mk2 cargo bay in there thinking... \u0022If I could get this into a suborbital flight, then if I just release a small probe with a lot of speratrons then I could get it into orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got to about 52,000 meters, the majority of the atmosphere gone, and released the probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlbeit \u003Cem\u003EThe Evil Kraken\u003C/em\u003E attacked the original probe design, so I couldn\u0027t get a perfect orbit but it was an amazing achievement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane then re-enters near another large landmass... and you can turn the engines back on to control you landing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor crash like I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, it only took about 250 units of liquid only fuel to get up there, and then maybe 12 seperatrons to get the probe into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is pretty cheap in my opinion. Getting the entire plane into orbit is a little tedious and fuel intensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the heat shield on the front of my plane is \u003Cstrong\u003ENOT\u003C/strong\u003E aerodynamic... it would be nice to have aerodynamic ones so you can make a fast plane, and still be protected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"He_162","CreatedById":152811,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-15T01:03:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPictures really help.
