Though I call it a Viper II, I really did not attempt to make any specific version. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not fully a Mk 1 from the 1978 version or the Mk II from NuBSG. (Though I did get more of my inspiration from the latter)\n\n![FAD5MXM.png](http://i.imgur.com/FAD5MXM.png)\n\n**Mods**\n\n**Adjustable Landing Gear** (So incredibly useful they should be stock!) \n\n**B9 Aerospace Pack** (just the Landing Light on the bottom of the ship)\n\n**Bahamuto Dynamics (Parts pack)** (The Pop-Out RCS thrusters - less drag in atmo) \n\n**BahamutoD\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Armory** (Weapons and countermeasures of course) \n\n**Firespitter** (buried deep inside the ship is a small fuel tank that I used as a common point for fuel lines)\n\n**Kerbal Aircraft Expansion (KAX)** (I\u0027m not actually sure what part of this mod I used, though Kerbal X says I did \\*shrug\\*)\n\n**Mark IV Spaceplane System** (SCIMITAR Engines instead of Stock Rapiers - they\u0027re a bit more powerful. Though Standard Rapiers would likely work okay)\n\n**OPT Space Plane Parts** (The wings)\n\n**TweakScale - Rescale Everything!** (Lots of little tweaks here and there)\n\nIn terms of performance, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not the greatest turner in atmosphere. Any atmospheric fighter will likely wax it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s tail. These are the compromises you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll always see when trying to make a space fighter like this with no cheats (like infinite fuel). Either performance in atmosphere or space is going to suffer by comparison. And the form dictated which was going to come in second. \n\nAnyway, as said above, it\u0027s not the best atmospheric fighter, but in space, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s VERY snappy and maneuverable! And I believe I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve actually made a craft that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s both a good replica of an icon AND a decent - and operational - aerospace fighter as well! So I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m fairly pleased with it!\n\n**WEAPONS:** \n\n**(All BD Armory)** \n\n**x2 Vulcan Cannons**\n\n**4 Space Maneuvering Missiles**\n\n**2 Flare Dispensers**\n\n**2 Chaff Dispensers**\n\nCraft was created to be compatible with the latest release from BD Armory. It has a Weapons Manager, and... I was GOING to put an AI Flight box on it too, but then I had a moment of Lore Clarity. Heh. \n\nIf you want to put an AI controller on your craft to test a fight, go right ahead. \n\nBut NO self-respecting Colonial would have ANY \u0022Toaster\u0022 running a ship! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS:** \n\nThough not absolutely required for download or operation, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAC Fuel Balancer - hey - if you\u0027ve downloaded the mods so that this craft is compatible and will load in your game, what\u0027s one more that\u0027s not even a parts mod, eh? \n\nIf you\u0027re using TAC Fuel Balancer, then before take off, pull up the Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer sections. Note that one of the tanks in the oxidizer section has no fuel in it. That\u0027s the center tank of the drop tank (the drop tank consists of 6 parts - a center small FL-T200 tank, two conical NCS Adapter tanks, two nose-cones and a docking port). You want to set that to \u0022Transfer Out\u0022. I also recommend dumping Oxidizer from one of the small FL-T100 Tanks, and then setting the Oxidizer section to \u0022Balance All\u0022. \n\nOn the Liquid Fuel section in TAC, Set the FL-T200 and the two NCS Adapter Tanks to \u0022Transfer Out\u0022 and then \u0022Balance All\u0022. \n\nIf you\u0027re not using TAC Balancer, then you\u0027ll have to do your best to just manually transfer the fuel from the drop tank section to one of the other fuel tanks. I recommend transferring from the Drop Tank(s) to the Liquid Fuel Tank that the top engine is connected to. \n\nIn any case, now you\u0027re set for take-off. \n\n![L6f3rDA.png](http://i.imgur.com/L6f3rDA.png)\n\n**Recommended ascent Profile:**\n\nThe Viper II is capable of getting to low orbit from the runway - though it needs the help of a little extra fuel tankage in the form of the drop tank to do so. In regards to that drop tank, there\u0027s enough clearance for it to pitch without collision with the runway, but you have to be CAREFUL with it. Wait until you\u0027re going at least 110-120 Meters per second, then start the pitch gently, just enough to get the front gear up and then the rear gear. As soon as you\u0027re clear of the runway, pull the gear up and start the first major pitch up. \n\n I recommend 45 degree ascent until just after 10,000 meters, when you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have drained the drop tank and released it. Note that this is not done with a decoupler, but with a small docking port arrangement. Hit \u00229\u0022 on the action groups to release it. (Why not use a decoupler? Because I wanted the option to attach a new drop tank to this craft in orbit!) \n\n![uNh3wq8.png](http://i.imgur.com/uNh3wq8.png)\n\nThen slowly drop the nose to between 20-25 degrees until about 15,000 meters, then further to 10-15 degrees between 15,000 and 20,000 meters altitude. Then keep flying until around 25,000 meters altitude. Watch the speed carefully at that point. As soon as the speed levels off and begins dropping, angle the nose up to between 20-25 degrees pitch and switch the engines to rocket mode. (If you\u0027re using Kerbal Engineer, then your speed should be around Mach 3.7-3.8 when your speed starts to drop off.)\n\n![dAYE68v.png](http://i.imgur.com/dAYE68v.png)\n\nAt between 65-67,000 Apoapsis, throttle the engines down to zero with the X key (you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll go over the 70,000 meter level before they shut off completely), pitch the vehicle to pure pro-grade attitude, turn on the RCS thrusters and thrust forward with those to keep your apoapsis from dropping. Yes - you heard me right - you\u0027ve got plenty of RCS that you haven\u0027t used by this point and you\u0027ll need almost all your remaining fuel to get a stable orbit and you may as well burn off some extra weight that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s NOT your main fuel supply...\n\nCircularize at apoapsis and you should have a small amount of fuel remaining to rendezvous with a tanker or carrier in orbit to top off the tanks (you DID plan to rendezvous with a larger craft didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t you? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ) \n\n![21VRmom.png](http://i.imgur.com/21VRmom.png)\n\n![D5fITDm.png](http://i.imgur.com/D5fITDm.png)\n\nIf not, you should have enough fuel/oxidizer left to de-orbit and land. Landing is rather like a space shuttle in terms of glide path if you\u0027re not using your engines, you\u0027re basically going to drop down (hopefully onto a runway - though the Viper is more than capable of wilderness landings) at about a 20-40 degree angle to maintain speed, then flare right before landing and use the airbrakes to help slow you down. (The airbrakes can also be used in re-entry to slow down faster, though this craft is actually very good at bleeding off heat for some reason! The only parts that tend to get hot are the RTGs on ascent, and if you\u0027re shallow in re-entry, you can keep the Viper from pinging any temp sensor bars at all!) \n\n**And lastly -** \n\nIf all else fails and you find yourself stuck in a decaying orbit or out of fuel in deep space, there is a failsafe in the form of an Ion Engine tucked between the three main engines and solar panels on the bottom of the craft! If you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re truly confident in your abilities, then you may want to pull those to save a little weight. But hey - you never know when you might need it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nAnyway - you can [download the craftfile from Kerbal X](http://kerbalx.com/logandwj/Viper-II). Give me some upvotes while you\u0027re at it if you like this little ship! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T00:27:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 12:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Logan.Darklighter**"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T00:10:40Z","Content":"This is sweet.

Just wanted to point out the Flare and separate Chaff dispensers as well as the docking port connector for the drop tank. \n\nOn that note - I\u0027m thinking of creating a re-supply craft with a bunch of drop tanks in a \u0022clip\u0022. Basically the reload version of the drop-tanks would have the port connectors on both top and bottom so that you could dock a bunch of them together - or just put them in a standard cargo hold. But you\u0027d need to make sure they would be accessible. Perhaps fold them out of the cargo bay on an IR Robotics arm so that the Viper could dock to the one on the end, then decouple it? \n\nAlso - good news in terms of being able to resupply the armaments! It was always possible to reload the BD Armory ammo boxes from a docked craft that had the same ammo. But I\u0027ve since discovered that the [Kerbal Inventory System Mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111) can actually store BD Armory Missiles - if you have a large enough volume box for them! That means that a Kerbal can actually place a missile (or bomb) on an unoccupied armament rail (or anywhere else, really - but the rails are safer). \n\nOf course - amusingly, I THINK that also means that a Kerbal - carrying a missile \u0022strapped\u0022 to their back, could actually FIRE the missile themselves!\n\n\u0022Say hello to MY LITTLE FRIEND!!!\u0022 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T01:54:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Logan.Darklighter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rufledt","CreatedById":115067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T13:58:26Z","Content":"Cool! funny, though, it looks like a replica of my replica from a few weeks ago:\n\n![vm2.jpg](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pKzAI0O-UBo/VcFeUj49S4I/AAAAAAAADao/iKTWZ8Adk6U/s640-Ic42/vm2.jpg)\n\nMight you have some unnamed \u0027inspiration\u0027 for this? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) The similarities are striking (except mine didn\u0027t use mods)\n\nI didn\u0027t find the drop tank necessary to get into orbit, there\u0027s a vid on my thread here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130661-We-Can-Game-s-Functional-Sci-Fi-ships-SSTO-s-and-more%21](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130661-We-Can-Game-s-Functional-Sci-Fi-ships-SSTO-s-and-more%21) where i got it to LKO, deorbited, and flew back for a runway landing with the same tank set up as you minus the drop tanks. in fact, the reason i made the top fuel tank liquid and not LFO was because i didn\u0027t want to add drop tanks, and it works.

I think we both just started from a similar source. Have you seen how many Vipers there are over on Kerbal X? Do a search sometime, they all start to look very similar after awhile. Except for that one guy who made a Viper Mk 1 where he made the body shape out of two almost merged hulls in order to get the shape closer to the original. Very impressive. But holy jeezus the part count on that beast! \n\nI will fully admit to stealing... er... borrowing... the top angled fin element from you, though. I thought that bit was inspired and really worked very well indeed! Worth copying! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I didn\u0027t find the drop tank necessary to get into orbit, there\u0027s a vid on my thread here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130661-We-Can-Game-s-Functional-Sci-Fi-ships-SSTO-s-and-more%21](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130661-We-Can-Game-s-Functional-Sci-Fi-ships-SSTO-s-and-more%21) where i got it to LKO, deorbited, and flew back for a runway landing with the same tank set up as you minus the drop tanks. in fact, the reason i made the top fuel tank liquid and not LFO was because i didn\u0027t want to add drop tanks, and it works.

I find that even with the tanks as I have them set up, and with the drop tank, that if I don\u0027t dump some oxidizer on the runway that I wind up with too much. The drop tank is in fact all liquid fuel, BTW. No oxidizer in it. \n\nAlso as I said above, the main reason for using the Drop Tank on the armed version is that it\u0027s just plain heavier. The un-armed prototype actually did get to orbit on its own. But I kept not quite making it and running out of fuel before circularizing when I was pulling those missiles, guns and ammo up with me. \n\nTL;DR - Heavier ship needs more fuel. \n\nIn fact I do have fins on the nose! They\u0027re just inverted/clipped into the hull so they\u0027re not visible. It\u0027s a bit cheaty, but hey, whatever works. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI managed to upload some images to imgur this morning. I intended to get around to posting them here, but got busy with other things during the day. Now\u0027s a good time to post and explain how I do things. \n\nI use TAC Fuel Balancer, (highly recommend it!) and here\u0027s what my fuel distribution looks like on runway spawn. \n\n![ruvIvHE.png](http://i.imgur.com/ruvIvHE.png)\n\nYou\u0027ll notice that the FL-T200 tank is empty of oxidizer. That\u0027s actually the middle connecting tank in the drop tank set-up. It\u0027s meant to be that way. I don\u0027t need oxidizer in the drop tank. \n\nHere\u0027s what I\u0027ve been doing as my first step in pre-flight. Take one of the FL-T100s and dump it\u0027s oxidizer. Then... \n\n![3WWQ1NU.png](http://i.imgur.com/3WWQ1NU.png)\n\nSet TAC to \u0022Balance All\u0022 and it evens out the Oxidizer Distribution on all the tanks. (Except for that Drop Tank section, which I\u0027ve set to \u0022Transfer Out\u0022 so that it doesn\u0027t receive any.)\n\nNext, I move up to the Liquid Fuel section and set the two NCS Adapter Tanks and the FL-T200 to Transfer out and \u0022Balance All\u0022 on the rest. That way the drop tank fuel is used up first. \n\n![RNujJWr.png](http://i.imgur.com/RNujJWr.png)\n\nI typically wind up with the LF and O levels fairly close once in orbit with this set-up. Between 12-18% fuel left for orbital maneuvers. Not much, but enough to get to a tanker to top off with!\n\nHere\u0027s some other pics. \n\nI mentioned that I use a docking port rather than a decoupler because I foresee that having the ability to attach another drop tank in orbit might just come in handy. Here\u0027s a good shot that shows the connection. \n\n![Hy3ydti.png](http://i.imgur.com/Hy3ydti.png)\n\nThis one shows the most visible difference in the most recent update of BD Armory - these are the new chaff and flare dispenser ports. \n\n![VVBnG8C.png](http://i.imgur.com/VVBnG8C.png)\n\nAnd here\u0027s the emergency Ion Engine activated, with solar panels deployed. It\u0027s not much thrust, but if you\u0027re out of propellant for the main engines, this may help you limp back to a rendezvous with a ship that can fuel you. \n\n![LXyowsx.png](http://i.imgur.com/LXyowsx.png)"}]}
