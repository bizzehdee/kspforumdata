It currently carries one shot, but I\u0027ll upgrade it to four ASAP, with a possible future autoloader.\n\nI\u0027m currently working on making the turret a bit more compact (easy) and upgrading the torsion bar suspension system (hard).\n\nOne of the main goals for the future XM-1.9 prototype upgrade will be a smoother bearing system and fixing the cannon. (Version XM-1.9.1, which is this version, has an issue with the rifled main gun, causing aerodynamic instability for the cannon round).\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/LvpSVVkmUlg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

When you use the turret, pull up while rotating to prevent getting stuck.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T03:18:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 03:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by andrew123**"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T20:26:03Z","Content":"Way too many parts.....\n\nAt least for a tank.\n\nYou might also want to look into a stronger and more reliable bearing.

I\u0027m ripping out any unneeded parts when I have time, as I went crazy with the struts.\n\nI did mention all of those improvements in the OP. My bradley esque tank with a bearing is only about 300 parts.\n\nI don\u0027t particularly care that this tank is around 500 parts. As long as it looks good, a few fried computers are worth it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T00:53:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by andrew123**"}]}
