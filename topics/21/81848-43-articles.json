At supersonic and hypersonic speeds you want extremly sharp wings, even negative sharped wings are imaginable, or just a lifting body with some control. But planes in such a shape are hardly maneuverable at subsonic speeds. IR they try to combine the different approaches, which leads mostly to multiple delta wings or in some cases to jackknife wings. If you try to design the same way, it should be possible to get some stable delta wing shaped planes. I\u0027ve build dozens in 0.90 with FAR.
