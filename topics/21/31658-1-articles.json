I only have issues if the cupola:weight ratio is high enough, and the only solution tends to be more control surfaces lower down... some rockets have needed as many as 18 fins and additional gimballing to stay steady when delivering payloads with multiple cupolas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheThing345","CreatedById":25669,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T13:02:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd how exactly am I supposed to use this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat link gives me the written craft file, not a download...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying to put that written file into a .txt, then change it into a .craft gives me a 1-part ship and crashes my game...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Nvm, I\u0027m stupid and didn\u0027t notice how long the bar to the right was...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T15:36:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by TheThing345\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
