Particularly since I am no longer using it with the orion vessel since it is not accurate to the actual Orion mining vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case nobody is familiar with this(Most likely the case). This is a giant oversized piece of mining equipment meant to hold large amounts of fuel. It was an extra fuel compartment for another ship. This is why it has engines for 8x gravity(outside of the SF rockets I added since) as it was meant to be carried empty into orbit then used on planets to bring up extra fuel and potentially drag very large asteroids around for it\u0027s mothership(Up to hypothetical F asteroids if they are ever put in game). But it is basically capable of getting anywhere in the SS. Or at least I think it is. I\u0027m still testing this and haven\u0027t gotten past Dres yet because of constant testing and modifications I kept making to it. Without the SF rockets it\u0027s mean to be carriable in MK3 cargo bays and can be split in two to stow away more easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstructions and keybindings are in the ships description panel. **This ship consists of a main rocket body and a probe on top that can be used for various tasks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/0yzdbxjjgya2adu/The%20Retriever%20x8%20Plus%20V3%201_0_5.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/0yzdbxjjgya2adu/The Retriever x8 Plus V3 1_0_5.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Screenshot%20from%202016-02-01%2020-49-0\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202016-02-01%2020-49-04_zps0d3ar612.png~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: out of curiosity, if people don\u0027t like this, what don\u0027t they like about it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit2: Ok, still needs lots of work in important areas like rcs on the bottom of the vehicle to reconnect with the probe. I also want to add a science bay to run science if it\u0027s not too big and work on a few more aspects of the ship. Needs more RCS though to connect to large asteroids.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-03T08:16:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2016 08:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
