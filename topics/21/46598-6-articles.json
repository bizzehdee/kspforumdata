Obviously driving slowly and carefully is the number one necessity. I\u0027ve found that when hauling a load, it helps to disable steering on the middle wheelset, and then disable the motors on the forward and rear wheels so you don\u0027t tip yourself while accelerating. If the module is particularly heavy, you might need to enable the forward wheels while accelerating forwards and vice versa, essentially in a \u0022puller\u0022 configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, if you have several modules you need to move a large distance and enough base crawlers, you can dock several together and form a truck or train sort of vehicle with perhaps two crawlers, under the front and rear-most modules.
