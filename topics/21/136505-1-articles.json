Let\u0027s just say that results where a bit interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe got another important call today from naval command, saying that they wanted us to develop a new seaplane that would be able to carry small cargo and passengers, work as a surveillance aircraft and as a ship/submarine hunter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some bit of discussion, one of our engineers had a bright idea. As he is a big fan of retro aircrafts from ye olden days, he knew pretty well that witch old types are still around and witch are not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo he rushed off to our main archives to search for some info about old maritime aircrafts. After he found what he was looking for he went to our storage hangar 5, located at a big naval-base for seaplanes and ships alike during war time, that has like some other Airfields been turned into a storage place for old aircraft types that are either on reserve or that might help in developing new types.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside that hangar was an old Airframe of the once mighty KSH-315 SeaMaster flying boat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some taught and inspections we chose this to be our new type.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old engines where removed and replaced with more modern \u0022Bear\u0022 turboprops (2 per nacelle) and the avionics and control-systems where completely redone, plus some new radar equipment was also installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe design of this aircraft is heavily based on the Boeing-314 american clipper (hence the 315 in the name) and also has some bits of the Short Sunderland and Avro Shackelton thrown in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: some of the picks (the once where the aircraft has the mouth) are from 1.05 and some from 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact that this one was built in two different versions gave me a perfect chance to do some comparasons between the to versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, the improvement in performance is massive. In the old version it used to be around 20 or so FPS or even less. In the new version it was about 50 FPS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that nothing has changed............................................o wait, there\u0027s this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oIY62z8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oIY62z8.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dunno why, but every-time i would try to launch this without unbreakable joints and no crash damage on, it would just explode in to a pile of parts. And no, it didn\u0027t happen on the old version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope to god this doesn\u0027t happen on the full release version of 1.1 or i\u0027m in trouble. I don\u0027t want to go around flying half of my aircrafts with cheats enabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that \u0022little\u0022 issue, everything went quite well, i was able to make multiple succesfull water landings and takeoffs proving it\u0027s reliability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLength: 54,3m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWingspan: 66,3m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeight: 23,4m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTop speed: bout 130m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStall speed: 45m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinimum takeoff speed: 52m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParts: 606\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass: 226,9 tons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPitch auth: with a little bit of extra speed (pull your nose down) you should be able to do a loop de loop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoll auth: pretty slow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYaw auth: who needs rolling when we can just turn like a boat in the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hH8xR/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA you can see from the picks, TweakScale and NEBULA decals are broken for now, and i\u0027m using an older version of KerbPaint. So the new version had to be logoless (mostly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome flying instructions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ieZbo8A.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ieZbo8A.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is basically what you should be aiming for when lading on water. When at an altitude of 20m or less you should have a speed of of about 40 m/s at that point, also you should point the nose slightly upwards, after that it\u0027s nothing more than a smooth landing. And just to give an idea of just how reliable this one is, during my water trials (about 3-4 tests) i didn\u0027t lose even a single part to splash damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaking off is pretty easy as well, just wait till you reach the top speed with your turboprop engines, then just fire the shuttle engines (action group 1) and start pulling up and you should be able to takeoff just before the oxidizer runs out (i got left with about 200 units out of 1300).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there it is for you, the biggest seaplane i have ever made and sorta my first aircraft made in KSP 1.1.
