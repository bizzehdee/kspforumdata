The Vega rocket is the lightweight rocket of Arianespace and ESA\u0027s workhorse, with 3 solid rocket stages and a small liquid 4th stage. Vega rockets can carry up to 2,500 kg to LEO. I\u0027ve added the Sentinel 2 spacecraft, an Earth Observation spacecraft of ESA\u0027s Copernicus Program. It carries a Multi Spectral Instrument, with 13 spectral channels. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027ve made it run off monoprop, as it has nice round tanks like the real Attitude and Vernier Upper Module. I\u0027ve made the 3rd stage liquid fueled, because it had the nozzle shape like the real one, and for gameplay reasons, as it has around enough delta-V to reach suborbital, and one might want to shut down the engine before the apoapsis is too high.\n\nThank you for orbiting by!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T01:21:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SaturnianBlue**"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T12:24:11Z","Content":"Nice- you might want to make the bottom stage a bit bigger though."},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnianBlue","CreatedById":141267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T11:39:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nice- you might want to make the bottom stage a bit bigger though.\n\nProbably, the little lips out on the bottom of the BACC booster does screw up the width measurements.
