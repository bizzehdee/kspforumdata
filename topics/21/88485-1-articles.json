Since this version came out, this was all that was on my mind: \u0022Rebuild the Blackbird.\u0022 I did, and I went through trial and error of getting all the stock parts to look JUUUUST right, to closely match the real deal. Well, in the end, this is my most accurate, and most balanced Blackbird I have ever built. I managed to climb to over 30,000 metres, and managed to get above mach 4 in this, and it has more than enough fuel to circumnavigate Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g0yqqbi31acmwii/AAAjGQd3s5hvboaEPlBipj_Ra/screenshot37.png?raw=1\u0026amp;dl=0\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot37.png?raw=1\u0026amp;dl=0\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\\/IMPORTANT INFO!\\/\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that this bird is still fragile on the tarmac.

Bring her nose up ever so gently, and let the lift gradually make its way under the wings. \u003Cstrong\u003EOne MOOOORE thing!\u003C/strong\u003E I purposely left the 2 rear fuel tanks closed off to maintain Center of Mass balance, the one that\u0027s open will get you very far. Also, the reason I put a cargo bay behind the capsule was to lighten the load.
