I have since updated it, and it\u0027s actually a fun little craft, not to mention it brings a lot of style points when you can walk your kerbals around inside your ship. So here it is, the Falcon crew shuttle! I called it Falcon because I find a resemblance with the famous ship made by Correllian shipyards. Perhaps this was built somewhere close?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZV0p5t7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZV0p5t7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a passenger cabin directly behind the pilot cockpit with seats for four passengers, and a hatch that opens to reveal the ladder for crew ingress/egress. Other than that, it\u0027s a brute-force SSTO that can lift off on the single turbofan... then it goes up ridiculously quick on TWO turbojets. It is a bit intake-limited, and even though I did the intake trick so both engines flame out \u0022at the same time\u0022, the small residual lag between them when they empty the common pool can still send you spinning at full throttle, so it is a bit sporty on ascent. The good part is, the huge TWR combined with the total absence of lift-generating surfaces means you can do weird things and still make it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CjuaFJO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CjuaFJO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is actually the proper way to court the flameout. Any slight thrust asymmetry makes you pitch \u0022up\u0022, so you know, throttle down a bit (I think I ended at 50% throttle before cutting the turbojets at almost-orbital speeds) and make it go where you want. If case of any trouble, cutting thrust will solve \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E, since it is perfectly aerodynamically stable in any orientation... the same way a perfectly round ball would be. Perfect for thrust-powered aerobatics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also comes with a rocket VTOL system, mainly because the single jet is like TWR 1.05 at maximum thrust. Otherwise landing this would be either suicide or incredibly boring, so you also get that cupcake-style extra response with that optional system. Or you could also use it for Duna SSTO: this thing is perfectly capable of filling all tanks with LFO mix and comply with TWR and deltaV for that planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, have fun, and remember: do NOT try this with FAR. xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/LhP1A\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
