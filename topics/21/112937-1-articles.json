After a few test flights to make sure they attain orbit easily, and land easily enough, I made it into a subassembly attached with the pylon that leaves nothing on the part it was attached to.\n\nI tried slinging two of these under the wings of my electric plane... but it wasn\u0027t sufficient.\n\nA 3rd one on top, some use of the offset tool to get the center of thrust in a good position, and I had my payload in orbit.\n\nI now plan on using them as strap on supplemental boosters for a variety of things. their CoL and CoT are already balanced, so I should be able to stick them on something (that already flies well) without much precision needed in their placement (aside from Center of thrust considerations).\n\nI\u0027ve heard of some people making reusable boosters, but often this is in the form of a suborbital booster, or a single SSTO booster with a top mounted payload.\n\nSo far I haven\u0027t seen people doing strap on SSTOs as boosters, or doing anything like this for getting oddly shaped payloads to orbit.\n\nSurely some of you have, and I just haven\u0027t seen it.\n\nHave any pictures?\n\nBack in 0.24, I had some strap on SSTO Rapier boosters for a similar electric plane for duna, but they weren\u0027t winged, and just came down on chutes, hopefuly near KSC\n\nI\u0027m hoping to get some bigger designs... Its already going to be a pain to land those 3... bigger payloads would result in a lot of SSTOs to land.\n\nSo I want fewer, bigger strap on SSTOs.\n\nI also want designs with some more nodes so I can add turbojets for better static TWR (I imagine many payloads will require a vertical launch and \u003E1.0 TWR)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T19:57:15Z","Content":"Showcase thread moved to Spacecraft Exchange."}]}
