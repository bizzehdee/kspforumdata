First up is a Kerbfleet workhorse, the Pogo XLP. This is a very basic mid-career (that is, no RAPIER) SSTO capable of bringing six Kerbals to LKO and back. Comes fully equipped with an inline shielded docking port and six-axis RCS controls.\n\nI made the Pogo launch and land vertically, mostly to save myself time on routine crew transfers. Not that I don\u0027t enjoy spending a half hour of real time getting my glide slope just right and sticking a horizontal landing in the middle of the KSC runway... ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) but yeah. \n\nAttached album gives the flying instructions, Here\u0027s [the link to its page on KerbalX](http://kerbalx.com/kuzzter/Pogo-XLP). Also, here is [its first appearance in the comic](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122280-Duna-Ore-Bust%21-a-KSP-Graphic-Novel-%28Ch5-Pg22-Time-for-a-tot%21%29?p=2026117\u0026viewfull=1#post2026117).
