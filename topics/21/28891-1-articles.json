It is possible to do a mun-return mission with a lot less hardware:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It is possible to do this with a much smaller lift rocket when using asparagus staging. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The service-module is quite overpowered for a mun mission. A smaller engine and fuel tank would also get the job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Because there is no reentry heat in KSP yet, there is little reason for using different pods for landing on Mun and landing on Kerbin, so the command capsule could also work as a lander. The service module could be controlled by a probe core in the meantime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. And why does the service module need an engine anyway when you have engines on the landing module? So the CSM could be reduced to a fuel tank with a probe core (\u002Benergy supply) and a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why I didn\u0027t do any of that in the tutorial was because I wanted to make the mission profile as similar to the real Apollo 11 as possible... within reason, though. One important feature I omitted was a two-stage lander with a descent-stage which would be left behind on the surface. I tried building something like that, but with the parts available in KSP it just looked stupid and even less than the real Eagle. By the way: When \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E want to save some weight on your landers, only leave the empty tanks on the surface, not the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-24T22:59:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2013 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Crush\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T22:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou should have a look to mulbin\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28073-0-19-Munbug-V-Now-80-more-Apollo!-New-Jool-V-Rocket-New-CM-New-Lander!?p=343648#post343648\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMunbug V\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
