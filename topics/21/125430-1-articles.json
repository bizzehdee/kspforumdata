If you have been following me for a while, I bet you already have an idea of what I\u0027m about to show you... if not, know that the White Dart series has been with me since before we had RAPIERs. You could say it\u0027s my signature craft. Although it has had many iterations, from the beginning of the line it\u0027s distinctive characteristics have been to be light (and part-light, too), have incredible aerodynamics, and perhaps most important of all, look cool as heck. While I can attest to the first two points (55 parts, it has the easiest launch procedure I have ever done, and it can do \u0022Kobras\u0022 on reentry!), I think you\u0027d better be the judge of the aesthetics department... I\u0027m too full of myself right now to be anywhere near objective. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fy8yQK9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Fy8yQK9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you know, just so it is clear how it easy it is to fly, let\u0027s just paste the entire flight manual here... such as it is. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFlight Manual (AKA: go to orbit in five steps without touching the WASD keys):\u003Cp\u003E1- On takeoff, assume a 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA AoA over the horizon and engage the normal SAS mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- At 7,000m, engage the prograde autopilot until you are again at 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA over the horizon, then back again to normal SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- When the RAPIER gives less than 50kN thrust, switch modes manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- Once your apoapsis is over 50kms, go back to prograde autopilot until you hit your target Apo, then cut engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- Circularize at desired altitude with a maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, real easy to fly. The actual performance is a bit more murky due to KER still being fried due to the update, and me being too lazy to run a simple calculation \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E, but from the 200km test orbit with plenty of fuel to spare, I can already tell you it has quite a bit of range. Any LKO shouldn\u0027t be a problem even if you are not the most efficient kerbal rendezvousing. Similarly, there is enough RCS in there for even Mechjeb to dock for you. And before you tell me how long low TWR designs take to get to orbit... I timed it. 9 minutes until you cross the 70km mark, form the runway. So not that long at all, and with considerably less pilot input along the way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that is the real trick of the design, low TWR. It is frankly anaemic until you go supersonic at 7,000m, but all that engine weight saved really helps with weight efficiency. And the aerodynamics are frankly, some of my best. Wing loading is ridiculously low, and the CoM/CoL barely moves at all during flight. It is in fact set up to be ever so slightly unstable when the tanks are nearing empty, so reentry \u0022Kobras\u0022 (going to a \u0026gt;45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA AoA to use the whole wing as a giant airbrake) are downright easy, but if you find her a bit jumpy just re-enable the emergency fuel tanks on the tail, or empty them pre-emptively into the main tanks: you will still be able to do Kobras, but it\u0027ll want to go back to pointing prograde on its own like a nice stable airliner, not a jumpy dogfighter. Oh, and one last confession: I cheated quite a bit on the aerodynamics department. Not only does it have my usual hidden canards, the main shock cone intake is attached to the rear node of the RAPIER and turned 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA... a dirty trick, I will admit, but it is for a good cause: the draggiest part of the airframe \u003Cem\u003Eis the freaking fuel cell\u003C/em\u003E. You can\u0027t go much better than that... Fall like a feather, cut through the air like a needle. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K84s2bJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022K84s2bJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, one final note. See that picture up there? That is there to explain to you why the file you open will look slightly different from the one I give. See, from a few versions ago, the White Dart gained the feature of interchangeable mission modules. Now, I haven\u0027t had the time to properly build a few of them, and I\u0027m afraid a VTOL version is probably out of the cards, but I still built a \u0022science bay\u0022, and the build is made so changing form one mission module is as simple as chugging it away and plugging in a new one. Just grab the center tank and the whole rear of the ship will come off with it, and re-attach without issues once you have changed modules. My test 2.5mT crew cabin could be considered the maximum recommended payload... but I\u0027m pretty sure it could lift up a bit more than that. I would very much like to see what you come up with, if you give it a go! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with that, I leave you with the mission album and the usual download.
