All I care about now is getting down to the mun and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am prepping a station for mun orbit at the moment. It has fore and aft docking ports. If I get a new fat lander design finished before it leaves I can bring it along. It would be nice if I could reuse it to bring back samples to the mobile lab. That way I dont need to keep relaunching rockets to land at biomes on mun. Only done 4 so far. Thankfully canyon biome was an unplanned second landing. Such a small target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
