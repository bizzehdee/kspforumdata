I don\u0027t use them while \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elanding\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, only while docking in orbit.\u00A0 The reason I don\u0027t use them is that they are neither necessary nor sufficient for helping with landing (at least, the way that I design and fly my landers); and the way that I land would tend to preclude me from actually trying to use them, anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding \u0022not necessary\u0022:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese days, I almost always have at least level-1 SAS ability on my lander (i.e. a level-1-or-better pilot, or a HECS-or-better probe core).\u00A0 To land, I just put the navball into \u0022surface\u0022 mode, and set SAS to \u0022hold retrograde.\u0022\u00A0 As Nich points out above, doing that will just naturally bring your lander into a smooth, perfectly vertical descent; it automatically corrects for any horizontal drift.\u00A0 So lateral thrust simply isn\u0027t needed.\u00A0 The only exception to this is, sometimes in very early career I\u0027ll \u0022shoot for the moon\u0022 and want to send a scientist instead of a pilot, and don\u0027t have HECS yet, and I\u0027ll need to do a controlled descent with only level-0 SAS.\u00A0 But that typically happens, at most, once in a career game.\u00A0 And even there, I can land the craft OK without having lateral thrust, whereas what I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E constrained by is low dV due to limitations on part count, ship mass, and tech level in early career, so I need to save every kilogram I can.\u00A0 (And frankly, at that point in my career I probably don\u0027t have RCS unlocked yet anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore:\u00A0 The reason why anyone would care about having a little bit of lateral velocity left upon touchdown is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etipping over\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 I would say that that\u0027s the biggest design challenge for landers, especially in early career when part selection is limited:\u00A0 keeping them low enough and squat enough that they\u0027re naturally tip-resistant.\u00A0 Yes, tipping is a problem... but the solution to that isn\u0027t to try to keep horizontal velocity to zero, it\u0027s to \u003Cem\u003Emake the lander low and squat\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 I find that when I have tipping problems, it\u0027s generally because I landed on a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eslope\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, not because I was moving sideways at touchdown.\u00A0 And RCS can\u0027t really help you if the problem is sloping ground.\u00A0 So by keeping the design low and squat, I solve both the \u0022horizontal velocity\u0022 and the \u0022sloping ground\u0022 problem at once, and RCS simply isn\u0027t needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding \u0022not sufficient\u0022:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRCS is a very low-thrust system.\u00A0 It\u0027s terrible for doing high-muscle, major trajectory adjustments; that\u0027s what the primary engine is for.\u00A0 RCS is for fine-tuning, where the dV amounts involved are a few m/s, or even centimeters per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand:\u00A0 an efficient landing on a vacuum world has very little fine-tuning involved.\u00A0 It\u0027s brute force.\u00A0 The ideal vacuum landing means that you fall out of the sky at hundreds of meters per second, as a dead weight with all the grace of a concrete falcon.\u00A0 Then at the very last possible instant, you slam on your main engines at full thrust, and brake to a halt \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ejust\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in time to kiss the ground at a near stand-still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a very touchy process.\u00A0 The entire time the landing sequence is happening, you\u0027re pulling high acceleration, and you have to keep an eagle eye on two and only two things:\u00A0 1. how much ground clearance do I have?, and 2. how fast am I falling?\u00A0 Make the slightest judgment error or get distracted for a moment and you\u0027ll find out first-hand why this landing technique is called a \u0022suicide burn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo RCS is really unhelpful there.\u00A0 First, because continuous high acceleration is involved, and the tiny fine-tuning nudges of RCS would just get lost in the huge surge of thrust from the main engines.\u00A0 Also, I can only concentrate on just so many things at once.\u00A0 My attention is completely taken up by watching my ground clearance and my fall speed, and I have absolutely no attention to spare for anything else, such as RCS.\u00A0 Landing\u0027s hard enough as it is.\u00A0 Maybe you can concentrate on more things at once than I can, but I know that if I tried to monkey around with RCS in the middle of a landing, I\u0027d be painting a wide swath of Munscape green-and-whatever-color-Kerbals-are-inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one time in my entire KSP career that I used RCS on landers a lot was way back when I was new to the game.\u00A0 I used it then for a few reasons.\u00A0 First, that was back before all this new-fangled SAS autopilot stuff was around, so there was no such thing as \u0022hold retrograde.\u0022\u00A0 Second, I was a noob at lander design, so my landers were tall and tip-prone.\u00A0 Third, my landing technique was very slow and wasteful-- I was approaching the ground very slowly and carefully in a kind of sustained hover-- which meant I had plenty of time to think about RCS and try to nudge my lateral velocity to zero manually.\u00A0 So I did it then.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022

low, squat lander designs, as well as faster and more efficient vacuum landings, then I stopped with the RCS and never looked back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I know that lots of folks

it\u0027s about helping someone to better explore their current direction rather than encouraging them to adopt elements of your own is in poor taste.\u00A0 I see it clog up thread after thread, year after year, every time I wander through the KSP forums and it does get tiresome after a while, so I fully empathize with \u0022no no no no no no

lander!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did make a few modifications in the version that I checked out, so I should specify those up front:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI lowered the side tanks and legs as much as I could without looking totally goofy for the same reasons mentioned by others.\u00A0 Ground clearance is important wherever possible, and coming in hard is a particular concern in this case since the lander has such a low TWR and light legs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSince lowering the legs gave it such a high CoM, I added a pair of RCS blocks to the shoulders of the lander (one quad and one linear on each side) to help prevent it from tipping over when landing on a slope.\u00A0 If you\u0027re using RCS this way, you just switch them on right before touching down and let SAS fire them as needed.\u00A0 As long as you\u0027re not using them for maneuvers or anything then there\u0027s more than enough monopropellant in any of the standard pods for this purpose and you don\u0027t need to add any additional tanks or anything.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nInstead of trying to figure out exactly how much mass you have tucked into the service bay, I just threw a pair of locked monoprop tanks in there for ballast. As a result, the lander I flew is probably around 3-5 tons heavier than your actual design.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI added some lights because I like to have lights.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts, observations, etc:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe fuel and engine arrangement is the biggest area of concern.\u00A0 Specifically: When the side tanks run dry the 48-7Ss die out, requiring you to finish the landing with just the single LV-909 if you\u0027re touching down at anywhere near the lander\u0027s max effective operating range.\u00A0 The lander\u0027s overall TWR is on the lowish side to begin with, and if your relying on the 48-7Ss for support than it could be a real problem if they gave out at the wrong moment.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are a number of possible ways to address the fuel/engine issue:\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you happen to have the Poodle unlocked, then using one of them instead of the LV-909 \u002B 4x 48-7S would be great for a lander this size and would eliminate any issues without having to adjust fuel lines.\u00A0 Since you\u0027re not already using a Poodle here, I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s not an option at this time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMoving the 48-7Ss to the outer rim of the central tank is another viable approach, node-attached to girders or cubic struts that are surface-attached to the tank itself.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRunning a second set of fuel lines from the central tanks back out to the side tanks (in addition the the fuel lines you already have) would also ensure that the 48-7Ss don\u0027t die at the wrong moment, but it would require you to remember to manually drain what\u0027s left the side tanks into the core tank before lifting off to return home -- tedious, and very unreliable if you forget to do things as often as I do.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIt has lots of fuel which is great, but that also means lots of launch mass.\u00A0 This is not a terribly small lander.\u00A0 By the time you\u0027ve added in a transfer stage you could easily be looking at ~250 tons on the pad, so make sure it\u0027s sufficiently upgraded.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLanding on a moderate slope, the high CoM of the build I used combined with the softness of the legs were a bit concerning.\u00A0 The RCS blocks eliminated any risk of tipping over in this case, but I would rather not try to take this down on any kind of uneven terrain without them.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe return portion was aerodynamically stable, and handled a direct return from the Mun to an atmospheric periapse of 30k very comfortably.\u00A0 The 5t of ballast I was carrying in the service compartment probably affected that, but I don\u0027t think that running a lighter load would cause problems in this case. One parachute was fine.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, I rather like the look (omg, space rabbit!) and feel this configuration, and may use it myself in the future.\u00A0 The only changes I can think of to make in my next revision are a Poodle engine and LT-2 landing legs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless
