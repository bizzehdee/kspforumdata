You can read more at the website vpacconcept.org. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis involves building mission architecture around a four person crew and cockpit.\u00A0 So everything based around that one cockpit and everything is done from that one cockpit, including a static simulator used for science, acting as aft part of a ship. We are modeling vehicles and mission architecture around these vehicles with the above in mind.\u00A0 A \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E orbiter called Seraphim, that separates in orbit, the front of the vehicle becoming the MPEV Multi Purpose Exploration Vehicle (Cockpit and crew including aft compartment), see models here; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.vpacconcept.org/hangar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.vpacconcept.org/hangar\u003C/a\u003E \u00A0The Seraphim carries the EXEM Eternal Engine Module in it payload bay, this combined with MPEV for beyond LOE ops.\u00A0 Also looking at being able to construct in orbit for longer duration missions and how we might develop this mission architecture to include descent and ascent to from planet moon surfaces, again all from this one cockpit. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe were wondering if we could team up with some interested KSP community members and possibly simulate VPACC\u2019s vehicles and missions to help us understand and develop this mission architecture. \u00A0 We are currently building these specific models for Orbiter space sim, but I think KSP has developed to such an extent that this would be a viable fun option.\u00A0 Would love to hear what the community thinks. \u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022?format=2500w\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022730\u0022 src=\u0022https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5596a493e4b0d82ab9915c29/t/58120edebebafb2c8ab8902f/1477578537204/?format=2500w\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022?format=2500w\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5596a493e4b0d82ab9915c29/t/57900c8a4402434ae8db8e69/1469058200699/?format=2500w\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022?format=2500w\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5596a493e4b0d82ab9915c29/t/57e31b409de4bb5b97cf4164/1474501457458/?format=2500w\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022?format=1500w\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5596a493e4b0d82ab9915c29/t/581b3b892e69cfd82f8c2bc8/1478179734038/?format=1500w\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKind regards from the VPACC team\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresident \u0026amp; Founder\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVPACC, Inc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
