Specifications for such a craft were that it not be so highly maneuverable as to be dangerous to the pilot - who would likely be a cadet/rookie, that it be stable at high speed so as not to cause the pilot undue alarm, that it be easy to land, and that it be both cheap and economical. The cheap because, it has to be said, rookies and cadets are at the highest risk of pilot error of perhaps any airman outside of being in a missile lock. So it should be easily replacable if the craft is damaged, or worse, lost. It should be economical because training needn\\\u0027t cost a fortune. As such, the entire craft is propelled by a single pusher turbofan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGliding is reasonable, acceleration is very good, maneuverability is ok for training purposes, and this is an all round easy to fly bird. They can be retrofitted for combat, though this is not recommended. Though they may make alright bombers - we just haven\\\u0027t tested this. \u003Cem\u003ESkypper\u003C/em\u003Es are very useful for small to medium sized countries looking to learn their air forces some skills. If a small country is out of options, they may make use of these for dual training and combat purposes - but expect heavy losses. For a small, cheap bomber that could be retrofit as an interceptor, see our \u003Cem\u003ECrescent\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pEqLH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pEqLH.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/huZTq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022huZTq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JYDF2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JYDF2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c4yDu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c4yDu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AKtAc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AKtAc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=C7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=C7 Experimental\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=VA Tails [see attachments]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPLUGINS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=C7 landing gear\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Blinking nav-lights\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Damned Ind.
