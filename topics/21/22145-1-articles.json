Posting this as a reference for anyone who might be having problems getting things into orbit and beyond. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a very basic but reliable launch platform.. The launch stages can put up to a 30t final stage into 100km LKO fairly easily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs built in the posted .craft file, the whole craft will make orbit with 1700 - 1900L left in the central launch stage depending on how efficient you are with your launch/gravity turn/orbit circularization. I generally average between 1800 and 1900L remaining with my method. Mechjeb might do better but I don\u0027t know since I don\u0027t use it. The remaining launch stage fuel will easily manage a mun intercept and orbit circularization or kerbin escape without having to use the final stage. The final stage orbiter has a delta-v somewhere around 8000m/s, so it should be able to make it into orbit around almost anything in the solar system, and back from most places. It can even land on most lower gravity moons and possibly Duna if your comfortable with standing it on it\u0027s engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not extremely pretty, or unique, but it works. And like I said. Posting it as a reference design for anyone who might be having problems. Though I should note the lack of RCS, while making things simpler and saving weight, makes orbital attitude adjustments require a bit of pre planning until you dump the launch stage and it\u0027s mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.craft file (you\u0027ll probably have to right click and \u0027save link as\u0027)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://foxlightlasers.com/webstuff/KSP/Quickie%20Mk%20I.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EQuickie Mk I\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**note** The Kerbal Engineer Redux plugin is show in use in the screenshots, but is NOT in the .craft file..
