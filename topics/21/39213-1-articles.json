Try to test your fueltank-engine-combination alone. That\u0027s what I did for this ship, too: one nuclear engine has not enough thrust to lift one tank, but two engines can do it and so you see a tank with a bi-coupler fired by two nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are welcome to download my other (and smaller) spaceplane and play around with it, it may give you some hints (I used some tricks on it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/42498-Apophis-SSTO-with-VTOL-capabilities\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/42498-Apophis-SSTO-with-VTOL-capabilities\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
