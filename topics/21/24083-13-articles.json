Orbiter\u0027s manual controls make sense, though, and are joystick based. Kerbal\u0027s are ... Well. Kerballed.

So following a flight profile with or without automated assistance--be it pressing \u0027w\u0027 repeatedly, programming mechjeb to hold a certain attitude, or simply hitting \u0027t\u0027 for the SAS shouldn\u0027t be too different with regards to getting better or worse at the game--and seem to be a fault of the game itself rather than your designs. (Or Mechjeb, but that\u0027s got its own dev schedule--and is recuperating from all the changes made by the Kerbal devs since 1.0 and 1.0.2.) I\u0027m living in fear of new updates, since every \u0027tweak\u0027 to the atmosphere of planets seems to mean a complete redesign of every ship ever made. This is why my only mod nowadays is Mechjeb. I\u0027m too afraid of all the minor changes and instabilities breaking the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Space Shuttle\u0027s docking system and instrumentation are about as esoteric and precise as one can be--incorporating an axis shift all the while, where the Apollo version was anything but.

Not nothing at all, but I wanted better margins, as my refueling station is parked at 100x100. It wasn\u0027t -quite- enough for the \u0022Dock or bust\u0022 trip I\u0027d planned. I did manage to get the same Spatha in orbit with closer to 700m/s last night, and docked with my Kerbin station, refuelled, took off to Minmus Station (my intent was to fill the cargo with rocks and drag them back to Kerbin after refuelling at Minmus) and back again--thus supplying my Kerbin station with ore. (seems more efficient to haul rocks from Minmus to Kerbin than design an SSTO that can do kerbin to orbit in one hop while full of ore)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...but then the Minmus Station Docking Incident occurred.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I deleted that save due to frustration. =)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T12:39:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 12:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by slaintemaith\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T13:33:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOuch, that must have hurt.

I haven\u0027t really included it in the designs list on that page for two reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Still trying to narrow down the max payload weight the Shuttle can lift off with and make a certain altitude (ie 100x100km orbit for a heavy payload vs 200x200km with a light payload). I designed it as a station-builder, but alternatively, how much weight can it safely glide and land with if it needed to bring something down? It launches no problem, and it glides wonderfully during testing (but the cargo bay was empty after jettisoning a test payload in orbit). So not quite ready for roll-out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) My designs list in \u003Cem\u003ERaptor Aerospace \u003C/em\u003Ereference air-breathing aircraft that primarily operate in the atmosphere for aero-testing, science surveys, or service missions (like moving a rover to an island for example). SSTO spaceplanes are sort of an exception to that, but they use the same facilities as the atmo-only aircraft, so in my mind, they\u0027re just aircraft that can operate for extended periods at \u003Cem\u003EREALLY\u003C/em\u003E high altitude.
