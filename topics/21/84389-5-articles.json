In fact it is now the thing that is most requested so that is being bumped up the list. I\u0027ll be adding that feature real soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Skip\u0022 functionality has been taken out. I\u0027ve noticed that a number of users have been really confused by that and there are about 10 craft that haven\u0027t been completed as a result (and are therefore not shown in the search results).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now the use flow is to go through the whole process of uploading the craft and setting up its page in one go. I had thought that it would be neat to be able to upload several craft at the same time, but I now think that doing that is more confusing to the majority of users than it is helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that some users have realised that they can upload a craft and then have it hidden from the search by not completing the page. I don\u0027t really want that happening, the point of KX is to share with the community. But I will be adding the ability to have a limited number (2-3) of private craft that won\u0027t appear in the search and can only be accessed by people you specifically give access to. You will only get a couple private craft, but I also plan to add a subscription feature later if you want to have more private craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging the \u0022cancelled\u0022 to \u0022skipped\u0022 won\u0027t change the action that the link takes, it just changes what message you get back. \u002B1 for doing something totally unexpected thou!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing Opera(15\u002B) should be fine, its basically got the same stuff under the hood as Chrome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping to get loads done on the site today, but apparently today was the day to have a fever so I\u0027m not coding today.
