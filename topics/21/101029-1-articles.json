MechJeb not compulsory! They can carry cargo or passengers, are strong enough to do loop the loops and barrel rolls and have enough range to get to the Runway Island, (about a 15 minute journey, Kerbal time). Thanks to Jakalth for his turbojet engines which turned out better for the propellers than mine. \n\nThere are 3 variants. The first is the basic model.\n\n![kFnK4i9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kFnK4i9.jpg)\n\nSimply press space to fire up the engines. You will need SAS enabled to fly it. Pitch and yaw are a bit sluggish but roll is very sensitive. This is good as it makes landing easier. **Do not retract the gear as it holds the rotors in place**. Brakes have been disabled on the wheels used for the bearings so feel free to use brakes as and when for the undercarriage. Hotkey 1 toggles the jets which is useful for when you touch down.\n\n![qx8VFBX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qx8VFBX.jpg)\n\n[Chinook RS Download](http://www./download/f3lexlvz6h5ra8y/Chinook_RS.craft)\n\nThe second variant is a more powerful version able to carry heavier loads or hold more fuel. I tweaked the positioning of the jets to give it more power. I include it as a separate design because, unladen, the speeds this can go out will be faster than what the rotor blades can handle. If you go faster than 70 m/s you could be in trouble. If you are carrying heavy loads this is not a problem.\n\n[Chinook RS Plus Download](http://www./download/jcin2zaq8fwdka4/Chinook_RS_Plus.craft)\n\nThe third variant is the passenger Chinook. Able to carry 52 Kerbals! This also uses the uprated engines but as the passenger modules are heavier the helicopter should be able to handle it.\n\n![0QCqUli.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0QCqUli.jpg)\n\n[Chinook RS Passenger Download](http://www./download/3p4bf458a38wokf/Chinook_RS_Passenger.craft)\n\nHere\u0027s my journey to Runway Island.
