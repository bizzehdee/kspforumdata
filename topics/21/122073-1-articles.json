Was going to try sending my Driad too Jool, but things didn\u0027t go so well for that craft. I kinda broke it... badly... So this time I\u0027m starting over from scratch with a new plan. And thanks too a lot of tips and info from several different KSP regulars, especially Rune, I\u0027ve got a new design as well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far the design is in it\u0027s early stages with lots of room for tweeks and changes. The idea, is to launch a space going tractor and pull all the cargo too Jool orbit. For this prupose I went a little overboard(yeah, not surprising for me. I\u0027ve been doing that a lot lately) and built a multi role tug. This craft has a large docking port on it\u0027s bottom to attack cargo module too and has the thrust provided from 12 Nerv(nuke) rockets. Alone, the craft has just shy of 6500 delta-V, allowing it to make the trip on it\u0027s own. But where\u0027s the fun in that? So I\u0027ll be making cargo modules to drag along with it too be deployed in the Jool system for various missions. These missions include deploying space planes to explore Lathe, deliver satellites to various parts of the Jool system, bring a lander or two for dropping onto Tylo, and maybe even dropping a probe into the depths of Jools atmosphere where it will eventually be crushed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I\u0027ve got the Tug its self initially designed. The design allows the tug to land on Vall, Pol, and Bop and refuel it\u0027s self using the built in drills and Refinery as well as perform scientific experiments. The Tug has sufficient TWR and delta-v to land and return to orbit from all three moons. It has a small crew compliment this time, with only room for 3 Kerbals in the command pod. But with it\u0027s towing capabilities, it can bring more Kerbals to the system in relative survivability, by towing them in crew pods behind the tug. Power generation comes from 6 large solar arrays and a cluster of radio isotope power generators for when solars don\u0027t do the job(at a much slower pace of corse). It even has radiators installed to help dissipate the heat of the Nerv rockets into space, for when long burns are needed. Hopefully, this will allow this craft to fill most of the roles to be performed in the Jool system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I went a little overboard with symmetry, but at least it should fly strait this way. And no, it\u0027s not self launching, that would be too easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/Joolomnimissionmodule_zpsurglwvez.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Joolomnimissionmodule_zpsurglwvez.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have the Lathe spaceplanes built and tested for this mission, although not yet finalized. Coming in at around 20 tons, they are not the lightest sstos I\u0027ve built, but they should do the job. Each are equipped with a pair of water skis made from radial intakes so they can land in the seas of lathe with no worries. Their safe landing speed is at or below 70 m/s, which gives them a nice large safety margin. They are equipped with science equipment to run experiments in Lathes atmosphere and waters and have landing gear if I can land them close enough to an island to make use of it. Takeoff from the water is achieved by getting the craft up to at least 35m/s and jettisoning the floats. The current versions have 6 sepratrons to give an initial boost to lift as the engines push the craft up to a high enough speed to sustained flight. They are a bit finely tuned though, and only have just enough fuel to reach orbit, from there they will need a smaller tug to bring them back to the primary tug for their return trip too kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an earlier version, possibly MK2. Newer versions have better wings, better floats, and sepratrons to lift them from the water for take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/latheplanemk4_zps2vxqihsa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022latheplanemk4_zps2vxqihsa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot more to get done for this mission, but hopefully, this time, I\u0027ll be able to complete it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload for the craft can be found in this thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/136499-Jak-112-Lamp-Post-with-download\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHERE\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-20T03:40:54Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2015 03:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T12:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty cool stuff.

But it didn\u0027t end well... I couldn\u0027t get it to land stable. The bounce would always end up toppling it over... It was more of a jet powered drop pod then an actual plane though so it was taller then an amphibious vtol lander should be. I might have to revisit that idea for the other liquid filled planet, Eve. Sadly, the flotation tends to add a lot of weight, but a vtol would probably be the best way to minimize the total weight needed since no external structure is needed for the floats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also can\u0027t seem to get small enough craft, that are amphibious, to make a vtol viable and still be able to reach orbit with the same craft.

I could always ditch the ssto idea and make a vtol water hopper with a second return vehicle, leaving the hopper behind planet side...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*update* \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently have a set of 5 different modules that can be dragged behind the space tug, that I am now calling the Jak-112 Lamp Post. So far, i\u0027m keeping optimistic, but there are quite a few little hurtles to get past yet before I can see if this project will work. Got little bugs to fix in some of the modules as well as adding lights to my landers(seemed to have forgotten to do that...).

The Tug it\u0027s self has 6500m/s of Delta-V and can do most of the missions by its self, including refueling, but it\u0027s the little stuff like landing on Lathe and Tylo that need more specialized equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a slight weight issue with my tylo lander. I can use a nice light weight, non-returning lander if I want, but if I plan on bringing a Kerbal down, I\u0027m having issues keeping the weight down... the best I\u0027ve got so far is a 45 ton mini-monster of a lander. not really the best choice for being lugged about behind the Lamp Post...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-03T01:50:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2015 01:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T01:49:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, the modules are ready for deployment.

At full burn, I was getting dangerously close to the thermal limits of some of the parts near the engines. So about 10 minutes into first burn I had to reduce thrust to just over half thrust. This increased the burn duration to 15 minutes just to get half way through the projected delta-V. Of course, due to how much this craft is slowing down my computer, the actual time it took to perform this burn was closer to 1hr 25min real time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI shut down the engines and let the craft coast for a while and cool down, letting it travel past the transfer node to the same point past it that I had ended the first half of the burn. While this was happening, I took a break myself. Saved the game, went away, had something to eat, then came back. Upon loading up the game again, I found a problem. The Node had once again changed... the delta-V needed was reset to full and the position of encounter had been altered by a vast amount. The game was trying to make me fail at this! Again!!! So once again, I had to wing it, manually. And had to burn without using the numbers from the transfer node. At least this time the node was in the same place and hadn\u0027t inverted... So guessing the node amount, I once again went full burn. This time only being able to go full burn for about 8 minutes before the craft started getting too hot. Dawn to half burn again and carefully watching temp, it was another slow 15 minute(1hr and 20 min) burn until BINGO! Jool encounter, right where expected. And none too soon.

Sadly, I missed taking a lot of the earlier screen shots...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the mission started by getting the Tylo module into a low 55/60km circular(ish) orbit. This was followed by seperation of the Tylo module from the minitug module I was using to do all the orbital maneuvers up until this point. With the minitug module seperated, I jettisoned the lower docking port, freeing up the engines, and undocked the upper sr. docking port, from the roof mounter docking port on the lander, to free up the weight that was adding. This left me with just the Tylo lander and two pieces of orbiting debree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started the burn by finding a decent spot to do my mission, somewhere on the lighted side of Tylo. And a simple Retrograde burn later, started my descent. The initial retrograde burn was close too 900m/s delta-V used from the descent stage of the lander. This killed most, not all, of my forward speed, this way I only have too really worry about vertical motion while descending too the surface. I really liked how this descent was looking so I did another quicksave at this point to give me an easy reload if things go wrong. My first try was going well, I waited for the suicide burn distance to be close and started the burn early. Ends up a little too early... I ran out of downward speed too quickly and ended up sending myself back upwards for a bit before I could kill the engines. This cost me a bit of fuel... I then had to do a second burn to bring my speed down again, when I got close too the ground. But I ran out of fuel in the descent stage, and while trying to panic start the second stage to slow down, ended up running out of time. crash...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttempt 2: Waited a little longer for the suicide burn timer to get closer.

This payed off in the end. I was able to slow down the craft to a nice safe-ish speed close too the ground, and pulse/idle the lander down the rest of the way. Not the most efficient way to land, but it did leave me with a lot more delta-V then I had initially calculated for this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/Tylolanded1_zpsnbgvwys1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Tylolanded1_zpsnbgvwys1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E129m/s of delta-V, I\u0027m quite happy with that.

The Lamp Post landings are becoming routine and are getting easier every time I do them.
