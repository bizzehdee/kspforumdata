Launching from the hanger fixes this.\n\nJoystick highly recommended. =P\n\n**Specs:** *Rev i.*\n\nStall: -50m/s[*clean*]\n\nTop Speed: 550\u002Bm/s [*Mach 1.6*]\n\nCeiling: 13,000m\n\nRange: Currently Untested\n\nPayload: 3000kgs external stores, plus internals\n\nMax G: \u002B/-12\n\n*More soon ...* \n\n**Rev c.**\n\n-\u003ERear canards added on the engines. Aircraft is far more stable now but will still pull \u002B/-7 g\\\u0027s in a turn or as high as 9 in a loop without losing pitch control.\n\n**Rev g.**\n\n-\u003EEngines reduced to single nacelles and mounted beneath rear wing area\n\n-\u003ETail fins switched to a slanted configuration\n\n-\u003EAll active flight surfaces doubled\n\n-\u003EFour individually releasable bombs added for air to ground harassment of those dirty kerbmunists. 8)\n\n**Rev i.**\n\n-\u003ERefitted for intercontinental flight, fuel payload increased to 3500kg\n\n-\u003EDrop tanks now drop in pairs, so you don\\\u0027t have to re-trim the aircraft for asymmetry every time you drop one\n\n-\u003EEngines can be individually toggled. This didn\\\u0027t seem to work without separate fuel feeds. Be ready to trim.\n\n-\u003ECan easily make it to KSC2 [1500kg\u002B fuel remaining], probably better if you don\\\u0027t mind going slower.\n\n-\u003EOutstanding low level flight once clean [no external stores], can even knife edge pass if you\\\u0027re good with the controls.\n\n-\u003EWings reinforced, have pulled 12\u002B gs without airframe damage\n\n**Rev j.**\n\n-\u003EHeavily reinforced front landing gear, touch and go is now far easier."},{"CreatedByName":"wired2thenet","CreatedById":18275,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T08:08:51Z","Content":"This one was ... interesting ... to fly ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI stink at making aircraft, so some of these designs are helping me to understand the finer points. I do like this one, as well as one other I downloaded tonight (which was REALLY stable and almost got me off-continent)."}]}
