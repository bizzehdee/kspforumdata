Since its only mission is to orbit Kerbin and land, this could be easily accomplished by autonomous systems. How would Curiosity make it to the surface of Mars if it needed human operators every second it executed a burn or a turn? Do NASA and the Air Force have a guy in Mission Control with a joystick and keyboard constantly regulating the thrust and directional changes of every Atlas V rocket they send into orbit?
