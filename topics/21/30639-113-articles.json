So far, I just find the lower AoA that doesn\u0027t make me burn up, and ride it all the way to engine cutoff at \u0026gt;20kms and about 800m/s... but I think 1km/s is doable is I get the cutoff height better defined and manage vertical speed accordingly (I need KER installed, like yesterday). Probably the ultimate limit is the thermal barrier, as it should be, but piloting it will require \u003Cem\u003Elots\u003C/em\u003E of practice. But in some ways SSTOs are easier to pilot now, and the ride up to orbit is certainly MUCH faster.
