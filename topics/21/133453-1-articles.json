Aka the engines want to be at an angle at all times witch causes stability issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the problem is that it is physically impossible for me to make them point straight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Because of how infernal robotics works, the only things that will make the part to witch the rotatron is added and the part that is added to the rotatron collide with each other is landing gears and landing legs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding gears worked \u0022ok\u0022 for me, they made the engines point more straight, but because i can\u0027t use mirroring it\u0027s very hard to get them to be mirrored, since even the slightest miss alignment will cause the engines to point on different directions, witch in turn causes the aircraft to go off course and crash (happened to me at one point but i fixed the problem later on).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven at this point they don\u0027t make the engines point straight enough. I was able to fix all the stability issues, but because of the looseness of the engines they tend to explode (only the back engines do) and take a chunk of the aircraft with them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. And again because of how Infernal robotics work, i can\u0027t strut them up of they will be stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. I wanted to use powered hinges on the back engines (none of these problems would have existed), but for some reason they pretended to be pistons (either it\u0027s a bug or they just don\u0027t like to be pointed the other way around) and just broke my engines before moving even one degree down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A0JyWW4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A0JyWW4.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes that was me flying in a straight line. I guess i just made a more modern version of the Heinkel Grief (Nickname: \u0022Flying Zippo\u0022) witch was a WW-2 german Heavy bomber whose engines (two per propeller) would randomly catch fire mid flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven altough i said to myself that i\u0027m not gonna give up that easy, That pick above was the point in witch i just gave up. If it can\u0027t fly in a straight line without exploding there\u0027s no chance that i could make it any better since i tried pretty much every trick in my book.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll and all, it works but it\u0027s a hit or miss.
