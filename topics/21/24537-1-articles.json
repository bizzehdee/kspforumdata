This little rover with its intuitive delivery system is perfect for your first ground exploration of new territory. Although the delivery system\u0027s range is untested, it can easily get to minmus, even landing on the interplanetary stage. On the ground, the ant can reach top speeds of ~15m/s, more if on a slope. In low gravity planets, the sole probe body also has enough gyroscopic torque to completely flip itself over, so getting stuck shouldn\u0027t be a problem. This rover is also very sturdy, and i have yet to destroy it in normal use.
