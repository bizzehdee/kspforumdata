The result of a lot of struts and structural pieces!. Made by Fat Kerbal Interstellar Transit [FKIT] and Kerbperial Empire. Some of it flies, some of it is too big to fly and some of it is just for show (AT-AT for example). Feel free to play around with the craft files since I have not included any launch harnesses. But rest assured - I have managed to get some of the smaller fighters into orbit without too much drama!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loocas","CreatedById":28256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T16:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey look awesome.
