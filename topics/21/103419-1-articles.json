It needs B9 aerospace and tweakscale, aswell as infernal robotics.![BWOyYoH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BWOyYoH.jpg)\n\nIt\u0027s mostly for the aesthetics, i tried my best! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAlso my first post here, hope y\u0027all like it!\n\n-jappie2\n\n![BWOyYoH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BWOyYoH.jpg)\n\n![ZKqe6WZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZKqe6WZ.jpg)\n\n![PmtSieg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PmtSieg.jpg)\n\n![J5VVfAn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/J5VVfAn.jpg)\n\n![aBrbHPa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/aBrbHPa.jpg)\n\n![bn4rTWw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bn4rTWw.jpg)"}]}
