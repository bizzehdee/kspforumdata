Often, it is in one of these points in time that a breakthrough happens - a breathtakingly new, revolutionary design, that, while maybe not changing the present, points a way to a future of going faster, higher, and further, whilst also making so much more awesome noise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has now become evident that one of these breakthroughs has happened at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently, a single photo was released apparently showing a new secret aerial vehicle after its first crewed flight in near darkness. However, the picture was not too revealing, and some areas that presumably contained technical information were censored. However, we can now report that this first flight was conducted by Jebdo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0LS4XAd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220LS4XAd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday however, the KSC has released a full set of images for each of the second, third, and fouth flight of the vehicle now known as the \u0022Komet\u0022, and has been more forthcoming with information about this remarkable craft - a radical new design that combines a new type of wing, called the \u0022Delta-wing\u0022 and made of plywood, with a powerful hypergolic rocket engine. It seems that its designers, once in a mood of boundless progress, also decided to not only completely eliminate the tailplane, but also design a gear that is dropped instead of retracted, which necessitates landing on a skid. To alleviate the pilot from fear of these newfangled features, the single seat has been carefully and closely surrounded by a barrage of tanks for the highly explosive rocket fuel, encouraging the aviator to instead focus on expending said fuel in the designated combustion chamber as prescribed by the manual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur dear reader may notice that on other, more grown-up and realistic planets, such as Earth is rumoured to be, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_163_Komet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esuch a crazy kontraption could never possibly have been built, much less flown\u003C/a\u003E. On Kerbin, however, it has now become a reality to combine a fast, docile glider and a rocket into one vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we present the full image series of the three flights. One of these photos even contains the overlay with technical data, indicating that a considerable altitude was attained. However, some of the information may be misleading. For example, our expert consultants tell us that the multiple engine readings in the bottom left corner are likely just different gauge readings from what almost certainly is the same, single engine, as additional instrumentation is common practice during flight testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESiena: Late Evening Ascent\u003C/strong\u003E - high altitude test\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/kYanm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Not by numbers but by character, it resembles many of the reported characteristics of its real counterpart. That skid, for example, only works with prepared airfields - landing anywhere else leads to violent destruction of the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/xqeyf4x55fr6t5e/Komet.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file link\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstructions (omit reading these if you are up for a challenge):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eafter loading, leave throttle on 50%\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethere is only one steam generator and one engine, they just have several gauges in the display :-)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Estage once to start steam generator\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Estage again for engine ignition\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Earound 20m/s, hit Z for maximum thrust AND pull up hard - prepare to correct roll!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Estage the gear as soon as this seems a good idea\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Edon\u0027t panic if you stall and spin at high altitude: with SAS off, the plane will sort itself out at lower altitude.
