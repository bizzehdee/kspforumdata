Actually, I got it on the first try! What a rarity in KSP! I use a very simpy launch stage, w/ 4 large srbs, 2 LVT 30s, both onion staged to the core, 2 bi coupled LVT 45s. Next is a Trans-munar injection stage, with 2 radially mounted aerospikes. Finally, the lander sits on it\u0027s throne. I designed it to be space friendly, leaving no debris, so the munar injection stage collides with the Mun. I\u0027ll attempt to add the photos...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rPYUFzj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rPYUFzj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5Tr3Y6V.png\u0022 alt=\u00225Tr3Y6V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I would love to see other people\u0027s designs, so feel free to show them off!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LePadeaux","CreatedById":61990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T14:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESmallest practical design I could come up with.
