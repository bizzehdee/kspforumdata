I\u0027ve browsed this section of the forums for a long time and have been constantly amazed at everything you all produce and share. If possible, I\u0027d like to contribute and share a fighter / interceptor I\u0027ve been working on for a little while. I\u0027m not too sure how people like clipped parts but I really really like this plane. It\u0027s handles well and has a tendency to nose up during flight. It\u0027ll take off around 150 m/s and can cruise at 3.0 - 4.0 mach pretty easily at higher altitudes, and has a pretty long range. Be careful, however, because at extremely high-g maneuvers it will break up. Under normal circumstances, it\u0027s pretty durable and you have to really try to break the plane apart.\n\nI hope everyone enjoys this plane! Critiques and opinions are always welcome! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Happy flying! \n\n![2jatLad.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2jatLad.jpg)\n\n![fieBpi7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fieBpi7.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T00:41:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 12:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tyler87**\n  \nwording / grammar"}]}
