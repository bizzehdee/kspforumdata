It needs the Wobly Rockets, Triple \u0026amp; Radial Parachutes parts to make. It\u0027s the product of a line of predecessors, some byzantine others simple like this the finished product. The final improvement was moving from boosters\u002B2-stages, to a booster\u002B3-stages design, splitting the big, double fuel tank and adding some lighter LF engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can routinely push this design to a 40-60 kms high before even starting the NERVA for the orbit stabilizing burn... and the later has more than enough juice for that, deorbiting and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boosters of the craft are recoverable, and so is the 1st stage.... and the 2nd stage if it somehow survives re-entry. The 3rd stage contains a NERVA engine and the command pod can *NOT* be detached, as leaving nuclear material scattered is very bad PR. (Actually it\u0027s possible to land the command \u0027stage\u0027 with the engine alone).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re \u0027cost\u0027 conscious, you may probably get away with using only 6 medium boosters, as well as removing the engines of the second stage (but keep the fuel!), the previous versions all flew with that design...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
