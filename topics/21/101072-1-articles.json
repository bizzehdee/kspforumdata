The probes can return and dock to the main plane which return to kerbin, so we wont have to leave the poor kerbals in space. I figured I would share for others who may get some fun out of kerbals flying these utterly underpowered probes around space like a WW1 Fighter Plane, 4 at a time. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74770478/Astroid%20Recon%20Space%20Plane.craft](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74770478/Astroid%20Recon%20Space%20Plane.craft)\n\n![2015-03-01_00001.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74770478/2015-03-01_00001.jpg)\n\n![2015-03-01_00002.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74770478/2015-03-01_00002.jpg)\n\n![2015-03-01_00003.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74770478/2015-03-01_00003.jpg)\n\n![2015-03-01_00004.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74770478/2015-03-01_00004.jpg)\n\nMods Required:\n\nB9 Aerospace\n\nMechJeb2\n\nKW Rocketry\n\nEdit: Just realized I never put my landing gear up xD\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T22:45:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 10:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rich1051414**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T22:22:02Z","Content":"Seems interesting, what mods does it use?\n\n(Also, hate to criticize, but you misspelt \u0022Asteroid\u0022 as \u0022Astroid\u0022.

I believe the only parts used other than stock were from mechjeb, b9 aerospace, and I may of used some RCS from KW Rocketry. As for the misspelling, I would love to say it was intentional. Astroid is actually another thing entirely, and has to do with circles within circles making a \u0027inverted\u0027 rounded square. Seeing as the plane is a vessel capable of lunar orbits(orbit within orbits) and returns, and launches 4 probes, it would be a clever pun, but alas, it was only a misspelling ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
