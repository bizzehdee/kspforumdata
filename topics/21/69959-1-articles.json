Which means lag prevents me from getting a nice dock, and solid structure. It should work, as some of the sections have docked perfectly. But the drive section keeps linking by only 1 dock, so will completely fly off if ever powered up. I might retry with a second, smaller tank, drive section, or reduce the part count (by making a second one! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, that sounds a good idea... will be launching a slightly smaller drive section to dock to it easier soon.

That will gut down on 50\u002B parts you don\u0027t need and you can still send it anywhere. You can also ditch the adapters as they are overly heavy dead mass that serve no function other than aesthetics (which won\u0027t be too compromised if you remove them). Delta V-wise, you could run a grand tour without refueling with that thing. Now, with that much fuel you are probably getting diminishing returns, which is where more fuel is not the answer. You have so much mass that adding more fuel mass is barely increasing or even decreasing your total delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHIS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img13/8320/67nb.png\u0022 alt=\u002267nb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecan go to any planet, refuel via a kethane miner, and then go to any other planet or home. 12 nukes, 8 jumbos worth of fuel, up to 90 tons towing capacity (that I\u0027ve tested, possibly up to 100 if I add a bit more fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T20:01:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.
