I\u0027ve got a $16k \u0022Kerbal Rescuer\u0022, a $10k Satellite with launcher, and a $13k satellite/probe launcher which is capable of putting a bird into any Kerbal, Mun or Minmus orbit, landing on Minmus or possibly the moon, and possibly other planets or moons. The $10k one carries only a 100-gallon tank \u0026amp; 20 gals of \u0022jet fuel\u0022. I think I can get a bird in orbit for about 20 gallons of rocket fuel, but I\u0027m having stability issues with the really tiny ones.

I had to use an inertial stabilizer, so it was still $13k. Also, my prototype, 3-stage $16k bird launcher landed on the Mun \u0026amp; returned safely to Kerbal with a no-chute landing. I threw away the second stage before I landed on the Mun, which might have had enough fuel in it to get to Munar orbit, and I still had a bit to spare after I landed on Kerbal.
