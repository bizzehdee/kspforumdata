It started as a proof of concept project that I was too lazy to clean up:wink:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScriptKitt3h, the ramp is hinged with those detachable structural pylons. Their connection is flexible, allowing the landing legs to bend the ramp down, but stiff enough to snap the ramp back up when the legs are retracted. The ramp is secured in the closed position with one of those asteroid-grabby arm things.
