I don\u0027t really want to use mods and I realize movement will be difficult but I am going to try it anyway. Does anybody have any ideas on how it should be built or what it should be capable of? I might use reaction wheels as hinges for arms and such. I have my own ideas but I am curious what the KSP community would put on a robot if they could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klond","CreatedById":38787,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-10T16:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154716-mecha-pigeon/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=2915161\u0026amp;embedComment=2915161\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-2915161\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0My answer was fake wings, a beak,\u00A0and guano.\u00A0 Balancing on 2 legs is hard (a tail helps).\u00A0 Download the pigeon, maybe you\u0027ll get some ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I would use grabbers for hands if you\u0027re gonna do arms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Hell, just do a Trojan Centaur on wheels.\u00A0 Forgot the leg movement crap, make it huge, and you get arms as a bonus.\u00A0 Then stuff all your kerbals up in the belly.\u00A0 Alright we\u0027re going off the rails here but make it breath fire too.\u00A0 Jeb can sit on top of the whole thing, king-of-the-world style.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
