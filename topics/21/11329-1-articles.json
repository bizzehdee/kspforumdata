It was my quickest design so far, only taking about 10 minutes, but that was all I needed because it worked first time! \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ykRyHzL4Q8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**4) Twin Propeller Aircraft**\n\nFor this one, I used the Damned Aerospace Mod ([http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10138.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10138.0))\n\nIt managed to fly around 340km north, but I\\\u0027m sure that with more fuel we could make it to the north pole (my goal!)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/g2TGaDk8uqM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**BONUS) Triple Fuselage Plane**\n\nHere\\\u0027s a Bonus plane! I had a youtube video for it, so I think it is a fun plane to modify and play around with, so here it is. (Sorry about the quality, I\\\u0027ve now got Vegas Pro, and I\\\u0027ve fixed the letter-boxing now!)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLJqwMZ8T38?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThanks for visiting, I will upload more soon. \n\nIf you liked these planes, have a look at my youtube channel for more videos!
