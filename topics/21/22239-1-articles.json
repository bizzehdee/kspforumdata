And so I am also introducing here - the Nuculus I! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0pYxYl.png\u0022 alt=\u00220pYxYl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn abject defiance of mild environmentalist protests and massive outraged games-should-be-hard-dammit-ist protests, the Nuculus offers a NERVA engine and well over 3 km/s of delta-V on the final stage - enough to allow an easy return from Jool at the cost of a 7% weight increase and correspondingly more difficult landing and takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrainer versions (plane only, no boosters) of both planes are also available - so you can try them out and practice your landings on Kerbin. (Or just crash the Nuculus trainer on Moho - it has a pretty good shot at making it there all by itself!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used my weird customized Kerbal Engineer Redux for design and flying, but I (think I) removed the parts for posting, so the .craft files below are all stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch out for the Space Cthulhu when you\u0027re on the pad. I decided to make this a freestanding rocket (no space for the towers) and it often loses an engine or two if you timewarp before launch. (Just end the mission and restart.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Jool transfer window happens when Jool is 96.58 degrees in front of Kerbin. (Thanks, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eksp.olex.biz\u003C/a\u003E!) Your ejection angle if you go into an 85-90 km parking orbit is 114 degrees from Kerbin prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that Jool moves about .12 degrees per hour, so if you launch when Jool\u0027s right at 97 degrees, that\u0027ll give you a couple hours to get into orbit and escape Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to launch just before sunset, both because it\u0027s pretty and because I achieve orbit at about the right spot for my escape burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Landing gear up. SAS on. Throttle to full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) When the first stage SRBs burns out, stage once to drop them and again to light the second stage SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Stage again to drop the second stage SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) At 10,000 meters, begin a gravity turn to 45 degrees. BE CAREFUL. If you turn too fast, the spaceplane wings will catch the wind, and you\u0027ll lose control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) When the liquid boosters burn out, you should have an apoapsis of 85-89 km. Cut the engines and begin your coast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Stage to separate the liquid boosters. MAKE SURE the throttle is at zero when you do this, otherwise you\u0027re likely to crash into them. Puff your engine (tap Shift, count to two, press X) to help clear the spent tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Pitch to horizontal. Throttle back up about 30 seconds before apoapsis. Achieve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) You\u0027ll have a little bit of fuel left - I suggest firing it off when you pass your ejection angle; it\u0027ll raise your apoapsis to 300-400 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) Stage to drop the orbital insertion booster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) The interplanetary stage is four strap-on boosters - they should have plenty of fuel to get you to Laythe if you aerobrake at Jool. (119.5 km Jool periapsis should do the trick. I can\u0027t give you advice on a Laythe aerobraking altitude - it seems to be between 20 and 25 km. You can do a direct descent if you have to but it\u0027s really scary.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb can almost fly this craft to orbit, but it doesn\u0027t know that it has to throttle down when detaching the liquid boosters or it\u0027ll hit them with the main engine. So to fly using MechJeb, I recommend the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Edit path, set Turn End Altitude to 40 and Final Flight Path Angle to 40.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Set Orbit Altitude to 85km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Auto-Warp Toward Apoapsis to OFF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Launch - you can stage the SRBs manually or let MechJeb do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) When MechJeb shuts off the engines to coast to apoapsis, there should be only a tiny bit of fuel remaining in the boosters. Stage manually to drop them during the coast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Fly normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Stage to drop your interplanetary boosters. Don\u0027t wait too long; if you do this in the atmosphere they\u0027re liable to hit something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Set the plane at an angle of attack of 20-30 degrees and switch on SAS for re-entry. Once you hit atmosphere, don\u0027t touch the controls until you get under 300 m/s - the plane will be very unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The jet engines will have switched on when you dropped the boosters - if you\u0027re going to hit water, you can always throttle up and fly to a continent to land, but you\u0027ll have that much less fuel for liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Continue to glide until you start to see your shadow, then flare to a 30- or 40-degree angle of attack. Try to get your surface velocity under 45 m/s if you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) At the last moment, let your nose start to come down so you don\u0027t lose your jets when they hit the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Don\u0027t hold down the brakes or you\u0027ll tip over; tap them to slow down gradually. Re-engage the SAS, or don\u0027t - it\u0027s up to you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Throttle up your jets. Release the parking brake if it\u0027s set. Try to find a liftoff direction that sets your wings level - it makes it a lot easier to recover from bumps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Be alert for bumps. You can recover - especially if you have a joystick - but you need to be quick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) At 100-120 m/s, start to pull up. If you go over a ridge at this point, you\u0027ll be airborne - be ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If you\u0027re not already heading east, turn. Pull up to 45 degrees and set the SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Wait until your surface velocity stops increasing, then stage to fire the central engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) The jets will still have a bit of power before they\u0027re totally useless. Wait until your vertical velocity starts to fall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Stage to drop the jet engines. The plane\u0027s nose will jerk down from their backwash - don\u0027t worry, let the SAS recover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Wait until the two side rockets burn out. You should be in a high suborbital trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Cut your engines to coast, and stage to release the wings. Use the final engine to establish orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) If you\u0027re using the nuclear final stage, you should have enough fuel to leave Laythe orbit, descend to a low periapsis over Jool, and burn to a Kerbin intercept. If you\u0027re using the LV-909, you\u0027ll have to be creative. Good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Resender","CreatedById":18274,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T12:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m impressed and this has given me an idea to get my space shutlle onto new worlds\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceGibsy","CreatedById":20515,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T12:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow thats a nice design!
