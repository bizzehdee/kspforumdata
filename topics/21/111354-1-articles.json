Leaving BrixCo with eorin then deciding that this was a great idea and having a tiny little company that I spent too much time on the op learning BBcode for xD. And it\u0027s grown into this; a bustling community with experience known to many people on the forums and having a successful youtube channel devoted to just ksp and building pretty planes. Thanks so much (I really mean this) for great times and a home on the forums."},{"CreatedByName":"Thingymajigy","CreatedById":136332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T08:39:16Z","Content":"The sparrowhawk comes with a revolutionary multifunction feature that provides the bird enhanced survivability in the wild.
