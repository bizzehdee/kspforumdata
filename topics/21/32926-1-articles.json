I am writing my own missions based on what I had down in my Excel worksheet.. Only this time I will also release the mission pack to you guys when its done.. Its going to be pretty big.. And have many different plot lines in it. It will also be based a little different then some of the other ones I have seen.. The whole package is going to be desiegned to work along side you Sandbox game. That means the payouts will be adjusted for you can run what you want on the side.. And have enough money..
