Thought I\u0027d have some fun trying to make a super heavy missile carrier. I might have gotten a little carried away already. So far the Carrier it\u0027s self is nothing more then a rolling chassis. Ok, to be honest, it\u0027s not just a rolling chassis. I have a fully implemented custom suspension installed on it that lets each wheel move up and down freely, more then the wheels suspension would allow, using heavy landing gear as the shock absorbers. It has a row of short trusses for each wheel that can flex freely letting each wheel move independently. This lets it contour to the ground nicely, improving stability. Only issue is the wheels want to twist while steering at the moment and I don\u0027t know how to fix this, yet, without reducing the flex of the suspension. The wheel assembly twists/rotates clockwise or counterclockwise while steering, causing them to bind up a little. Usually just the front or rear wheels do this.\n\n![zackmissilecarrierchassie_zps5aimvji0.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/zackmissilecarrierchassie_zps5aimvji0.jpg)\n\nAll the wheels are in full contact with the ground in this pic. It\u0027s a bit deceptive though.\n\nIt\u0027s current weight, as a rolling chassis, is 91 Tons. It has a top speed of 13 m/s. And it can cross most terrain with little trouble. Due to it\u0027s mass, it acts like a battering ram and can take out any building in the KSP with just a \u0022love tap\u0022 at 4 m/s. It\u0027s only issues are the wheel twist while turning and the trouble it has with crossing the \u0022rails\u0022 between the VAB and the launch pad(due to the wheels twisting instead of climbing).\n\nPlanned weaponry:\n\n1: a single massive F.R.E.D multi-missile(added, but it\u0027s so large it becomes dangerous to maneuver the Zack, might remove it...)\n\n2: 2-4 Arget, guided anti-armor missiles(added)\n\n3: at least 4 heavy M-Beam missiles\n\n4: 2 racks of 12 light M-Beam missiles\n\n5: possibly a ramming prow of some type.\n\nAny ideas on how to fix the wheel twist would be appreciated.\n\nInfo:\n\nF.R.E.D = Fragged Radiated Exploded Demolished. It\u0027s a multi-missile with 24 cluster bomblets, 8 M-Beam kinetic penetrators, and an eject-able outer casing.\n\nArget = small guided missile using an M-Beam kinetic penetrator warhead with enough fuel to fly 4-5 Km. Highly maneuverable.\n\nGear = Part of the suspension. Needs to be reset upon deployment and sometimes while firing missiles. Reset by raising the gear then lowering them again.\n\nMissile launch stabilizers = Using action group 1 to deploy them, then raising the main gear for the suspension, allows some of the weight to be moved off the wheels, hopefully preventing them from being damaged by the recoil of the missile.\n\nFinished product available here: [Zack missile carrier(finished)](http://www./download/4piip46aw1ralvy/Zack_missile_carrier%28finished%29.zip) Replace the craft file if you downloaded the older in testing version.\n\nLink to the post discribing the final result is here: [LINK](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112692-Zack-100-Ton-Missile-Tank-Rover%28wip%29?p=1780656\u0026viewfull=1#post1780656)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T21:22:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T20:03:59Z","Content":"![zackmissilecarrierfred_zps1ab67eh5.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/zackmissilecarrierfred_zps1ab67eh5.jpg)\n\nF.R.E.D missile equipped along with 4 Arget anti-armor guided missiles. Also added the crew cabin for the lone Kerbal to rain down some pain. And hopefully be able to repair any damage it might receive from launching FRED.\n\nThe vehicle now has a set of heavy landing gear underneath to stabilize it when the main missile is being launched, and a slightly improved suspension.(less wheel twist... only a little though...) The stabilizing gear is deployed separately from the main suspension gear.\n\nDownload for testing purposes: [Zack missile carrier](http://www./download/69err1zvklze8z6/Zack_missile_carrier.zip)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T00:27:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 12:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T20:19:15Z","Content":"Ohw ... no download link yet. \n\nI\u0027ll be patient ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T20:28:50Z","Content":"If you had girders between your wheels, it should reduce the twisting while allowing the wheels to translate up and down...\n\nThen again, I haven\u0027t seen your suspension mechanism... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T00:22:29Z","Content":"The suspension is rudimentary.

The small girders have no reinforcing so are able to flex quite a bit. Struts are connected from the small girders to the wheel assembly to reduce twisting. The struts also connect the girder arms to each other, but only at the end, reducing horizontal movement. The heavy landing gear goes from the upper XL girders, which are reinforced, to the girder segment right next to the wheel assembly, pushing it down. The weight of the vehicle compresses both the suspension on the wheel assemblies and the heavy landing gear. This combo gives much larger movement then the wheel assemblies alone would have.\n\nNothing really breakthrough, but it\u0027s functional. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T00:47:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 12:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T00:46:44Z","Content":"Who needs suspention when you have sheer weight?

The ladder in front lets you EVA your Kerbal pilot to repair the wheels if they get damaged as well.\n\nTotal weight: 160.8 Tons\n\nPart count: 1122 parts...\n\nWhen deployed, the Zack will have it\u0027s stabilizing gear deployed and the suspension gear retracted. This is to prevent it from damaging the runway the moment gravity sets in. Once it is settled, EVA your Kerbal to the control seat first, if you plan on doing so, otherwise the suspension gets reset... After your Kerbal is in his \u0022hot seat\u0022, Use the landing gear button to engage the suspension. Letting this completely engage and settle, you can now use action group 1 to raise the stabilizing gear. The tank is now free to move. Move with some caution until the FRED missile has been deployed. It will wobble about a bit as you move.\n\nIt has a lot of stages. Each stage is for a seperate weapon and can be moved around as wanted. It has a few too many weapons to simply use action groups to fire them... Firing the FRED missile early is probably the safest bet. Both the FRED missile and the 4 Argets can be remote controlled by switching too them as soon as they are fired, or by dropping the thrust too 0 so you can have more time to switch to them. SAS recommended for the big missiles, but not needed for the missile carrier its self.\n\nDownload: [HERE](http://www./download/4piip46aw1ralvy/Zack_missile_carrier%28finished%29.zip) or on first post.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T21:23:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 09:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**"}]}
