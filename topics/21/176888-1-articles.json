This Arleigh Burke class inspired (basically just a replica) ship is built in a more realistic manner, as opposed to the usual KNS ships with their MK-3 hulls and low part counts/sizes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship features nothing all that special or groundbreaking, but it has a few neat details. These details include an IR powered gunturret with included camera (too see what your shooting at better), some animated comms/radar stuff, working props (can\u0027t be used right now as they will just act as paddle-wheels due to the almost antigrav nature of the ships flotation), and of-course the full hull with actually working rudders (normally have to use engines on the bow to turn).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and there\u0027s of-course the ships paint job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason the ship looks like it\u0027s levitating, is because of the tweakscaled wings that now have insane buoyancy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of these features, i decided not to add this to the KNS post, it shall instead remain as a possibly one-off 1:1 ship build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started the build by placing down four wings that marked the length and width of the ship, then it was on to making the rest of side of the hull (upper part first). after that it was a matter of getting the deck and the lower-hull made. once those where done, it was on to the superstructure. Height of the ship was eyeballed. I was kinda expecting to have a lot of crashes while building this, but thankfully not, it helped quite a bit to exit and re-enter the hangar every now and then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeapons in this thing was a pretty interesting conundrum, how am i supposed to carry near 90 missiles (SAM (Surface To Air) and Cruise on the real one), and 8 ASM\u0027s (Anti-Ship-Missile) onboard. Well, i really cant, but i did find a way to carry quite a lot without compromising realism too much. All the ASM\u0027s, or cruise-missiles in this case are carried externally on top of the hangar, and the other missiles are carried in the 2 missile cell\u0027s that are actually \u0022Patriot\u0022 launchers turned upright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227EbMccx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7EbMccx.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis allows the ship to carry 32 SAM\u0027s witch should be plenty to down any aircraft. I placed the launcher\u0027s where the forward CIWS (Close In Weapon System) would have been located. I moved it a little lower on to an external platform like the one on the JMSDF\u00A0 (Japan Maritime Self Defence Force) Kongo class GMD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launchers needed to be placed there because i wanted to make sure that the launch tubes would be completely clear. I was basically afraid that the entire ship would explode if i launched a missile that was partially clipped by wings and such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Yna7JdR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Yna7JdR.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case your wondering about access, the hangar at the back is open and has enough space to fit something like the Seahawk (could hold 2 if rotors could be folded), and there are \u0022doors\u0022(lander cans that i originally saw \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145841-triop/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022145841\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145841-triop/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Triop\u003C/a\u003E use as crew doors) littered around the ship that allow you to transfer crew to different parts of the ship: bow, mid-deck, hangar and wings of the bridge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227QVmJdp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7QVmJdp.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case your wondering that if there\u0027s a way to fix this levitation issue, their really isn\u0027t, and trust me, i tried.
