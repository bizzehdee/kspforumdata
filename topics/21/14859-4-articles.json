It looks like Kosmos and Novapunch have already been added, so I\u0027ll have to see what else I used in my space station. I want to ask the thread this, or perhaps you can put it on the front page, but I have a variety of large ships that use mainly Kosmos as structural pieces and NP as the delivery vehicle - a Kerbin orbiter, smaller Mun orbiter (smaller in comparison to my kerbin orbiter) and a Munar lander. I could feasibly get any of these vehicles to either Moon, and I wouldn\u0027t mind if the rest of the community gave me a location of where to pilot it to and which vehicle to put up. On the two orbiters, if ISA Mapsat and/or the Muon detector haven\u0027t been added (they aren\u0027t really necessary for the community file, I guess) I could replace them with more body sections or crew tanks for balance and giving people a place to EVA to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s KLOSS IV (Kerbin Low-Orbit Space Station - would be MOSS for Munar or Minmussian orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/23Hug.png\u0022 alt=\u002223Hug.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENebo Orbiter - A smaller orbiter meant mainly for ISA/Muon detection.

I could probably toss a rover on the Methodios Base so people have stuff to play with once they get there and land it near a Mun arch or something. Also, for the Nebo orbiter I did a .cfg edit of DJY\u0027s Crew Tank so that it fits under the 1m command pod and holds 2 Kerbals and was rebalanced for fuel and mass and stuff. It functions just like the normal crew tank - you must have the command pod full or else you won\u0027t be able to take Kerbals out of the crew tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah.

I modded the part.cfg of the telescope so it really behaves like a telescope i.e. it has several camera\u0027s inside with several magnifications (alter maginification by pressing F7 or F8). The link to the modified part.cfg will be below. If you want to use it default, add the MuMechLib.dll as required plugin. The camera part is not required for the telesope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/47942810/screenshot119.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot119.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the original craftcraft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/47942810/screenshot128.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot128.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the craft after removal of the arms and the addition of some extra solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/47942810/screenshot135.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot135.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA picture of the second stage at half a kilometer as seen through the telesope at the biggest magnification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/47942810/screenshot138.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot138.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally a pretty picture of the Distant Observatory with Kerbin and the Mun as seen through a camera on the second stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe modified part.cfg: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/47942810/part.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/47942810/part.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new persistent.sfs file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/47942810/persistent.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/47942810/persistent.sfs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"khyron42","CreatedById":8551,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T13:39:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeautiful setup, both with and without the arms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been travelling the last couple of days, so I\u0027m (belatedly) bumping myself off the list, and request another turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBioman, you\u0027re up!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wildkittyv1","CreatedById":30893,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T13:44:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECardinal, why do you say that DA/DR doesn\u0027t work?
