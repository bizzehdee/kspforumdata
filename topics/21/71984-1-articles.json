It comes in 2 versions, the Normal One seen above and the \u0022Classic\u0022 Version which has an open cockpit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fn0nyQ7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Fn0nyQ7.jpg\u0022\u003E I have yet to record it\u0027s top altitude and top speed, but in the sunlight it has so many solar panels it can run both engines full throttle for an infinite amount of time as long as you are in sunlight. I am not posting In-flight photos yet as it seems the forums do not like me having too many pictures. The mods this craft uses are Firespitter Version 6.3 or later and KAX 2.0 or later. All other parts are stock. It has 270 parts. Download Links.
