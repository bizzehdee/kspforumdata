Traitors would reveal themselves by complaining about \u0027wanting to go home\u0027 or \u0027have to go bathroom\u0027.

But \u003Cem\u003EKermunist Surprise I\u003C/em\u003E is series of solid fuel boosters attached to side with series of radial connectors for easy dropping.

A few hundred meters of height and falling booster gets traitorous assembly crew, plus ice cream van some distances away to lower left.
