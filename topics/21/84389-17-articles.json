When the first image is processed it also queues up a\u00A0job which will process the other sizes, but on the background worker queue so\u00A0it can take as long as it likes without slowing the site down. \u00A0BUT this process has to change the definition of original back to a higher quality size so it can process the :medium and :wide thumbs from a higher res source (and then it will insist on uploading that, which would overwrite the already uploaded small thumb). \u00A0Thankfully I found how to change how it refers to\u00A0\u0027original\u0027 so I could give it\u00A0a slightly different name in the upload. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for each craft you wind up with\u00A0four\u00A0images, ie for craft with id 4242 you get 4242.jpg (which is the small thumb), 4242_medim.jpg, 4242_wide.jpg and 4242_original.jpg, but the first (4242.jpg) is uploaded on it\u0027s own and quickly (by tricking it into thinking that it is the original) and the others get uploaded a bit later and the bulk of the work is done on the worker queue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis does mean that when you change a thumbnail or set one for the first time, the craft won\u0027t have it\u0027s higher res thumbnails so will use the lower res one until they\u0027ve been processed, but that\u0027s fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing that muggins here hadn\u0027t got right on my first go was setting the image storage up so that it could work with my CDN. \u00A0So up till now, images have been getting\u00A0served\u00A0directly out of the AWS storage (which has been racking up the number of GET requests substantially). \u00A0I\u0027ve now figured out how to set the image storage up correctly (I think) so it will take advantage of the CDN\u0027s caching and it also makes for nicer urls. \u00A0Before the image urls were something like\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003Es3.amazonaws.com/thumbs.kx/10138.jpg\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Enow they are t.kerbalx.com/10138.jpg\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the upshot of all that is multiple sized thumbnails are processed and stored without adding a slowdown to the site and that plus a\u00A0proper CDN setup should mean that pages with lots of craft thumbnails should load up really quite quickly (faster than it has been this week and MUCH faster than it was when the images were hosted on imgur, *smug-face). \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think there are still further gains to get out of tweaking the CDN, but I got some more learnin\u0027 to do!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I\u0027ve not changed yet is where forum signatures are being hosted from. \u00A0That will happen soon and I\u0027ll post about that. \u00A0Going to need people who have the sigs to change the url that they are pointing to.\u00A0I guess I\u0027ll just keep an eye out for people with them and send PMs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill no sign of activity from imgur. \u00A0I had one email back last week from a different support person who started with an apology for the delay in the reply and quickly and helpfully answered my questions and ended with saying that they hoped to hear back from me so they could re-evaluate the site and life the block. \u00A0I emailed back and ...........\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other rather odd thing is that the first support thread I opened when they said I\u0027d been blocked,\u00A0in which I detailed what I was doing to fix the problem\u00A0(which at that point was barking up the wrong tree) and asked if that was correct, was never answered and has now been deleted. \u00A0It was still an open request, but it\u0027s been removed from my support account without a trace. interesting. I am getting the feeling that an unfortunate dice roll has assigned me someone who doesn\u0027t care. \u00A0So I guess time to write to them again.......joyous.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-22T12:57:42Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2016 12:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T13:09:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood work.
