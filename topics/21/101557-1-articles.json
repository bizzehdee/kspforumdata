More air intakes. BTW air intakes compensate for low thrust ratios going into orbit. This is not avoidable with ION as it is heavy. Hence I use more air intakes to get into orbit. As many parts as this adds it\u0027s not as bad and using massless for electricity for ion!! \u003E\u003C (Also added more massless electricity and other items for easier munar decent.) I also added seperatrons to the rear to slow down decent for lunar landings.\n\nThis will be the possible new design for my Ion cluster engines in a nice craft form that can be flown(hopefully) to space and tested(If not it will attached to a larger ship.). This can be modified to be added to a larger craft as an Ion engine cluster with jets to help design a more complex Ion based vessel. As you can see it comes at a price though. Nearly 300 parts(mostly massless electric) and a large price tag. This when use will probably be designed to detach from the main ship fly and collect samples in orbit(or where ever it can get) and fly back to the main ship or ships.\n\nSo far this flies pretty nice. It has an interesting feel to it. And a nice low mass for hopefully better deltaV. Or am I using the wrong term?\n\nThis is at 18.74 but could go up to 18.75 weight before massless. Not sure what to put on though. This would make it 1/4 of 75 mass exactly. (heavier in updated version.)\n\nNot sure if it needs another torque for the front. It has one in the form of a drone base in the rear under all the batteries. (added in updated version)\n\nEdit for updated version: TIP for larger Air intakes. at around 64 air intakes per engine(and higher), thrust of the basic jets ends around 32k, Rapiers ends at around 42k, and Turbojets up to 69k. But the advantage of Rapier isn\u0027t it\u0027s duel role. It\u0027s it\u0027s ability to stack another engine on top! I could change the basic jet for a turbojet to help with the upper atmosphere but it would be harder to take off and consume more fuel potentially. If this was added to another vessel it would have turobjets elsewhere for getting into orbit. In this desing you can use the Ions in place of turbojets past 42k. Also, gain speed around or before 40k and before you hit the 42k mark or you will spend more xenon gas.\n\nParts:\n\n33 Ion engines (if they are all on it should say 16 Xenon gas at full throttle)\n\n1 Basic Jet\n\n1 Rapier Engine(it allows another on top of it.)\n\n(I forgot the RCS)\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=]()\n\nPic of updated version of craft:\n\n![\u003Ca  href=]()![%7Boption%7D](%7Boption%7D)http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-03-09%20104153\\_zpseplbzfhf.png\u0027 alt=\u0027Screenshot%20from%202015-03-09%20104153\\_zpseplbzfhf.png\u0027\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T14:44:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 02:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela**"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T23:57:26Z","Content":"[http://www.deviantart.com/art/KSP-Interstellar-lander-1-506355813](http://www.deviantart.com/art/KSP-Interstellar-lander-1-506355813)\n\nHoly crap!

Can\u0027t land on the moon. but possibly on the second moon. Can get to both. No large solar panels but more massless parts. Landing is tough but I think can be done if you control the throttle well enough. Can\u0027t do it personally though. Make sure you come in slow and probably long. I reduced the overall lift to reduce weight and part count. This makes it harder to land. I could also remove some more batteries and replace them with another set of wings overlayed on the old ones. That might make it easier to land. I beleive I avoided it because it shifted more parts to the weighted category to increase performance. But it\u0027s not that much weight. doubling the current wings and placing them on themselves for both wingsets will make it mostly stable if I\u0027m not mistaken.\n\n[http://www./download/6uhhbqyqjy5ay0k/Ion_craft_v3.craft](http://www./download/6uhhbqyqjy5ay0k/Ion_craft_v3.craft) \u003C- Vastly improved steering and landing/takeoff plus electricity exchanged for more lift(As mentioned above). Can now land pretty safely. Slightly heavier and will need to do more loops with the Ion engines to get to a target.\n\n[http://www./download/fcia49u4tzbeuuh/Ion_craft_v4.craft](http://www./download/fcia49u4tzbeuuh/Ion_craft_v4.craft) \u003C- Improved landing and takeoff again and added one generator. **(This is the best version atm!)** To take off flat from the run way: 1. Fly below 50km and float the front wheel in the air to the desired hieght(SAS may be helpful or needed for this). 2. Accelerate to takeoff speed and wait for plane to lift off. Do not let the rear of the craft hit the ground or you may destroy elevators or worse the jet engine. Above 40-50km the speed will drive the nose into the ground making it impossible to achieve early takeoff.\n\n334 parts and one landing assist item. Has interesting flight characteristics. It has a good satellite in it\u0027s nose also. Just scan with the nose cone and select send. It will pop out. These versions have RCS now also. I recommend Version 3 or 4 unless you don\u0027t care about landing. This vessel is very bouncy on landing though. Try to keep the nose down and come in slow and at a low angle if possible. This was a needed change to allow it to have early takeoff. Which you also need to be careful of. If the nose goes up to fast it will blow up a few elevators or the turbojet engine. Make sure to let it coast up into the air slowly if doing runway like takeoff. Using SAS helps this tremendously.\n\nAlso, you can fly it like a vtol if you fly it straight up and switch witch engines you use. Some variation of Ion and rapier, ion and turbojet, or the turbojets alone! I\u0027m not sure if this is usefull though given the plane can do what it needs already. Useful if you added rear landing struts maybe.\n\nTo increase range just add more groups of 8 xenon fuel by zooming in the inside from the top and placing them in the other tanks. Not sure how much can be added or how much range increased yet. I\u0027ll have to test this later.\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=]()\n\n![\u003Ca  href=]()![%7Boption%7D](%7Boption%7D)http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-04-17%20150533\\_zpsxllefovh.png\u0027 alt=\u0027Screenshot%20from%202015-04-17%20150533\\_zpsxllefovh.png\u0027\u003E\n\n^ Made it to minmus. Not sure how much fuel I wasted getting there.(Had enough left over to to explore quite a bit though.) But as you can see I fudged up the landing and crashed. It was at the right sped but I tried to do a maneuver and left the engines on and accidentally crashed. Either way there is my rocket pod engine minus the other stuff! ;p\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-18T12:47:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2015 12:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela**"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T11:15:24Z","Content":"I was just testing a minmus run and I left the apoapsis at about half way and let it run around until minmus came back(I accidentally oops and didn\u0027t refresh my energy early enough.). As I was running around at full fastforward it slung me out of Kerbins influence. It happened without spending any extra fuel. the only thing on was the SAS possibly and it used electricity. So gravity or something slung me out possibly with SAS turning around randomly. I wonder if it anything to do with the moons gravities colliding and slinging me too. Anyone run into this?\n\nEven now as it\u0027s accelerating with the SAS on around the sun it\u0027s expanding and virtually giving me a free duna sling. I\u0027m halfway to it\u0027s orbit. And SAS is on and the ship keeps going back and forth from the radial position I set it to point to. Might be because I had it on normal or prograde set it to another one then fastforwarded really fast. Either way it seems to be an electrically driven form of propulsion this way(or torque to be more specific). Does this count as legitimate transport or does it count as a cheat?\n\nCan anyone else fly this and reproduce this? it\u0027s version 4 of the craft.

It\u0027s either the torque or the gravity from the moons slung me there. The apoapsis stopped moving. Maybe it was already there.\n\nThis position did not cost me any xenon gas beyond what I had already spend halfway to minmus. Whatever slung me got me here without spending fuel. Edit: as I keep moving the torque it is an impact on the orbit.

It has about 9,000 Delta V once in orbit. and 450 Liquid fuel and 60 mono to get up there and do whatever. It now has 3 engines besides the Ions. Turbojet, Basic Jet, and Rapier. This gave it the oomph and versatility to get the max delta V I\u0027m willing to put up with without sacrificing flight time. BTW, it takes 2minutes exactly to get to 10,000km. It\u0027s not fast, but it\u0027s not too slow. Once in space do what you want. And if you really want delta v you could add in a lot more Xenon tank. 8 at a time gives approx 700 delta v per set of 8 tanks added on past the current tanks.
