I used a stack separator between the bottom and top part which does its job but seems I should have used a decoupler instead. Its lighter and a less violent separation for the bottom stage. Thing is its recessed into the bottom lander can and now I cant seem to get at it to select it to change it from a separator to a decoupler. I think the bottom lander can is the root part? The whole root part think confuses me somewhat. Also how do I save the entire LEM as a subassembly so I can build a rocket and then load the LEM? Attaching the LEM inline of a rocket is it best to use docking ports or decouplers? Anyways I hope someone can help out thanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g113/swinehund2/2015-01-29_00001_1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015-01-29_00001_1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T19:54:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrust me. You do not want to use this as your lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, it looks neat and probably can make it to Mun\u0027s surface and back but your Kerbal won\u0027t be able to get out. The hatch is obstructed by a Vernor engine. Besides that, I assume the bottom will remain on the surface while the upper part ascends to Munar orbit?

To work out the root thing: drop a probe core on the top docking port, and click the \u0022Select Root\u0022 gizmo. The fourth on the top let corner. Now click on any part once, and then on the probe core you just added, ideally once, but it can bug, so repeat until the whole ship is picked up when you do and the blue outline disappears. Congrats, the probe is now the root part and you can grab the whole LEM by clicking on the docking port and drop it in the subassemblies tab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce done that, you should also be able to grab the decoupler or the lower stage to replace it with some clever camera work, so you should be set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
