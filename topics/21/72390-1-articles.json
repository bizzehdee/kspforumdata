I\u0027ve ended up with hovercraft, planes that can take off horizontally from the launchpad, 3000 part ships, and things that run across the ground. Now, I have modified the parts some, mostly crash tolerance, RCS having 10 thrust units and being super efficient, and command pods needing no crew. That\u0027s all. Engines are the same, and fuel tanks only carry a little bit of extra mono propellant. The results are well worth it though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YGos0Lq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YGos0Lq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a little ship named 2. It runs on two legs, propelled by RCS. It can fly a little, but it is best on the ground. This one just so happened to run nearly 39 kilometers before tipping over and crashing, which is my farthest distance with this particular craft. The nice thing about these types of ships is that the Demo lacks wheels, so exploring the ground is difficult. With this I can run up and down the pyramids, stroll along the moon, or set speed and distance records on the glaciers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8EjVaqM.png\u0022 alt=\u00228EjVaqM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Maximallian Supership. Just to give you an idea of how big this thing is, that little dot on the launchpad is a kerbal. It actually does not fit all the way on the launchpad, but it is still capable of taking off, getting to space, and leaving the upper portion with enough fuel to get it into orbit. This works because it is using already successful ships as engines, simply tripled and put onto another ship capable of holding them. About 950 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e1WscyM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e1WscyM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContinuing with the Maximallian series, meet the Maximallian Colossus. 2,975 parts in its full version, the one pictured here is 600 parts less, just so that my computer could actually load it up (after 5-6 minutes). Due to limitations in computing power, this remains as more of a conceptual craft. It uses 3 of the Superships as engines, and most likely could actually take off. Unfortunately, every strut and fuel line managed to sever themselves in the VAB, so it just explodes when coded into orbit and the engines are activated. It\u0027s difficult to fix for a variety of reasons, one of which is it quite simply is too big to fit in the VAB, so I can\u0027t view the craft in its entirety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1rGJqzF.png\u0022 alt=\u00221rGJqzF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Grand Spiral. Can only be coded into orbit, but when its engines are lit and its arms curve around, the pure majesty of it all brings a tear to my eye. Then the violent explosions take place, spewing debris and fire. They\u0027re majestic, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all I have for the day. Plenty of other ships in my roster, but these are a good enough sampling for now.
