It seems to actually be about 90% of the time and I think the solution is to drop payload while putting in rcs input to take the box straight up (with the open bay facing down). Anyhow, I got everything unboxed.\n\nSecond problem that I have not been able to overcome, but I think will not be a big issue: There\u0027s a big battery sandwiched between two docking ports in box 2. It seems to be docked to the end of the ISRU and to the end of the C.R.A.D.L.E. So I decoupled the C.R.A.D.L.E.\u0027s docking port but it immediately re-docked and then the battery detached from the ISRU. So the battery ends up sticking with the C.R.A.D.L.E. - weird, but the ISRU seems to have plenty of power...\n\nThird problem (but I just figured it out!) is the three tubes. It was apparent that I needed to dock one of the modues to the center one and then separate it from the other two, but for the life of me I couldn\u0027t get it to dock! Then I realized that you stuck them together with the center tube docked to both other tubes and then rotated/offset them so they don\u0027t appear docked, so I put the rover and cupola module close to one of the ports on the center tube and then decoupled that tube and let the magnets take over. I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s what you intended, but it took me a while to figure that out!"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashTestDanny","CreatedById":151030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T02:37:00Z","Content":"Finally! It is completed!\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, I present to you Rune Base Alpha!!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/6IvUD)\n\nFor me, the turning point for completing my assembly was realizing that I had to undock the port on the center tube in that bundle of three and have the rover in position so that the tube would be captured and not fall to the ground. Rune mentions in an earlier post that if that tube falls to the ground, it\u0027s probably useless. After that the last two big problems were the fuel dump ended up on its back and has no source of torque, so it was stuck there, and the battery that I mentioned earlier that had fallen to the ground. I actually managed to overcome both of these issues in much the same way. I pushed the tank around with the rover a bit and it ended up on its end, which was not a lot better, but the rover has so much torque I was able to push right up against the tank and turn the rover on its end and then use its rcs to lift it so it would dock. Then I used its torque to right it and the tank. Since I knew the rover had enough torque for that, I took the same approach with the battery only keeping the tank on top for a compatible dock. That rover is really something else!

At least I do!\n\nThe game is slowly training me to hit F5 frequently... Unfortunately I did have to repeat my landings a few times... So legs - no, I didn\u0027t have them out when I unloaded the CRADLE - not for the fuel dump, at least. Would have preferred to do it that way, but the solar panel was being ripped off every time that way. It looks like the panel is clipped into the floor of the cargo bay when loaded, and so the cargo bay pulls it to the extended position while deploying and if there is any horizontal movement of the cargo bay before the panel is clear then it breaks it. So the trick for me - and I don\u0027t think it will work on the Mun - was to use RCS to fly the CRADLE as straight up as possible until it is clear of the panel and then get it the heck out of the way before it crashes onto something I don\u0027t want destroyed. I\u0027ve gotten pretty good at flying the empty CRADLES on minimus and managed to get all three stacked up together with only minor explosions.

Going in there\u0027s no issue, the game allows that for some reason, but then they become part of whatever they clipped into and when you separate the parts by undocking, they are still joined by the clipped part(s), so when you try to fly the CRADLE off, it pulls whatever was clipped and everything attached with it. My procedure above eliminates clipping of the gear by not extending them before the cradle is gone. B2 and B3 is a little trickier because the clipping is with the solar arrays, which are buried deep inside the cargo bay and should not be extending. I think they are getting clipped by the floor of the cargo bay due to settling. So I probably am not eliminating that clipping at all, but by lifting the CRADLE\u0027s weight slightly with the RCS, I allow the part to get unclipped before making the sudden move of removing the CRADLE.\n\nI think the solar array issues can be helped by making the outer edge of the solar array nearly flush with the surface you are attaching it to.

You think Eeloo could be pulled off with 6000\u002Bm/s? ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI don\u0027t see why not, that Lamp Post is one powerful tug section. And Eeloo is not that far away in terms of energy, the trip there takes less dV than going for Moho. It\u0027s all a matter of relative speeds: it might take a long time to get there, but it only takes you ~3km/s to get your apoapsis to Eeloo\u0027s orbit, and when you get there, it is moving so slow matching orbit takes very little, another km/s or so. With more than five km/s you should have no issues at all.\n\nMoho is the one that takes a lot: crossing its orbit takes about the same, but when you get there you have to match velocities with the fastest object on the Kerbol system. And still I think it can be done for only \u0022a bit\u0022 more than that (~3km/s to circularize).\n\nRune. You would have to also take a Skycrane and/or Trident to drop the modules, though."},{"CreatedByName":"CloudlessEchoes","CreatedById":142599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T03:17:27Z","Content":"Figuring out how to assemble this slowly...

I had no problems with the Sr. ports on either of my bases, but I managed to find perfectly flat bases - first on one of the lakes on Min and second by the lower arch on the Mun.\n\nAs long as the fuel dump is not more than about half full, the rover should have enough torque and/or enough thrust in its rockets o fix some alignment issues (probably caused by not-quite-perfectly level terrain). Might also try moving it to the other end of the ISRU as there\u0027s another Sr. port there you could dock to..."}]}
