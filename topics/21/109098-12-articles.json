It\u0027s not clear on the pictures where your rear wheels are. They should be slightly behind the center of mass or else you\u0027ll have a hard time taking off because your vessel won\u0027t be able to rotate to have its nose up. Just check that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T18:08:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 06:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ser**"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:49:17Z","Content":"Hey guys, if you\u0027re interested I created a challenge for FAR aerodynamics\n\nIt\u0027s called the 5th Generation Fighter Challenge and it asks you to create a state of the art fighter aircraft with similar specifications to modern fighter aircraft.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126342-The-5th-Generation-Fighter-challenge-FAR](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126342-The-5th-Generation-Fighter-challenge-FAR)"},{"CreatedByName":"TasDev","CreatedById":146801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T04:18:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\* How are your control surfaces set up? You should have the rudder set to yaw only, the canards to pitch only and the elevons for roll/pitch.

Everything was placed with symmetry turned on. I am flying with SAS, because without it it becomes even worse.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m with Wanderfound; it could be any number of the things he listed. I\u0027m also looking at the nose gear; at a glance it looks off-center. Could explain the behavior of the plane before takeoff.\n\u003E I\u0027m thinking the canards aren\u0027t helping you any either. You\u0027d be better off lengthening the fuselage and ditching the canards in favor of a pair of stabilators aft. The Tail Fin part works well as a stabilator for this kind of low-tech bush plane design. \n\u003E \n\u003E I may also be missing it - where are your air intakes? Obviously you have an intake - otherwise that Wheelsey would sit there and laugh at you - but I\u0027m not seeing it. If that\u0027s an Engine Nacelle aft, you\u0027ve got access to Elevon 2 and 3 - either of which make for better ailerons than Elevon 1.\n\nGear was centered. Intake is in the fuselage, but I have no access to better ailerons yet.\n\nSo I built another plane with propeller engine and it behaves the same. Drives left on the running way, constantly tries to dive when in the air and attempts rolling leftwards.\n\n![qGn7Piid.png](http://i.imgbox.com/qGn7Piid.png)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOK, I have found the problem - I did not know that even single central parts should be put on with symmetry turned on. Now it behaves properly.

I believe my problem largely lies with the high AoA requirement at lower velocities I think, as it basically falls like a rock below 150 m/s; which is rather high to land at for someone who\u0027s never been good at landing in the first place. Having the craft fall through the landscape glitch at high velocities doesn\u0027t help the landing experience, either :/.\n\n[http://imgbox.com/RMw8ZYYZ](http://imgbox.com/RMw8ZYYZ)\n\n[http://imgbox.com/Dh8QAzQr](http://imgbox.com/Dh8QAzQr)\n\n[http://imgbox.com/7BNTkM2e](http://imgbox.com/7BNTkM2e)\n\n[http://imgbox.com/dkh3F8PK](http://imgbox.com/dkh3F8PK)\n\n[http://imgbox.com/cWK0cK7r](http://imgbox.com/cWK0cK7r)\n\nOther than that, so long as you don\u0027t exceed structural tolerances, it flies quite well. Ironically, it even flies well in stock as well except for taking off.\n\nWould anyone have suggestions on how to improve its handling at low velocities? Or am I just a terrible pilot?\n\nIdeally it would retain it\u0027s overall shape and ability to reach orbit; I am able to reach orbit if I remove one of the rocket fuel tanks, though it\u0027s much more difficult.\n\nThanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T05:19:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 05:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tipped**\n  \nfix images"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T05:33:39Z","Content":"Are you unable to maintain enough AoA to hold level flight or does doing so induce a stall?
