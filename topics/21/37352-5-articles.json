I used that during these burns, I used the TAR and PAR during docking and the manual SURF during landings to get the craft perfectly level.

There are some close up pics without the ascent module in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40559-All-craft-from-my-Constellation-mission-vid?p=524201\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post524201\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis post\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time I also built the ascent module in the VAB and to start with I built it the right way round (command pod first) while I was testing it out. Then once I got it how I wanted I took it apart and rebuilt it backwards, starting with a probe core that was later thrown away. So basically I started with a prob core and then worked upwards adding the ascent module parts starting from its lower docking port. Then I was able to select the ascent module from the lower docking port and could save that as a subassembly. Then back in the SPH I fitted a radially attached docking port to the middle of the cradle and then loaded up the ascent module sub-assembly and attached it via the docking ports. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding the cradle was prob the hardest part of this bit of the design. In the pics in the post I linked to above you\u0027ll see I used those small cube parts to make the join to the front and rear sections and to form the 90 joint in the cradle itself. To start with I\u0027d tried using radially attached girders, but then when you come to add the rear section you can\u0027t get the same joins, so you have to use a way that uses attachment nodes (I think that is the key to it really). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CSX_Ind","CreatedById":54958,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T14:23:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking port trick for the construction rover, why you so hard \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it just me or the new KAS version...I can set the winch to undocked then when I retract the wire, it goes back to locked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
