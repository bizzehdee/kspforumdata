Weighing over 100 tonnes, it was quite hard to get to Duna, and its shape did not help, but I used two liquid fueled LV-N boosters attached between the centre wheels, which I decoupled after landing. Getting it to orbit from Kerbin required A LOT of struts...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T18:15:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A35K**"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T18:57:44Z","Content":"Mine isn\u0027t very large I\u0027m afraid. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n![6D3448ABEDA3B35782CC3456DF33E185362AF10F](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/864982003416132200/6D3448ABEDA3B35782CC3456DF33E185362AF10F/)\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=186530039](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=186530039)\n\nWhen I had first started playing the game back in Jun \u002713 I was using Impossible Innovations with BahamutoD\u0027s old wheel pack and little to no idea of how to do anything. I made some pretty absurd gigantic rover/plane/rocket/tank/thing things then that I have no pictures of anymore. Good times ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nSince then I don\u0027t really rover anymore. The wheels work much worse then they did when I first started playing. That is a huge gripe of mine that I\u0027ve actually kind of forgotten all about until just now lmao. Oh well, there is hope in sight with Harv\u0027s recent announcement of a wheel design/system overhaul!"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T19:01:12Z","Content":"Nice rig. \n\nHmm, I don\u0027t have any pictures unfortunately, as I deleted the save, but I suppose my largest \u0022rover\u0022 was a mobile base on Minmus set up kind of like a train. Each \u0022car\u0022 consisted of a particular base component, with two radially mounted structural fuselages and associated docking ports that connected each car. Rugged wheels were attached to underside of the cars via I-beams, and even on Minmus proved to be quite stable and very fast. Driver cab had a cupola module for a nice IVA experience. Each car also had some of the large radial RCS tanks on the bottom sides, which (in conjunction with thruster blocks) helped both with delivery and allowed the train to fly (though this last part was only briefly tested). \n\nIn total, I think I had about 19 or 20 cars on the train, with room for as many people. Could mine, do science, make fuel.. basically everything. Hoping to do something similar with MKS/OKS components within the next few days, though not quite sure on what to do with the inflatables.."},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T19:01:24Z","Content":"The largest in size for me was probably my \u0022Movertron\u0022 in 0.90, which was launched by a dual lane lifter,...\n\n![BMkn1CL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BMkn1CL.jpg)\n\n...to land on Mun...\n\n![9oOqKbl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9oOqKbl.jpg)\n\n...and do construction work...\n\n![4dItlwm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4dItlwm.jpg)\n\n...with a KAS winch...\n\n![AYm2T4p.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AYm2T4p.jpg)\n\n...building a mining colony...\n\n![e8cWKpr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/e8cWKpr.jpg)\n\nIt wasnt very heavy, but pretty tall to be able to lift large colony modules underneath it.\n\n![kyDhBYs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kyDhBYs.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T19:47:21Z","Content":"My VTOL minmus mining rover\n\n![jMU12Za.png](http://i.imgur.com/jMU12Za.png)\n\nMines, refines into fuel, then goes into orbit to fill an orbital tanker\n\n![aaX6DHZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/aaX6DHZ.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"SemiaCloud","CreatedById":138816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T20:16:11Z","Content":"None.
