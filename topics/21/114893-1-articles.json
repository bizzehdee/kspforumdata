I know. this is how you achieve orbit. You build a slightly inclined track gradually climbing about 8 degrees. When a high enough speed is achieved the track changes into long large loops to achieve acxeleratio and velocity. . you leave the last loop a half loop. It will be acxelerating the payload in a slightly decreasing angle. you will be in vacuum being pulled down by the earths gravitational pull. leave fuel on earth, it is useless in space. in space you trust GOD first and the mighty Moose second.
