The other one (Fantonov) was my attempt at creating a big, i mean a stupidly big cargo plane out of wings alone (fuselage and wings), it doesnt look too bad but it just doesnt want to stay together as it behaves like a snake after takeoff \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. The fantonov was created quite a long time ago in like 0.90 or 0.25 not sure when and its fully stock. The other aircraft on the other hand was built about 30 minutes ago and also suffers from structural issues aka the wings get torn and most of them fall off durning takeoff making flying it impossible \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E.
