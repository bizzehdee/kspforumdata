I made it when I was learning how to fly and wanted something that would stay in the air long enough for me to figure out how to operate it. If you like nimble fighters, this plane will seem sluggish to you. But for a newbie like me, the good thing is that it doesn\\\u0027t flip around violently while manuevering, makes stable, slow turns, and if you make a mistake, it gives you time to figure out what you did wrong and correct it. It\\\u0027s actually kind of hard to crash. It will take off by itself if you just turn up the throttle and leave the ASAS turned on, and it\\\u0027s stable at low speeds and so is pretty easy to land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up is the F2 Prodigal. He doesn\\\u0027t want your help, and he doesn\\\u0027t need your help. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E On takeoff, hit the throttle and ASAS and let him find his own way into the air, because he\\\u0027ll throw a tantrum and commit suicide by flipping on his side if you try to steer him. Once in the air, he\\\u0027s kind of temperamenal, but will more or less do what you tell him to do. But the cool thing is, I\\\u0027ve tested him from many altitudes, and he will land himself (assuming the ground below is flat). From level flight, turn off the engine and ASAS, then go get a snack or whatever you want to do while he descends at a level and steady 9 or so m/s, touches down, maybe porpoise-bounces once or twice, and then rolls. All you need do is apply the brake to bring him to a final halt. The Prodigal: you can\\\u0027t tell this kid anything, but leave him alone and he\\\u0027ll come home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, there\\\u0027s the F1 Pilum. It\\\u0027s a little bigger and somewhat more stable and easy to fly than the Prodigal, but is faster. Flies well, but needs kind of a long takeoff run. There\\\u0027s nothing really remarkable about it, except that I think it looks kind of cool, and was my first successful plane design. As a wise man once said, \u0027For me it\\\u0027s awesome becouse I made it.\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are my first planes, and I hope somebody finds them of interest. Most of what\\\u0027s good about these planes is to the credit of the very nice people in the how-to and especially \u0027The woes of building a space-plane\u0027 threads.

When we get persistent crews, it will be useful, safer, and cheaper to get them some flight experience in a stable airplane as opposed to an expensive rocket. Does anybody know if eventually vehicles will persist as well as crews? By \u0027persist\u0027 I don\\\u0027t just mean that they keep going when you\\\u0027re not personally flying them, as vehicles do already, but could you leave a plane sitting at KSC after flying it, ready to be re-fueled and re-flown? In that eventuality, re-useable spaceplanes would have a big economic advantage. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"opticalshadow","CreatedById":31348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T20:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eman these things are a breeze to fly, i love teh way the 3rd model looks, and it flys like a dream. the middle one is pretty twitchy, but its a fun plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe first plane however i have problems with, i think its just a little to sluggish for my tastes, though i like its looks alot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-25T08:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeahletstrythatdyne is back, with more of the finest in mediocre aircraft! Updating my previous designs for .16 are: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe T-4 Mentor Trainer: Newbies can take a nice relaxing orientation flight while the avionics ASAS keeps the plane from flipping around wildly. Taking off is as simple as turning the avionics on and cranking up the throttle, and the plane will get itself airborne by the second set of runway stripes with no intervention required from the pilot. Practice yaw, pitch, and roll in a plane that won\\\u0027t rocket into the ground before you can correct, or go into a spin. Once you feel more comfortable, turn the avionics off and it\\\u0027s still pretty stable and flyable, but more manueverable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe F5b Dart is meant to be fun at low altitude (replacling the Pilum). With avionics on it responds in a controlled way that will help you avoid flying into the ground while buzzing the tower, but map the F key (suspend SAS) to your trigger, and you can cut into sharp turns in the midst of more deliberate flight. Apply rudder gently in non-SAS mode, but otherwise the craft responds well in all 3 planes in assisted or unassisted flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth planes are easy to land on unprepared ground, so it doesn\\\u0027t matter if you miss the runway. To park (so that it doesn\\\u0027t roll away during EVA), retract the landing wheels; this won\\\u0027t damage the plane. Pilots may egress and ingress using the ladders.

They naturally then set out to see if a jet engine could propel such a floating fuselage, because, who hasn\\\u0027t wondered that? The first obstacle we encountered is that when the protoype got to the end of the runway, parts would simply frikkin\\\u0027 rattle off of the damned thing as we tried to roll it across open ground. What to do? What would be the most sensible way to get our vehicle the 3 or so kilometers to the shore?

Once safely over water, throttle-off and eject the rocket engines. Then be sure the craft is upright and level before triggering the descent parachutes, or else the shock may cause the stupid engine to fall off despite being bolted down with, like, a million struts. As the moment of splashdown approaches, try to bring the nose up so that the impact doesn\\\u0027t cause the stupid engine to fall off, again. The avionics SAS will most likely break off anyway, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ewhich we couldn\\\u0027t stop even with all the struts that would fit on it\u003C/span\u003E as a clever weight-saving measure since you don\\\u0027t need it anymore. Once settled on the water, the Siren is amazingly stable and will not roll over. Spin-up the powerplanet, and the Siren\\\u0027s powerful jet engine will send it screaming across the water at speeds in excess of \u003Cem\u003E5.5 meters per second!\u003C/em\u003E Leaves a majestic rooster tail of wake and jet exhaust and everything. Should your pilot wish to stretch his legs mid-journey, he can emerge from the Siren and swim around, as the built-in ladder is accessible from the water. Passengers may swim up and board the extendable side ladders and cling for dear life. As a bonus, while cruising the Siren sometimes makes a musical tinkling noise, not unlike someone shaking BBs around in a metal can. No, really, it does.
