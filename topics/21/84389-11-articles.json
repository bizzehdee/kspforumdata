I had thought of basing it simply of a checksum of the craft file, problem with that is even if you don\u0027t change the craft, when you hit save in KSP is re-assigns all the part ids (which is a weird thing to do IMO, but hey). So that makes it too easy to change the craft-file checksum without actually changing the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour suggestion of basing it on parts is good, but has one edge case that I can think off. It works if parts are added or removed, but won\u0027t recognise a change if you just move a part. But that\u0027s probably better than nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I\u0027m going to look at is striping out all the unique part ids from the craft file and then taking the checksum on what\u0027s left. That would recognize any change to parts (including tweaking fuel levels or other minor changes) but should ignore something that\u0027s just been resaved without being changed. It would also pick up on a craft name change, but I might exclude that as it\u0027s too easy to just change it\u0027s name in order to bump it. Need to experiment with this a bit though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour idea of only allowing it to get bumped once a day is a good idea too, will definitely have that as part of the rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also want to have a filter than will show the most downloaded craft in the last 24hrs/week/month/year/all-time, but currently I don\u0027t track the dates when craft are downloaded (just increment a count) so without that all I could do is; most downloaded craft that was uploaded in the last 24hrs/week/month/year/all-time. which is similar, but not quite as good. But adding in tracking download dates is a load more data to store and a bit of a pain to add in retroactively, so I\u0027m not quite sure what I\u0027m going to do there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I gotta do something, there\u0027s all these STS craft dominating the sort-by-download filter!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E (props for having the most downloaded craft on the site btw!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T01:44:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to intrude, but I seem to be encountering a problem: I try to use my username and password and whenever I type in my password (which I changed) it doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am Astrofox1.0 on KerbalX, and I type in the correct password and I get the invalid Username and/or password response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are wondering, I tried it several times before I reset my password - then I logged out and tried to log back in, and it didn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel as if this is a bug that kinda needs to be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for KerbalX, and of course your Youtube channel (love the Constellation Mission), as well as trying to fix this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T16:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Astrofox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Astrofox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorry to intrude, but I seem to be encountering a problem: I try to use my username and password and whenever I type in my password (which I changed) it doesn\u0027t work.\u003Cp\u003EI am Astrofox1.0 on KerbalX, and I type in the correct password and I get the invalid Username and/or password response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are wondering, I tried it several times before I reset my password - then I logged out and tried to log back in, and it didn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel as if this is a bug that kinda needs to be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for KerbalX, and of course your Youtube channel (love the Constellation Mission), as well as trying to fix this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit appears that your username is infact \u0022Astrofox1_0 - Astrofox - astrofox001\u0022, was that intended or has something got rather awry there? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etry logging in using that username exactly as I\u0027ve put it there and see if that works OR you can now log in using the email address you signed up with (that\u0027s a fairly new feature).

Then you can recall one of your mod-groups to run a search for craft and you\u0027ll be able to share your mod-groups with others. So you could say \u0022I use these mods\u0022 and put a link to you mod group, folk who click that link will see a list of your mods and be able to download a .ckan metapackage that will tell CKAN to install those mods along with their existing mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I also want to improve the interface for the search by mod section of the search interface, I feel that\u0027s a bt clunky at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I will give Hangars some tlc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunctionality wise I plan to add things like;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a Hangar mod list that will show all mods required for the craft in the hangar (and that will link into the mod-group idea so you can download the .ckan metapackage for a hangar and also search for other craft that would work with the same mod set). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- download all craft in a hangar as a zip\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterface improvements are also needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- more prominent link to hangars on the main page.

So there will be an option to include/exclude favs and DL hangars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I really want to improve the \u0022thumbnail\u0022 for hangars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- and a few other ideas that are still stuck in the back of my head so I can\u0027t really explain them yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T13:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I see it being used in a sig I think it is growing on me!

When you type into the search field it looks at both craft name and at #tags, so if you type \u0022SSTO\u0022 or \u0022boat\u0022 into the search, you\u0027ll see that it finds craft with that in the name, but also a whole bunch of craft that don\u0027t have it in their name (it\u0027s in their hash tags). So there is essentially an unlimited set of sub-categories and craft can be in many sub-categories together. So you can search for \u0022cargo ssto\u0022 and it will find craft that have both #cargo and #ssto. I need to make the use of #tags more apparent in the search interface and provide a list of the ones that exist so they can be clicked on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022adsii1970\u0022 data-cite=\u0022adsii1970\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas also thinking about maybe having a statistical breakdown on each user\u0027s page (such as XX aircraft uploaded, XX rockets uploaded, XX rovers uploaded, XX SSTO uploaded) more for giggles and grins than anything else.

You may have noticed the site being slower than it used to be. This is down to a problem with my hosting platform and the lower tier database that I\u0027m using. Basically the low tier database doesn\u0027t have dedicated RAM, it shares resources with other users on the platform and while this has been fine for a while, it seems another user of the platform is hammering the living carp out of the shared resources so it\u0027s slowing KX down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m going to upgrade the database platform to a high tier, which unfortunately costs me more and I\u0027ve been looking for help to get funding for that. I still need help with the funding so if anyone can help chip in with a donation that would be really appreciated. I\u0027ll put a donate button at the end of this post and there is also one in the footer of the site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m going ahead with the upgrade anyway, which should boost the sites performance quite a bit (I\u0027m basically strapping MOAR boosters to it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ).

And the size tag needs to have a \u002B or - sign in it (and size=-1 doesn\u0027t really do much, try size=-2 or -3). Also for some reason, and I think this is my coding rather than anything, the center tags and size tags don\u0027t play nice; the center tags don\u0027t like being inside size tags.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry using this;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[noparse]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThis craft was constructed on a computer with the following system specifications:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003EOperating system: Windows 8.1; Processor: AMD E2-1800 APU with Raedon HD Graphics 1.7GHz; Installed RAM: 8.0 GB; System type: 64 bit operating system, x64 based processor\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/noparse]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: to make it so that the green text starts on a new line (rather than a new paragraph which puts a bigger space between the lines). put a return at the end of the green text line \u003Cstrong\u003Eand two spaces\u003C/strong\u003E. the two spaces are important, that tells markdown to make a new line.

Which I\u0027m kinda surprised by, I thought people would be upvoting lots! Is the upvote system still unapparent? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk so the points system is kinda modeled on imgur\u0027s point system, you can get upvotes and downvotes for your craft and your comments (you also get some points for uploading part maps). But unlike imgur downvotes are costly to whoever gives them (at least with craft). I\u0027m guessing you guys haven\u0027t tried to downvote a craft yet so you won\u0027t have seen what happens. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you click downvote on a craft it will show you a message asking if this craft really warrants a downvote and informing you that in order to downvote the craft it is going to \u003Cstrong\u003Ecost you 5 of your own points.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there is a disincentive to downvoting (and new users can\u0027t downvote until they\u0027ve earned enough points) and really I\u0027d hoped downvoting would be used just on craft that are either totally the wrong craft (ie not the one pictured) or in cases where the user has put offensive content in the crafts page or even perhaps hidden some offensive text in the description in the actual craft file. Basically for things that are \u0022just not cricket chaps\u0022. What I thought I\u0027d do is wait and see how that process worked and then put something in that would filter out craft that had say 4-5 downvotes as a sort of community driven self moderation system. If you downvote a craft that actually has offensive content or is spam and then either the user or I delete the craft you will get your points back. But....you guys are the best community a developing site could ask for, no one tries to post spam, no ones posts offensive content, I\u0027ve not had to pull one craft from the site so far, so that system is kinda obsolete! So, thanks guys for being a mature bunch of users!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure at some point, someone will do something that requires moderating. At the moment I\u0027m the moderator, and I do look at each craft page that is posted (I don\u0027t download all the craft though). At some point I will need others to help with moderation tasks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, points. I will add the running total and a break down of points on the profile page.
