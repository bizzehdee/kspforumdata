The outriggers hold the truck off the ground and kept planted and you can swing out and telescope/extend the boom and its also loaded with lights. Youll need to press U and H to get both vehicle and crane lights to work. I have the controls preset and named accordingly. Download the truck below the pictures. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix Aerospace","CreatedById":26120,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-18T03:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease, \u003Cstrong\u003Eplease\u003C/strong\u003E post the packs needed.

I have switched the capsule from the \u0027soyuz\u0027 rocket to the bare stock capsule that has came WITH the game. You are correct the bigtrak lights are with it. Ive gotten so much into modding on this game i have never foreseen the problems with trying to share them on the community but you guys are helping me out with that and im learning it.
