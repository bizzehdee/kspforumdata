After all, even if I overestimate, and my kerbals get 70 m3 per person instead of 80, I think that\u0027s no biggie, given that kerbals in most other people\u0027s space programs are forced to sit in cramped cockpits for years, without space to even stretch their legs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tapejara","CreatedById":111216,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T09:26:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell my next station is up and running. The Kerbals now have more elbow room but unless my calculations are off I\u0027m going to have to scale things up to get the sort of habitable volume NASA would be satisfied with. Assuming a perfect cylinder (which it isn\u0027t) and accounting for the rigid spine I reckon that inflatable module has an internal volume of 55-60 cubic metres. That makes it cramped even for one Kerbal, let alone the three aboard currently or the maximum of six it can hold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/gr4V2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/gr4V2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy third station is going to have to be massive!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
