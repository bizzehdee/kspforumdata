While that may be impossible, the Chausiku Kibowen comes close. It takes off easily, flies to orbit easily, re-enters easily, and lands easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft file:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Brikoleur/Chausiku-Kibowen\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Brikoleur/Chausiku-Kibowen\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tYHGdst.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tYHGdst.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe payload fits in a wide 3.75 metre fairing between twin fuselages. There\u0027s room to flare out the fairing a fair bit. Because it\u0027s in the centre, it minimises \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shift issues, and the fairing keeps it aerodynamically efficient.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022n6DoYZ7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/n6DoYZ7.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the body is structural: it is not intended to fly with full fuel load. The supplied craft file has plenty to get into orbit with the payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo fly up, lift off at about 100 m/s, and once you\u2019re at about 200 m/s, point the nose up at just under 20 degrees. Then do nothing at all until the jets start to flare out: at this point you should be still climbing healthily at about 25 km altitude, going at around 1400 m/s. Then hit 2 to toggle mode and start the tail engine, and fly yourself to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo return, hold attitude between 45 and 60 degrees until transition to normal flight. If you have any fuel left, it helps to pump it towards the nose, as in very balanced regimes it may want to get into a flat spin when you hit thick air. To get out of it, apply thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApproach and landing are extremely easy. It touches down below 40 m/s at a reasonable angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Dz0RFYz.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Dz0RFYz.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
