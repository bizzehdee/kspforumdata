It\u0027s recommended you zoom into the ship and select the control ring at its centre. You will have to use Infinite Fuel if you want to fly it anywhere, unless you want to fill it with fuel and hook up a ton of fuel lines yourself! It does have SAS, vernor thrusters and 2 small engines inside the tips of the saucer section. Oh and you\u0027ll have to hyper-edit it into orbit.\n\nHotkey 1 - Toggles exterior lighting\n\nHotkey 2 - Toggles cabin lights\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Yes, without the new Gizmos this would have been impossible.\n\nAzimech, amazing Constitution refit. After this build I\u0027m probably going to have a rest and just build smaller things for fun! Besides, I think the part count might get on the silly side if I built another Trek ship bigger or more to scale. It would be nice to get my Chinook to fly better, lol.
