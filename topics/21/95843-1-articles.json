It was a pretty sketchy craft and took several attempts to get the landing and take-off on Duna right without crashing. Now in 0.90 I am cranking in Career mode (Moderate) trying to get enough cash to unlock the final upgrade to the R\u0026amp;D center so I can unlock the final level of the tech tree. I have sent a probe to orbit Duna and Ike. I am starting to plan a Kerbal mission to Duna and was hoping you guys might share some of your Duna lander craft designs with me. I plan on a two launch approach with a command module and lander rendezvousing in Kerbin orbit and then out to Duna for the landing. Figured I would leave the lander in Duna orbit for future use when I return to Kerbin.

Otherwise we wouldn\u0027t be launching any kind of command pods at all, as the command seat makes all of them obsolete. My standards of reasonability say that one-kerbal pods are only suitable for short-term missions, while interplanetary missions require a crew of 3\u002B, at least two kerbals in the lander, and 2-3x more living space than strictly necessary. A small lander might be built around a Mk1-2 command pod or a Mk2 lander can, a medium lander would add a hitchhiker, while a large lander would also include a laboratory.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, we do have different definitions. While I agree that the EAS thing is nonsense (and it\u0027s not a real replacement even gamewise for the capsules as it does not refill EVA fuel - plus I\u0027m not sure if it can do an internal \u0027crew report\u0027 or not or store science) and that using the 1-man can for an interplanetary transfer is probably stretching it just a little, I don\u0027t see any reason at all why a short term landing has to be a two-man mission or use a long-term vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might accept arguments that you need an atmospheric-rated craft for landing on Duna (halfway, at least.. I mean, it\u0027s Duna afterall), but that would ONLY include the mk1 and mk1-2 capsules and spaceplane cockpits... not the one or two man cans, nor the lab or hitchhiker. (the descriptions in-game do mention something about the cans not being atmosphere rated, and imply that the hitchhiker can\u0027t \u0027return\u0027, although there\u0027s no game mechanic to back that up in stock).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy usual station is based around a Mk1-2 capsule or Cupola, with a lab, and possibly a hitchhiker attached (depending on my mood and/or contracts), but I don\u0027t see any reason to use any two-man vessel for landing. Not everything has to be a copy of the Apollo program - the Soviet design called for a two man orbiter and a one man lander. Given that the typical career-oriented landing mission is land, do science, and return, there\u0027s no reason to have a long endurance craft (especially considering the Apollo LEM could do something like 75 hours on battery power \u003Cem\u003Ealone\u003C/em\u003E). So I\u0027d say that the Mk1 capsule is acceptable under all circumstances, and if Duna\u0027s atmosphere is too thin to be a problem (or we\u0027re just ignoring that entirely), the 1-man landing can too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe older Duna lander pictured was piloted long range by solo pilot, although that\u0027s mostly because I was too lazy to put a probe core on it.

So the lesson is make sure decoupler goes away when it is around a docking port, either by attaching properly or using separator which detaches on both sides.
