It\u0027s is designed to see how far I can get out of orbit and explore the solar system virtually unaided. Or at least with out having rockets and throw away parts. It is currently an MK2 drone plane with stock 12 wing configuration, weighing 21.3t, using 2 R.A.P.I.E.R. engines, electric based maneuvering and control systems, a communitron 88-88, Solar panels, and several 1k battery arrays for extra energy, and parachutes for fuelless landings. it has a virtually permanent back end with a front end made for easy modding. Mearly modify front section for functio and rebalance the mass to lift back to center. As weight is added wings can be added to move the lift forward if needed. MAke sure th front endge of all wings are alligned in each section though as it might throw off balance of the plane(I could be mistaken though). Some things may need to be improved with aerodynamics as I\u0027m not that knowledgable but it\u0027s pretty good as far as I can tell for now. Consider this the base model or a late test model. There are lots of earlier version testing out ideas and learning the game(I recently got it) but this one pretty much embodies the point. There could be problems with weight to mass though as it is scalled up. I\u0027m not familiar with the forumulas for that. It can be modded to add more engines fairly easily though. I recomend putting the same fuel engine config with struts and fuel lines back to the main body unless more rocket fuel is desired for travel in place of pure liquid or as a Mass distrubutor. The fuel lines ensured that the rear fuel is used first and it accessible at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rear(with 2 engines) has 300 liquid fuel to give you time to get in the upper atmosphere and gain as much speed as possible before punching the R.A.P.I.E.R. engines into rocket mode.(Earlier test models were all Super Jet with possible smaller side rockets as the tests proceded.) I finally settled on the R.A.P.I.E.R. when I finally figured out what they were! 8p They were also more efficient in jet mode for what I was doing. So enjoy!(AT least once I figure out how to share the file for the ship. Can someone tell me how to do that. Can it be done on the forum or do I need to use something like Curse and link it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: This ship is designed from stock parts and designed with the idea of not having any unrealistically clipped or stacked items making it as realistic as possible from the games perepective. I think the elevators clip at a few points but those can be adjusted. I was just to lazy to do it.

Ultimately, I would like to be able to control it like a plane from 33-55km with as much ease as possible.

I\u0027ll update these as I figure stuff out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also uncertain how good the VTOL is. It\u0027s a little laggy and hard to test outside of using it for launch and ascent. Tried to land on the hanger but failed. It is nice while going into orbit to adjust trajectory. I may change it so the two of them in front of the COM are TurboJets(or Rapiers for ascent on oxygen less planets) if needed to help with upper orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMK3 NIRDm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/63iz1s8pqy0hn00/MK3_NIRDm_Area_explosive_.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/63iz1s8pqy0hn00/MK3_NIRDm_Area_explosive_.craft\u003C/a\u003E this is a build up to an MK3 version of the other ships for potential refueling and a small orbital base. it\u0027s unsound structurally and will blow up on the runway just from it\u0027s own weight, but it makes a cool explosive radius about the size of the entire facility! 8) could be a cool idea for an interplanetary bomb.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T21:09:19Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 09:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
