That said if the aerodynamics update is delayed further I might look into FAR mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETMS, The fuel is in three tanks, feeding from the outer pair to the central tank. The cockpit is actually attached to the central tank not the front tank. I couldn\u0027t get the darn thing to empty the tanks properly with fuel lines when the cockpit was attached to the front tank. The centre of mass is pretty darn close to the centre of the middle tank so the balance doesn\u0027t vary much at all as the fuel drains. The VTOL engine is clipped inside the fuselage and again aligned with CoG. The central gears and air intakes are all attached via clipped girders. Just your regular clipping nightmare (though nowhere near as bad as my space shuttle).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-25T11:58:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2013 11:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mick777Oz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T13:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks awesome, and you fly it like an ace.
