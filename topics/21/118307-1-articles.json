You could add drop tanks like on the real thing to extend its range and then you could probably make it even in low atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T17:26:16Z","Content":"Nice work with the cockpit looking good."},{"CreatedByName":"landfish2","CreatedById":138824,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T15:13:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nice work with the cockpit looking good.\n\nThanks (:\n\nI wanted to use a stock cockpit but the size and shape were just so completely off, I decided to make my own"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T15:15:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks (:\n\u003E I wanted to use a stock cockpit but the size and shape were just so completely off, I decided to make my own\n\nAgreed, stock cockpits are ugly as sin.

Most people don\u0027t build replicas which are this accurate!\n\nI\u0027m not sure if its what you meant but that 3-view is an overlay of an actual diagram of the real thing, I used to build replicas from just the top down view and though they looked very clean and nice and they were the proper size, they just didn\u0027t feel as close to the real thing so recently I have started making these larger 3D replicas which are less clean and less pretty but capture the feel of the real thing better IMO\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Nice work! I love scale builds like this. That cockpit was ingenious.\n\nYeah there really aren\u0027t many ways to do curves in KSP. The \u0027barrel cockpit\u0027 was the best solution I could find."}]}
