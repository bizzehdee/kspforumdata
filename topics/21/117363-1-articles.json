View full album](//imgur.com/a/RnVv1)\n\nStats: Probe weight is about 700 Kg, 165 parts, rocket is about 314 total including probe. Scale is about 77% vs real life. TWR is about 1.38. Default Centaur thrust is about 130, full thrust recommended.\n\nThe Probe is highly detailed, and in fact, the scaling tweak scale can do was actually a problem when trying to simulate science experiments. Sadly, I wasn\u0027t able to simulate the classical half stage in the technique I built the probe. Also, at 10-100X warp, some parts may get very hot, a stock game bug caused by clipping.\n\nAlso, the parts may be offset due to a procedural parts bug, so you will have to move the insulation panel base, sustainer engine, the Centaur top cover, and the probe core on the antennae. \n\n[Download](http://kerbalx.com/SaturnianBlue/Pioneer-10-and-11)\n\nHere is the highly detailed KSP recreation which is aided with IRL images.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The rocket launches 90 degrees to the side, so I recommend you turn it 90 degrees too. The sustainer \\*might\\* explode during half stage jettison. Also, you should add batteries to Pioneer 10/11, as the original doesn\u0027t have even have 100 Electric charge.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9If you download this replica, post your experiences below, and if you have some subassemblies for the Atlas-Centaur, feel free to post.\n\nThanks for reading, leave some rep if you enjoy!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T18:43:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 06:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SaturnianBlue**"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T01:15:13Z","Content":"I have to spread rep around ):"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnianBlue","CreatedById":141267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T01:42:53Z","Content":"Here\u0027s some KVV pictures: ![cyobaZV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cyobaZV.jpg)\n\n![dakPVUl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dakPVUl.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T02:03:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 02:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SaturnianBlue**"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T02:21:19Z","Content":"Good stuff mate!
