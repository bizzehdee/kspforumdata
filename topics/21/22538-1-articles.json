To that end, I made the heavy lifter that I use in most of my missions away from Kerbin now. I am posting both the Heavy lifter with a 1M pod and a 3M pod, in case someone wanted to design their own lander. As far as I can tell, the max weight I have had it lift is the 3M IP Lander, weighing in at 48.145 (Ladders are negligible and were not factored in).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, without further ado, have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
