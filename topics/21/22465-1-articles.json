It\u0027s fairly intuitive to fly, as long as you disable flow to the nuclear engines on the takeoff from Laythe. Or route fuel lines from the ascent engine tanks to the nuclear engine, either way. Anyway, it does exactly what it says: lands a 1-man pod on Laythe, lets the kerbonaut splash around a bit in EVA, and gets it back to Kerbin. It\u0027s got a lot of extra fuel at each stage of the game, and the only really tricky part is landing--it may be a good idea to aim for water first, since it\u0027s more forgiving than land if you don\u0027t get used to the throttle lag on the jet engines fast enough and come down hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, if people want, I\u0027ll put together a more complete flight log/instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/232q2l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022232q2l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB.

Note the submerged engines; I figure if we don\u0027t have pontoon landing legs yet, I\u0027m not going to sweat the slight departure from logic. Also proof that it floats upright if you land upright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sGDVWl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sGDVWl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHome safe, and with 40L of fuel left for the nuclear engine to burn when I jettisoned it. Absolutely needs aerobraking in Kerbin atmosphere to get into orbit; that and getting into Laythe orbit are the least forgiving bits of the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-18T17:34:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2012 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
