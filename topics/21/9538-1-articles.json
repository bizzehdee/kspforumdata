Its usual payload is 16 large fuel tanks to a circular 200km orbit, with RCS for maneuvering. It takes 48 fuel tanks and 12 engines to do this, so over 1/5 of of the initial spacecraft weight is converted into orbiting payload. Furthermore, surfaces, RCS or autopilot are not required for ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload can obviously be changed into a lander, or an extra stage added at the bottom for vertical climbing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, any takers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://C\u0022 alt=\u0022C: spacecraft weight \\Users\\Oliver\\Documents\\FF Fuel Orbiter.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, the file is from v13.3.
