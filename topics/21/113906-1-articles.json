Both hull and turret armour were increased. Several alternative armaments were explored in paper studies but ultimately the IS-2\u0027s original 122mm gun was retained.** \n\n**WARNING: To use this tank, drive carefully. On launch, slowly move the tank forward untill it starts to jump, then disconnect the turret (with SPACE) and continue. I have no idea why It jumps like this but it seems to be solved by doing this. The road wheels are delicate, especially the front and back two. I suggest having a Kerbal follow and repair if needed.**\n\n**Comes with rotating turret, simply switch to it and \u0022control from here\u0022 on the front pod, just behind the gun.

I was just curious if there was anything that could be done improve performance on those high part ships whether it was a setting or a mod. I\u0027m just guessing that my bottleneck is my cpu having to do the physics for said pieces on the ship. I wonder if its also an optimization issue or whether having more cores for example the [8/16 thread i7](http://ark.intel.com/products/82930/Intel-Core-i7-5960X-Processor-Extreme-Edition-20M-Cache-up-to-3_50-GHz) or the [8 thread amd fx](http://cpuboss.com/cpu/AMD-FX-9590) or higher clock speeds in general would help."},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira","CreatedById":10884,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T07:31:45Z","Content":"Goodness, as if it wasn\u0027t bad enough in War Thunder!
