I\u0027m sure that I\u0027m not the only one with plane trouble. In this thread, I hope for people to share their planes that they are struggling with so that they can get help from those who know more about what they\u0027re doing. I\u0027m starting this thread because I have a craft that is being, very troublesome: the X-23.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe X-23 was something I thought up while I was very bored. The idea involves a whole lot of non-snapping angle adjustments on the fuselage and other janky tweaks. When it gets put on the runway, it dips down on one side then levels out again. When I try to launch it, something seems to really want it to swerve around, but even if I do my best to get it to stay straight, it still went off the runway to the right, towards the launchpad. I did manage to get this dang thing to takeoff, but once in flight it wasn\u0027t very stable at all. I need serious help with this craft...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t opened the craft in a while so I\u0027m not very sure on it\u0027s stats...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe .craft file says its dimensions are\u00A012.002367,4.47398376,9.33164692.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI believe that it is 23 tons (hence the name X-23)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUses some mods but I don\u0027t fully remember. Probably just Firespitter and I think it uses a part that I made that is just a re-stat of the stock seperatron to have 4x thrust, 4x fuel consumption, but 4x fuel capacity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/36v32nx0rxyz2dd/X-23.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/36v32nx0rxyz2dd/X-23.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(X-23 craft file)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/thuksrkqurhq780/AAD60utQ94S4FmWNbeq1N-FFa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/thuksrkqurhq780/AAD60utQ94S4FmWNbeq1N-FFa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0[My \u0022potential missile part (solidBoosterSep-Copy)]\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry I don\u0027t have a picture, but I will try to fix that and I hope others can use this thread to get the help they need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-lococarl, over and out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
