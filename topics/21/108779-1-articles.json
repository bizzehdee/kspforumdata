However, one kerbal didn\u0027t fit in with the rest. She didn\u0027t understand everyone else\u0027s obsession with speed and power, so she took it upon herself to create something that was the very opposite. The result of all her hard work was the Albatross, a one-seater sailplane that, instead of fighting the air, embraces it!\n\n![y4AbvuS.png](http://i.imgur.com/y4AbvuS.png)\n\nI made this plane to try and see how well a realistic looking sailplane could fly. Since there\u0027s not really a way in stock to have a tow plane or a winch launch, I went with a couple of small rocket boosters to get it up in the air. The best glide ratio I was able to get is about 12:1, which is rather pitiful compared to a real world sailplane.\n\nFlight notes:\n\nThe plane is designed for stable flight at around 50m/s, on takeoff this means about 10 degrees nose up pitch, and for gliding it will settle at about 5 degrees nose down. The ailerons do double duty as speedbrakes, pressing the abort key activates them and allows you to descend faster. If you want to taxi after landing, make sure you disable the brakes before you come to a complete stop, otherwise there\u0027s no way to get it rolling again. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
