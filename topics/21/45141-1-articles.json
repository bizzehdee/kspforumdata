Seems that there was an issue with the LV-T45s overheating a few seconds after take off that required fixing in 0.23, and I figured since the Canary was quite popular you might appreciate a rebuild.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve removed all the Rockomax 48-7S\u0027s (they were overheating the main engines and made the part count bigger than it needed to be) and swapped the T45s for T30s. Since the new engines lack gimbaling you\u0027ve got to be a bit more careful with your gravity turn, and keep the throttle below 2/3 when out of the atmosphere because can\u0027t compensate for the unwanted rotation due to the asymmetric CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn update to one of my favourite craft! yay! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a little on the fence about the change to the non-gimbal T30s.

The T45s don\u0027t have the TWR to get it to orbit alone, and I can\u0027t pair them with the little 48-7S\u0027s anymore.
