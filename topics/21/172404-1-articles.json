I am hoping to use it as a means of delivering small science probes to various locations on Kerbal accurately. Currently it flies, but it can be rather unstable and prone going into a stall followed by a flat spin. Is there any tweaks I can make to my design to make it more stable in flight (after adding retractable landing gear)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-16T03:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) move the cockpit up somewhat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Move the wings back\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) add more stabilizers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
