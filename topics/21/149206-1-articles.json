I decided to get Real Scale Boosters, because my so called orbiters were not fairing well, but since my computer was so old, I had to remove my other mods, and even though it was tough, I did it. I started new and I did much better, I put my kerbals into space, into orbit, and sended some probes into orbit as well. My cover story was that the space program crashed, causing the united kerbal states and emirates, to stop their\u00A0little war do to financial problems. Finally on the day on my lunar landing deadline, I flew past the moon at a closes point of about 7,000 km away from the surface, in the next post I will gave my pic of the final spacecraft. Cheers everyone\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
