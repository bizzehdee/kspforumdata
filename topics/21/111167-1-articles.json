Of course many whine about how the SSTO parts simply lack the space to carry big cargo, even the MK3 is not enough for most. The Xylol was created to see how much could be done within the limits of a Mk3 cargo bay... so I started a project to go to Duna, explorer it and return, all using parts fitted inside of and launched via the Xylol 3.
