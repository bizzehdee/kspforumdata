View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can tell from casting my powers of sorcery on them, Kerbal-on-ladder forces have 1.8 kN of thrust, 2 G for a Kerbal. This means that the plane has nearly 5 m/s of acceleration (which matches experimental results). This means it should hypothetically be able to go anywhere but Tylo in stock KSP or anywhere in RSS without using fuel. In practice, time-warping usually requires some EVA fuel to get back on, so you\u0027ll eventually run out of that (after around 30-40 warps or so).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T05:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s amazing.
