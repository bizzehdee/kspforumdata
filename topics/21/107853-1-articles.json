Indeed there is no other reason, Comrade Reader, that such planes could actually fly! \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/oZlN7)\n\nAfter a night of fudging around with a shape roughly based on the simpler and smaller [Tupolev TB-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_TB-3), and going through piles and piles of different propellers, I finally managed to put together a 3 blade, variable pitch unit good enough to send 25 tons of Ural steel up to the required flying speed of 20 meters per second! Thusly, I named it the AM-34RD variant, as it was the more streamlined long range modification and conveniently also had 3 bladed propellers.\n\nThere, our brave Kosmonauts, now doing the Motherland proud by piloting this rare jewel of the Koviet nation\u0027s historical glory, reported remarkably little could ever go wrong due to the glacially slow flying speed and mammoth reserve lift capacity. Even if it would somehow drop out of the sky (impossible!), absolutely nothing would happen to the crew and passengers. \n\nThusly, it was decided nothing in the way of crew amenities or safety features were to be provided.\n\nTruly, even in the 1930s, Koviet engineering has no equal! And now, Comrade Reader, you too can see the TB-3 AM-34RD Replica for yourself, as the craft file is hosted on KerbalX!\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/crafts/2116](http://kerbalx.com/crafts/2116)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/VWev_lT_dpI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T10:44:44Z","Content":"Ha!

To add a bit of game balance I allowed acceleration beyond the historical 300kph but there would be insufficient pitch authority to prevent the plane from doing its own thing!\n\nThis was one of the most advanced TB-3 models used for anything from bombing, paratroop transport to fighter mothership in the SPB/Zveno project, first seeing combat in 1938 in the Russo-Japanese conflict."}]}
