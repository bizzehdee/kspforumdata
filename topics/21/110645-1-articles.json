Who needs fuel efficiency when fuel is nearly free?\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/mSfzf)\n\nWith all the napkin science worked out, I started building the boat, laying out the keel and structural framing to get a rough idea of how the vessel will turn out. As hull plating was applied, redundant structure was removed and I soon inverted the ship to fully plate over the bottom side, its shape dictated by the airfoil parts available in stock KSP. \n\nOnce done, I flipped the ship the right way up and used the exact same airfoils to create the main deck, offset slightly down so the boat had a reasonable gunwale height. \n\nThe superstructure consists of living quarters at the bottom, a flying bridge, and an air conditioned high tech conning tower comprised of a humble Mk. 1 lander can. \n\nPutting the ship to sea was easy - just make a gigantic rover with a basic chassis and jettison it once in the water. If the rover frame gets stuck on the ship just go to space center and delete the debris. The trawler has a top speed of 16 knots (8 meters per second) which is quite decent for a coastal vessel. \n\nEndurance and range depends on payload - the craft shown in video has a minimal fuel load for a short 20 minute builder\u0027s trial, while the configuration supplied in the KerbalX link above has two aircraft fuel tanks and should be good for about 2-3 hours of sailing.\n\n![8lAUol1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8lAUol1.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T15:48:30Z","Content":"Lol that is awesome!\n\nJust like your truck, for times when I don\u0027t want to recover things (It makes me feel like I am cheating...)!\n\nThis will rock!\n\nDownloading ASAP"},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T15:51:30Z","Content":"Does this work with better buoyancy or would it need some tweaking to keep it from sinking down into the water?"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T01:05:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Does this work with better buoyancy or would it need some tweaking to keep it from sinking down into the water?\n\nDefinitely will need tweaking.
