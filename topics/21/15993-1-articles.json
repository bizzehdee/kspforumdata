With lower gravity on Minmus, the fuel consumption to get a 2-3/ms landing is a lot easier then on the Mun, so I tend to have less fuel for the return trip on my Mun trips. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design is simple, but it works!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, landing on Minmus left me with a rather interesting position, which you\u0027ll see in the screen shots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have video of the ship sitting in the way that it is for proof, sadly I don\u0027t have video of the actual landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to get rid of the wobble that exists, remove the ladders on the 2nd stage, and add stabilizers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-04T06:03:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2012 06:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Dariuas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
