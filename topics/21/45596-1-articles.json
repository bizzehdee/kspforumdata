I imagine the real value is in the stable launch vehicle that puts a lander into orbit and has enough dv to drop into lunar orbit before separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3x4 Skipper engines power stage Five with x4 T30\u0027s overlapping into stage Four. Preset throttle to minimum 80% and launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you have a sliver of fuel left on stage Five, light stage Four. Five should expire seconds later if you time it correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExecute stage Three to to drop the Skippers; throttle up T30s to 100% simultaneously. They should drop away cleanly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii110/ozzallos/Kerbal%20SS/screenshot24_zps45e32119.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot24_zps45e32119.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Astra lander is a simple, centerline design. A Poodle provides the horsepower while 4 1x6 solar panels supplement power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe\u0027s good for there and back. This lander is designed to return in one piece, so simply de-orbit and deploy chutes at the appropriate time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggest a fuel load of less than 50% when you pop the chutes and a descent of less than 12m/s to withstand touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding lights are provided along the landing struts to provide depth during low light descents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii110/ozzallos/Kerbal%20SS/screenshot19_zpse21f032e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot19_zpse21f032e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Excelion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch vehicle is basically the same as the Astra, just with a bit more fuel and a couple more T30s in stage Six (six to be exact). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe won\u0027t have enough juice to break Kerbin orbit by herself, but it will give you a healthy start on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame basic launch profile as the Astra. The payload is heavier, so preset throttle to 100% and launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce there\u0027s only a hair\u0027s worth of fuel left on stage Seven, activate stage Six to burn concurrently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeven should empty seconds later. Use stage Five to dump the boosters and ramp back to 100% (assuming you throttled back to conserve fuel on the way up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn to Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii110/ozzallos/Kerbal%20SS/screenshot20_zpse9457bd8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot20_zpse9457bd8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Excelion lander is a different animal entirely. Four 909s provide the lander with it\u0027s primary thrust and there\u0027s plenty of fuel for at least two neighborhood landings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower comes in the form of 4 1x6 solar panels, and landing lights are standard equipment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main difference is in how we handle atmospheric landings. The Excelion lander can be landed full and intact, or as the stand alone command module. Or both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage Two will pop the primary chutes. Dump at least 50% of the fuel before hand to maintain structural integrity and ensure your drop is no more than 12m/s on landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage One will separate and boost the command module clear of Stage two in case of WTF. Stage zero deploy those chutes. You probably will survive this as long as you\u0027re over 500m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can actually land both modules intact (assuming you deployed the gear on stage two first).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, um, no file attachment ability anymore?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Napoleon","CreatedById":71252,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T23:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice!
