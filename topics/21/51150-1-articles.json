Empty (no extra payload at all) it can lift off the runway at about 80m/s loaded... well it gets on up there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created a \u0022Show\u0022 Version that is closer to the original than the \u0022work\u0022 version. The \u0022Work\u0022 version has a bunch of supports and increased engine and air intake for higher flying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1JVCy66.png\u0022 alt=\u00221JVCy66.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Show\u0022 Vulcan taking off from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1JVCy66.png\u0022 alt=\u00221JVCy66.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Work\u0022 Vulcan coming in for a bombing run on the KSC \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vcq1Ekd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Vcq1Ekd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, my best reenactment of Thunderball (Sean Connery James bond) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ha72jAO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ha72jAO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBombs Away!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have created bombs from structural fuseloges, and have created cruise missiles as basic rockets.
