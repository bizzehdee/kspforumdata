On the other hand, I usually rendezvous on solar orbit, and from them it\u0027s only a couple dozen m/s usually to get an aerocapture pass, so most of the delta-v in the mission is actually to raise the periapsis after capturing, and that is usually only high if you want to park in a low orbit. At the end, you end up using more fuel to get to the asteroid than to tow it into stable orbit! All in all, you could move an asteroid into a stable orbit with just a couple hundred m/s, and this should give, with just the two tanks that you get into orbit on the single launch, about as much delta-V as needed to capture \u0027roids of up to 1000-2000mT, if I have worked Tsiolkovsky right and you manage to only need about a couple hundred meters per second once you grab it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
