It features both a standard docking port (fore) and the new large size (aft). Quantum struts are used to strengthen connections with the smaller port. It uses a double set of nuclear engines to provide forward and reverse thrust without the need to completely rotate the craft (and the long train it\u0027s pulling). Action groups are used to toggle one set of engines on and the other off; while at the same time using colored indicator lights to show which engines are active. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly stock but with a B9 Aerospace cockpit and colored lights, and of course the Quantum Struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22466/Omni%20Tug.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edownload\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlbum (5 images) - \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/NH0XZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/NH0XZ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LGRs2qz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LGRs2qz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"musketeer","CreatedById":37885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T18:30:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice to have more engines, seeing as in Scott\u0027s KPS series, he has trouble actually moving the thing.

I do agree with musketeer, tho only to a certain extent. The thing can pull one of two modules at a time pretty well, but more than that it\u0027s just not worth it. You should probably think about making a bigger one in case you want to move whole stations at a time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Read have Read","CreatedById":60863,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T21:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI too made a similar one, but with 4 arms and Liquid rockets - it is probably too powerful.
