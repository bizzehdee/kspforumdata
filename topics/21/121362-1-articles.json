Both, or neither, may be needed on a ship, depending upon it\u0027s role. Blisters, added below the water line, aid in the flotation of ships. Bitts, added to the deck of the ship, aid in adding ballast. By right clicking and activating the Water Compressor, the Bitts begin filling with Compressed Water. As they begin to fill, the ship will gain mass and therefore sit lower in the water. To raise your keel, activate the Water Decompressor, which will evacuate the contents of the Bitts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShips that we\u0027re familiar with are able to pump water into various areas of the ship in order to achieve an even keel. You can also do this by right clicking on a Bitt, Alt-right click on the second Bitt and transfer Compressed Water between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you know what they are...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy Bitts and Blisters?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have successfully tested cargo ships with over 150 tons of cargo. The problem is, once the cargo is delivered, all of that mass evaporates from the cargo hold. When a ship is first built to carry this amount of mass, it may have the perfect waterline. Losing that mass can cause it to sit too high in the water. In Kerbol, this can create a deadly situation. Anything that makes contact with the surface of the water at high speed is destined to break. By turning on the Water Compressor and filling the Bitts after the cargo is delivered, you can replace that lost mass with ballast, thus, bringing the water line back down to a level where it\u0027s safe to travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlisters help ships float. Compressed Water causes them to sink. By balancing the two in your ship designs, you can hold a steady keel and achieve efficient speeds.[/Quote\u0027]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T17:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Azimech\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Azimech\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I\u0027m not going to give it wheels.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, why would you?
