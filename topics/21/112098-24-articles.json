I suppose this number could be reduced somewhat by aerobraking, but it seems kind of cheesy to have such a fragile craft as the MTV aerobrake (after all, it uses an inflatable habitat and giant solar panels. You could probably cut the round trip number in half to get the amount you need for a one way flight (for the two landers)."},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-26T15:40:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, otblock said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hey, I am interesting in taking this on, but before I really get down to business, I was wondering if there was some rule of thumb to see if a craft could feasibly get to Duna orbit?\n\u003E \n\nIf you take advantage of the Oberth effect it is a breeze, requiring only an extra 300 or so m/s at maximum Kerbin orbit. As long as it is highly eccentric. You need to take advantage of the speed generated heading towards Kerbin. Dumping the central tank further reduces dv required for a return trip. I would send a test craft out there and back. And as Trev says you don\u0027t really want to be aero braking anything except the two lander aero shells in a constellation mission.

I did nearly run out of fuel during the descent, but that was because I realized that I was going to land short of the target and had to adjust accordingly, spending more fuel and time.\n\nHere\u0027a an album of the next phase of the mission. it included the EVA, SPR activities, munar liftoff, and docking with Orion.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![gNhm6Iu.png](http://i.imgur.com/gNhm6Iu.png)\n\nI wonder if that EVA follower mod I saw one time still works, it would be really helpful in situations like this.\n\n![1aVk50y.png](http://i.imgur.com/1aVk50y.png)\n\nThe rover was delivered to the surface easily, but I realized that I had attached the decoupler backwards (it\u0027s actually attached to a cubic strut on the rover\u0027s underside and moved to the top with the offset tool), so the RCS pod stayed attached to the rover the whole time.\n\n![5OA7JRF.png](http://i.imgur.com/5OA7JRF.png)\n\nI planned on doing two or three EVAs, each including some activities near the landers and an excursion with the SPR to various locations around the crater that I thought looked interesting, mirroring the later Apollo landings. The first destination was a smaller crater on the edge of the big crater. It involved driving uphill for the first part and finding a way over the rim of the big crater into the small one. it turned out to be a rigorous test for the SPR.\n\n![vOJSHJc.png](http://i.imgur.com/vOJSHJc.png)\n\nClimbing over the crater\u0027s rim was dangerous and tense, but the rover handled it quite well.\n\n![AnUGqaA.png](http://i.imgur.com/AnUGqaA.png)\n\nInside the small crater the crew stopped and got out of the rover to walk around a little bit, place a second flag marking the point of furthest excursion, and pose for a photograph with their rover.\n\n![Ee6eeaT.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ee6eeaT.png)\n\nUnfortunately, the driver (Macvan Kerman, not me) had come to believe that the SPR was indestructible, and was much less careless on the way back down the crater. The rover did survive this jump unharmed, however it did not arrive back at the landers in driveable condition.\n\n![piKHPd7.png](http://i.imgur.com/piKHPd7.png)\n\nAlong the way the front windows, one of the things on the side (I have no idea what they would have been in real life), and the front left wheel all broke off the rover, leading Mission Control at KSC to cancel the other two EVAs and get in touch with the DMV to have Macvan\u0027s driver\u0027s license revoked. The SPR was declared unserviceable and the crew abandoned it as soon as they returned to the landers.\n\n![HJbnjxf.png](http://i.imgur.com/HJbnjxf.png)\n\nThe lander was originally scheduled to lift off a day after the EVA, but due to an eclipse (and due to scatterer actually making the skies dark when it happened), the launch was delayed one day.\n\n![mVyTqVM.png](http://i.imgur.com/mVyTqVM.png)\n\nAltair back in munar orbit. \n\n![OdnEII7.png](http://i.imgur.com/OdnEII7.png)\n\nOne and a half revolutions later, Altair redocks to Orion and the crew transfer all the rock samples and written reports over to the Command Module. \n\n![agGqCr5.png](http://i.imgur.com/agGqCr5.png)\n\nAfter moving everything that doesn\u0027t need to come back to Kerbin into Altair, the crew seals the hatch and jettisons the lander.\n\n![QqeMLc1.png](http://i.imgur.com/QqeMLc1.png)\n\nAltair fired its APS to depletion and then used its RCS to place it in an uncontrollable spin (only because because I thought it looked cool). it impacted the munar surface and was completely destroyed.\n\nI promise to not post as many pictures this weekend.
