Why the concepts for this mission called for Altair to perform the lunar orbit insertion, I still do not know, but this is apparently what they would have done, so this is what I have to do.\n\n![6RUUeqO.png](http://i.imgur.com/6RUUeqO.png)\n\nAbout a day later, the CMP and LMP (I\u0027m not coming up with brand new designations for the crew when I can just use the ones from Apollo) perform a spacewalk to examine Altair. The LMP egresses from Altair and climbs up and down the ladder to ensure that it can be used for reaching the surface of the Mun once landed. He also inspects the exterior of Altair to check for any damage caused by the launch or the two days spent in orbit.\n\n![lrWlzYl.png](http://i.imgur.com/lrWlzYl.png)\n\nThis is the best recreation I can do of [this sort of famous photograph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Gumdrop_Meets_Spider_-_GPN-2000-001100.jpg) from Apollo 9.\n\n![Y56KrqT.png](http://i.imgur.com/Y56KrqT.png)\n\n![oI16xeT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oI16xeT.jpg)\n\nAfter the spacewalk comes the most dangerous but also most important part of the mission. Altair undocks from Orion and prepares to fire its engine for a two hour flight test. Only the CDR and LMP are inside. This isn\u0027t a landing mission, so there isn\u0027t any need to endanger all three crew members by putting them all in a ship that cannot return to Kerbin. CMP is still in Orion, inspecting the lander one last time before it departs.\n\n![jDi3pOE.png](http://i.imgur.com/jDi3pOE.png)\n\n![WYZFBml.png](http://i.imgur.com/WYZFBml.png)\n\nAltair releases its drop tanks while at the maximum distance from Orion. They weren\u0027t completely empty because I apparently haven\u0027t connected the fuel lines properly, but I decided that I wouldn\u0027t get another chance after this one since I planned to return to Orion after this orbit.\n\n![WtSvtWk.png](http://i.imgur.com/WtSvtWk.png)\n\nOn the way back the descent stage is jettisoned, Altair will complete its mission using the ascent engine.\n\n![yTp7Cq7.png](http://i.imgur.com/yTp7Cq7.png)\n\nRendezvous with Orion is almost complete, although it\u0027s been well over a year since I tried to do a manual rendezvous and docking, I found that it wasn\u0027t that hard, so I didn\u0027t use that much fuel.\n\n![lnZf7Dp.png](http://i.imgur.com/lnZf7Dp.png)\n\nAltair\u0027s ascent stage is docked and the crew have returned to the Command Module to continue the mission. Because Altair still has at least two thirds of its ascent fuel supply left, I think I\u0027ll use it to launch Orion into a high altitude orbit before casting off the lander.\n\nI\u0027m trying to decide if the next mission i fly with these should be a Constellation copy of Apollo 10 or just go for a landing so I can actually tell whether they\u0027re ready for release."},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T18:30:58Z","Content":"[@Servo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/149419-servo/) and [@Frank_G](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/100000-frank_g/)\n\nAwesome landers!"},{"CreatedByName":"JaffaPadawan","CreatedById":164464,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T23:25:18Z","Content":"After looking at this thread, I \u0027ve decided to make my own Constellation pack.

I\u0027ve gone through two habs, ground vehicles (DIPS/FSPS/SPR), cargo landers, NTR stages.\n\nThe other thing I realized is that designing your SLS to have a realistic (I.E. equal) payload capacity is way overkill when all your mission elements weigh less. If the payloads were less unwieldly, I have the mass-to-orbit to do the whole thing in three launches.
