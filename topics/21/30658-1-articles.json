First time posting a ship up on the forums, so feel free to tell me what to do better. It\u0027s a neat design that I thought I\u0027d share.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresenting, the Parallax!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u30F5nM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u30F5nM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, it\u0027s a very tall ship. The bottom engines actually extend past the floor of the VAB. The whole ship has more than 15,000 m/s delta V, which is good for a rocket without nuclear engines. The only mod parts used are the fairings and a mirco ASAS from the KSPX expansion pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift off:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FLfmuhm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FLfmuhm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeparation of first stage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WPoqgmE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WPoqgmE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage uses radial attachment points to create an artificial \u0022stack\u0022 that is wider than single parts. Combined with mainsails, this produces a huge amount of thrust and burn time, which is necessary for a linear rocket of this size. The fairing jettison at the same time to avoid the stage damaging the next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third stage, partly used to circularize, in a 170k orbit; the rocket still has 11 km/s of delta V left:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Iv9Jx3G.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Iv9Jx3G.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file and part package coming when I sort out which fairings are used.
