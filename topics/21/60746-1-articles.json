This a new SSTO... well, it kind of is, but not the usual one, what with wings and all that. No need for those! This is a consumer ship, and we had to cut on something to appeal to the not-so-wealthy masses. Not everybody has a runway they can take off from, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, a brief description. This thing is meant as the ultimate personal spacecraft... for those on a budget! While being small, it sacrifices none of the range, allowing the single kerbal to step in any place on kerbin\u0027s vicinity on its own without a costly support system only accessible to wealthy states and corporations. But, if you are indeed a dirty capitalist and have access to resources such as motherships and refueling depots, the PPPC will still be of use, acting as a very light auxiliary craft that can either serve the escape pod or light shuttle role (optional autopilot included) on pretty much any reasonable body on the system (that is, everywhere but Tylo and Eve), not to mention being a very capable scout craft on its own, if you can forgive the spartan conditions of the tiny cabin.

And you don\u0027t waste pretty much none of it getting to orbit, there are enough intakes in there for that single turbojet to put you in a 120km apoapsis, and from there circularizing means raising your periapsis form the 35kms it ends up when you finally run out of air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM\u003C/strong\u003E (Pretty light right now, but I\u0027ll try to improve it, you are welcome to submit your screenies! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/uckQY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
