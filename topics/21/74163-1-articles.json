Technically, in lift configuration, it needs some additional boosters (included here), but if it is just recovering payload from orbit, it is fine on it\u0027s own. First, the list of mods in use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadly Reentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMech-Jeb (In this case for orbital info, it can so not fly this thing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have others installed, but they are not used here, this is the list if you want to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I go into the design, here is the Verti-Shuttle.

It could safely deorbit and land a block of lead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rationale behind this is that with playing in career mode, that I will eventually need something to go pick up spent boosters from my early career, which, despite my best efforts, are still in orbit. I have used grabber claw vessels in the past, but I thought it might be useful to have something that could recover, say, crewed vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReady for launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C4ClN2j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022C4ClN2j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor anyone who cares to down load this craft, here are the ascent and landing profiles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent Pitch targets:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@1000m - 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA Pitch \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@5000m - 50\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA Pitch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@12000m - 35\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA Pitch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@20000m - 15 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA Pitch \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@21000m - Booster Separation NOTE: The aerodynamics of the craft are designed for the boosters to separate THROTTLED UP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@30000m - 5-10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA Pitch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@45000m - Nosecone ejection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis profile has given me at least 2/3 fuel in the main tank after circularization.

It\u0027s interesting (looking cool doesn\u0027t hurt either).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made something somewhat similar at one point, which is an SSTO booster stage using RAPIER engines that would decouple and deorbit once it\u0027s payload was in orbit, and land on \u0027chutes for recovery. All it was really good for was taking a three man capsule into LKO, so it was eventually replaced by some SSTO shuttle-planes I built. Yours seems more versatile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
