I used a lot of fuel not sending my kerbal to a fiery death).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship currently only has two docking clamps, which I may move or add more of in the future, along with a HSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway! enough boring crap, here are some screens from the adventure!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

A ship like that is great, but you don\u0027t actually get to walk on the planets/moons you visit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this reason, my interplanetary stuff is more or less always a space-train of a lander and an efficient transfer vehicle bolted on to it.

I usually go for a smaller lander attached to a mothership of sorts, but then that has the problem of the momentous task of refueling the mothership....

I just have to find a way to get a ship to Duna surface, refuel it and back into orbit, where the carrier waits.

It puts deposits on the surface to mine, and adds converters to turn it into whatever fuel you need. So I have a lander with a large fuel supply that can land on any planet aside from Eve, and take a decent portion of fuel back up to the transfer vehicle. A few landings and I\u0027m refueled and ready to go to the next moon/planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/359/screenshot13qw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot13qw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xpiation","CreatedById":67885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T22:50:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, there is four docking ports, I am just worried that they will off-set the centre of mass if I use them, I may work on the spacing of my engines so that I can tug a module, similar to your second image, so long as I design the module to be centered nicely, and dock in the middle like you have. I don\u0027t think I will mod the game however, I will wait for squad to give me those features =P I like the challenge of fuel usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do you have to land your first rocket with thrusters?

Most of them I have just to give me more / nicer looking part options. The Kethane mod is there because I sort of like the logistics of moving fuel around all over the place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the added benefits of mod parts is that most of them are balanced for weight and capacity to the normal tanks, but are just \u003Cem\u003Ebigger\u003C/em\u003E, so I can have a fewer part count for the same thing, leading to less frustration over frame rates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat interplanetary tug is designed to be nice and stable. The fact that it pulls the lander rather than pushes it means it handles 4x physics warp perfectly fine, and the port doesn\u0027t compress like it does when you push something along. Having the engines behind the center of mass like that also makes it nice and stable during my burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of those images, the two ships both land on rocket / parachute power. The huge ship I posted has two nuclear engines for interplanetary burns and 4x 1700Kn engines for high gravity takeoffs and landings, though I usually only turn on two of them. On things like Minmus I can land on nuclear engine power alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most recent image I posted has a lander with 2x LV-T30 Engines (well, they\u0027re mod engines that are \u003Cem\u003Eslightly\u003C/em\u003E better on fuel in the atmosphere) and parachutes to bring it down. That one can take off of anything other than Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end I like the smaller ship as it\u0027s not as ugly and doesn\u0027t turn like a brick. But I think the puller design is a lot more suited to toting stuff around the solar system than pusher designs. If only for the long physics warp burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - you mention docking things. I\u0027ve found that as long as ports are fairly close to the center of mass, and as long as what you dock isn\u0027t too heavy, you can have it a little uneven, and SAS will compensate for you. Especially if you\u0027re using low thrust engines like the nuclear ones. That second image of mine - I had small probes docked to each of the three external tanks at one point, and I put them in orbits around various things. The whole vehicle flew fine with one or two probes missing. Then again they only weighed like 2 tons each. YMMV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also didn\u0027t mention - I have a rover at the bottom of the lander that can re-dock and be taken to every world the lander goes to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/6363/screenshot15ut.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot15ut.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover\u0027s docking port sits just slightly higher than the port on the lander. The rover has the ability to retract and deploy its wheels. If I retract the wheels as I\u0027m rolling under the lander, I come under the docking port. Then I redeploy the wheels and the ports meet and I\u0027m good to take off again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to use a mod called Damned Robotics that had hinges and things to dock the rover a bit more easily, but it\u0027s still bugged in .20, so I just went with the rover squatting technique to get it to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-01T00:35:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2013 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Immashift\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
