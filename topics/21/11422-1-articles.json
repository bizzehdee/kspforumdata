Make sure you still have some jet fuel and apply a small amount of thrust to give yourself some forward momentum. \n\nIf you lose control and go into a spin, don\\\u0027t panic. Activate ASAS, apply some throttle, wait till you straighten out, pull up slowly... or eject and glide back to Kerbin."}]}
