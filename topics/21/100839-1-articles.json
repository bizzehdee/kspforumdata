It allows small fragile, non-heat shielded, non-aerodynamic vehicles to survive Kerbin Re-entry and landing unharmed by providing them with an aerobraking and ablative heat shield to hide behind as well as landing chutes and an impact absorber. I needed a way to get my science data and samples from clunky landers only the surface of Kerbin for the big science payoff. This is more of an intermediary stage than a vehicle and has become standard for all my science retrieval missions. \n\nIt\u0027s a platform that smaller ships dock to in order to re-enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. I have made two sizes, one for my \u0022micro landers\u0022 and one for full sized ones.\n\nThe system includes a heat shield, SAS gyroscope, Orbital deorbit thrusters and a small amount of fuel for same, plus retrograde hold (essential!) and power for the trip down.\n\nThis is my first post on this forum and I\u0027m not sure how to post the files. If you\u0027re interested, just let me know.\n\nAll of this is done using Deadly Re-entry and FAR.\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot57.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=12](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot57.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=12)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot59_1.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=9](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot59_1.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=9)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot66.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=13](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot66.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=13)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot70.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=14](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot70.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=14)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot81.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=10](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot81.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=10)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot83.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=11](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot83.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=11)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot87.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=8](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot87.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=8)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot100.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=7](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot100.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026o=7)\n\nThat was for my micro-lander. I have a version for full sized ones or other vehicles of similar size. On this version the ring typically takes damage on landing but that\u0027s it\u0027s job! The lander, payload and crew will be safe!\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot229.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=1](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot229.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=1)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot230.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=3](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot230.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=3)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot233.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=4](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot233.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=4)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot241.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=6](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot241.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=6)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot247.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=5](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot247.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=5)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot252.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=2](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot252.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=2)\n\n[http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot256.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=0](http://s141.photobucket.com/user/thenewpav/media/screenshot256.png.html?sort=3\u0026o=0)"}]}
