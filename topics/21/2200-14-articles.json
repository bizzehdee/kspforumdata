TiberDyne ASAS allows for flawless level flight (Control surfaces don\\\u0027t move \u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E unless you try making it move), so can point in a direction, activate SAS, and relax.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithin the first thousand meters its speed at full throttle ranges between 200 - 230m/s, not exceptionally fast. However, this craft is recommended for higher-altitude flight where its speed can really shine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l223/SpootKnight/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot26.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot26.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the subject of modular capability, currently displayed SFO uses radial parachutes (Later shown) to make up for the lack of deployable landing gear, with this catastrophic damage can be nearly avoided entirely. Should the force of the parachute deployment however tear the wings in half, the cockpit stage can be jettisoned with its own radial parachute. In place of the parachutes and decoupler, SFO can instead be fitted with an RCS tank and thrusters to allow for maneuvering at extreme altitudes. This loadout unfortunately, renders SFO completely devoid of any safety measures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l223/SpootKnight/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot28.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot28.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith some carelessness, SFO can be taken to the Mun as-is. This comes at the cost of ensuring there is no return back to Kerbin as it will have only enough fuel to make some form of orbit, or to crash it into the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, would you mind posting the .craft file here?
