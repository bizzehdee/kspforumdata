It\u0027s definitely the largest and most complex project I\u0027ve undertaken and with a combined part count in excess of 1000 is by far the biggest to date. Before I even started building it I did two others just to get some experience and figure out what needs to go into building a decent moon base. There were a lot of lessons learned for me and I will be adding them to this thread as well as encouraging everyone to share their experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027arial black\u0027;\u0022\u003EMun City\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll KSP images have been moved \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/IxZdi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EView from above: This is the first sight of Mun City that greets visitors as they come in for a landing.

In this case I wanted it on top of that mountain it was a compromise I had to make... In this view you can clearly see the escape rocket as well as the large Gryphon rover used to assemble the base.

LOL, I was wondering when someone was going to say that... don\u0027t worry, I will provide all the craft files that are pictured in this thread and an explanation on how they are landed and assembled on other moons and planets. I\u0027ve already done stuff that\u0027s way beyond what\u0027s pictured here and everything I do is stock. My plan is to build a base on Duna that\u0027s even bigger than Mun City and document the whole process. These things take time however, if you\u0027re looking for the Nexus-III module with the curved connectors, here\u0027s the file which includes launcher and landing/roving system...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWARNING!! this craft file has over 900 parts - most of which are in the launcher... This was originally done in .22 so the big rocket parts aren\u0027t used in it\u0027s design, I was going to update it to reduce the part count, but if you want early access here it is, warts and all. You\u0027ll need a decent PC and fairly advanced piloting skills to land it on the Mun but knock yourself out.
