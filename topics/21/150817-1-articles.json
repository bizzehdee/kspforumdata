I wanted to build a rather huge spaceplane that can bring a station up in orbit... but of course that was not big enough! First I tried making several streches of mk3 bays but I could not quite get those designs go fast enough to make it into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe result was\u00A0one long mk3 bay for the main station parts and two bays for solar cell arrays etc. additional bits and pieces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain specs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n~45 tons of payload to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n173 parts, 195 tons of weight with no cargo, 353k funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pic is more telling than many words, so here she is looking all pretty in\u00A0orbit (gotta have moar lights!):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OMDIW_orbit.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://koti.kapsi.fi/petti/random/OMDIW_orbit.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are craft files if you want to try it out:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://koti.kapsi.fi/petti/random/KSP/MarkyMark.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file for just the plane\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://koti.kapsi.fi/petti/random/KSP/MarkyMarkStation.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESame craft with the test load station bits visible on the screenshot above.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane is not really fully optimized but it\u0027s already fairly easy to fly (well after some tries..). I like to set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on and caps lock the fine controls on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStage to set off with the air breathing engines, there is not very much pitch authority but she is steady on the runway so I like to keep her straight until the end of the runway and then pitch up when the runway falls off.\u00A0Try to keep building speed all the time\u00A0to get the engines to the powerband, then start pitching up more, still maintaining some acceleration. I like to keep one rapier and one whiplash detail window open to follow the thrust, first point about 5 degrees pitch to build speed, once you see thrust build up fast pitch up a couple of degrees more,\u00A0still maintaining acceleration and increasing thrust. Once the rapiers go well past 300 kN you should be able to start pitching up carefully. When the air-breating mode runs out of steam it\u0027s time to stage the poodle in (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is already good) and switch the rapiers to closed cycle. Once your time to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E starts rising fast it\u0027s time to shut off the rapiers and let the poodle take you to orbit slowly, around 10 degrees pitch prograde will be sufficient to maintain the climb and build speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAction groups are needed to control the engines:\u00A0Hit 1 to switch the rapiers to closed cycle mode when you start losing so much thrust that you don\u0027t gain any more speed. Hit 2 when the whiplashes run out of power (closes also the intakes). hit 4 to toggle the rapiers off to use just the poodle for finalizing orbit / orbital maneuvres. 3 controls the cargo bay doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t really tweaked everything to be optimal, I\u0027m sure this can be still improved fairly easily to get better performance and maybe cut some costs. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E may not be perfect since \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E balancer was not working with 1.2 when I built this, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe amount of liquid fuel / ox you need really depends on the ascent profile and payload.. experiment!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA gradual descent deorbit should work, the huge hull means you can do effective aerobraking and lose some speed in the upper atmo,\u00A0but avoid large pitch\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAOA\u003C/abbr\u003E in the atmosphere, if you flip it\u00A0is game over..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
