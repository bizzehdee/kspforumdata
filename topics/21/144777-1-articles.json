To properly fly them, you may need to right-click on the core and use \u0022control from here\u0022. Some ships, however, will be equipped with forward-facing pods or docking ports that serve well as an alternate control point. In addition, the weapons on these vessels are ALL missile-based. Some are dumbfire (such as the i-beam rockets on many of them), others are guided, like my widely-equipped 1.25 meter Anti-Ship Missiles, stock weapons designed to destroy other armored vessels made from stock parts at intermediate ranges (making them overkill for ships with little-to-no armor plating).

few shots).\u00A0 The central girder is exposed in teh spot where the weapons bays are located, a centralized mount which allows you to accurately aim individual shots usually leads to this being severed and the ship is separated in half.\u00A0 The NX-1 is also somewhat vulnerable to a mobility kill although achieving this with either ibeams or ASMs is not reliable.\u00A0 Both ships are actually very hard to kill with a phasing style ASM since you need to hit the core girder, a small target (and with teh amount of lag both create its pretty much a gamble, sometimes the ASM doesnt do jack, sometimes it tears a chunk out, rarely splits the ship though.\u00A0 That said, almost every time it takes 4-6 ibeams to achieve a kill which means i have to empty an entire SRM-6 into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/I2eVOBB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022I2eVOBB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNX-3 is pretty

would be very beneficial if you gave that small section its own dedicated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines (like a pair of 48-7s) and that

also a mized bag, usually takes 2 hits because the first may or may not actually hit the core girder (and if it doesnt it generally doesnt wipe it out completely.\u00A0 That said, it is extremely

does get split.\u00A0 I suggest making the engines connected to the sides instead of the central girder so that the halves can remain functional after the ship is split apart.\u00A0 If you move the engines so they connect to the sides and perhaps add 1-2 more weapons to these sections then you will end up with a ship that is not only solid to begin with (yeah it can get split but its not too reliable and requires multiple hits to the core area) but actually remains a threat even after its been split in half.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

tries).\u00A0 That said, if im not spot on i can empty 6 shots into it and it will still have 1 engine fully functional!\u00A0 As for ASMs, its generally solid, occasionally splits but its still very unlikely (or way less then most of the competition).\u00A0 Only way to reliably kill this thing is using heavy torps (7-10t), or triple SRM-6 (there is not a single ship ive ever encountered that can take 18 ibeams and not be neutered to the point its useless).\u00A0 Also, its basically free of any weakspots (besides the obvious engine cluster which is kinda unavoidable, though you did armor it to the point that even that doesnt die easy).\u00A0 TLRD, this ship is one of the best armor wise ive ever seen since 1.1 came out!\u00A0 Too bad the same cannot be said about the part count/mass, and its firepower is less then stellar.\u00A0 If you could make a version of this that carries 2-4 ASMs you\u0027d have the best warship on here...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

achilles heel is the engine which seems to die way too easily, almost as easily as its little brother the NX-12.\u00A0 If you can add some armor near the engines (or perhaps spread the engines out

port from directly in front and you are near guaranteed to wipe out primary weapons and have a good chance of doing alot of internal damage especially if ASM has shrapnel.\u00A0 that said, there are 2 sections that seem to be quite well protected but have nothing inside them.\u00A0 Its alot of mass that isnt doing anything, placing some fuel in the 2 front sides would be beneficial (or even some weapons firing out the front).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/A3BTzPO.png\u0022

its hull is kinda hard to actually kill because of lag that seems to cause projectiles to shatter doing absolutely nothing to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNX-21 is fodder, very easy to split with both ibeams and ASMs.\u00A0 Occasionally survives a hit but almost everything semi competitive that hits its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E kills it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNX-22 is surprisingly sturdy for the part count although it is very easy to neuter by shooting from the front by either killing the thruster or knocking off the ammo stacks (not exactly unexpected from mass driver based weapons).\u00A0 Gets split with sustained fire to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E too but this requires multiple hits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelios has seen better days, but it is still not easy to vaporize with SRM-6 unless you empty the entire magazine into the engines or get a lucky hit on the root girder.\u00A0 One weakness is that it tends to loose most of its armor plating to the first hit (the way its connected to the core is through 2 spots, both of which are easy to kill from the top/bottom.\u00A0 Then with open internals its just a matter of good aim and firing enough shots to kill it.\u00A0 Sometimes gets 1 shot obliterated but this is not common, happens more with ASMs then ibeams...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/QxFS9SE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QxFS9SE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all i really like these things, although i cannot say the same for the part count.\u00A0 The NX-16 is the best hands down as it just WILL NOT DIE!\u00A0 A few things that i see are very common with your builds are centralized engines.\u00A0 While some ships have these armored quite well, there is basically nothing that can be done to actually keep a centralized engine from dying, so you are better off with 2 or more separate engines, all of which need to be targeted individually for a mobility kill keeping a single ibeam from accomplishing this.\u00A0 Another thing you may want to consider in the future is to change from a XL girder based skeleton to one based entirely on ibeams.\u00A0 Ibeams have a smaller hitbox and the exact same mass meaning the probability of killing a ibeam is somewhat less then that of killing a girder, not to mention they give you more room inside a ship to build with.\u00A0 You dont have to make everything out of them, but at least make the vital center spine out of those and then build outwards in a similar manner to how your ships are already built.\u00A0 It should offer somewhat better armor.\u00A0 Other then that i think your new line of ships is solid, maybee try to cut some parts (as those are very high) too...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScriptKitt3h","CreatedById":82780,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-14T01:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca
