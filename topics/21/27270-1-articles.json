Those forward mono fuel tanks could also be the culprit, but unlikely - you could plant them further back just in case. For my money though, I\u0027ll bet that it is a spike flameout due to the scoops. Set the mechjeb 2 tolerance to 20% to prevent flameout and you\u0027ll see your air runs out around 20,000 or so with that setup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
