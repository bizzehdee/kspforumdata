It has no RCS, but future versions may. Climbing with your velocity indicator at 45 degrees with 150 m/s speed should put you into orbit easily. You can also cruise at a minimun speed of 85 m/s with your velocity reticule on the horizon, but I\\\u0027ve gotten it down to 76 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problems I have had with this craft is its tendency to go into uncontrollable end-over-end flips if you pull up or drop the nose too fast.
