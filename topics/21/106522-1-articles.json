(A play with the SUKHOI line of russian fighters, wich sorta inspired this design)\n\nIt is able to go all the way up to 1015m/s (around mach 3) before exploding! here are some more pictures of it:\n\n![XDUyLu0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XDUyLu0.jpg)\n\nParked infront of the administration building after a flight to the old airfield\n\n![Jy2y5b4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Jy2y5b4.jpg)\n\nbreaching the sound barrier shortly after takeoff\n\n![xUDBMro.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xUDBMro.jpg)\n\nstarting to catch fire...\n\n![p6PkHKB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/p6PkHKB.jpg)\n\nslowed it down a little so it didnt explode, and got a shot at it droping the droptanks\n\n![sy2O7RN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sy2O7RN.jpg)\n\nand there it is going at max speed! the plane started exploding 1second after i took that picture, getting the wings ripped off, and only the main fuselage remained.\n\nit has 2 airbrakes and 2 radial droge parachutes to help it land and halt to a fullstop quickly. \n\nthats it, hope you liked it and also that it gave you the inspiration to build some ridiculously fast plane!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T17:12:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by andrew2343**"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:36:17Z","Content":"Nice job!

For imgur the owner of the picture just clicks on the picture and to the right there will be a few options.... one of which is BBCode, copy that one and you can paste it here without insert image option and shazaam! You have an imbedded picture.\n\n![esmPSJP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/esmPSJP.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T17:02:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 05:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo**"},{"CreatedByName":"andrew2343","CreatedById":56356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:08:46Z","Content":"oh ok i didnt know how to do those things, thanks for noting that!"}]}
