It has about 4500m/s delta-v while fully refilled with LV-N engines.\n\n![ZgZ6zXJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZgZ6zXJ.png)\n\n**Please leave a** **comment** if you like it. I might share the craft after I have finished my **modification** to **1.0** ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nAlso, I would demonstrate the **weapon system**, **refuelling** and **reloading** process on this post later. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Chozo Nomad","CreatedById":60301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:11:24Z","Content":"Nice!
