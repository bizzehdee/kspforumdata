This is Tummanost Station, ready to provide interplanetary vessels with fuel and supplies, as well as offering the kerbalnauts returning from missions a place to prepare for their eventual returns to Kerbin. Docked to it at the moment are two Trevoga-class orbital service vessels and a single Sozvesdiye-class SSTO. Maximum rated occupancy is 20 kerbals, but the standard crew compliment is eight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/81551041/station1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022station1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"larsmaehlum","CreatedById":51566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T10:11:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat looks really neat!
