I closely studied the XC-305 for inspiration while still keeping aspects of my own building style involved as well. The ship is propelled by 8 Nervas and a pair of aerospikes giving it the impressive acceleration that is known across the Co-XX series and along with several reaction wheels offers impressive manoeuvrability compared to similar sized ships. Weaponry consists of 12 Hornet-III missiles for defence which work in concert with the advanced scanning and comms arrays to offer impressive beyond visual range capabilities. Docking ports mounted on the side of the ship allow the ferrying of items such as fuel, small fighters, Kethane drill or science packages across the system.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/1l0npem2p8e96v9/Co-23A.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wCiDPAI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wCiDPAI.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECo-22\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Co-22 is an upsized version of the earlier Co-21. Its was designed for the battle club and so features several small improvements over its predecessor. Landing gear are also featured in case you are insane enough to try putting the thing down on Minmus. The main gun is magazine fed, providing more shots at the expense of stopping power.

This new ship was a revolution in combat capability compared to its predecessors featuring a high impact spine, MK-3 armour, forward mounted weaponry and a boost system. Metal armouring was once again used despite not looking so nice as by this point combat ships were being manufactured by many companies and individuals and their capabilities were improving rapidly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe C variant was an experimental \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E corvette to deliver supplies directly to the surface of small planetary bodies and could provide local fire support for ground forces. However the base design of the Co-XX series has proved very poor for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E conversions due to the weight distribution and development was cancelled early on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Co-21D is the current front line ship of KIDA and the most recently developed of the series. The armour was further upgrades and the cargo bay removed to make room for more weaponry. The Co-21D is still very viable in current combat situations but newer ships such as the Drek have started to supplant it for front line roles.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Co-21E only briefly existed before my PC had to be wiped and all Data was lost on the vessel. It was equipped with a Kinetic cannon which provided impressive hitting power and the ammunition could be stored in a compact magazine. The last picture is of the Gn-21B which was the first of my ships equipped with such a weapon.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Co-21G is an aesthetic upgrade mainly although the mainsails have been replaced by LFBs with massively improve the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E while in boost mode.

The engine block and the bridge were completely redesigned while improved armour was added to the vital areas of the ship to increase survivability. An abort system was also added to get the crew to safety in the event of the ships destruction. However by this point forward facing weaponry and plate armour was becoming much more common and once again the Co-XX series was no longer the favoured ship series. Zokesia also started large scale manufacturing of warships and quickly took the lead in their development.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6izlc3io6w3bmlj/Co-10E.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jusDZAW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jusDZAW.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECo-8B/C\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs more people got into warship building, many designs arrived which were very nice looking and the Co-XX series was rapidly becoming outstripped by newer competition. The answer to this was the Co-8, providing much smoother looking wing armour and a cargo bay for freight hauling, the Co-8 could move quickly around the system and deliver payloads in style. The downside to being nicer looking was the white panels provided almost no protection from enemy weaponry and so the Co-8 was more popular with private businessmen than true military forces. The C variant provided slightly more armour and a stronger bridge. The Co-8 was one of the first ships to build off a central spine to greatly improve shock absorbance.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/pi2e461fhten503/CJ%20Co-8B.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pi2e461fht...%20Co-8B.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ankl5ppzpyyxhte/Co-10D.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UG8A2jY.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UG8A2jY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECo-6A\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Co-6A was significantly larger than earlier models and featured heaver armour and a larger engine block. It was the first ship capable of a Laythe trip (In my hands anyway) so extended KIDI\u0027s reach out to the Jool system. The armouring system was still MK-2 and so only provided protection from light weaponry.

All these crafts as great as they were/are had mostly just small docking ports to accomodate various missiles and torpedoes (but once I carried 2 small Sparrow shuttles form Zombiphylax docked to side ports of xc-305 or 701B). One great contruction point of xc series and its descendants was that the spine of the ship was made from girders strutted together, which made it quite stiff. I imageine future ultimate battleship/mothership as sort skeleton at its basic form. Just engines in the back, fuel going forward around spine made of girders, power generation (RTGs are too expensive in career mode, solar panels inefective in far way systems, so propably 1 rtg as backup, some 2 large panels and large power cell), massive torque (to compensate for carrying assymetric cargo loads), radiators. Keep it simple, keep it tidy, keeping parts count down, making it easy to refil fuel tanks - yeah finding and clicking fuel tanks under armor was always annoying with some ships.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo basicaly you would have this bare skeleton of a ship which would be quite light and easy to get into orbit and then modules to set it for particular mission profiles... Refinery module and mining lander, missile pods, science lab module, proprieatary SSTOs shuttles, dropship landers, hab modules for surface... I quite like Zekes \u0022base in box\u0022.
