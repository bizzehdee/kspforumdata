Then you can launch it back to space and rendezvous with a mother ship."},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T17:06:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know what the proper way is but it can definitely make 100km orbit.

(kinda like \u0022never land on steep slopes\u0022 or something...)\n\nDecent is fairly easy, you might need to adjust the deployment altitude of the parachutes, Eve is hilly, just follow the retrograde marker with airbrakes open the whole way, the drogue chutes are staged first, start deploying when you are under 150ms (the mach effects should have disappeared by then).\n\nOh yeah, don\u0027t land on slopes of more than a couple of degrees.\n\nI am putting together an album, ascent is basically straight up for 30km (control throttle to keep the craft from overheating), you will have left the boosters behind by this point, start your turn carefully till about 80km where you are completely out of atmosphere. It\u0027s easy to get the height but you need to keep an eye on your orbital speed to get an orbit.\n\nNote: I have been spending a bit of time on a Chinook replica.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T08:26:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 08:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by selfish\\_meme**"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T14:31:05Z","Content":"If taking off from Eve is more difficult in 1.0x than it was in .90, I don\u0027t see how 8500 d/v will get you to orbit from sea level.
