She flies... moderately well with SAS support, she\u0027s aerodynamically sound and really flies a lot better once she reaches ~10km and gets over 400m/sec. My problem is I\u0027m having trouble taking flex out of the wing segments, and she doesn\u0027t glide worth a damn once she runs out of fuel. In fact, she pretty much just goes into a modified ballistic nose dive as soon as she can\u0027t thrust vector anymore (this makes sense to me) but I havent been able to attach wing surfaces that make even the smallest bit of difference once she loses power. Do the wings need to be larger? Can I get away with strapping a booster on her back for her to ignite once she nears the edge of atmosphere to achieve orbit? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions, modified craft files, etc on how to get her into orbit and or maximizing her ability to glide?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21160358/2013-08-01_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-08-01_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21160358/2013-08-01_00003.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-08-01_00003.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21160358/SSTO%20TEST%20BED.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21160358/SSTO%20TEST%20BED.craft\u003C/a\u003E - Craft file\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"agentweez","CreatedById":26520,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T21:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso: is it possible to get bigger landing gear from another mod pack?

She never really gets above 1000 m/sec anywhere. Maybe she needs less drag but those intakes are the only thing giving her any go at the really thin atmosphere levels, and she\u0027s already pretty streamlined for drag besides the suckers. I really have no clue if there\u0027s anyway to visualize CoM in flight, or what reduced fuel weight in the tanks looks like. I was able to determine that she still flies really cleanly when she\u0027s hideously low on fuel. Like 5% fuel left she\u0027s still very stable in flight. I don\u0027t know about her speed, I know she\u0027s not moving fast enough in the really thin atmosphere to maintain altitude, I have to fly in the skipping method, diving down to 20-25 km to get a big breath of air, and then scream on full throttle back to her AP, ad infinitum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Matticus88\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Matticus88\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think front canards will help you alot.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENoted, I\u0027ll try that out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Autochton\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Autochton\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI use Taverio\u0027s Pizza and Aerospace landing gear, the stock ones become S size, and then adds M, L and XL versions in progressively bigger scales.\u003Cp\u003EFor wing flex, I would consider Procedural Wings, or struts until the morning comes.
