Also for talking about piston engine technology in general.\n\n![Rotary-Engine1.gif](http://cdn.wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Rotary-Engine1.gif)\n\nThe idea is to rapidly evolve this technology because it\u0027s fun and it\u0027s got great educational value, and will continue to do so. This tech won\u0027t disappear in 40 years time, some futurists tell us. Some people even want to use the atmosphere of Mars (CO2) to convert into methane and oxygen, and fuel Mars rovers with piston engines with it.\n\n![Marchetti%20anim%204.gif](http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/POWER/unusualICeng/cam-IC/Marchetti%20anim%204.gif)\n\nAt this moment in time KSP could be compared with the technology of 1865, just before the first working internal combustion engines got it\u0027s useful ignition system. This can and will change.\n\nHere\u0027s my stock example. It\u0027s huge, too many parts and too heavy. But it is the first stock, non welded, non supported engine.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Os3ifau3N5g?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nWhen using mods, please tell which ones. Personally, I don\u0027t like welding. That technology is far from mature, IMHO. \n\nI do like Procedural Parts and Procedural Fairings! They make life a whole lot easier!\n\nWho\u0027ll build the next? I want to race! \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-15T14:13:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2016 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Azimech**"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T20:54:57Z","Content":"LOL, wankel. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nSorry, I could\u0027nt resist.
