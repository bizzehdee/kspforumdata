Capable of lifting a fully loaded Rockomax 64 into orbit, or whatever other payload you see fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a matter of pure lift, it can probably handle better than 70 ton. However, the landing gear struggles at that weight; warranty void if payload exceeds 40 ton.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure to check the action groups; it isn\u0027t designed to use staging. Keep the Vernor thrusters turned off until it\u0027s time to lift the nose for the final burn at 30,000m/Mach 4. The abort system works fine in flight, but raise the nose before ejecting if something goes wrong during takeoff unless you feel like having 100 ton of spaceplane run you over. The degree of deflection on the forward flaps can be adjusted in flight by right-clicking. The forward-facing Sepratrons (triggered by action group 0) are for emergency braking assistance on short runways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/o0mgvh9jws4c1b6/Kerbodyne%20D7%20Heavy%20X5.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/o0mgvh9jws...avy%20X5.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/media/Kerbal/screenshot305_zpsda5f6b86.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/screenshot305_zpsda5f6b86.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot305_zpsda5f6b86.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-31T03:40:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2014 03:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdated image link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T05:24:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Wanderfound, I downloaded this .craft, but KSP won\u0027t load any spaceplanes when I have this .craft in my planes subfolder.
