The mission? get jeb back down from the fuel station at 250km orbit. Sadly I forgot to record or make screenshots from this pretty succesfull mission. bill just had enough fuel to manuver himself on to the fuel sation. jeb hopped right into the 2nd seat and let bill make the return flight. Landing was ... interesting, to say the least. even at low fuel the ship still nees some thrust on the jets or it falls right out of the sky. thankfully the vertical engines could provide enough lift to gently glide down pretty close of the runway.
