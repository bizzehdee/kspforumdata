With certain life support mods they also provide artificial gravity bonuses (e.g. \u0022Firm ground\u0022 in Kerbalism, which you usually only get when landed), plus they look great and have detailed interiors, plus SSPXr just got a major expansion to add 1.875m and 5m parts so there\u0027s even more centrifugal goodness to go around!
