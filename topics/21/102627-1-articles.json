And they were keen on air-breathing engines for fuel economy.\n\nWhich we did. To spec.\n\nAnd it just so happened that, during the development phase, we went from a rocket with jet engines on the fins to a craft with massive air-breathing nacelles and a strong resemblance to a Kothig castle.\n\nAnd thus the Flying Buttress was born.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/ZN8XE)\n\nIt should be able to reach an 80 km orbit around Kerbin with enough fuel to transfer to Minmus, land, and return safely.\n\nThe RAPIER engines are on automatic by default. It is recommended that you shut the air intakes (Action Group 1) when the engines switch from air-breathing to LOX. Doing so reduces drag noticeably, improving delta-V.\n\nIf you prefer, you can redo the action groups for manual switching of air-breathing and LOX modes, tied into the closing of the intakes.\n\nThe mobility enhancers (ladders) are keyed to the Gears action group as well--a legacy from earlier designs where landing gear and ladders would deploy at the same time.\n\nFurther testing will be done on the potential of shallower ascent curves allowing for greater speeds during air-breathing ascents. \n\n***Update 1:*** I\u0027m able to achieve 2166 m/s in leftover dV if I use a 20-degree ascent angle, versus 1741 m/s with a 40-degree ascent angle. Will soon try a hybrid--go 9 km straight up, then go on the 20-degree ascent until the engines cut, then switch to 40-degree to clear atmosphere and reduce drag effects.\n\n***Update 2:*** Thanks to the advice of Radam, I\u0027ve got a more optimal launch plan. If you launch straight up, then turn at 4 km and maintain (roughly) a 100 m/s vertical velocity until flameout/switchover, you can conserve about 3200 m/s in delta-V, ample to land on the Mun and return safely.\n\nI\u0027ve also got a variant, the Jupitec 7-A, which effectively replaces the Jupitec 7.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ysu5UnVKeE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n[***Download the Jupitec 7-A from Gameframer.***](http://gameframer.com/#/ksp/vessel-details/55248ba0d5d548f563e395e1)\n\n(Note: Gameframer is in alpha, and its delta-V estimates should be taken with a grain of salt.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T05:02:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 05:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LitaAlto**\n  \nUpdated with testing results"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T20:26:27Z","Content":"Nice!\n\nCan it land on the Mun too?"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T20:51:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nice!\n\u003E Can it land on the Mun too?\n\nThanks!\n\nI haven\u0027t attempted a Mun landing yet. \n\nI think the 7 doesn\u0027t have *quite* enough delta-V for the task, but I\u0027m experimenting with ascent paths to shave off some more delta-V beforehand.
