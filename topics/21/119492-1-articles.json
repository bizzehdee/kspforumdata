Specifically designed to drop any one of my base modules to the surface of any rock in the kerbol system (minus Eve and Tylo, as always). So, it does that, yeah, and that is kind of good.

See, I was looking for a new lander for the modules to provide the same service as the old Eagle, but the 1.0 changes certainly precluded the capabilities of that \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E cheaty ship (nuclear engines, VTOL, SSTO, capable of dropping a module on Duna and make it back to orbit...). Because that is impossible with the new, much more realistic atmospheric flight... right? Wrong! The mileage might be less, the payload may be just 10 mT, but this thing can SSTO kerbin like a conventional plane... or, refueled on the appropriate orbit, \u003Cem\u003Edrop a module on Val like a rocket-powered VTOL\u003C/em\u003E, for example. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket VTOL part might sound a bit overkill and unnecessary, but considering we don\u0027t yet have stock cargo bay doors that can be used on the ground, I kinda needed it to release the modules once landed. Still, with things with more clearance, I also did a nice trick, just because it didn\u0027t really cost me anything.

I probably won\u0027t use it in the end, but hey, it\u0027s there. And another \u003Cem\u003Etiny\u003C/em\u003E thing I added very late in development (it\u0027s not there in most of the pics), was actually one of the most inspired ideas. See, the shape precluded this docking to the base like the Base Rocektcrane currently does, and I was worried about 100% stock refueling (I accept that some people don\u0027t want to install KAS and KIS, awesome as they are). So I was toying around with building a Klaw-equipped refueling rover when it hit me. Why not putting the Klaw on the ship instead? I had a perfect spot on the tail for it and everything! So yeah, in the end, the ship that made me worry about refueling from a base, ended up being the thing that I will use to refuel \u003Cem\u003Eother vehicles\u003C/em\u003E. Because with a ISRU module, this makes one hell of a miner! And let me tell you, playing Lego with this thing is a lot of fun.

You can also see that I have set up a nice farm for the crew, courtesy of KAS, KIS, RoverDude\u0027s LS, and a bit of ingenuity.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few engineering notes: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe unusual design makes it a bit draggy (the side rocket VTOL engines, basically), so it\u0027ll take some doing to break Mach. The basic idea is to never overload it over 10mT (even tough it has the dV and, theoretically, the thrust) on Kerbin, because then you won\u0027t have enough T/W to overcome the Mach barrier at 10,000m, and you will burn liquid fuel like there is no tomorrow inching your way into thinner atmosphere. However, once you go supersonic with a 10mT load or less, it has TWR out the wazoo, so don\u0027t worry. Oh, and another thing, the rocket VTOL system. That is meant to be used to land on airless bodies, or to reduce vertical speed on Duna prior to touchdown, but actually, if the thing is almost empty, it develops TWR over 1 on Kerbin. So yes, technically, you can drop modules on kerbin, refuel, and go back to orbit for more. At least landing is going to be cheap in dV wherever you have an atmosphere! Oh, and note that in order for the VTOL system to be balanced, the rearwards tank should be empty, and also have in mind that the Thuds cannot access the fuel on the outboard wing tanks. It really is meant to be a \u003Cem\u003Esecondary\u003C/em\u003E system, and all mayor burns be done with the RAPIERs, where you have slightly more TWR and the same Isp. But really, if you do that, you shouldn\u0027t really notice, since by the time it has used less than half of its dV the thing self-adjusts for perfect VTOL balance until you empty the larger tanks, no matter which engines you use. Oh and I almost forgot! The cockpit is totally wrongly aligned, so make sure to select your point of control according to which propulsion system you use: probe core for horizontal flight, Jr. docking port for VTOL mode. They are handy to reach, just behind the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this baby, basically, you need \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E else to set up one of my base packs (ok, maybe the fuel depot to take it to the orbit of the rock you want to put the base one, but come on). With the ISRU module installed, it makes a decent miner. It can always work as a 10mT cargo SSTO. Did I mention the whole thing is a mere 80 parts? Setting colonies on, say, Laythe, must be a breeze, what with having a thinner atmosphere (less drag), and a lower gravity (even greater TWR, and more dV margin). Even Duna is doable! Though I wouldn\u0027t really \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E know, because it\u0027ll be some time before the Europa (my first ship to Jool in 1.0) or the Arrakeen (ditto for Duna) both finish assembly on Munar orbit and head out with two of these apiece. Maybe you guys will tell me how it does? In any case, I\u0027m hugely satisfied with it, and I hope you guys like it too.

I\u0027m glad you like it as much as I do, I feel like this is a worthy successor to the Eagle. I fact, considering the wide range of situations I built it for (SSTO in Kerbin \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E Duna with 10mT payload, basically), it handles a bit \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E good: such a design has no right to handle like a jet fighter. I mean, it\u0027s draggy and it has low TWR full on kerbin, but still: I reckon I could do aerobatics with it, and if you turn on the RCS system, it turns on a freaking dime whether there is atmosphere or not. Plus, I don\u0027t know why, but the plane-like shape makes figuring out RCS orientations easier under weird camera angles (actually I do, it\u0027s not radially symmetrical like rockets so your brain always knows which way is up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
