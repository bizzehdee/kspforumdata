They were unreliable, heavy, lacked sufficient power to even get it off the runway.

WOW :L\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow my Bomber fleet resides at KSP City and at Insular Airfield, waiting for the call, to fulfill the mission. They are extremely adaptable for different roles; i.e Reconnaissance, Science, Bombing, and they can be fitted with fuselage extensions and under-wing stuff. 10 Engines to get this thing rolling, compared to 15 and 2 Rockets to get my one rolling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66709-D-20-Defender-%28Nuclear-Class-Strike-Bomber%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66709-D-20-Defender-%28Nuclear-Class-Strike-Bomber%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hellbrand","CreatedById":65742,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T18:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E So Beautiful Thank you for the praise\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps If you\u0027re interested I could see some of your other designs and Help Fix them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
