I\u0027m looking for lightweight Eve lander designs that are capable of taking off from explodium-level on Eve. Anything under 100t? Is anything under 60t possible? Perhaps lower than 50t? The lighter, the better. Post .craft files and/or imgur pictures of the lander. I\u0027m looking primarily for stock craft, if that needs to be mentioned...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd just to clarify, I\u0027m looking for the lightest mass of the craft only after launching from Eve. Landing equipment can obviously be included, but the weight of that is not counted. Also anything that can carry at least one kerbal. Preferrably not something where they are in command chairs (although, that it welcome, too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-28T01:12:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2016 01:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Der Anfang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T03:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thread might have what you\u0027re looking for in it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/118750-post-10-lightest-sea-level-eve-ascent-challenge/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;embedComment=2128068\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-2128068\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
