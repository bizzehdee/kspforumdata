This craft is capable of 90x90km stable equatorial orbits, de-orbiting under its own power and landing safely on Kerbin (although location is based heavily on pilot skill and experience). Furthermore, it boasts a shielded Mk2 Clamp-O-Tron docking port for use with your existing orbital space tugs and refueling platforms. With a low part count and stock components, the Nolyks boasts ease of integration with your existing space exploration program, and can be further customized (within reason) to alter its mission profile.\n\nSpecialized Controls:\n\nAction Group 1: Manual R.A.P.I.E.R. engine mode toggle, Air intake open/close toggle.\n\nDisclaimer: Rowe Corp recommends the use of reaction force for the occasional stabilization issues, and absolutely denies any resemblance, direct or otherwise, to the Skylon space plane platform.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n[-=\u002BDownload Here\u002B=-](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026id=0B7woBToR2eXwM1FPQXppT0lXNlE)\n\n![uc?export=view\u0026id=0B7woBToR2eXwemVZY3pZQU1PTkE](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\u0026id=0B7woBToR2eXwemVZY3pZQU1PTkE)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T05:06:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 05:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zerik0**"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T06:30:52Z","Content":"Looks cool.

I hope you enjoy it. It\u0027s a Spartan in its simplicity, but with only a 31 part count and only one action group, it\u0027s friendly to a lot of computers and pilots, alike.\n\nYou could also easily switch out the docking port for a small cargo bay and deploy small or micro satellites. I just took it up again after posting this and easily achieved a 110x110 km orbit, deorbited over an ocean, leveled at 6 km and flew to a continent to land safely."}]}
