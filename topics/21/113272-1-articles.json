So after successful testing its capabilities, I wanted to share it out to the world. From Kaboom (a.k.a Misinterpreted) Inc, I bring you the ARAR rocket.\n\n**So what is its purpose?**\n\nIt\u0027s purpose is to bring 3 kerbals to an asteroid, rendezvous, and return. Now, in my test, it didn\u0027t have enough fuel to slow it down to meet the asteroid, but that was because I tried to get there faster and that is what I got\n\n**What are its features?**\n\nIt has about 1780 m/s delta-v after the transfer to an asteroid (or planet, you can go to Duna or Eve) 2 mini engines on the hab module for the impatient, 2 solar panels and 4 batteries for power, capacity for 11 kerbals, and its own launcher that sorta looks like the SLS\n\n**Pics?**\n\nNO! JK Here they are.\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=463451079](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=463451079)\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=463457285](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=463457285)\n\n**Download**\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/uz15ckxc950sy2i/ARAR%20Rocket%20Mk1.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uz15ckxc950sy2i/ARAR%20Rocket%20Mk1.craft?dl=0)\n\nHappy rendezvousing!"}]}
