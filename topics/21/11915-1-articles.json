The glider composes of a Long-winged Sailplane and a Launcher Cart. On takeoff, Drive full throttle down the runway and then, when the aircraft stops accelerating, Pull up and press space! Then turn up to vertical and level out as the sailplane slows. Ta-Da! you are gliding \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple issues to take note of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. A bug causes the cart to sometimes veer of the runway, if its starts veering in one direction then lightly tap in the opposite direction to compensate, If you are to harsh on the controls to bring it back straight then the craft will go out of control and crash\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Another bug sometimes causes the ailerons to do the opposite of what you want them too. Just try restarting the flight, it usually works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
