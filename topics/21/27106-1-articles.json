I\u0027m testing it next to the ksc, it holds up weight well, it\u0027s very visible from up high etc, but landing on it is HELL. Even if I double its size, this kind of precision landing demands a lot of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it were equally easy landing on the pad and on land I would use the pad because it\u0027s pretty, thus making this one of those rare cases where the lack of sense outweights the fun of doing it.

With only stock parts I think it\u0027s unlikely to make anything practical, you could experiment with landing struts or landing gears, as you retract each one it gives room to some degree of levelling.
