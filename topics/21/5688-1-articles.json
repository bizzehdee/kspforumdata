These six nodes were instead used in the construction of a glider-dropship, the VA \u003Cem\u003ERobin\u003C/em\u003E, which is designed to carry crates with a medium range. It can fly reasonably stably without payload, though has a funny habit of making explosions when its lands, though on inspection, the flight crew couldn\\\u0027t see where the destroyed sections had come from. In other words, it lands pretty well intact. Uses huge amounts of RCS fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is difficult to land with payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9joUR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229joUR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshmo","CreatedById":10280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-17T22:48:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is just scary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-18T00:09:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHabitation modules for overnight stops are just behind the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, due to the nature of its being STOL and the near-impossible task of aborting a landing, I used the stacked skids landing gear type that Tim favours, to keep the whole thing from blowing up.

Or going in at the wrong angle. Or using too much fuel. Or crashing into a mountainside because of using too little fuel because you don\\\u0027t want to use too much fuel. Or attempting maneuvres that would be possible with all engines running but only the Aerospike engine still has fuel and the whole thing flips out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-18T00:29:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, nice ship!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is flying in an unstable manner when using what it seems to be as the main three engines in the back of the craft, the payload may be bending the center spine of fuel tanks.
