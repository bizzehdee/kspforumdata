Time to get some SSTOs going! I went for elegance and utilitarianism on this one: It is not only beautiful, but it actually does something useful! It carries with it up to 12mT of payload in a bay that is very accessible and spacious. In fact, to show this usefulness while I was testing the hell out of it, I went ahead and designed a bundle of subassemblies (included) to assemble a deep-space vessel/station with modular parts, and we will talk more about those a bit further down. I even documented it quite extensively, check out the imgur album for a somewhat chronological graphical account. Plenty of MMU action in there, since I designed the payloads without any kind of control to save on parts, and just a couple of docking ports to grab it with MMU\u0027s for assembly: I think I get points for \u0022NASA style\u0022!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/T4ue66t\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/T4ue66t.png\u0022 alt=\u0022T4ue66t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow some juicy details, because I\u0027m proud at how well this all worked out: it\u0027s simple, it\u0027s elegant, and it performs brilliantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe traditional wing\u002Btail arrangement gives it very good handling characteristics, and a low wing loading means it is an excellent glider, maintaining the agility of much smaller crafts. Combined with the clearance the raised tail gives you, it\u0027s very easy to take off and land, and flying it is a dream. The new ASAS doesn\u0027t always stick perfectly, but after a few tries I can usually lock \u0026gt;45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA pitch headings with ease at all altitudes, and land her almost on a pin\u0027s head (I usually stop on the runway before the third perpendicular dotted line).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/96P0M9Z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/96P0M9Z.png\u0022 alt=\u002296P0M9Z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel is a bit on the tight side, though, with the maximum payload: make sure you airhog below 30kms as much as you can before letting the RAPIERS transition to rocket power! That happens a bit after 30kms always, and by then you should aim to have \u0026gt;1600m/s speed, with a healthy vertical component (but RAPIERS give it such an awesome T/W on rocket power, you don\u0027t have to worry too much about that last one). Also, the part count is about 150 without payload, so pretty good on that front for potato computers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome more interesting details on the payloads... See the little docking ports along the spine of the brodsword? That\u0027s because the payloads are only supported by a double dock, so you can actually put them out and then back in, and return them to the runway without them wobbling to death or whatever. That means that if you design new ones, you either keep to the distance I use on one of the three different ones, or place anoter yourself (which is a bit tricky which ever way you go about it). You could, of course, add a few struts to forgo all that and be even more rigid, but you would lose the really nice feature: the Broadsword can be \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E reused! The second file here is called \u0022Broadsword support crawler\u0022 for a reason: it can reload and refuel a parked Broadsword. Aweosme right? Well, it\u0027s actually not the most practical thing, but I recommend trying it at least once because it\u0027s really cool. And I bet someone finds a reason to modify the crawler and put it on top of a rocket so you can load modules on Laythe or something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/lwOgvA4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lwOgvA4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lwOgvA4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payloads are also really part-limited, so the resulting space station/deep space vessel is also quite light, while still fulfilling pretty much any role you want from it, form fuel depot to crew transfer station and orbital laboratory, complete with full science suite. You could also use the skeleton of the one with the nuke to place other smaller components, or you know, whatever you want really, it\u0027s a very flexible set of parts... perhaps lacking a good lander in there to fulfil all roles, but hey, I\u0027ve got to leave something to the imagination, don\u0027t I?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that while the payload capacity of the Broadsword is only around 10-15mT, one of those payloads is a humongous orange tank. Obviously, it\u0027s not full, and in fact it is there as a yardstick so you can see what the maximum payload is (and length, with that inside, you have to use the drop at the end of the runway to pull up without scraping the runway with the payload). You are actually have to move some liquid fuel to the front of the ship, since the climb takes so long! But it will still manage 1,600m/s in the end, and make orbit just fine with excess liquid fuel on the red tank and not having touched the oxidizer in there. The rest of the payloads, it takes to orbits with ease without touching their fuel supply.
