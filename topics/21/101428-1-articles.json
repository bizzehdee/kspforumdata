(Tested with KJR, NEAR, and MechJeb, because I\u0027m a terrible pilot.) Armed with three HE-KV missiles in the weapons bay and a hidden Vulcan cannon."},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T05:51:30Z","Content":"Just saying, you could easily fit at least three more missiles in there. Honestly, if it has 3kms of dV, you could probably stick six hidden Vulcans under the wings and still have appreciable range."}]}
