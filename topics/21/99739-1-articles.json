And yeah, this time... another replica of another shuttle! Only this one wasn\u0027t really built in the end. Designed to the original specifications of 20mT in low orbit, but with a really big bay so you don\u0027t have any trouble putting your stuff there, let me present to you the shuttle\u0027s SSTO successor that never was:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/0IWxOgV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0IWxOgV.png\u0022 alt=\u00220IWxOgV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built it from memory and going by the rule of cool, so probably not 100% accurate, but I think it looks the part: drone controlled, lots of aerospikes in a linear manner... Yeah, I know, that big engine maybe shouldn\u0027t be there in the middle. But it decreases part count a lot and makes it easier to use!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it\u0027s main selling point, actually, simplicity of use. This will take you to orbit in eight minutes flat! With no thrust fiddling during ascent required as the spikes shut off sequentially flattening your thrust curve. In fact, you can trust the autopilot to do the gravity turn for you too: as you go over 10kms, switch to \u0022orbital\u0022 in the navball speed indicator, and tell the computer to hold prograde. That\u0027s pretty much it! And if you are not trying to land with a full cargo bay (which it can do anyway, but requires a pretty good pilot), it glides like a feather since it\u0027s so light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/TQDWkCE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TQDWkCE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TQDWkCE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd not only is it easy to use, it is practical too! You get 20mT to LKO with \u0026gt;250 m/s in the tanks and full RCS for docking, so this very usable as you standard medium launcher, for station modules, probes and the like. In fact, I\u0027m pretty sure I can mount an expedition to most places with 20mT! Be sure to let me know what you are using it for if you like it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/103n45q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/103n45q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022103n45q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when you are done lifting your stuff, of course, just deorbit and land it for full recovery and lots of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1savings. Again, let me reiterate: You are supposed to have left the stuff in the cargo bay in orbit. Then landing is as simple as taking off, and boy is the takeoff simple. But of course I wasn\u0027t going to stop attempting it myself to find the limits of the design.
