We can still swap tricks and stuff. Just relevant ones for craft meant to work under stock aero.\n\nHere are my latest: \n\n(latest being a somewhat relative term)\n\n![mLIs3F4.png](http://i.imgur.com/mLIs3F4.png)\n\nVixen SSTO. Complete whale to get to orbit. \n\n![kg6rufl.png](http://i.imgur.com/kg6rufl.png)\n\nDrakken SSTS (Single Stage to Suborbital). Should be able to (barely) make LKO, but doesn\u0027t quite. Safe to say, I\u0027m having issues designing vehicles that don\u0027t use RAPIERs. \n\n![bxNXBw1.png](http://i.imgur.com/bxNXBw1.png)\n\nKG-21 Fishbait, from the old Kerlington Intergalactic scheme. (In hiatus, probably going to make a proper rocket-building company soon.) \n\nSo sit down, pull up a chair, grab some coffee, and let\u0027s hang out, talk about stuff. NuStock stuff."}]}
