In KSP recently, things have been... uneventful, at best. So, I need something new to do . . . That\u0027s why I created RSA: the RavenWing Space Administration. It\u0027s goal is to fulfill the requests of all Kerbals, by sending space probes and manned spacecraft anywhere that is requested by the people of the planet Kerbin.So, if you, the KSP community, would be so kind as to be my Kerbals to request these missions (in other words, give me challenges), I would be more than happy. Thank you all, and soon I hope to post my design for an Observatory that can easily fly to the top of the VAB (with the help of a little gravity hacking), and have a perfect view of the sunsets, sunrises, the Kerbonaut Complex, the SPH, the tracking station, everything! (For best results, download the Distant Objects Enhancement mod, link is below.)Thanks again!
