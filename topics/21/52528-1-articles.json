After completing the science tree in career mode, I decided to challenge myself and build something bigger than I had ever built before. I decided to build the Millennium Falcon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... and shortly thereafter, realized it was too lopsided for me to bother launching. So instead of a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/YT-1300_light_freighter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EYT-1300\u003C/a\u003E, I decided on the much more symmetrical \u003Ca href=\u0022http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/YT-2000_light_freighter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EYT-2000\u003C/a\u003E. If any of you have played Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance, you\u0027ll be familiar with a ship named the \u0022Otana\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img163/5096/l1yh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022l1yh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with its sensor dish exposed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img28/2544/lfqj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lfqj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis project took me around 20 hours total, and featured many unsuccessful launches to get into orbit. Coming in at ~200 tons and ~700 parts, it\u0027s definitely my crowning achievement when it comes to cool-looking builds. It has all science modules as of .22, and a total of 12 landing struts so everything might not explode if I try to land. Here\u0027s a blueprint-style picture showing different angles of the finished product:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img607/2542/lq5g.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lq5g.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you interested in the inner workings of the YT-2000, here\u0027s a look at the skeleton. It has 4 nuclear engines to push it through the solar system, with 75% of an orange tank per engine. It also sports 4 landing thrusters around the center, accommodating my naive hopes at somehow landing a 200 ton ship on a moon (which I have yet to accomplish).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img703/6816/peh3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022peh3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for those curious as to how I got it into an orbit around Kerbin, this is the 14-mainsail launcher, complete with being three-times as slow when launching; it took me around 20 minutes of real-time (6 minutes mission time) to complete the launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see 4 landing struts peeking from above the solid rocket boosters here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img191/4082/be3b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022be3b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 1: Landed on Minimus!
