The A-2 Masamune!\n\n![uc?export=view\u0026id=0ByBa_yWHU4TdWG41RFh3bHl5Qkk](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\u0026id=0ByBa_yWHU4TdWG41RFh3bHl5Qkk)\n\nIt has 3 modes of operation: Air breathing, closed cycle, and nuclear. It is designed to deploy a tiny one kerbal lander in Mun or Minmus orbit and then rendezvous with it later. I\u0027ve flown two successful missions with it so far and it usually has more than enough fuel to return home for a jet powered landing. Basic instructions are as follows:\n\n1. Use air breathing mode to fly up to around 21,000m. You should get close to 1,500m/s.\n\n2. When you start losing power, press 1 to switch to closed cycle mode. There is enough oxidizer to get your apoapsis to 70k.\n\n3. When you run out of oxidizer, hit space to activate your nuclear engine and use it to circularize your orbit.\n\n4. Use your nuclear engine to do a orbital transfer to Mun or Minmus. \n\n5. Around this time, you should run out of liquid fuel in your active fuel tanks. Enable the four disabled Mk1 fuel tanks while at zero thottle.\n\n6. Circularize your orbit around Mun or Minmus.\n\n7. Press 3 to open your cargo bay doors. Then, have a Kerbal go into EVA mode to board the mini lander that is inside the cargo bay.\n\n8. Undock with the ship, switch to the mini lander, and right click on the probe core to \u0022control from here\u0022.\n\n9. Use the mini lander to land and return to orbit.\n\n10. Once you are in a decent orbit and getting close to the ship for orbital rendezvous, right click on the docking port to \u0022control from here\u0022.\n\n11. Lightly tap RCS to dock with the ship. The lander is extremely small and light, so only quick taps are needed.\n\n12. Once docked, unboard the Kerbal from the mini lander and get him back inside the ship.\n\n13. Preform a orbital transfer back to Kerbin. You can easily aero brake to save fuel at this point.\n\n14. Once back in the Kerbin atmosphere, press 2 to disable your nuclear engine and 1 to enable your air breathing engines.\n\n15. Cruise down to the surface for a safe, powered landing!\n\nHere is the [CRAFT FILE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByBa_yWHU4TdTlEyWlF4NDlFcDA/view?usp=sharing)\n\nHere are some [PICTURES](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByBa_yWHU4TdfjdCS091VGtUVjAzbHhWLTBJSmk2VDNSaVBERU1IZ0M1QTdDTkJaVk5hTjg\u0026usp=sharing)\n\nWhat do you guys think?

I definitely intend on improving my designs. The mini lander has a few flaws. It only has around 2,000m/s delta-v, which is enough to land, get back to orbit and dock with the ship, but with very little wiggle room. I always have less than 20 out of 240 units of mono-propellant left when I get back to the ship. Also, the probe core is always draining power on the lander, so you have to be mindful about sunlight and solar panel direction. If you actually do run out of power on the lander while in orbit, you can get off and your EVA suit\u0027s RCS has more than enough power to adjust the angle of the solar panel. But other than that, I think I did pretty good for a no-clip, stock lander that fits in such a tiny space!\n\nOn a side note, I really want to make a two part ISRU mission involving Laythe. Like, Send a giant rover/manned base to mine ore and locate a nice flat spot to land. The problem is, I\u0027ve been having trouble finding a place that both has ore AND is a good place to land. Laythe is hard. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T04:33:21Z","Content":"I\u0027m sure I am a horrible pilot. but I am utterly failing with this craft.

Then slowly push my nose down bit by bit when I start to lose acceleration. You should be at around 300m/s by the time you are at 9-10k in altitude. At that point, you want your nose closer and closer to the horizon and your speed should easily get above 350m/s. If you did everything right, a runaway acceleration takes place and you go from 400m/s to 1,400m/s very quickly. If you have a good angle while doing this, parts won\u0027t explode and you will bust out around 23,000m going 1,500m/s.\n\n@SHiftER2O I think 1.0.2 favors SSTOs, it\u0027s definitely a lot more fun to build them now. I used to play Battletech \u0022the actual pen and paper RPG\u0022, and overheating was a concern. I think the new aerodynamics / overheating stuff really adds spice to the game.

I tried following the plan you replied and still cannot break mach. I took off and pitched up 40 deg. Slowly lowering my nose to keep acceleration up. at around 9-10k up I was at around 340m/s, but every time, even if I level off or attempt a dive I can not get my speed going. I can gain some speed if I dive but lose it all again once I try to level off. I am using stock aero if that makes a difference, not FAR"}]}
