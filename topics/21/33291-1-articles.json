Tested with an 80ton payload and still had enough fuel to make it to the mun and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The main focus of this design isn\u0027t so much about carry weight since a much more streamlined design can probably carry more further, but for carrying bulk. So far no internal cargo bay can fit 3.75m parts and in order to be a fully reusable, the payload in question cannot be structurally integral* \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The payload is stucturally integral due to it\u0027s own massive weight but the plane can fly with the payload absent just fine)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The payload it comes with is a simple refueling canister that can be brought to orbit without using a drop, however, it can be interchanged for all but the largest 3.75m parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/nzrg37.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nzrg37.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECRAFT file: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/VWctYKRe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/VWctYKRe\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This design is made using the following mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFarrem Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETV aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E None of the parts have been \u0027hacked\u0027 but my KSPX and KW packs are pre 0.20 versions so they may not work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPiloting Tips: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Fly using Trim (Alt\u002BWASDQE keys) and avoid SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Steep climb to 15000m hieght then level out.
