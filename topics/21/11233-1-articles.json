Just remember to keep ASAS on, and it\\\u0027ll handle smoothly, if a bit slowly. You can tap f while turning to turn quicker, but that ends up a little more unstable.

I included pylons on the wings where weapons would be mounted and flaps for lower minimum speed (The flaps actually work). I also included an ejection system for people on dangerous missions. It is stable in flight, but I have not tested emptying the fuel tanks. I might upload pictures later."}]}
