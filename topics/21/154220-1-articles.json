I just wanted to share a little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E I made for fun, I call it the Banana Twins. It has two separate landers that can independently land on Mun/Minmus and return to the main craft. So really, this is 3 separate craft in 1. All 3 craft contain a probe core so they can be controlled remotely.\u00A0100% reusable design, nothing is lost except fuel. If you can manage to land it at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, it\u0027s even possible to refuel and do more missions.\u00A0It\u0027s a bit tricky to fly, but it\u0027s perfectly balanced and provides just enough punch to get into orbit. The trick is activating the NERVs at 15,000m (while going close to 1,400m/s) and then switching RAPIER modes at around 20,000m. The Whiplash engines provide nice economy for transport and landings. The landers throw the main craft off balance when they deplete their\u00A0mono-propellant, so there is extra mono-propellant to top off the landers when they return to the craft. It\u0027s capable of unpowered landings as well. 100% stock, v1.2.2.
