You lose about 400m/s of delta V on final booster separation due to the balancing issues. I am still working on figuring it out, but it isn\u0027t that big of a deal. By using all the fuel (including the payload), it can make it to Low Mun Orbit. It costs a total of 550,000 dollars to launch and all the boosters are recoverable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/EJkUZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
