The Atlantis is a derivation of a prior Space Shuttle\u0027s that I worked on. It is designed to carry a crew of 3 to low Kerbin orbit and is not payload capable. It was designed with ease of use in mind and was developed to replace my prior payload capable shuttle, the Endeavour. Project Endeavour is a much more capable shuttle in many regards, it lifted a 3 man orbiter that was nearly twice as heavy as the Atlantis as well as a 7.5 metric tonne payload using the same amount of fuel. Project Endeavour however was canceled; it suffered from chronic fuel dispersion issues, was nearly impossible to control, and had a 34 step pre-launch protocol. But in its place Atlantis does its job, and does it well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Atlantis has the standard components of a space shuttle: two SRB\u0027s, three SSME\u0027s, two OME\u0027s, a orbiter, and a expendable external fuel tank. The launch vehicle weighs 147 metric tonnes and the orbiter weighs 27 metric tonnes before burning off fuel. Bi-propellant and mono-propellant are stored inside the fuselage of the orbiter and is not designed to be refueled in orbit to extend its operational range. Contrary to conventional shuttle design I opted to use non-gimballing main engines (SSME\u0027s) due their higher power to weight ratio. This design decision was a necessity in order to stay true to a realistic Space Shuttle, both from an aesthetics perspective and an engineering perspective. Atlantis has a power to weight ratio of less than 1.5 for a short period after booster separation; without non-gimballing main engines the gravity losses would have been considerably worse. Upon re-entry Atlantis is stable and acts like a glider; it can glide for over 40km from an altitude of 8km and stalls out at about 30m/s. But that is enough talk about design, let\u0027s talk about how to fly this thing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAction keys\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Shuts down main engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunch\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Stage SSME\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Ignite SRB\u0027s and release launch clamps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Tilt back 5 degrees (maintain this until 8km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Stage when the first SRB\u0027s burn out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Jettison SRB\u0027s on burnout\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Follow typical ascent profile\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*2/3 throttle after 20km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Shutdown engines when the external fuel tank runs out \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Jettison ET, toggle AG1 (Apogee should be 80-85km at this point)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Circularize orbit (100km x 100km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELanding\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Refer to video for retro burn initiation location\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Burn at 1/3 throttle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Turn off engines when your trajectory hits just east of the island\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Land using a gliding approach (-20 degree glide path)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Survive landing \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EIMPORTANT NOTICE\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/eHIaYFE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eHIaYFE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eHIaYFE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBehold the limit of my artistic skill in Microsoft paint.
