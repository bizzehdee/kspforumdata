No other argument is made based on any other constraints other than \u0027relative diameter\u0027. What \u0027we are used to doing\u0027 has no bearing on the single constraint of \u0027keep it close to the relative diameter\u0027.

Directly comparing to RW craft, It will look oversized if you go Sr/Standard, and with Standard/Jr it will look impossible for kerbals to transit. Your choice as to which of those matters most to you when building replicas. That\u0027s why I said that this is one of those things that you really need to not overthink too much. Pick what matters most to you, add an explanation of your choice in the craft description if need be for your own peace of mind, then stick to it for consistency between craft in the same save. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-19T23:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI almost exclusively build capital ships in chibi scale, so im fairly likely to use the smallest ports availeable for them when adding hangar space (if a starfighter hull is below 1.2m its very hard to make the larger ports look good on it).\u00A0 Capital ships tend to use the mid range port options for docking to themselves and or stations/refulelers (they are more numerous for asthetic choice), and stations or vertically stacked ground base modules use the largest one for its improved stability (and the fact that 90% of my ground/station designs are physically large enough to accomodate that size port without looking stupid).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe largest port is also very big and has a huge hitbox, so i dont go near it on anything that expects to get shot at (especially with stock non-BDA weaponry which evicerate those large ports very quickly).\u00A0 That and i tend to use ALOT of klaws on both ships (its helpful to be able to dock to a section of a ship and use its fuel after its been lost in combat), and even starfighters that are physically large enough to add one without making it look like a joke, which is not all that many of them as of this point in time (trifighters use them, and most bombers/heavy fighters but every other one uses the small ports or the extendable MH one which docks to the small ports).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd ofc as for non military replicas (i do actually make a few of those), i just pick whatever port looks the part and fits closest to the rest of the ship scale wise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-19T23:05:50Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2019 11:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
