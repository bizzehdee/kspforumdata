As you can tell this isn\u0027t a biplane, it kinda took a creative turn for the better in my mind. It is probably a late 20\u0027s or 30\u0027s fighter, right around that time period. She is a joy to fly, accually quite smooth. To be honest is wasn\u0027t expecting much when I made her. I was to much in on the looks. However I got lucky and got a very lovely plane, if I do say so myself. I guess I will let the pictures take over for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/suyut\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

However if you do not take off by then you are in luck. Just leave the seat, right click on the wheel and repair. Your kerbal can then get back in the seat, even while in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding is a tricky though. You have to be going fairly slow, less than 60 m/s. Then once you land your SAS and brakes HAS to be on(the plane will flip). If no brakes then no SAS is required. Also dont try turning during landing. Also the Infiniglide glitch is some what present, there is no way I can get around that with out sacrificing agility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright that is pretty much it, no action groups in this one.
