One that actually flies! I was lucky enough to have an interview with the test pilot for Kodemunkey Aerospace, Jeb \u0022Crasher\u0022 Jebberson.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETK: So tell us, what is so unique about this particular aircraft?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJJ: Yeah, well the thing you have to remember about most aircraft is that they crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETK: *Nods* Anyone who has signed the waivers required to visit the facility can tell you that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJJ: Uh, yeah (he pauses for a moment to examine his hands) The thing about this plane is...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETK: That it flies?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJJ: Yeah man, it\u0027s the craziest thing! It\u0027s really unstable though, even with the autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETK: So, i assume this aircraft has a lot of safety features?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJJ: Yeah, check it out, the engines and landing gear detach!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETK: They...what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJJ: Yeah, like the rockets *Twitches* It also has a parachute, it\u0027s like crazy man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETK: (muttering) not as crazy as you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do list: Add flaps for the delta wings, learn how to fly.
