View full album](//imgur.com/a/2ABli)\n\nHere is my first Sci-Fi Build, The Doctor\u0027s most dangerous and oldest enemies from the TV Series Doctor Who. This one features the Daleks from the New Series, introduced is the Series 1 story Dalek. I have tried to replicate the function and detail/Size of the Daleks as much as possible, even simulating the Levitation capability with rockets, though some details were omitted due to bugs and performance. Please do not time warp or physics warp, the notorious time warp to overheat bug has struck again, though is mitigated if you stay on 1X warp. Ah and yes, I did listen to hours of I Am the Doctor making this. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\n[Download (KerbalX)](http://kerbalx.com/SaturnianBlue/2005-Dalek)\n\nStats:236 Parts, 100 KG of Fuel, 730Kg. ~300m/s DV\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9Action Groups: (Infernal Robotics) 1,2, Head Swivel, 3,4 Laser Gun Up and Down, 5,6 Plunger Manipulator, 7,8 Plunger front up down, -,= Eyestalk up and Down, (Stock) 9, Toggle Lights.\n\nTo Do: BD Armory Variant and Classic Era Daleks\n\nDalek 2005 Less Parts\n\nHere\u0027s my 2nd Dalek version, which is a low part count version, with 91 less parts than the 236 part count original, at 145.
