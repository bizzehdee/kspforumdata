They are really sound designs already. Not much I had to do to to them to make them run, just cleaned up all the external bits hanging off the side. I used Nothke\u0027s 6S tubes to make an interior storage, and between that, the procedural fairings base, and a little bit of clipping, each rocket has smooth sides and full functionality. Each insertion stage has batteries, antennae, rcs and a mechjeb module so they can run independent of payload once in orbit. I\u0027ve tested all the refits, and so far all but one can get the advertised payload into a stable 75k orbit with enough Dv left light maneuvering and a deorbit burn. THe only one I\u0027m having problems with is the 5t model, but I think I\u0027m running the gravity turn to late, I ended up about 100 Dv short on my test flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try and get some pictures up in the next day or two so you can see them, but they are going to by my go to launch systems now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sylandro","CreatedById":80729,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T23:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERune, would you mind making a Procedural Fairings version of your lifters?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T17:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis this place still alive?

It\u0027s next on my to do list, link everything I have been releasing since 0.24, and I might throw in a new SSTO that was sidelined for a while. I also have to decide what to do with my old shuttle replica, the new one blows it out of the water, but that one is so tiny and cute, and I really like how the \u0022segmented SRB\u0022 idea worked out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sylandro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sylandro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERune, would you mind making a Procedural Fairings version of your lifters?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, forgot to answer \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E. Since I don\u0027t use that mod myself and would have to learn it before using it, it might be faster if you ask Ghostshark27 for his files and take out remotetech... or even faster to take away the stock fairings (just pick any of the side decouplers and both will come off), separate either the payload or the first tank from the rest, and stick the Procedural Fairings thingie in there, from what I understand of the mod. You will end up with excess lift capacity, unless those fairings are very heavy, so don\u0027t worry about bringing more decouplers than you need, just stage them right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
