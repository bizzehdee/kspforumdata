Even though I recover the vessels where they land, I think it is fun to send missions to get the crew back to the space centre grounds before recovering them, if they land nearby within reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QlTV0u1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QlTV0u1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Aegea is inspired by the Flying dolphin passenger hyrdofoils that go between Athens and the Greek islands nearby. It comes with a carriage to get it from the runway to the water. At around 15 m/s it will rise out of the water on its own and is quite stable without SAS, but at higher speeds the ride gets less bumpy with SAS engaged. The top speed is somewhere just above 90 m/s. Warning: At speeds higher than 90 m/s there is a non-zero probability of the Aegea becoming an actual airplane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet the craftfile \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/tpxgo59wagbk8sc/Aegea.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JjzVwKK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JjzVwKK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-13T18:42:11Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2015 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zwolff\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"doxlulzem","CreatedById":153306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T20:58:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks really neat.

At speeds between 0 and around 10 m/s, it floats as a boat. From then on raises as the speed increase to around 15 m/s, where it is fully above water, and stays that way until you reach about 95 m/s where I accidentally got it airborne once.
