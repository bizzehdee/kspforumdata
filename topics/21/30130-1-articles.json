Also, piloting can make a major difference in how much fuel you use. The first Mun rocket I built landed without enough fuel to return, but upon my learning to fly at least \u003Cem\u003Eslightly\u003C/em\u003E better, I later was able to return to Kerbin with some of the transfer stage and all of the lander stage\u0027s fuel left. What kind of flight plan do you usually undertake for a Mun trip?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would personally also add a decoupler between the pod and the fuel tank, just because I\u0027m silly and cannot imagine the entire return stage surviving reentry IRL (but hey, this \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ojimak (my advice probably isn\u0027t the best, but its better than none)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PIRATEONTHERUN","CreatedById":32233,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T03:45:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last stage is serious overkill, and I\u0027m surprised you were able to slow down fast enough with an LV-909 hauling all that fuel.

Now I have mods installed and I won\u0027t show you my launcher because you won\u0027t recognize the parts.

They\u0027re weak, but they\u0027ll get you there and back again with enough fuel for a third trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, move the engine on your lander to those radial fuel tanks and replace it with a Clamp-o-Tron Sr. (add one to the transfer stage as well). This way, you can put the transfer stage into orbit, undock the lander, drop it down to Minmus, then bring it back up and refuel before heading back to Kerbin. You\u0027ll have way more thrust on the lander than you\u0027ll really need, but oh well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, shift fuel capacity from the lander itself to the transfer stage. Now you can ride the transfer stage back to Kerbin using its much more efficient atomic engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth, if you have not yet done so, consult a guide on orbital rendezvous. Should be simple enough in Minmus orbit, but it never hurts to be prepared.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T05:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA simple change for extra \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV would be throwing fuel at the lower stages. It looks like there\u0027s a lot more thrust down there than strictly needed, and this would make use of it. Stupid_chris\u0027s craft also points to some potentially useful modifications: Consolidating from 6 radial RCS tanks to 1 half-height KSPX size 2 tank would get you significantly more RCS for marginally more mass, and ejecting the command pod on reentry eliminates most of the parachute requirements/reduces the overall mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T11:34:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA straight swap of the LV-909 on the transfer stage with a Nerva, as people say would probably turn this ship into a Duna/Laythe capable ship.
