It has enough fuel to reach orbits as high as 300x300 km, but if going above 200km I would suggest that it will probably need a fuel top up for the de-orbit burn. It certainly does from a 300km orbit, but I haven\u0027t tested the limit of how high it can go and return without topping up.\n\nAction keys:\n\n1 : Toggle engine mode and toggle air intakes\n\n2 : Extend airbrakes \n\nPilot notes:\n\nTake off speed is between 70 - 80 m/s\n\nInitial climb out is 30 degrees nose up, but when you get to the point where speed starts to decrease, keep the nose on the top of the prograde marker.\n\nAt 10,000m nose up attitude should be 10 degrees, and just fly to build up speed\n\nYou should be able to reach 1300 - 1400 m/s by the time you get to 19,000m by which time the acceleration will start to tail off. When you sense that it is, press action key 1 to change engine mode and close the air intakes. Keep the nose at 10 degrees and shut off the engines once you achieve your apoapsis.\n\nCoast to apoapsis and burn to circularise.\n\nDon\u0027t forget to use the airbrakes, action key 2, on re-entry to help slow down, or you will burn up in the atmosphere.\n\nChariot SSTO is fitted with a Junior Docking Port. If your station isn\u0027t equipped with one of these, you will need to change it in the SPH before flight.\n\nOn the runway ready to go\n\n![char1.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/char1.jpg)\n\nTake off at 70-80 m/s\n\n![char2.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/char2.jpg)\n\nInitial climb out at 30 degrees until the speed starts to bleed off\n\n![char3.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/char3.jpg)\n\nReduce to 10 degrees at 10,000\n\n![char4.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/char4.jpg)\n\nOrbit at 301,000m\n\n![char5.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/char5.jpg)\n\nDocked with a station at 275,000m for a fuel top up\n\n![char6.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/char6.jpg)\n\nDon\u0027t forget to use the airbrakes on re-entry\n\n![char7.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/char7.jpg)\n\nBack safe and sound\n\n![char8.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/char8.jpg)\n\n[Chariot SSTO craft file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3u1vaj89eyb27by/Chariot%20SSTO.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T12:57:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 12:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow88**"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T16:20:28Z","Content":"So simple yet capable!

Looking at my station now, I realise I should have put the comms tower on the habitation end, and made sure that the fuelling rig had sepratrons fitted for jettison in case of emergency. If the fuelling tanks get ruptured, just have to keep my fingers crossed the crew can make it to the lifeboats in time."}]}
