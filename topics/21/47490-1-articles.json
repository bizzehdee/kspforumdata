You could include ships from Star wars, Startrek, or any other movies, just be sure to specify. I don\u0027t care if they\u0027re fuctional (can use infinite fuel cheat if you want). Also, you don\u0027t need the craft files unless you want (some people may want them), it\u0027s up to you. Use all the mods you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this is a successful showcase \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you say, let\u0027s get this started!
