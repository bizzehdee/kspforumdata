I know I could have just picked his up, but I wanted to make one of my own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not a \u0027Space Shuttle\u0027 and I made no attempt to make it behave like one. For that, please see my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/134672-My-Space-Shuttle-%28-Launcher%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Espace shuttle.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn earlier version of this shuttle made it to Duna, Ike, and back again bringing home over 15k science (and about 2 mil in contract funds). It would have been loads more science, but somehow I forgot my barometer and temperature probe, so at least 20 science payloads = gone \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E. This version has that problem fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost is a not-insignificant 295,434. However, you\u0027ll get at least 100k of that back when you land at KSC, so just about any \u0027explore Duna\u0027 or similar mission should cover your costs and then some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.mmudforums.com/images/ksp/screenshot58.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot58.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.mmudforums.com/images/ksp/Dunar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file here!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction group 1 is to enable or disable the Hummlebee style \u0027VTOL\u0027 vernier engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction group 2 grabs all easily-reusable science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction group 3 grabs science from the goo and materials bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction group 0 extends/retracts solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the behemoth to orbit (I ain\u0027t gonna lie, this is hard):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZ, T, space. Fly straight up for about 3000m, then begin to slowly pitch over. Around 12-14k meters (about 15 seconds left in outer booster stage), you will need to take what fuel has left the top of the center tank and refill it from the bottom of the center tank; this balancing is important or you\u0027ll tip out of control just before first stage cutoff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 15k meters you should be at a 45 degree angle; at 20k, you\u0027ll be nearly ready to discard the outer boosters. I suggest shutting off all engines for a moment to do this; the seperatrons don\u0027t seem to do a great job here for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, turn on RCS and throttle back up. I have yet to not lose control for a bit here; if you do, just turn off the engines and get back on course with RCS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll find that at first, the off-center thrust of the shuttle is causing you to veer a bit off course; then, the thrust of the mainsail will shove you the other way. Once you\u0027re almost about to lose control from this (watch your pitch meter), hit space to stage on the other shuttle engines and it\u0027ll even out for a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain as you near booster cutoff you\u0027ll have to take manual control of the mainsail thrust limiter to keep from veering, but it\u0027ll only be a few seconds of manually throttling it back before you cut it free. Throttle down to about 70 percent for a couple seconds, then about 40 percent and then it\u0027ll flame out and you cut it away with spacebar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be at about 100k at this point and ready to burn prograde to circularize. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can prove it\u0027s possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.mmudforums.com/images/ksp/screenshot56.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot56.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrills deployed, maybe this empty space has ore!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.mmudforums.com/images/ksp/screenshot57.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot57.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, I have enough delta-v to make it directly to Duna or Eve without needing to refuel on the way. You could head out to Minmus and fuel up there if you wanted to bring some extra fuel with you to brake (I did a very, very careful aerocapture at Duna). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo amount of fiddling with the launch window planner gets you to Jool with this craft, unfortunately. If you really want to bring it there, you\u0027ll need more fuel, or nukes, or some sort of booster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
