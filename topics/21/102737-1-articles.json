This fixes an issue in the old model where the seat would fail to eject under high g loads.**\n\n![lyKSaxk.png](http://i.imgur.com/lyKSaxk.png)\n\n**The air-frame has also been completely reworked to be prettier as well as lower part count.**\n\n![fUz15cK.png](http://i.imgur.com/fUz15cK.png)\n\nThe new variant comes with two recoverable external fuel pods under the wings. They offer the plane longer ranges than before. They can be jettisoned before a hypothetical dogfight; sustaining its high maneuverability.\n\nThe H3 model also comes with 4 stock Ibeam missiles to satisfy those warmongers here on the forums. It is unlikely they can actually do any major damage to anything but anything is better with x-plosions\u0027\n\n*Enjoy!* \n\n**Action-group keys and functions**\n\n1: Toggles engines\n\n2: Fires missiles\n\n3: Fires missiles\n\n4: External Fuel Tanks jettison\n\n5: Anti-spin parachute deployment\n\n6: Anti-spin parachute cut\n\n**Ejection system action-group keys**\n\n8: Jettison canopy\n\n9: Eject pilot\n\n0: Deploy ejection seat parachute\n\nOld version: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105848-K-22-Rapier-6th-Generation-Kerbal-Air-superiority-fighter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105848-K-22-Rapier-6th-Generation-Kerbal-Air-superiority-fighter)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T19:37:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jon144**"},{"CreatedByName":"eorin","CreatedById":79133,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T20:46:48Z","Content":"beautifull take your deserved rep =)"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T02:54:37Z","Content":"Ah, I remember the render now."},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T02:56:37Z","Content":"I really do need to update this.
