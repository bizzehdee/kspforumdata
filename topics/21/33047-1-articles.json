And so the Astromotive division of Yeahletstrythatdyne presents, small, medium, and large models of rovers designed for use on Mun and Minmus, complete with launch vehicles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for small, this is the V-24 Formica, robotic exploration rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fszQdi9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fszQdi9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yKm5k0I.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yKm5k0I.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RbVlmA1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RbVlmA1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft: OBSOLETE \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter landing, press 1 to disable the motors on the two outboard wheels, as the V-24 only has and needs power for the two middle wheels. Steering is easier and more effective with your roll left/right keys (especially on Minmus), as the command part sits on its back, though the function of those keys will be reversed. (That is to say, roll-left turns the rover right, and vice versa.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext in size is the V-23 Jitney Personnel Conveyor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1lUoSQw.png\u0022 alt=\u00221lUoSQw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LxmY0pu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LxmY0pu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wIoby96.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wIoby96.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft: OBSOLETE \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Jitney carries two Kerbals on external seats, has a headlight for night activities, and handles quite well on both Mun and Minmus. The Jitney is not robotic (it is inert without a pilot at the controls). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on the large side, this is the robotic V-22 Autoexplorer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iGiAObx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iGiAObx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N6c7DOw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N6c7DOw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft: OBSOLETE \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe V-22 uses the TR-2L wheels for higher speeds and more responsive steering, though of course exercise caution when braking, as these wheels currently grip so hard they can easily flip the vehicle. Using reverse rather than brake will slow the vehicle less dangerously. Although the V-22 can operate on Minmus, even greater caution should be exercised there to avoid rollover accidents. As you can see, the V-22 is rather large for a simple exploration rover robot. That\u0027s because it\u0027s intended to be a chassis which can be put to other uses as well, such as a this rover \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P1mPoei.png\u0022 alt=\u0022P1mPoei.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand this bus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AZoZigY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AZoZigY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese three rovers are intended to be bare-bones designs to which you can add details and payload items such as scientific instruments, and they should be able to handle a little extra mass, though be very careful to make sure the rover itself ends up with a symmetrical mass distribution after your customizing has been completed, or steering the rovers to the moons will be more difficult. All three models use the skycrane delivery method in which a small lander deposits the rover from a suspended mount, as you can see in this image of a V-22 arriving on Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CN0KyVM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CN0KyVM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T20:58:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sammoe","CreatedById":61421,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T02:30:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!
