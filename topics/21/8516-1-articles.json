It uses some slightly odd staging which I\\\u0027ve not seen elsewhere on the forum. (Admittedly, I\\\u0027ve not looked very hard...). Whilst fairly short, it\\\u0027s enough to get the lander to the Mun and back with 1.5 tanks of fuel to spare in the orbital transfer stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1: All 5 engine fire, with the central fuel tanks being refilled, and 2 of the 4 external tanks being refilled. We\\\u0027re basically fuelling 5 engines from 2 of the external stacks. At the end of this stage, we eject the empty stacks and their engines. This stage gets us to 300m/s at an altitude around 13Km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 2: Remaining 3 engines fire, again with the central stack refilled by the remaining external tanks. The 2 external stacks are ejected when empty. This stage gets us all the way to orbital velocity, and most of the way to a circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 3: The single engine on the central stack is our main engine. Initially it\\\u0027s needed for the last 10% of thrust to circularise the orbit around Kerbin, leaving plenty of fuel for a transfer to the Mun. I usually use it when landing on the Mun to slow down descent until around 3Km from the surface (usually with 1 to 1.5 tanks still full), then jetison it to crash into the Munar surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 4: From a small height, the single fuel tank and small engine on the landing stage has enough to land safely, relaunch, make Munar orbit, and transfer back to Kerbin - with fuel left over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe staging is a bit \\\u0027non-standard\\\u0027 (and takes some manual setting up) but it seems to work quite well!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caesar15","CreatedById":11257,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-23T01:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat seems pretty small for a mun lander, but if it works dont change it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-23T04:50:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ wuggy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe staging scheme you are using is not odd at all.
