Another way to think about it is 2.017 units of fuel per 1 that is put up. This means it only costs around 2 tanks to send 1 up into orbit. Best part about this lifter is it is put on top, even with placing a brick of fuel tanks on top it still flies (somewhat) like a champion. This is extremely efficient believe it or not, even use the NovaPunch pack I was only able to get it down to 2.1:1 fuel ratio (lower is better), but I have new plans now that I\\\u0027ve built this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give some quick stats of it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Lifts 70 Kerbal tons into low orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Efficiency of 403.5 per Kerbal Ton or 2.017:1 fuel ratio\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Leave no debris in orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-5 stage rocket using 56.5 fuel tanks and 25 engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Near impossible to fly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Comes with insane launch platform to hold it up free of charge!

Performing the same math on a single engine and a single tank yields a 65 second burn time, and physical observations confirm that it does indeed run out after exactly 65 seconds. Something about the long chain of fuel lines must be reducing the consumption rate, without hurting my thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould love to see your craft file, are you using part explosions to separate stages? There\\\u0027s a post about a bug where if you over-heat a piece with a LFE (Liquid Fuel Engine) that they seem to burn at around 1/6th the normal rate, a guy was able to get a rocket up to 200km rather than a mere 40km before engine cut off without this glitch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso a note about the efficiency of the launch angle. I still am trying to figure this out completely but mechjeb actually uses a poor angle of assent for crafts with lots of drag, while testing this due to several dozens of flights I started putting mechjeb on to launch it (just have to disable him in the upper part once the rocket starts to spin as it would lose control). But I couldn\\\u0027t get to orbit with its angle of assent. I looked it up and there\\\u0027s a whole set of formula\\\u0027s on it but the optimal way of doing a gravity turn is based on a load of factors. I bet there could be some improvement on mine for sure, but jeb\\\u0027s angle adds too much drag from the atmosphere with these kind of larger designs. I should play with jeb some more though, you can edit a lot about the launch angle inside it, but its quite time consuming hehe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Analogy","CreatedById":28969,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-28T23:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, I didn\\\u0027t realize that a jet engine produced just as much thrust as a rocket engine in this game.

Also I\\\u0027m very curious to see how you would design a rocket for this, I\\\u0027ve gotten into quite a pattern of using 6-symmetry be interesting to see another design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
