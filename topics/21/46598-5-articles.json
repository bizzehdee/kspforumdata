Now, the first thing that comes to mind is KAS. Now, KAS has gotten big and become a bit of a memory burden, so I wanted to try it without KAS (as I don\u0027t have it).

I was getting magnetic docks even before I could lower the gear, on KERBIN! Therefore it\u0027s guaranteed to work on any planet except Tylo (who would build a base there anyways?). The pic just shows a cool move of docking the base crawler to the truss and then docking the truss gantry to that. It worked surprisingly well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am working to develop an unmanned version for prolonged operations and precursor work. Additionally, I am adding a docking port to the front (already one on the rear) and spacing it so that when two gantrys dock as one, their payloads will inadvertently dock so long as they both carry 5 segment long trusses. I built around the long X-truss since ~3 lengths wide and 5 lengths long is the standard large size for the trusses and if you can dock to that one, you can dock to pretty much all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AppleDavidJeans","CreatedById":84275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T18:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you do a better design for the crawler transporters?
