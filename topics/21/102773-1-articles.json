View full album](//imgur.com/a/NjnmA)\n\nKerbyuz (Progress - Unmanned)\n\nThe unmanned supply ship, used to resupply the ISS when Space Shuttles became obsolete and before the ATV came along.\n\nLooks the same, except for the fairing and modules.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/pGgiJ)\n\nControls, Action Groups and Instructions\n\nLaunch Profile: Ignite First Stage. Soyuz should lift off the pad.\n\nPitch 45 degrees at 10,000 to 15,000m (Gravity Turn).\n\nOnce boosters are out, separate with Action Group \u00222\u0022.\n\nStart core stage after boosters spin away.\n\nSeparate core stage. Fairings will separate with it.\n\nFire Third stage. \n\nWith correct flight profile, you should be in orbit by now,\n\nSeparate the Third Stage.\n\nStart up TMA engines. Deploy Solar Panels (Action Group 1) and RCS.\n\nSet up a rendezvous, go for an EVA.. Your mission!\n\n(Be careful, those radial intakes are going to hurl your poor Kerbal into deep space!)\n\nOnce you seek to start deorbiting, fire retrograde with the TMA engines.\n\nOnce sub-orbital, undock service and orbital modules with action group 2. Be sure no one\u0027s in the orbital module!\n\nAnd you\u0027re off to the atmosphere!\n\nOnce at desirable altitude, deploy chutes with Action Group 3.\n\nAt a handful of meters from the ground, engage retrorockets. Your descent should be adequate with this profile.\n\nAction Groups: Abort - Tears fairings off and separates crew module away from the ship. (Only on TMA!)\n\nCustom01 - Deploys Solar Panels (And antennae on Progress.)\n\nCustom02 - Separates the modules. Be sure to switch to the reentry module on the TMA version!\n\nCustom03 - Deploys parachutes. This is vital, as staging prevents them from deploying on their own, somehow.\n\nUpdate releases\n\nVersion 1.0 - Current, first version\n\nVersion 1.5 - Added more launch clamps, and core stage now fires at launch instead of after booster separation.\n\nVersion 2.0 - a BIG update! Decouplers replaced with docking ports (actiongroup 2), and radial intakes added to capsules, making it look much better. Be careful about going on EVA, though - it could shoot your Kerbal out of the hatch in a split-second!\n\n[Craft File - Soyuz TMA](http://kerbalx.com/Columbia/Kerbyuz%20%28TMA%29)\n\n[Craft File - Progress\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9](http://kerbalx.com/Columbia/Kerbyuz%20%28Progress%29)\n\nFeel free to give any suggestions and feedback! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T14:21:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Columbia**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T12:43:59Z","Content":"Wow!
