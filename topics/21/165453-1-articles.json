Packing six AIM-20 missiles and two Vulcan cannons it is decently offensive. (The tastefulness or otherwise of the nose art is up to the buyer.) Wingtip missile rails may be added. When given a 3 to 2 numerical advantage it has managed to take down a pair of ADF-01 Falken Crewed, once all three on Team A managed to survive! Usually one or two C.A.F. get shot down, but last plane in the air wins, right? Two V Two doesn\u0027t usually turn out so well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe low dry weight makes it quickly gain agility as ordnance is fired, so shoot early and often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Galane/Cheap-As-F\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Galane/Cheap-As-F\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/Y5cPqC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4394/36803550760_5c49f2aec5_z.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u002236803550760_5c49f2aec5_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/Y5cPqC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Escreenshot9\u003C/a\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/photos/27748767@N08/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eg_alan_e\u003C/a\u003E, on Flickr\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Schwarz","CreatedById":181098,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-13T10:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that is really a Cheap As F package, great for small countries with hostile neighbors.\u003Cbr\u003E\nToo bad when BDA AI learns about energy fighting and how to use big lasers, the Falkens will once more obliterate everything in their path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-13T22:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould be even lower weight and cost if BDA had an inline RADAR with the capabilities of the pointy nosecone one.
