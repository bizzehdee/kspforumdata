Compared to my prior experience on Eve, atmospheric entry heating ending up being the huge challenge this time around. The goal of the mission was to send a 3 man pod to Eve sea level and return it back to Kerbin in a single launch with no docking or refueling. It was a fun couple months working on the project.
