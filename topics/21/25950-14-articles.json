I\u0027ve been having the same problem, though I\u0027m getting closer with better launches. This ship is intended to make its entire transfer burn with the transfer stage. During the transfer, you\u0027re supposed decouple the command module, flip it around and dock to the lander, then release the now useless transfer stage. If the transfer stage comes up short, you have a few options. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You can adjust the staging mid-flight to drop the transfer stage and attempt to complete the transfer burn with the lander. But this will cause a problem when it comes time to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You can burn out the transfer stage, flip the command module around and extract the lander, then flip back around and complete the burn. It can be done, but it is a bit rough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Flip the command module around while in orbit around Kerbin, and then use it to complete the burn when the transfer stage runs out. This has been the most successful option for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my last attempt, I was about 100 dV shy of a complete transfer with my transfer stage. Having attempted option 2 before, I went ahead and flipped the command module while in orbit. Once docked, I made sure that the command module\u0027s engine was deactivated (don\u0027t want it fighting the transfer stage) and use the \u0022control from here\u0022 option on the docking port on the lander to make sure my nav-ball was oriented the right way. Then I ran the transfer stage until it ran out, extracted the lander, re-enabled my engine, did the \u0022control from here\u0022 thing on the command module and completed my burn. And there was one unanticipated bonus to flipping the command module while orbiting Kerbin. By shedding the fairings, I got back almost all of the 100 dV I needed for the transfer. I only needed to burn the command module for a couple of seconds to finish the maneuver. It would be a cheese move, but you could probably re-stage to fire the fairings before launch and save a bunch of dV on the way up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo keep at it, man.
