To get it off the ground make sure SAS is on and throttle to full before you press space and start the launch sequence, its quite heavy, but in general if its working right should take off semi-straight for the first 1km. If you keep having problems apply some struts to the boosters, these break on stage separation and will help keep them on, and the SAS should be enough to stop spinning.
