It has a Kerbal capacity of 18 thanks to use of 3 stowaway modules, 4 cupolas and a lander can - the Cupolas serve as observation decks mostly and the Lander Can suspended from the ceiling is an exclusive zone for when your Kerbals want some privacy (not necessarily together). It has multiple action groups for lighting effects, comms and gear. 6 docking modules spaced out on the outer ring of the structure allow for docking rovers and expansion modules according to your personal preferences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/795/7beg.png\u0022 alt=\u00227beg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/2821/xeze.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xeze.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img818.imageshack.us/img818/3650/6hl0.png\u0022 alt=\u00226hl0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Exploratio Dish - The Exploratio Dish (it\u0027s not a typo, lack of \u0027\u0027N\u0027\u0027 serves a purpose ^^) is a deep space exploration satellite, exploiting lack of atmosphere on the Mun for a much clearer view of the nearby stars and galaxies. It has a very high centre of mass due to the design of it\u0027s dish so it is vital to land it perfectly vertical, killing any relative velocity and selecting a level landing zone. Once landed, deploy a ladder for easy access and explore space at your own pace ^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/3179/4819.png\u0022 alt=\u00224819.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2091/2o7d.png\u0022 alt=\u00222o7d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The UT Hangar - Last but not least, the UT Hangar. It\u0027s a medium sized structure comprised of 2 garages. Each garage has a potential capacity to store 2 UT5/UT6 rovers or one UT5 bulldozer. However, it is best to carry only 2 rovers to your destination using this particular structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has on/off ramps, Gigantor solar arrays, tons of battery power and a control tower with satelite tv. Sit back and drive the rovers remotely, not risking a gruesome death by barrel rolling face-first into the ground \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did all I could to keep the rovers as stable as possible. CoM is very low on them, which does help to combat the effects of low-gravity but still requires very careful operation. Each rover is equipped with 5 seats and full tactical gear, allowing you to \u0027\u0027science\u0027\u0027 on the go (or upside down). Useful, versatile and with a long range - thanks to generators, it is never without power, even at night. Besides, it\u0027s sleek and sexy so why don\u0027t you jump in and take it for a spin? I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll love the challenge...
