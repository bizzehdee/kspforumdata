I figured I could do much better nowadays, and perhaps a rebuild was in order. Well, IMO, it turned out all right:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Wq93DcQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wq93DcQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Wq93DcQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an over-complicated way of landing the single base module on the ground, you really can\u0027t go much better than this. It\u0027s fully VTOL, of course, and the included launcher allows it to do Munar surface mission without refuelling. A word of advice, though: my first one is still on route to its first Munar landing. But I figure if it can sustain a burn with the VTOL engines, it\u0027s balanced enough for landing. Whether Delta-v is going to be enough will depend on how much I use the nukes, I think, but it should be more than enough if I can refuel on Munar orbit (which in my save I can), of course, either before or after the landing. I will update the pics as more capabilities are tested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImgur album\u003C/strong\u003E (note the pictures of the very old 0.18 version, and how much better I am at building stuff \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/N8Vss\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The center of mass is right under that upwards-facing docking port, and the fuel tanks (including monopropellant) arranged around it so fuel emptying doesn\u0027t move it. I think I hit a natural balance with the nukes and the passenger cabin, which was the reason I went ahead with the build. I did have to rebuild it because I hurried too much the first time and the side tanks were sloppily placed, but I\u0027m getting good with VTOLing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
