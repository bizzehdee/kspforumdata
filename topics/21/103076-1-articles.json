The base idea (the wing and tail shape) came from Star Citizen\u0027s 300i fighter: \n\n![gallery_81_10_441364.png](http://star-citizens.de/uploads/gallery/album_10/gallery_81_10_441364.png)\n\nAside from this inspiration, I just randomly put parts together to build a ship I like. Being useful wasn\u0027t my main goal, but eventually it turned out to be a pretty good SSTO, so this is why I\u0027m sharing it. I was impressed how stable it was at both low and hypersonic speeds. I could turn around even at 1.4k\u002B m/s and it can fly well at low speeds as well. The only mod I used while testing was the TAC Fuel balancer, but sometimes I even forgot to use it and I barely noticed it on the controllability.\n\nSorry if anyone has a similar design, usually I don\u0027t keep track of other\u0027s crafts and I don\u0027t mean to steal anyone\u0027s work. \n\nI named the ship Unity, because everything just fits so well to my eyes, and I really like the look of it. The ship has docking clamp, RCS, drone core, RAPIER engines, and a crew capacity of 2. It is possible to attach some custom things to the outer, \u0022vertical\u0022 parts of the wings, and ofc everywhere else where you like it.\n\nI was able to reach high orbit without any problem and return safely and land at KSC.\n\nHere\u0027s a screenshot of the craft:\n\n![Unity.png?raw=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x9zkdo1kkzjxjd1/Unity.png?raw=1)\n\nAnd here\u0027s the download link:\n\n[DOWNLOAD](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vx04qckfp0tlqit/Unity.craft?dl=1)\n\nHave fun! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T08:42:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 08:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angezerus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T22:26:48Z","Content":"Hi, \n\n we cannot see the screenshot.."},{"CreatedByName":"Angezerus","CreatedById":129328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T08:45:00Z","Content":"Sorry about that, I\u0027m new to dropbox, I had to figure out how to embed correctly ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Anyway thanks for the headsup!
