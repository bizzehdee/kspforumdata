Thought I\\\u0027d put up some of my stock designs here. These first two are .14x4 craft files, which should still be entirely compatible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start, the Faraway-1. Originally built for Kerbol-escape missions, it has been readily adapted as heavy Mun-transit lifter, delivering the Munpod-1 with capability to spare. It is presented here in this configuration (known as the Faraway-Munpod-1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c69/Salda007/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot1-1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1-1.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFaraway-Munpod-1 on the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c69/Salda007/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot2-1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot2-1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c69/Salda007/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot5-1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot5-1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunpod-1 delivered to its destination with almost a full tank remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecent concerns have been raised about potential debris issues, as trans-Munar launches tend to leave the six inner boosters in a highly elliptical orbit that does not naturally decay. KLS researchers have put \u0027develop updated launcher that doesn\\\u0027t leave spare bits in orbit\u0027 on their to-do list. No, seriously, it\\\u0027s on there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo use the Faraway-1 component with your own upper stages, detach at the stack decoupler just above the ASAS. Make sure staging is preserved; all LFEs should be firing from launch, and the radials should dump stages from the outside in as tanks are emptied. I have thoughts on how to optimize the design for boosting large/heavy objects to LKO; if they pan out I\\\u0027ll put it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Faraway-1\\\u0027s primary payload has been the Munpod-1. Built due to increasing complaints by Jeb about having to land \u0027dinky little things\u0027 on the Mun, our designers went on a bender and slapped this five-tank, five-engine, 33.8 ton monster together. The new LV-909s were held up due to development delays when the Munpod-1 was being developed, so it uses the well-tested, reliable (heh) LV-T45 instead. Surprisingly, it handles remarkably well, with the five gimballing engines providing excellent control in the absence of RCS or ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShown above riding the Faraway-1, below are some shots of just the Munpod-1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c69/Salda007/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot13-1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot13-1.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunpod-1 on the pad for development tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c69/Salda007/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot7-2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot7-2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned, it handles extremely well on landing, although throttle should be used sparingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c69/Salda007/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot11-1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot11-1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA safe landing and a happy crew!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c69/Salda007/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot12-1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot12-1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMelwise was extremely proud of this photograph.

The eight lander legs provide excellent redundancy, should some be lost on a rough or uneven landing. The pictured mission even saw all four of the outer LV-T45s destroyed (due to the terrain collision bug when I resumed the flight). The remaining central engine was handily able to return our noble Kerbalnauts safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore ships will go up as I get designs finalized and screen-shotted.
