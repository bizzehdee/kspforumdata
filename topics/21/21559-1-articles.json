Versions I through IV demonstrated a remarkable capacity for flammability, even underwater. While this made for a great party trick, it accomplished little in the way of stellar transport. The project was almost scrapped when Isaac \u0027Weird Izzy\u0027 Kerman made the baffling suggestion to use something besides balsa wood and krazy glue for general construction. Remarkably, it worked, and the Cygnus V was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that it achieves orbit incredibly quickly compared to my other stock ships. The small mass and quad thrusters make it fairly agile and maneuverable. Like the Ozymandias, it is completely stock save for the mechjeb. However, I\u0027ll be uploading both stock and mechjeb flavors here shortly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A full album of pictures documenting a successful launch can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/XbK4Z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere.\u003C/a\u003E The non-mechjeb version will be up shortly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-07T03:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice ship.
