The original plan was to strap four hugeass rocket boosters to it and airlift it into the water, but that proved difficult, so the wheel pods were added. This allows the Leviathan to creep sloooowly into the water without too many essential bits falling off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hUvq7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hUvq7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FeNvF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FeNvF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eLFoX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eLFoX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s important to find a shallow slope into the water, or stuff starts breaking.

There isn\\\u0027t actually that much to see after it enters the water, just hour long cruises to nearby islands. The turn radius is enormous, but it has enough fuel to run basically forever. I have a few variations in the works, including one that has a helipad built in, but that is proving... difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it wouldn\\\u0027t be KSP if I didn\\\u0027t also have ideas on how to make even bigger ones.
