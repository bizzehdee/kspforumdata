The Monocruister!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it is not my fastest design to date, it is considered one of my largest designs yet in terms of aircraft. It contains four landing gears (due to the size of the craft) along with three turbojet engines to keep it powerful enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Monocruister1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Monocruister1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Monocruister2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Monocruister2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Monocruister3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Monocruister3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs usual, I\u0027m providing the craft files to this design. One warning about attempting to land this craft is that you will need some fuel if you\u0027re distant as this is a much heavier craft and will dive a bit. However, landing works well on this craft if done just right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might build another model similar to this with better lift support (earlier aircrafts I built were light enough to keep lift).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-13T17:35:45Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2012 05:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Bandock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taquarinha","CreatedById":47685,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T18:27:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice design. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bandock","CreatedById":28934,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T18:53:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Taquarinha. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, been a while since I posted any new design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atomictank","CreatedById":37393,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T20:46:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIT think it has a lot of potential but you could make it londer and mybe mount the extra bodies on swept wings!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am gonna go try that now\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bandock","CreatedById":28934,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-14T04:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used swept wings before.
