The descent on Eve was nerve-racking. It was a really close call but nothing exploded. Not for want of trying however. Darn thing was flickering like a christmas tree.\n\nCan\u0027t recall the descend angle but since these probes are separated by small SRBs, finetuning is not really an option. Too bad they landed in the ocean. No pics, alas.\n\nOn Duna it was hard getting at least a couple onto the ground with intact wheels.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Interesting. How distant are separated the different rovers of a same cluster ?\n\u003E Is there a real interest in the exploration of Duna to have small rovers like these ones rather than larger inhabited rovers (that can travel on hundreds of kilometers)?\n\nI separated quite low (under 30k) to keep them in physics range. The spread was not great. Less than 1 km. they\u0027re painfully slow and completely useless as they have no science experiments. I just thought it was a fun idea.\n\nIf the physics range were greater you could release 4 probes with different small science experiments over different biomes.\n\nThe rocket, however, is stupidly expensive. I\u0027m sure there are more efficient ways of gathering science from Duna.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E With a large rover, it\u0027s not so long, as its weight makes it stable.

It\u0027s an infinitely better design. The centre of mass could be lower, however.\n\nAs I said: these small rovers are painfully slow. Not really useful. I just wanted to try this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T21:35:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kreutzkevic**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T20:27:22Z","Content":"A similar packing system could be used to create a craft capable of carrying lots of small satellites for a mission that aims to pass by multiple bodies in need of mapping.
