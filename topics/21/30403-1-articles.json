The rotors consume a different amount of power based on the air. The thicker it is, the more they consume. As I ascend, i gradually throttle up to keep the net energy flow around 0. then as the air thins out, the rotors begin consuming less power and produce less thrust, so I drop solar panel to lighten up. When Im down to the last panel and my vertical speed drops to about 10 m/s, I press the button that decouples all the helicopter parts and leaves just the rocket, and try to make it to orbit.
