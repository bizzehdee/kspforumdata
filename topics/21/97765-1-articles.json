Still didn\u0027t unlock unlimited research in my career game but working hard on it. Though the low tech planes are more challenging, R.A.P.I.E.R.\u0027s make it nearly too easy. All craft are well balanced and aligned for smooth operation throughout their mission using the rules outlined in my documentation about space plane building in KSC (see signature).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably one of the coolest looking designs is this 2-engine-set space transporter for cargo up to around 5-6t. Mainly intended for engine part tests for aerospikes, PB-ION\u0027s and the like. Here it\u0027s standing on runway before launch for an aerospike test which is mounted in the cargo bay area between the 2 tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/SPT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/SPT Bitail 300 0_01.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/bitail_300_0_01_01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bitail_300_0_01_01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next one is a larger transport space plane, also low tech featuring 4 engine sets. It\u0027s intended for sub/orbital engine tests of the bigger engines like KR-2L. Here on it\u0027s maiden test flight around KSC while testing it\u0027s rocket engines.

It\u0027s a low gravity vacuum shuttle to serve at orbital stations / bases around Mun and Minmus and other low gravity bodies. It has parachutes though for landing at KSC too to return Kerbals after their shift at stations and bases. It has a nuclear engine as main engine for flights between Mun/Minmus and Kerbin. It also has wheels so that you don\u0027t need to land too precise at the outpost. Simply taxi to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion with wings as in the image: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/VAC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/VAC Shuttle-09 300 0_02.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion without wings: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/VAC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/VAC Shuttle-09 300 1_01.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently testing the version without wings. The wings weren\u0027t really intended to create much lift, they were basically meant as structural element between fuselage and VTOL engines. But since this shuttle is intended to only operate in vacuum for the most part i created a version without wings which saves 8 parts. With a little practice it\u0027s still possible to get the shuttle down near KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/shuttle-09_0_00_01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022shuttle-09_0_00_01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following is a research plane only for atmospheric use. It\u0027s intended for all those temperature, seismic and whatever else scan missions around KSC. Range is around 1/4 Kerbin at ceiling around 25000m / 1550m/s. Has 2 VTOL engines for landing in difficult terrain and a 4th wheel a little above ground at the rear end to avoid tipping over when landing uphill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/SSN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/SSN Duck VR 300 0_04.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/duck_300_0_04_01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022duck_300_0_04_01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally the fun part.
