The only thing I would say is that with a good aribreathing cutoff speed, you could make do with much less rocket thrust, a single engine should be more than enough (but if you want to keep the double fuselage, switch to 909\u0027s, I totally understand the looks part). Once you go over 1,500m/s, T/W is much less important, and you can improve your mass ratio if you drop engine mass for extra in-orbit delta-v! (or payload, of course).

Both able to lift cargo - but also capable of docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess a pure cargo lifter does not need docking options - and a Kerbal Transport could bring 6 kerbals to a potential space station and dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwitching to lighter engines may be a step towards that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tibarn","CreatedById":119937,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T20:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking neat, but what mod did you use since you say barely modded?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
