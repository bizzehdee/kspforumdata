The ship is all stock, so it doesn\u0027t look all that much like a Soyuz, but I wanted it to at least WORK like a Soyuz. Below are pictures of the rocket on the pad and lifting off. It uses four side boosters, a central sustainer core, and an upper stage like the real Soyuz launcher. The nose cones on the side boosters are tilted inward by mounting them on tilted cubic struts with part clipping enabled. Not pretty, but it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G1z76fh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022G1z76fh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real fun of the booster is the engines, of course. The sustainer core and side boosters each have four LV-T45 engines (since the more scale-like LV-909s would not lift the beastie). The sustainer core has four Ant engines placed where the vernier engines go, and the side boosters each have two Ant engines as verniers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b02fTqK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b02fTqK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we see the dropping of the side boosters. The side boosters to not feed fuel into the sustainer core (since that would be unlike the Soyuz launcher), but the sustainer core is longer than the side boosters, so it burns longer. I don\u0027t know that the side boosters of the Soyuz launcher use separation rocket motors, but I needed sepratrons to be sure rear end of the sustainer did not go up in a ball of flame at booster separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w00cegt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w00cegt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sustainer core burned out, and then the upper stage with one poodleski engine took the spacecraft the rest of the way to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0xFggcC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220xFggcC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upper stage placed the Soyuz in a 200 km orbit with fuel to spare.

Some versions of the Soyuz separated the orbital module before retro firing...other visions retained it until after retro firing. I dumped it so that I\u0027d need less fuel for the retro firing...but it does become another piece of space debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xeiPmn0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xeiPmn0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd...oops... I noticed that I forgot to put on the two 24-77 radial engines I was going to use as for the retro rocket burn. So I brought along that fuel tank for nothing. But fear not, comrades, because the RCS is plenty strong to deorbit this Soyuz. It did take a few minutes of firing and used a third of the RCS fuel, but a reentry trajectory was achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8bYRwvB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228bYRwvB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKa-DOOSH!
