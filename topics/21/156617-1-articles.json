Do not fire it on full throttle. Gently nurse the speed up to around 2,500 m/s, any higher and you will burn up, switch to map mode and put the AP at 75,000. Also watch the vehicle height as you will need to get her above 40,000 metres to stop loosing the AP from air resistance. It should be noted that the craft is capable of showing both an AP and PP of below 70,000 metres. As you cross the AP at above 70,000 metres you can fire the vector again (GENTLY!) to raise the PP. Orbit! Getting back is the hard part, as if you keep pointing prograde you go too fast into the lower atmosphere, but if you swing the nose around to slow down you can easily spin.
