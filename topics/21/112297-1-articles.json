I\u0027ve kept the scale to just about 100%. My Star 48 SRB has about 304 m/s of Delta-V, and the SRB on the HS-376 has 404 (Hard to do SRB equipped maneuvers without knowing Delta-V after all!). This Recreation was built in 1.0, so it may have too little delta-v in 1.0.2. For GTO insertion, use the Delta-K stage till you have 305 m/s left, stage, then fire the Star 48.![5KOnfKs.png](http://i.imgur.com/5KOnfKs.png)![I8tB45w.png](http://i.imgur.com/I8tB45w.png)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
