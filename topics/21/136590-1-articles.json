The final compliment to the primary armament is the 56 TOW-missiles carried on the flanks of the ship, to take out smaller targets the main guns cannot hit, targets beyond the range of the main guns\u0027 accuracy, and for increase in firepower in the broadside. Secondary armament is designed for the express purpose of protecting the \u003Cem\u003EAllegemeine \u003C/em\u003Efrom air or missile threat, and includes no less than 68 dual .50 cal turrets, 18 AIM-120 AMRAAM surface-to-air missiles, a CIWS turret in the aft section, and dual locking radar systems, one on the mobile SAM turret amidships and one in the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EAllegemeine\u0027s\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ebridge section.
