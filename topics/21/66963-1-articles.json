I conceived it as an intermediate between static refueling stations and interplanetary tankers. The product is a vessel that can efficiently change its orbit to rendezvous with other craft, but without the extra fuel and part count associated with an interplanetary tanker. It comes equipped with 5 docking ports for simultaneously refueling several craft of varying sizes. For those aesthetics junkies, I made sure the the Big O integrated seamlessly with its Ti\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A0o L booster so that the upper stage engine and monopropellant tanks fit neatly within the stack decoupler. All fuel tanks are easily reachable to avoid awkward camera angles when clicking on them to transfer fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/kIFyV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DHws383.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DHws383.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MM0f5dv.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MM0f5dvl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MM0f5dvl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/cqpbb4skw1ld157/Big\u002BO.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b8LAHNG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022b8LAHNG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAction Groups:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 decouples the Senior Clamp \u0027O\u0027 Tron docking port and ignites the sepatrons on the nose cone\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The Big O uses the minimum number of action groups so they don\u0027t interfere with any you might have used on your existing craft)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EFlight Notes:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncrease throttle to max and engage SAS before launch. Stage using the spacebar as usual. Wait until your altitude is at least 10km and your velocity is above 200m/s before beginning a slow gravity turn to 75\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and throttling down two notches. Continue pitching over and throttling down gradually so that by 25km altitute you\u0027re at about 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and 2/3 throttle. Switch to the orbital navball and follow the prograde vector. I suggest staying above 1/3 throttle for the majority of the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time you reach main engine burnout you should have an apoapsis of about 70km and an orbital velocity of at least 1400m/s. Stage again using the spacebar and press 10 to jettison the nose cone now that you\u0027re in the upper atmosphere. Throttle back up to at least 1/2 and follow the prograde marker. I recommend aiming for an apoapsis no greater than 100km so that there\u0027s plenty of fuel remaining in the second stage to deorbit it. Don\u0027t forget to manually extend the solar panels and make sure to charge the batteries before decoupling, otherwise the second stage may run out of electricity before you can perform your retro burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-27T23:57:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2014 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Narcosis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T20:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall, cute, and effecient.
