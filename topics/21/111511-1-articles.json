Therefore, I\u0027ve decided the best thing to do is start making my own replicas again, starting from the earliest jets. I\u0027ve seen a few meteors, but never have I seen any deHavillands.\n\nAnd so it is my pleasure to present to you the **deHavilland DH.100 Vampire FB.5!!!**\n\n![HI72lDE.png](http://i.imgur.com/HI72lDE.png)\n\n![DSpwPct.png](http://i.imgur.com/DSpwPct.png)\n\n![CdC0xdu.png](http://i.imgur.com/CdC0xdu.png)\n\n![t74dvhS.png](http://i.imgur.com/t74dvhS.png)\n\n![53YQ9f1.png](http://i.imgur.com/53YQ9f1.png)\n\n![CIKGC5e.png](http://i.imgur.com/CIKGC5e.png)\n\n![0MD834e.png](http://i.imgur.com/0MD834e.png)\n\n![NFmXR9c.png](http://i.imgur.com/NFmXR9c.png)\n\n![pN6LwAZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/pN6LwAZ.png)\n\n![hGJvNg4.png](http://i.imgur.com/hGJvNg4.png)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The tailhook does work, but you need a speed low enough for it to touch the ground. Edit: I\u0027ve also upped the brake torque from 5 to 8 on the Venom so it stops quick ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shaun","CreatedById":66344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T22:30:51Z","Content":"Progress update: Updated position of nose-wheel, flaps fixed using hidden control surface; flaps no longer pull nose up vertical over 50m/s.
