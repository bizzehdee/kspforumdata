I once saw a mod user with their base next to their rover transport next to their hover rocket plane. So now I have used stock Kerbal items to make my own space plane, returnable (can go to Duna and come back to Kerbin) lander with detachable rover/transport, and base. My major issue is getting them all in the same place for a nice photo. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I would love to see similar space craft that you designed. I feel our creations are a direct visual expression of our personalities. So comments are welcome and please send your photos \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Here are my creations. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1353.photobucket.com/albums/q673/EvifNam/jhgtuyhgf_zps4aff141a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jhgtuyhgf_zps4aff141a.jpg\u0022\u003E That is my Space plane I named it Jen-ion (my name is Jenian I felt it was witty \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) it is solar powered and has 5 ion engines. I have tested it on all atmospheric planets in the game and it flies in all of them I am proud of it but Im told it looks like a glorified boomerang... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1353.photobucket.com/albums/q673/EvifNam/vfghfgf_zps9104b10b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vfghfgf_zps9104b10b.jpg\u0022\u003E This is my Lander Which Im told looks like a lovely upside down bucket.... The lander is awesome it descends with aid of parachutes, lands deploys RC rover transport from underneath (to me it looks like its giving birth as it does so), kneels down to let astronauts out. Astronauts can ride the rover. It then rockets upward carrying the astronauts home, destroying itself systematically as it gets back into orbit to lessen weight (there are extra parachutes just in case it fails to do so threw human error). Then the ship can be docked and towed and or use its ion engines to go back home. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1353.photobucket.com/albums/q673/EvifNam/ghgf_zps79c39dae.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ghgf_zps79c39dae.jpg\u0022\u003E This is my Duna Base. It houses 10 Kerbals in it\u0027s 5 crew chambers. There are two ways to make it, Either sending three rockets docking them together and then sending them down to parachute on to the planet, or sending the whole thing wrapped up in a cage pushed by a nuclear engine rocket... which is dangerous cuz as it lands the nuclear rocket does too..... several km away but still we don\u0027t want to nuke any planets as we colonize, very bad idea. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1353.photobucket.com/albums/q673/EvifNam/kuyfsudfhjsdf_zps7224383b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kuyfsudfhjsdf_zps7224383b.jpg\u0022\u003E This is the rover and transport. It seats two in between the wheels on both sides and can flip upside down or on its side in any which way and the legs on its back flip it right side up again.... just make sure to remove the astronauts from their seats or it could wack them out of the rover.... they back up again if wacked but it is safe practice to prevent. It is solar powered, and has no need for batteries.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain_Party","CreatedById":59820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T10:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice work!
