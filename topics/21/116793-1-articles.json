If you don\u0027t press 6 it violently explodes the tail. I don\u0027t really know why.\n\nStep Four: Press 5 to close the cargo bay. Just like a normal SSTO, keep flying until you reach orbit. Don\u0027t use full throttle. Stage when intake air is depleted, avoid asymmetrical cut off.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T19:26:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 2001kraft**"},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T19:28:48Z","Content":"Download links coming soon."},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T06:10:20Z","Content":"**Koeing 747-9F** [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aww7yjxtjvnwpur/Koeing%20747-9F.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Koeing 747-9F SST** [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m8qc0hdxxgw8qt1/Koeing%20747-9F%20STS.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Stearwing D50** [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4feqvkip85d6r2v/Stearwing%20D50.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Stwearing D50 Subassembly** [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/toksxaq2jsvw83r/Stearwing%20Launch%20System.craft?dl=0)\n\nEnjoy!"},{"CreatedByName":"NEBx","CreatedById":148924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T07:58:42Z","Content":"Awesome ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)!"},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T18:05:10Z","Content":"Thanks!"}]}
