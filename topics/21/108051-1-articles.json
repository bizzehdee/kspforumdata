(250 at max altitude)\n\nExtra safe - 2 layers of parachutes.\n\nCan be flied both manned or unmanned.\n\nDrawbacks :\n\nA bit nose heavy before 90m/s\n\nTested only in 1.0.0 aero and not 1.0.2\n\nAction groups : (Only requires basic action groups)\n\n(G)ear - basic gear controls\n\n(U)Lights - Gear lights.\n\n\u00AECS - Activate engine\n\n(B)rakes - Landing gear brakes as well as airbrakes. Can tap in flight or toggle for complete stop on the runway.\n\n(\u003C-)Abort - Closes intake, shuts down the engine and deploys the mk16 parachute. This will bring you down to 10m/s. There is extra set of parachutes to bring you down to 6m/s, but they need to be deployed by staging if you need to land on a slope and fear you will not hit wheels.\n\n![AlpxuD5.png](http://i.imgur.com/AlpxuD5.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mapoko","CreatedById":139980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:40:26Z","Content":"I forgot to upload the craft file, did I ?\n\n[http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=09886213506917155006](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=09886213506917155006)"}]}
