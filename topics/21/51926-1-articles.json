So we decided to build an ISS, as close as we could in actual looks while at the same time also matching \u0022function\u0022. Since KMP no likey mods, this is entirely stock. I analyzed the individual modules and what purposes they served, facilities they offered, and their capabilities. For all intents and purpose, every module that has so far made up this station is \u0022functional\u0022 compared to the real things. They have all been launched aboard stock Proton rockets, except for the Unity docking node, which we sent up using a stock Falcon Heavy inspired launcher since we don\u0027t have a space shuttle. Part count is already starting to make my PC twitch a little, and we only have \u0022Expedition 1\u0022 so far. Each component was launch in it\u0027s appropriate order as well. Station is sitting at a 250km 0* orbit. We decided against the ISS\u0027s inclination just for the ease of intercept, but 60% of the ISS\u0027s orbit gave us 250 so we decided we\u0027d at least do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe\u0027s small, but great things often come from small beginnings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ujxl6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
