The lab with the solar panels is the \u0022stay behind\u0022, rearming and processing one. It has a hitchhiker for longterm occupancy and the 6-way docking port thingy for later expansion. The other lab is the \u0022go home\u0022 version with lander legs and parachutes for recovery on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what happened here was the lander went down to Duna, ran all its experiments on the surface, can came back up. The data got stored in the go-home lab and the stay-behind lab rearmed the experiments. Then the lander went back down, ran its experiments in the atmosphere while hanging on its chutes, landed, got a 2nd handful of rocks, and returned. Data again in the go-home lab, experiments rearmed by the stay-behind lab. As Duna currently doesn\u0027t have biomes, this is all it can do for the moment, but someday hopefully the lander will be able to make many more trips (there\u0027s a kethane operation at Ike supplying the fuel). And perhaps I\u0027ll have a reason to add more stay-behind labs to the nascent station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis system worked well enough to deserve repeating at Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3790/12450467904_df4883d218_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212450467904_df4883d218_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3668/12449961855_b509e0dd94_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212449961855_b509e0dd94_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from tweaking the arrangement of the lights, the actual lab parts are the same as used at Duna, but seen here in close-up. Just different rockets to get them to Laythe, and a whole major kethane system from Vall to provide the fuel. Also, instead of a lander, the reusable Science!-grabber is an SSTO seaplane. But the whole operation will be run the same way as at Duna, with go-home and a stay-behind labs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JayKay","CreatedById":90560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T16:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thunderstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thunderstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4uDrDMY.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/4uDrDMY.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is a proper space lab\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, except one of the gigantors should be ripped off and an ugly blanket should be slung over one side of the main body...at least that\u0027s how NASA did it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJK\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiakatt","CreatedById":102095,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T17:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/nkM7f\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
