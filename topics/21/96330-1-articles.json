I ended up with a craft costing \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A17655, with a bit over 2700 m/s \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V remaining in LKO, which makes it (barely) capable of a Mun return mission. (Of course, it would benefit from some solar panels or radial batteries, but those are \u0026gt;15 science.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iaFiBGY.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epicture\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.bhauth.com/files/Grand%20Day%20Out.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecraft file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat kinds of cheap, low-tech craft have you guys made?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
