The service module was abandoned in free Kerbal orbit in the return from EVE as the return module needed every bit of RCS to make for Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second uses an inverted cupola module in the same spot. There are 4 atmosphere probes attached as well, each capable of landing on worlds with atmosphere and providing science readings. I have redesigned the probes and will be sending 2 to replace the ones I used on DUNA with ones with more delta-V and parachutes with the idea in mind of bringing some of them from hypersonic atmosphere analysis back to the service module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h3SjrCc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022h3SjrCc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE using inverted command pods means that before launch and after each IVA or return from any other ships/EVA POV you need to change control back to a docking port facing the correct direction for NAV ball markers to behave correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JCY0yYq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JCY0yYq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EView of the good ship \u0022A cupola good ideas in a lander\u0022 from Ike\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BBVfZx3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BBVfZx3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is now waiting in orbit along for a trip to the Joolian SOI with a chemical rocket lander carrying Jeb(for Laythe since NERVA is not effective on high gravity and especially high gravity \u002B atmosphere bodies), a fuel module with a lander can that docks at the top on the clamp-o-tron Sr carrying Bill, and a new science return core carrying Bob. A few fueling runs to top up all the tanks and they will be off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
