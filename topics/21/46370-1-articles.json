Put a simple sputnik-like probe into space, but give it orbital maneuvering capacity. Small probe, small launch vehicle, two FLT-800\u0027s and two small SRB\u0027s. There! Orbit! Well... Maybe one FLT-800 and a FLT-400. Maybe less? From there I got carried away with shaving off weight. The fun thing is, that every time you think \u0022I can\u0027t take away more weight\u0022 it turns out you can. Less fuel = less weight = faster acceleration = making it into orbit anyway. That\u0027s a good lesson, because it works in reverse as well of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the question: \u003Cstrong\u003Ecan you get to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn on a single FLT-800?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI learned that you can actually get to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn \u003Cem\u003Ewith a launch weight equal to that of a single FLT-800\u003C/em\u003E.

With four air intakes the flame-out is a smidgen too early and makes for a very tight orbiting run, but six intakes are just enough to get you to 20 km at over 800 m/s, and hardly any fuel used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://willems.zenfolio.com/p472725769/e7bb75767\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://willems.zenfolio.com/img/s9/v96/p2075613031-4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022p2075613031-4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErmged showing off the small size of this M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn-going combination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://willems.zenfolio.com/p472725769/e75750395\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://willems.zenfolio.com/img/s1/v55/p1970602901-4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022p1970602901-4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the probes in a 25km orbit above M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.
