Here\u0027s what I did up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe premiere tour-de-force creation of Dynamic Research Corporation Inc - the Explorer-class deep-space research vessel. This is an Aid-ship, unarmed and unarmored, intended for intermediate-range excursions in the Kerbol system, limited mostly by delta-v capacity. It has crew accommodations for nine crew, although it is normally launched with only three - two Cupola modules and a Hitchhiker container are included. It has a standard-sized docking clamp at the bow, two regular clamps on the dorsal and ventral positions and a large clamp at the stern to complement various docking and rendezvous missions. Of possible interest is the detachable command module, equipped with parachutes, providing abort-from-ascent capability. This leaves the bow of the ship with a large docking port exposed for fitment of another command module of your choosing. It is also provisioned with Xenon fuel tanks for the purposes of resupplying deep-space probes and communication satellites, and has two small docking latches amidships expressly for that purpose. Due to the inclusion of two Cupola Modules and a large probecore module, the ship has ample flywheel authority in spite of its size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrawbacks: The mass of the ship means that it has a comparatively low delta-v compared to slimmer, trimmer designs, and the launch vehicle is somewhat a pain to use. However, once in orbit, it offers unparalleled crew comfort, scientific instrumentation and in-orbit research capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDRC\u0027s agenda is to promote long-term habitability studies in deep space and possible colonization efforts on Duna. DRC has eyed the feud among other corporations with a bit of trepidation, but has declined to get involved. As such, DRC will respect and respond to any distress hail from any other ship nearby and render aid if possible. (Unofficially, DRC is more sympathetic to Spiritwolf, but is unsure how to go about helping.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E292 parts once in orbit - I was worried once I saw the 300-part limit and had to fire the game up just to check...!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMediafire .craft file here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/410ml271z6nco43/Explorer-class_(DRC_Inc_).craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/410ml271z6nco43/Explorer-class_(DRC_Inc_).craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Eodc-ijJYA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-30T10:10:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2013 10:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pvtnum11\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded d/l link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T10:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWas thinking of adding a probe to a ship as a last ditch thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specula","CreatedById":27367,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T10:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, I\u0027m really surprised to see how many people are submitting to Macey.
