Do you have a fairing around your Soyuz?\u00A0 A different problem could be the ascent profile. In pre-1.0 versions of KSP, an older \u003Cs\u003Eaero\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0errordynamics model allowed people to basically go straight up 10km and then tip over to 45 degrees and continue to orbit. This is no longer possible, and one must keep the nose of a rocket closer to prograde (preferably within 10 degrees or so in the lower atmosphere), lest it break up or flip due to aerodynamic forces. A screenshot of your rocket might help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-09T20:08:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2018 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by EpicSpaceTroll139\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-10T00:39:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse the 1.8m structure tube or a fairing.
