I just about have nuclear engines unlocked, but I can either unlock those -or- the mk2 and mk3 aircraft pieces, but not both at the moment (something this mission should help with, actually).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm wondering if anyone has a really efficient and minimalist design for this?

Depending on how much fuel I have left over, I\u0027m going to dump fuel into Mun Command in high orbit, and hopefully de-orbit and land the entire payload en masse with the terrier. If I don\u0027t have that much fuel left, each of the landers actually has as part of the payload its very own FL-T400 and twin \u0022Twitch\u0022 engines that I am hoping to use to rotate the duty roster on my grounded base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022K8XpXAd.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K8XpXAd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLots of untried designs, I\u0027m sure there\u0027ll be a failure cascade somewhere in the mission.

I still have 400 units of fuel in the tank (out of 5600) to contribute to my lunar burn; if I\u0027d thought to put a command module on this stage I could de-orbit it with that and probably recover a chunk of my 200,000 credit investment. Next time, maybe. Instead that fuel is going towards trans-Munar burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit 2: It turns out the second stage is a little over-engineered; I completed my Munar burn with almost 2/3 of the tank left! So in its present configuration it\u0027s definitely a candidate for some sort of interplanetary expedition. The rest of that fuel is going into the orbital storage in Mun Command.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit 3: Got 1280 fuel units into the storage at Mun Command. Used most of my onboard\u00A0monoprop to dock, but Mun Command has all sorts of surplus to refuel it. I only had 75 units of default rover tankage for monoprop anyhow -- just enough! The extra 150 parts made a pretty big impact on the lag for my simple back-country command outpost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022w8Bztne.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w8Bztne.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real payload for this mission is 3 scientists who were undergoing astronaut training at Mun Command, as well as two tourists who are along for the ride. The scientists will each plant a flag, hopefully each in a separate Munar biome, collect a bunch of data, then return to Kerbal with their intel and plant another flag. Then they\u0027re to be deployed each to a separate science facility. For RP purposes I\u0027ll probably shuffle out Maree and Grajorie when their replacements\u0027 training is complete, as well as the guy on the munar Far East Crater base. That\u0027ll also let them flag on Minmus and return home to level up.That\u0027ll give me six level 2 or 3 scientists and enough data to really Science!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit4: Hah, forgot solar panels on my probes and landers. And it turns out the landers have enough gas for a suicide burn landing, and then just barely to get into orbit again, but not back home. So they\u0027ll need to dock with something and refuel for the homeward leg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-10T09:48:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2016 09:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by dire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EOr maybe I\u0026#039;m just bad at landing and taking off again.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Toonu","CreatedById":18557,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T06:54:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow many tons it get into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E?
