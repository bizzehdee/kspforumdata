I have juste started playing with the DEMO of KSP so the available parts are quite limited. My computer is quite slow and I have an old video card, so I\u0027m waiting to get my new computer (in a few weeks!) to buy and install the complete game! Can\u0027t wait to build and launch rockets with full graphics and a decent framerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pics of my first truly successful mission. I have designed this VTOL spacecraft, which is reusable and can use aerobraking to slow down A LOT when reentering. I deploy the parachute at low altitude (orienting the nose up) and bingo, with some practice I land quite precisely. The rocket itself is compact and nice, and doesn\u0027t oscillate during takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://verlamer.ca/kerbal/silex_xs/Silex_sub_stage1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Silex_sub_stage1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://verlamer.ca/kerbal/silex_xs/Silex_xs_stage2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Silex_xs_stage2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://verlamer.ca/kerbal/silex_xs/Silex_xs_orbital.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Silex_xs_orbital.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://verlamer.ca/kerbal/silex_xs/Silex_xs_orbit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Silex_xs_orbit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://verlamer.ca/kerbal/silex_xs/Silex_sx_chute.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Silex_sx_chute.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://verlamer.ca/kerbal/silex_xs/Silex_xs_landing.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Silex_xs_landing.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://verlamer.ca/kerbal/silex_xs/Silex_xs_landed.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Silex_xs_landed.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voculus","CreatedById":85437,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T21:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor being a beginner, you\u0027re building rockets like a pro!
