Couple reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Things with insufficient lift have very little lift force to keep them from accelerating downward, at which point you need to aim more vertical and your plane looks more like a turbojet rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Mk2 parts will usually have their center of lift roughly in the middle of their own center mass. Then you stick and engine on it, generally in the back, and it has no inherent lift. The CoM travels back and the CoL is in front; this is an unstable situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Elevons have pathetic lift rating given their mass. Spamming them probably won\u0027t help much, as by the time you have any meaningful lift from them you\u0027ll have too much control and the gentlest nudge of the controls will send it a-flipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you\u0027re allowed tail plane you might find yourself more stable flying sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T14:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I said elevons I meant to be put on the side of the fuselage to give control, thanks for the input.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Champ","CreatedById":96425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T15:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/133314-Test-Results-How-much-wing-does-your-SSTO-spaceplane-need-Answer-Maybe-none-at-all\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/133314-Test-Results-How-much-wing-does-your-SSTO-spaceplane-need-Answer-Maybe-none-at-all\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T15:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was one of my first SSTOs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3244718.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223244718.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo wing parts, just fins and body lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also made this abomination just for the lols:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3240358.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223240358.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T15:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Champ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Champ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/133314-Test-Results-How-much-wing-does-your-SSTO-spaceplane-need-Answer-Maybe-none-at-all\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/133314-Test-Results-How-much-wing-does-your-SSTO-spaceplane-need-Answer-Maybe-none-at-all\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYer, was about to link that thread too - discussion has already been had \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E TLDR; yes it can be done, but you need a steeper AoA and it\u0027s less efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T15:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9tCQPZnP8g?start=1739\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E \u003Cp\u003E^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley built a main wing free aircraft in his most recent livestream.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T04:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is going to end up being a craft-sharing thread, so let\u0027s just go ahead and move it to Craft Exchange now, shall we?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SquaredSpekz","CreatedById":124226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T11:15:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the whole point.
