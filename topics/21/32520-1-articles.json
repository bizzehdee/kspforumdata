Top speed of about 40 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t taken long to test it due to work, but it flies really well, it is just a bit nose heavy, but you can adjust it with the Alt\u002BS/W trim keys to maintain a fair flight. This is most likely to be easy to solve with weight distribution, I don\u0027t just have more time for that now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember to disable wheel steering as well as the motors for a more real ULM performance, as it starts raising the tail, gear up. At about 18 to 20 m/s, give it positive pitch, and you\u0027re on your way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: Remember not being able to land? Solved with the use of EAS-4 Strut connector. Somehow it increases drag and weight, so that the little bugger is a lot more easy to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly low, slow and enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/k0aequztsh134yz/Little%20Flyer%20III.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/k0aequztsh134yz/Little%20Flyer%20III.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few Pics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn runway take-off:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NNYfYzb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NNYfYzb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd... flying around:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CEBzF68.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CEBzF68.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pdjV4Iu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pdjV4Iu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"firerider521","CreatedById":60860,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T00:34:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this.
