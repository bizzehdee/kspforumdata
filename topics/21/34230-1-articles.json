After some tinkering, I came up with this beast:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HnYuWCm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HnYuWCm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerial ladder is Damned Robotics stuff: a Rototron on the bottom to rotate, a hinge just above that to elevate, and a stack of 3 hydraulic cylinders to extend. The cylinders are separated with a short box girder to each of which are attached 2 long extending ladders, 1 pointing in each direction, with one of the short, fixed ladder segments between to bridge the gap. At the bottom, there\u0027s a short, yellow, extension ladder to get from the turntable up over the hinge. Then there are some B9 Aerospace lights and ladders, TT\u0027s truck cab, and it\u0027s all powered by 2 of the big fuselage batteries from Firespitter under the cab. There\u0027s also a KAS winch on the back with a grappling hook.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s got pretty good sideways reach...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SUW3bpI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SUW3bpI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd can get Kerbals on the roof of the SPH...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r7YcNZ8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r7YcNZ8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s not tall enough to change the flag and Jeb was very disappointed that he wasn\u0027t quite able to paint \u0022Class of 2013\u0022 on the side of the water tower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fvv2EVq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fvv2EVq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, there\u0027s the whole issue of it not being able to pump any water at all, so no elevated master stream. But the only times anything burns in KSP is when rocket engines are working properly and during re-entry. Otherwise, things just explode and it\u0027s all over, so I guess Kerbal firemen really don\u0027t need to pump water. And Kerbals seem quite able to fall unhurt from disabled rockets on the pad so really don\u0027t need a ladder truck to rescue them, either. But something in the KOSHA regulations says you have to have a firetruck standing by during launches so I built one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding 1 more cylinder to the aerial would solve it\u0027s vertical reach problems but the thing\u0027s pretty unwieldy already. Ever see the last scene of \u0022It\u0027s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\u0022 ? I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s what\u0027ll happen if I make it any longer, but no way to know without trying. Of course, I\u0027ll then have to make the vehicle bigger because the bounce in the ladder already tends to toss it around some. Probably make it a 6-wheeler with better overall balance and more outriggers, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for looking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Varyon","CreatedById":60423,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T04:23:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s quite the feat of engineering.
