Once you understand all of this stuff, proceed to step 3.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDecide on the purpose of your mission. Is it merely for planting a flag and adding to a personal exploration quota, or will it also be a science gathering mission? Once you know your objectives, proceed to step 4.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou need to figure out what sort of mission profile your Duna mission will use. Are you able to reliably rendezvous and dock spacecraft in orbit? If so, proceed to step 5. If not, go\u00A0to step 8.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDo you care about reusable technology for your Duna mission? If so, go to step 7. If not, go to step 6.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWith the ability to dock and\u00A0without needing reusability for the mission, you can use what is probably the easiest mission profile to design a spacecraft for in terms of engineering - an expendable-spacecraft Duna Orbit Rendezvous profile. Proceed to step 9.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe ability to dock means that you can make a reusable mothership and also a reusable lander, and use a mission profile that relies on orbital rendezvous in both Duna and Kerbin orbit. Proceed to step 9.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you can\u0027t reliably rendezvous and dock, you only have one option available: a single-launch Direct Ascent profile. Proceed to step 16.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDesign your Duna lander. It should be transported to Duna orbit without any of its own fuel being consumed. It should carry any equipment necessary for your mission objective (see step 3). It needs 2200m/s of delta-v if you are using parachutes as well as the engines to land, and 2700m/s if you are landing without the use of parachutes (these values are above the minimum, but are likely to be safe values for a beginner to aim for). You should use high-I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0vacuum-optimized engines if you can, as Duna\u0027s atmosphere is mostly negligible. If you are not planning on reusing the lander, you might make it as a two stage design. Otherwise use a single stage. Don\u0027t worry too much about aerodynamics or a heat shield, those are rarely things that you need to consider for Duna.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you are using expendable spacecraft, proceed to step 10. If you are using reusable spacecraft, proceed to step 12.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDesign your return vehicle. This should have a decouplable capsule with a parachute and heat shield to return all of your kerbals to Kerbin. It should also have about 700m/s of delta-v in order to conduct the interplanetary transfer burn to go back to Kerbin. Proceed to step 11.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDesign your transfer stage. This should be capable of placing both your return vehicle and your Duna lander in a low circular equatorial orbit of Duna (60km is a good orbit to aim for). For this, it needs about 1000m/s to leave Kerbin, and a subsequent 700m/s to circularize at Duna. Proceed to step 15.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDesign your mothership. It will carry your crew, so give them enough space on board. It needs to have enough delta-v to escape Kerbin and circularize in Duna orbit whilst docked to your Duna lander, and then\u00A0to subsequently return to Kerbin orbit from Duna orbit without the Duna lander. It also needs to be able to carry some extra fuel to refuel the Duna lander, so include spare fuel tanks equivalent to the storage of the Duna lander. For best results, assemble the entire mothership in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E with the Duna lander attached to it (use the Merge button to get them both in the same construction window), lock the spare fuel tanks on the mothership and also the fuel tanks on the lander, and ensure that the mothership has at least 3500m/s in its fully loaded configuration. Such motherships tend to be rather large, and constructing them is often easiest by splitting them into several separately-launched modules. Proceed to step 13.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYour mothership will need refuelling between missions. Design a vehicle that can transport fuel to the mothership. Ideally it should be able to be recovered on Kerbin after refuelling the mothership. You may need several launches of this fuel tanker, depending on how large it is and how large your mothership is. Proceed to step 14.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDesign a vehicle to take kerbals into orbit and transfer them to your mothership. It is probable that you already have vehicles that are capable of doing this rather trivial task. Proceed to step 15.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDesign and test your launch vehicles. Every payload you have created so far needs a reliable way to reach Kerbin orbit. Once you have this, you can assemble your various payloads and conduct your mission. For a non-reusable mission, it is usually easiest to attach your Duna lander directly beneath your return vehicle with a stack separator, attach your transfer stage directly beneath the lander, and launch the whole thing on one single rocket. This becomes considerably more challenging to do if you are using a reusable mothership, which is a technique that lends itself to the concept of assembling the vehicle in low Kerbin orbit before sending it to Duna.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou have reached this step if you cannot dock spacecraft in orbit. This means that you need to launch everything on a single rocket, land your entire capsule on Duna, and then return to Kerbin directly from Duna\u0027s surface. I will outline the specific steps you should take. Follow the remaining steps in direct numerical order.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDesign your Kerbin return stage. This will transfer back to Kerbin from Duna orbit, and should have a capsule with a heat shield and parachute to land the crew back on Kerbin. It needs about 700m/s to do so. This is also where your solar panels should be attached.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDesign your Duna landing stage. 2700m/s should be good for this stage. You also need landing legs and ladders, and any science equipment you plan on using. You might split this into two separate stages if a single stage for this purpose is too challenging for you to create.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDesign your transfer stage. It should have about 1700m/s in total to reliably reach Duna and circularize in low Duna orbit (60km equatorial orbit is good to aim for).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFinally, design your launch vehicle. This should be able to send the rest of the vehicle into low Kerbin orbit. You can then launch the mission.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-26T19:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want just the lander, or a whole ship?

I don\u0027t know quite how much room for error that Duna lander has, but it doesn\u0027t look like enough to compensate for, for example, a horribly inefficient Duna ascent by a player who perhaps doesn\u0027t know how to conduct a successful gravity turn. It also has a very high part count, which might make it unusable for some players (I certainly wouldn\u0027t be able to regularly use a spacecraft that has 333 parts on launch).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-26T22:33:14Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2016 10:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by eloquentJane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-26T22:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m afraid \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160814-eloquentjane/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022160814\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160814-eloquentjane/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@eloquentJane\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0brings up a good point. \u00A0Without knowing the experience level of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).
