The suspension is as good as I can get it, I only activate the front wheel steering so the turn is not as sharp and likely to tip the rover. It\u0027s top speed is above 20m/s, which is not what you should be doing across rough terrain.\n\nEdit: As an example you can go up and down the runway sides without slowing, but the steep second slope at the end of the runway you will need to slow down.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I loved the book!

This is meant as part of a \u0027pre-accident\u0027 pack.

There are a few different versions from different artists.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hey man.

Obviously I made changes for practicality and for the use of stock parts and keeping the part count down."}]}
