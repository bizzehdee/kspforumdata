And I dont have that rocking anymore on any aircraft unless it is at its edge of flight envelope. \n\nI know the real Flanker has leading edge slats that auto deploy on low leading edge pressure situations. This helps it maintain control in high AoA situations, there is also an audible alarm that goes off in the cockpit that warns the pilot of an impending stall. \n\nI would also suggest running and using Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, it will help for structural strength without over abundance of struts.\n\nAs for the take-off and landing speeds, the trick I use is leading edge slats and flap use. Again the real Flanker uses both for take off and landing. \n\nYour take off speed should be around 140-180kts depending on load of craft. I use knots for my increments of speed it is easier to find that information.\n\nLanding speed should be about 120-140kts again depending on the current load on the craft.\n\nAlmost all of my craft take off and land at those speeds except my Mig-21 SSTO, it has a 200-230kts take-off and a 180-200kts landing speed, much like the real Mig-21.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T15:39:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo**"},{"CreatedByName":"FourGreenFields","CreatedById":139309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T15:39:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ouch.

But vids... not a chance.\n\nAnyway, I know it\u0027s annoying with Adjustable Landing Gear, but calculating stuff with raised gear is usually a good idea (except for calculating performance for landing approach, etc. ofcourse).\n\nThe stability issues do sound and look alot like an asymmetric stall -\u003E snap roll (wouldn\u0027t call it spin unless it keeps spiraling down, instead of instantly recovering). Thick wings allow you to pull higher AoAs, but would prob skyrocket the wave drag area on your design. Otherwise, what Hodo said (it kinda is possible to do automatic \u0022slats\u0022 though, just need to set the leading edge to negative AoA deflection).\n\nHowever, do you actually pull 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA? Or do you pull till less, and then the nose suddenly lifts? If so, your tail stalls first, loses lift, and now that your tail wings aren\u0027t countering anymore, your wings will pull the nose up. Possible solutions would be thicker tail wings, or tail wing slats. Or not pulling that tight.\n\nWith B9PW it shouldn\u0027t be a problem to add slats/make the slats bigger. Same for flaps.\n\nSet the leading edge control surfaces (if I\u0027m not mistaken your leading edge is already a control surface) to either spoilers, or flaps, then modify the custom action groups so you can control them. They should deflect up at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA, and then deflect towards the airflow (-AoA deflection, I think you already use that) so they don\u0027t cause a stall. That should increase your lift a bit. Don\u0027t expect too much though.\n\nEDIT: You could ofcourse also rotate the slats, instead of letting them deflect as flaps/spoilers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T15:46:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 03:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FourGreenFields**"},{"CreatedByName":"woot","CreatedById":102873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T15:56:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, that should do the trick.
