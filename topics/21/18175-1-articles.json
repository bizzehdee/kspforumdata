Anyway, here\u0027s a couple satellites from my MJ-series (MJ stands for MechJeb, not Michael Jackson): The MJ-1 Observation Satellite and the MJ-2 Deep space satellite. These satellites require MechJeb (obviously) and, as usual, the NovaPunch Remix Pack. The only difference between these two satellites is that the MJ-1 is meant for Kerbin or Mun orbit and has 2 solar panels and the MJ-2 has 4 panels and is meant for interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy responsibly, and as always, comment if you like!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-halocon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T05:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease post higher quality screen shots.
