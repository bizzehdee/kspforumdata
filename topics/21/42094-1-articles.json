(or flung out of solar system depending on which one you use and what your lifting lol) These ships might not particularly attractive aesthetically, but I have not built anything they couldn\u0027t get into orbit so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of these lifters provides quite a kick to anything on top so Kerlington reminds you once again to \u0022strut your stuff!\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets start with the biggest ones from the heavy series:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E37 mainsails, 74 orange fuel tanks, 18 stages, 821 parts and 213,120 units of fuel to burn!

And even though the part count count might seem a bit high, just remember it\u0027s all asparagus staged, and each stage drops off around 40 parts... And 2 stages drop within the first 15 seconds or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://sites.google.com/site/ouchsdownloads/home/downloads/Heavy%20large.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Heavy%20large.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. This can also get 10 full orange fuel tanks in orbit, just add a docking port on top and it makes for a great space station refueler.

This is because the game recalculates struts and fuel lines when you do this and often recalculates them wrong leading to missing fuel lines and struts. Or fuel lines and struts connected to things they are not supposed to be connected to resulting in a (spectacular) disaster. And I\u0027ll be honest there a lot of struts and fuel lines to go wrong here on all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll likely keep adding to the bundle as I\u0027ve got a few ideas for more stuff.
