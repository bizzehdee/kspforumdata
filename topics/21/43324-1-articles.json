Docking is just wonderful isn\u0027t it. I find it interesting that you did this by docking each module individually. Right now I am creating a ship almost exactly like this, but I am going to send it up all in one go. Trust me, it makes life a lot less painful if you can get it up in one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N3Coalition","CreatedById":75191,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T03:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to avoid use of asparagus staging for more realistic ascent lifters, unfortunately this limits the tonnage that I can lift into space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for some reason the VAB doesnt like my two docking modules idea. I tried to replicate it first by building the whole thing to see if two sr docking ports would work but... I don\u0027t think the VAB liked it. XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other advantage I can think of is that with it being highly modular, if it ever gets damaged, you can simply send replacement modules instead of a whole new ship. Other than that, I guess it was also a learning experience for how to multidock, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing should have roughly 9,000 m/s of Delta V without any payload, so I think this might be overkill for Duna.

It does allow for the replacement of parts. I did not use asparagus to lift my ship, I used 20 large fuel tanks and medium fuel tanks with 16 skippers and 4 mainsails. It works pretty well, the only flaw is that I messed up fuel flow, making it spin badly. Don\u0027t be afraid to just strap a ton of boosters on it and see if it explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ojimak","CreatedById":57539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T04:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/#fp=9a975e048e4bd6d6\u0026amp;psj=1\u0026amp;q=define:\u002B\u002Btenuous\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ETenuous\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/#fp=9a975e048e4bd6d6\u0026amp;psj=1\u0026amp;q=define:\u002B\u002Btedious\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ETedious\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m terribly sorry for doing this, but it just burned my soul. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ojimak\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-21T06:49:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2013 06:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ojimak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N3Coalition","CreatedById":75191,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T06:03:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI probably still used it incorrectly but when I wrote that, I was think about how precarious things floating at each other relatively quickly was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough this whole thing has been pretty tedious.
