Do any of the lifters or landers need testing? Or the ascent vehicle?\n\nThe Descent Vehicle and the Ascent Vehicle both need work, but I have updated them a bit already, I will get you a link for the craft files\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, my reasons for trying to cut down on the litter was more to do with your remark about what a mess the site would look like, than performance issues.\n\u003E Performance at the moment is fine. Which is to say my usual 1:3 time ratio for when I\u0027m on the ground.\n\u003E \n\u003E So far my only problem is whenever I\u0027m in the process of trying to pick up the RTG, my game keeps going black, except for the GUI, then crashes. The last couple of seconds of the log are loaded with hundreds of entries like this:\n\u003E \n\u003E and this:\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s something to do with the damping settings on the rover wheels.. at the time I was attempting to manoeuvre into alignment with the RTG docking port.\n\u003E \n\u003E From some googling around, it turns out both the above errors are relatively common in KSP at the moment. From what I can see, [it can happen even in a stock install](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5287). It doesn\u0027t appear to have been tracked down, so far. The best guess I\u0027ve seen on the cause so far seems to be this:\n\u003E \n\u003E The only mods installed are StockBugFixModules, KerbPaint and ModuleManager. Think I\u0027ll see what happens with all mods removed.\n\nI just got that exact same problem, but it was after I picked up the RTG and was heading back to base. 2 RTG\u0027s and 2 Batteries seems about the right mix of power, it\u0027s going down at full throttle but not so much you won\u0027t get a good drive out of it.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I never started it.. Do any of the lifters or landers need testing? Or the ascent vehicle?\n\nHere is the [descent vehicle](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/236133-the-dunatian/files/2258719/download), needs to fit 6, be small and tin can-ish, needs chutes and thrusters for descent, must have enough TWR to do a small hop when almost empty (not get back to orbit).\n\nHere is the new [Ascent Vehicle](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/236133-the-dunatian/files/2259907/download), needs to seat 6, be able to land and then refill it\u0027s tanks (not in a hurry, it\u0027s only supposed to have one RTG), leaves refuelling stuff behind on Ascent, docks with Hermes.\n\nGo to it! Can\u0027t wait to see them.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWell with the Linux Graphics driver update and the black screen issue, I feel I did not get the most out of the night, Mark and the Rovers have disappeared.

The Whatney rover is supposed to be a normal rover that he cut half the roof off and made a pressurised tent in it to hold the RTG and his life support stuff.
