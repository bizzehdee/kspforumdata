The other problem is the tail dragger design is never going to be that good for take off or landing expecially on a jet. Last problem I see is the Center of Thrust (CoT) is below your Center of Mass (CoM) this is going to cause the craft to pitch up, without any real pitch control this means the craft will just flip end over end without any way of stopping it when at full throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daniel K.
