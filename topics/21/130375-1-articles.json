I\u0027m kind of curious as to why you chose to double up the nose cone and fairing. You can use a fairing to make a custom nose no problem, but using both seems like unnecessary weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[edit] OOooooh, it\u0027s a parachute, I see.

If you\u0027re like me, that ejection seat only gets used when you\u0027re about to smash into something, a chute placed like that will just press your poor pilot deep into the fuselage of the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlanB","CreatedById":157341,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T13:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EI don\u0027t know why I added it, seeing that this is only a game, but it is a rudimentary ejection system.

The Big\u0027s S wings you are using are for shuttles and are probably heavier and providing much more lift/drag than you need, some smaller deltas should be enough for your craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlanB","CreatedById":157341,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T22:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
