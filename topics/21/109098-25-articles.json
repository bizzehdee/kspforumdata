You should probably disable pitch on those surfaces. Maybe enable them as flaps too, that\u0027ll add a bit of lift. For a subsonic plane you likely want to angle the wings up a bit as well (lengthwise, so they have a positive AoA when you\u0027re sitting on the runway)."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T01:09:28Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027Paul\\_Sawyer\u0027]  \n\nIt looks pretty much like the real ones and the derivatives are all green.
