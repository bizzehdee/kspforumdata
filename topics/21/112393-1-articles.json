I spend quite some time on getting it right, especially the nose was rather difficult, but I think I did a pretty good job.\n\nThe craft can carry six Kerbals (two pilots in the cockpit and four passengers in the rear bay), land and take off both vertically and horizontally and has a functioning cargo bay ramp.\n\n[Link be here](http://www./download/r71k8kkbyma6bry/Skyranger.craft)\n\nThe all parts are stock and while I did a little bit of part clipping (Merging three engines for the VTOL each and putting the passenger bay into the (largely empty) hull element) These things are purely for aesthetic purposes and could easily be solved differently.\n\nSince the cockpit is tilted forwards I would recomend to steer this thing from the probe hidden in the center of the craft. VTOL Performance is very good, but I sadly could not make this go hypersonic like the original due to the heavy drag of the many cosmetic lift surfaces. In forward flight it also has slight nose up or down tendencies depending on mood. Those get countered by SAS though.\n\n![p2ubaU1.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/p2ubaU1.png?1)\n\n![KoQKzCj.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/KoQKzCj.png?1)\n\n![tC8F3Xp.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/tC8F3Xp.png?1)\n\nYes, that ramp does actually work. You can walk it up and enter by pressing (![\u0026)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) when you are at the top. When disembarking the Kerbal will lose grip to the door, do a flip and land on the ramp standing.

It is for all intends and purposes just a glorified box with wings on it.\n\nI would also have to figure where to put the VTOL thrusters (since the original deign doesn\u0027t seem to have them, despite supposedly being VTOL capable) and the entry ramp is almost impossible to get down like that in stock.\n\nI will put some thought in it and maybe throw something together, but I can\u0027t promise anything.\n\nThe new Skyranger from XCOM 2 on the other hand might be more interesting.\n\nBut first things first, getting this build back working is my first priority.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-10T03:14:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2016 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Hellothere!**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hellothere!","CreatedById":111486,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T00:30:26Z","Content":"Okay, this took a lot longer than originally intended, but I finally finished the alterations.
