It used to be damn near impossible with stock parts because of the sheer size of things involved and how comparatively weak stock parts were in terms of their size, but with the new stock boosters and engines you might be able to get something up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, the key is balance, and struts, and power... so, everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want the balance so it\\\u0027s less likely to tip over. Being within .1 or .2 weight units should allow it to fly straight; ASAS and regular SAS units should be able to handle the difference. Struts to tie it together, set them up so they will disconnect/disappear when you detach the last stage. Tie it down to your first/second stage rockets (not the boosters though, you want the struts to last until at least 50km) so there\\\u0027s less wobble. Bring it out to the launchpad without and struts and see where it\\\u0027s limp - tie those bits to the center fuselage in a complementary fashion to the rest of the structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower... well, you want to go fast. This .16 iteration of the KLOSS IV was altered a fair bit as I had a \u0027useless\u0027 fuel tank from Kosmos that used LH2 and never got used. I replaced that with the Muon detector, and thus the weight of the entire thing changed and I basically had to rebuild it from scratch and it looks very different from my .15.2 version. I was having trouble with it tipping over around 15km, so I tied it together more, threw a bunch of massive SAS modules on... nothing helped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then changed the staging so the center rocket fired along with all the outside ones (it was meant to be it\\\u0027s own stage originally), and the additional vertical thrust basically stabilized the whole thing and I didn\\\u0027t need the additional SAS units at all. So, yeah, high acceleration can help as long as it\\\u0027s balanced because I guess the velocity doesn\\\u0027t give the thing the time nor space to wobble and start the tilt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope those tips help a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radzaarty","CreatedById":26678,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T12:56:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem I had was it was three stages, and on the launchpad it weighed just shy of 1200tonnes.
