Pro-Chute is a range of launch vehicles that can help expert operators lift their payloads into orbit and return the primary tank with rocket cluster safely back to Kerbin for recovery.

The main stage without fuel, which is recoverable, is worth about half the price of the entire lifter. You just need to get it back to a flat area for landing and let the parachutes take care of the rest. The good news is there is more than enough fuel left over in their payload rating to make a very aggressive de-orbit burn for maximum accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA decent pilot will get to orbit, stage their payload and re-enter into the lowlands west of KSC for a high recovery value.

I\u0027ve decided these lifters need batteries and reaction wheels to get more accuracy in landing so, the tech tree requirements for this series has been updated. Refer to the revise tech tree image in the OP. I think the tech requirement trade-off is worth it considering I\u0027m employing these regularly even with a maxed out tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also undertaken a new battery of survivability and reliability tests which has resulted in some fine tuning of the parachute position to ensure they always land within a few degrees of level and the short girders are enough to take the weight of the main stage for full recovery. I\u0027m getting a failure rate on landing at less than 5% so, they\u0027re pretty robust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
