With abstract command structure and past which could be described on the sinus graph. Although it runs since 0.20 generation every building in space center is new. Most of time there are sounds of explosions, in the rest - humming of fire and sound of emergency sirens. \n\nThe only upsides are the vehicles. While other places have jets or rockets we have... **dragons!**\n\n![8Gnimgx.png](http://i.imgur.com/8Gnimgx.png)\n\n![BFKM9kj.png](http://i.imgur.com/BFKM9kj.png)\n\n![uC0Mc4I.png](http://i.imgur.com/uC0Mc4I.png)\n\n![zxj4CaC.png](http://i.imgur.com/zxj4CaC.png)\n\nModel \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEDraco Nobilis I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEIt\u0027s hard to kill a dragon, but you have to strive hard\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2*\n\n*Benedict Chmielowski*\n\n![vzaSkyX.png](http://i.imgur.com/vzaSkyX.png)\n![znB5SUT.png](http://i.imgur.com/znB5SUT.png)\n\n![0V2RMmr.png](http://i.imgur.com/0V2RMmr.png)\n\n![3PPnvVl.png](http://i.imgur.com/3PPnvVl.png)\n\nExtremely rare VTOL used mostly for representational purposes, but could be also be practical while it comes to some the rescue missions.\n\nAlthough its fancy design machine is pretty stable, but not too fast, so it can be used to take up safe astronauts from hard to reach landing zones, rather than tasks where time is matter. \n\n![H5bnzLK.png](http://i.imgur.com/H5bnzLK.png)\n![OHWg4AY.png](http://i.imgur.com/OHWg4AY.png)\n\n![wMmUqb7.png](http://i.imgur.com/wMmUqb7.png)\n\n![fOZMuC7.png](http://i.imgur.com/fOZMuC7.png)\n\n![u3U2slu.png](http://i.imgur.com/u3U2slu.png)\n\n*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEIt\u0027s a metaphor of human bloody existence, a dragon.

Prattchett*\n\nEngineers which assembled this beast were surprised about tests in a wind tunnel - it works very well with new 1.0.2 procedures.\n\nBecause of high cost of materials needed to keep Draco together - broken wings, twisted tail, moving scales-brakes - every existing craft are under very careful service. \n\n![8edfsrH.png](http://i.imgur.com/8edfsrH.png)\n![eNErYgr.png](http://i.imgur.com/eNErYgr.png)\n\n![19xQWbu.png](http://i.imgur.com/19xQWbu.png)\n\n![FG7qvui.png](http://i.imgur.com/FG7qvui.png)\n\n![62C1Xmt.png](http://i.imgur.com/62C1Xmt.png)\n\n*\u0022They aren\u0027t aerodynamic, they couldn\u0027t fly with these wings\u0022*\n\n*Common skeptic*\n\nMain cons of this airship which will be analyzed in future prototypes are very weak brakes of landing gear, low flying speed and some problems about balance, but they are mostly recompensed with a picture of the ... well, dragon, parked near common limousines, helicopters and jets of other corporations at Consortium Conferences (some ED CEOs think this project is silly and use newer helicopter. They\u0027ll be fired soon).\n\n![7TDxAyc.png](http://i.imgur.com/7TDxAyc.png)\n![Eyk1eUN.png](http://i.imgur.com/Eyk1eUN.png)\n\n*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEFus-roh-dah!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2*\n\n*Typical Dragon-Born seeing dragon in Skyrim*\n\nDespite the status of Draco Nobilis there are a few of them on used vehicles market, but be careful, we assume no responsibility for engine settings, they should be checked individually before every start and CoM may change it\u0027s position during a flight. If plane becomes restive it is recommended to do an emergency landing like a normal plane.\n\n![6GcvNpI.png](http://i.imgur.com/6GcvNpI.png)\n![nbEYRXS.png](http://i.imgur.com/nbEYRXS.png)\n\n![7OAhqZS.png](http://i.imgur.com/7OAhqZS.png)\n\n![krtI6Lf.png](http://i.imgur.com/krtI6Lf.png)\n\n*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEI Admire its Purity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2*\n\n*Ash about the dragon on Nostromo*\n\n[DOWNLOAD](http://kerbalx.com/Drangir/Draco-Nobilis-I)\n![Bx1kTn8.png](http://i.imgur.com/Bx1kTn8.png)\n\n![Ed8BDCH.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ed8BDCH.png)\n\n*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEIt\u0027s not a dragon, it\u0027s a wyvern\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2*\n\n*Typical nerd-neophyte seeing dragon in Skyrim*\n\n![GR8IXIP.png](http://i.imgur.com/GR8IXIP.png)\n\nUsed mod: Tweakscale.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T21:16:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Drangir**"},{"CreatedByName":"nfpinto","CreatedById":143049,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T22:43:17Z","Content":"wow, beautiful!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T23:17:13Z","Content":"![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif)\n\nDamn.

Very creative use of tweak-scale and stock parts.
