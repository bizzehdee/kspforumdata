You see, Bill found this old 4x4 pickup in Jeb\u0027s junkyard and decided to fix it up. Him and Bob have been working on it a little at a time between rocket tests and space exploration. They both find working on this old simple truck relaxing after a long days work. They finally got the old gal fixed up and running like a clock. Little do they know, Jeb also has been tinkering on it when the two of them were not looking... Who knows what mischief Jeb has planned for these two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you see Bill and Bob, parked out front of the astronaut center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/utilitytruck1_zpse040314e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022utilitytruck1_zpse040314e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose two have no idea what is in store for them.

It uses a combination of RoverMax model M1 for driving and Small Gear Bay for added durability on rough terrain. It has a lot of SAS control allowing it to turn fairly hard at up to 19m/s as well as making it easier to right the truck if/when it flips over. The truck is quite durable. It can take a fair amount of a beating before breaking, but it is not indestructible... On it\u0027s own wheel power, it is capable of topping out at 21m/s. But, when you kick on the little Rockomax 48-7S it can push the truck to speeds over 61m/s. Be warned though, at speeds over 50m/s, it becomes hard to control and can blow out the RoverMax tires. The Rockomax 48-7S has another use though. If the truck tips over onto its roof, it is hard to right it again, even with the excessive SAS control. Using the rocket engine to push the truck onto its hood makes it far easier to right the truck again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etotal part count = 263(clean version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eweight = 11.5 tons(kinda heavy....)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etop speed = 21/61(tires/rocket)m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecrew capacity = 2(easily modified)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erange = nearly unlimited(limited rocket fuel, nearly unlimited electric)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edownload = \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/6vpk5ruocmcz4iv/Utility_Truck.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUtility Truck.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis truck is just for fun.

If you add Canards to the front and back of the truck, the truck is able to accelerate to speeds of at least 40 m/s, without using the rocket engine. All you have to do is attach front and rear Canards to the truck, and simply drive forwards. Normally, the truck runs out of steam at about 21m/s. But with the canards, it keeps accelerating to speeds over 40m/s, although it becomes nearly impossibly to control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe center wings are not needed for the glitch, but it is funny to simply drive the truck until it\u0027s moving fast enough to actually lift off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/truckkenardglitch_zps4e417063.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022truckkenardglitch_zps4e417063.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else seen this glitch before?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-02T04:12:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2015 04:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T07:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a glitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather think it\u0027s because the wings take (some of) the weight off the truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess weight results in less resistance on the wheels, hence a higher speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T10:45:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022T-Bouw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022T-Bouw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a glitch.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather think it\u0027s because the wings take (some of) the weight off the truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess weight results in less resistance on the wheels, hence a higher speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, it\u0027s an infiniglider.

It\u0027s the infiniglide bug. Also the rover wheels don\u0027t have traction per se, as the wheels in KSP behave like small electric rockets so there\u0027s no actual torque or traction budget. It is why they can\u0027t be driven uphill without rockets or a lot of momentum. You can test this by trying to drive up the side of the launchpad from a full stop. You\u0027ll also notice that mass doesn\u0027t really affect top speed or acceleration.
