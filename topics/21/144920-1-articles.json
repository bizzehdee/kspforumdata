Recently I\u0027ve found myself trying to make spacecraft in KSP as futuristic looking as possible and have been using lots of different sources to give myself some ideas (Halo, Titanfall, Destiny\u00A0etc.) I\u0027ve been a huge fan of Star Citizen for a while and decided to see if anyone had built a realistic replica of the F7A Hornet into KSP. I found a few pictures of things that definitely resembled the spacecraft but none of them really quite got it. So I decided to go all out and try to build a (kinda\u0027)\u00A0functioning replica of the F7A Hornet for myself and here are the results:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/VNsyg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/VNsyg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is only one downside to this thing. Becuase I was focusing just on aesthetics, it is unable to fly with the amount of fuel it carries. As such, you will have to use the good ol\u0027 debug menu to turn on infinite fuel. Nonetheless, it is still fun to mess around with.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft File:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/b5oqafc0te2q6k8/F7A%20Hornet.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/b5oqafc0te2q6k8/F7A Hornet.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRequired Mods List:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Tweak Scale\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- B9 Aerospace (including B9 Legacy and B9 HX)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Bahamuto Dynamics Armory (BDArmory)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-30T22:59:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2016 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AWESOMEPIEMAN\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-03T14:15:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a go making this fly without IF and maybe just stock parts?

The hornet is a pretty small air/spacecraft from the year 2946, it\u0027s just not possible to make a craft in KSP that looks the same and has at least enough Delta-V to make it into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrust me, I won\u0027t get discouraged. I have a lot of fun making other aircraft/spacecraft that CAN fly and still look super cool in the process. I may post some more in the future. Cheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
