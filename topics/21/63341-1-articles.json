KSA\u0027s insatiable demand for efficient engines was driving the price of this beloved food additive through the roof. The Intermediate Caravan powers it\u0027s 20 ion engines using much less tasty uranium instead. With over 12 km/s of delta-V unladen, it is easily capable of reaching any planet in the Kerbol system and returning (make sure to bring enough snacks for the crew!). Additionally, at just over 40 tons, the Intermediate Caravan is far lighter than nuclear thermal alternatives--finally, a use for those light launchers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownload: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(a modified version using only stock and NFP parts.
