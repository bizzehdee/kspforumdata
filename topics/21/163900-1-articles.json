I started work first on the Lunar Module, as I thought it would be the hardest thing to build. Indeed it was, and it took me quite a while to get it working right with the custom legs and whatnot. It came out looking pretty good (imho) though!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Lna6zJo.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/Lna6zJo.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally finished with that vehicle, I started work on the Apollo CSM and S-IVB.

I also need to modify that bottom bit of the fairing that\u0027s on the engine\u00A0bell as it currently interferes with the engine firing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I have a bare-bones starter for the\u00A0S-II stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wjoNGNF.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/wjoNGNF.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made the basic structural tube\u00A0for the S-IC stage, but \u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027ve kind of lost the drive I once had\u00A0to finish the thing,\u00A0no doubt due to my ADHD which has in the past made it hard for me to finish many work-intensive projects. However, I don\u0027t want this work to go to waste. Would anyone else be interested in continuing\u00A0the project?\u003C/strong\u003E I don\u0027t recommend this for anyone afraid of lag because just the portion from the S-IVB up totals\u00A0454 parts, and probably when everything is put together it will be 1k.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIf you are interested, please PM me!\u003C/strong\u003E We can discuss... things... and I can share the craft files and help and... stuff...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways I\u0027d love to be able to eventually release this as a joint project!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0Heck, redo significant parts of it if you think you can do a better job!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just feel like my lander is crying every time I scroll past it because it can\u0027t go to the Mun (Moon?) where it feels best at home. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScale is 5/6ths. Yes I know it\u0027s a strange number, but I started using it as my standard after I made my first replica, an\u00A0Airbus A-380, and it just so happened to be 5/6ths scale, even though I hadn\u0027t started work on it with that in mind. I want my replicas to have accurate scale relative to each-other, and it would have been a PITA to rebuild the 450 or so part A-380, so that\u0027s why they\u0027ve all got that oddball scale now\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* This \u0022ish\u0022 comes from the fact that I have edited the craft files to some degree to put more fuel into some fuel tanks, eliminate the capacity on others, increase/decrease thrust for some engines, not because I couldn\u0027t make the thing work with default part settings, but simply because I want to reduce the number of parts used. As it stands it\u0027s probably going to be about 1k finished, I don\u0027t want it to be 1.5k because of using a lot of fuel tanks and clipped engines (there aren\u0027t any engines big enough and with enough thrust to match the massive F-1s, even at somewhat reduced scale). Despite these edits the craft will be fully loadable in any stock game (well, assuming your computer can handle it) and will fly the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-31T01:23:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2017 01:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by EpicSpaceTroll139\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bubbadevlin","CreatedById":136524,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-31T05:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI totally understand you loss of interest lol..
