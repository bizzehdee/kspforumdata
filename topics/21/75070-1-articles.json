She was later refitted as a hospital ship and made voyages to Greece where she picked up wounded soldiers and took them back to England. As she was built after the Titanic sank there were improvements made to the ships safety systems, some of her water tight compartments were divided and some were extended, as a result she could stay afloat with six of her compartments flooded compared to Titanic\u0027s four. She also had improved lifeboat capacity, she had more than enough lifeboats to carry all on board the ship in case she foundered. Sadly, on 21st November 1916, she struck a mine in the kea channel, resulting in here water tight doors buckling and water spilled into the ship, as the ship listed to starboard side the open portholes on E-deck were submerged and water leaked into the ship even faster, she was now doomed, the ship eventually rolled onto it\u0027s side and her funnels collapsed before she disappeared into the sea. Only 33 people were killed when the ship sank and it\u0027s wreck is in remarkably good condition in comparison to Titanic\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-16T16:11:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2014 04:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Megalodon 720\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Fleet Master","CreatedById":78352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T23:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Remarkably good condition\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131027142000/titanic/images/c/c2/Wreck_of_Britannic_2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Wreck_of_Britannic_2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all seriousness I\u0027m waiting for this, I love it!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Megalodon 720","CreatedById":108146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T00:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I won\u0027t be able to paint it.
