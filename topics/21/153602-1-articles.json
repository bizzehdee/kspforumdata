I am trying to complete the surveys, but every craft that I have designed (and a few I even downloaded) just wont make it. I have completed the 1st 3 tiers of research, and 3 of the 4th tier (the tier that requires 45 Sci Points each). I can get into space and orbit no problem, but I just can\u0027t build anything with what I have to fly over kerbin, the rockets keep spinning and are insane to try to maneuver in the direction I need to go, no matter what combinations I try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 I also tried the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and built some basic planes, but that was a joke.....haha..(I think Jeb\u0027s still mad at me for dying so many times!)\u00A0I downloaded the excellent Hummingbird Surveyor from KerbalX, but that is for low flights only, and I had issues keeping it up (More practice I know..)\u00A0I need a ship that can get to 18,000\u002B accross a decent distance for the surveys.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I haven\u0027t played KSP for almost a year, but when I did I had flown to MUN, Minmus and Duna, so I know the game well.
