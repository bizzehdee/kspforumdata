For example i ditched one of the Engines used for the initial ascend as soon as i was in orbit, but kept the full fuel tanks, and just used the slightly more efficient lander engines for interplanetary travel. As soon as these tanks were empty, i got rid of them. It is hard to see in the images, but basically i used a normal asparagus staging for the middle stages. As soon as the last to \u0022siderows\u0022 of tanks was empty, i decoupled them together with the eninge underneat the central fuel stack, and just kept the tanks to \u0022pull\u0022 them with the lander. Later i separated these as well. I also had to rely heavily on aerobraking at Duna and back on Kerbin.
