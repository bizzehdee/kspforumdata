Surprisingly easy to fly.\n\nFly with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on- it flies and drives like a drunken brick, no different from the 0.90 version. Slightly less ugly.\n\nIt has some... unique aerodynamics due to the use of flaps as panels. To land it, simply let it flip out of control until it hits about 15m/s and fairly low, then use stability control to make it point prograde and try to land it.\n\n[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/home?preview=Reliant\u002BRobin\u002BShuttle2.craft)\n\n![bkM7Bkt.png](http://i.imgur.com/bkM7Bkt.png)\n\n![pjSp804.png](http://i.imgur.com/pjSp804.png)\n\n![9FVsJ4i.png](http://i.imgur.com/9FVsJ4i.png)\n\n![UTnt8iY.png](http://i.imgur.com/UTnt8iY.png)\n\n![62u1N5f.png](http://i.imgur.com/62u1N5f.png)\n\n![7ogIc7l.png](http://i.imgur.com/7ogIc7l.png)\n\n![e7qNZZI.png](http://i.imgur.com/e7qNZZI.png)\n\n![02qOwSE.png](http://i.imgur.com/02qOwSE.png)\n\nold 0.90 version\n\nFly with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on. (duh)\n\nAlso, the rapier does not need to be active at all time- I recommend that you switch it off after G-turn.\n\nYes, it does fly (and separate, unlike the original) but it flies like a drunken brick......Oh, and no hidden control surfaces there, I promise!\n\nDownload [https://www.dropbox.com/s/taxgf40ggd2zgjs/Reliant%20Robin%20Shuttle.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/taxgf40ggd2zgjs/Reliant%20Robin%20Shuttle.craft?dl=0)\n\nPICS:\n\n[![screenshot18749_zps9nuopblr.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot18749_zps9nuopblr.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot18749_zps9nuopblr.png.html)\n\n[![screenshot18767_zpsgj21se6q.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot18767_zpsgj21se6q.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot18767_zpsgj21se6q.png.html)\n\n[![screenshot18774_zpsjaqeaqhl.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot18774_zpsjaqeaqhl.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot18774_zpsjaqeaqhl.png.html)\n\n[![screenshot18778_zpsthelpel5.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot18778_zpsthelpel5.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot18778_zpsthelpel5.png.html)\n\n[![screenshot18872_zpsvah1jhj0.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot18872_zpsvah1jhj0.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot18872_zpsvah1jhj0.png.html)\n\n[![screenshot18878_zpsvoebr90w.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot18878_zpsvoebr90w.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot18878_zpsvoebr90w.png.html)\n\n(despite the last pic, the Robin is landable.)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-16T13:43:54Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2017 01:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Yukon0009**"},{"CreatedByName":"KotDemopan","CreatedById":98561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T04:55:23Z","Content":"Heh, classic. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCould use some lights though."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T05:46:06Z","Content":"That thing has a lot of LV-909\u0027s on it... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T06:07:23Z","Content":"[http://youtu.be/miPCcpzRaPE?t=37s](https://youtu.be/miPCcpzRaPE?t=37s)\n\n\u0022Seperate!\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T06:30:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That thing has a lot of LV-909\u0027s on it... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIt was supposed to be a Poodle, but it didn\u0027t have enough TWR to keep going after that."},{"CreatedByName":"Shaun","CreatedById":66344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T08:06:16Z","Content":"Haha Top Gear memories"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T08:58:15Z","Content":"Part clipping game is strong.\n\nAwesome craft ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gue__1","CreatedById":97916,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T11:20:18Z","Content":"Very original and 100% Kerbal!
