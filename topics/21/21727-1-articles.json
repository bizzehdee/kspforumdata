but something about it made me wanna try it,, i failed so many times i should tattoo kerbal killer on my arm. but after weeks and weeks i got better learning from my mistakes and others, there\u0027s a Lotta awesome creative ksp\u0027ers out there and so many great parts, mods,plugins etc i know because i have them all literately EVERYTHING! i wanted to contribute some way to the many creations i saw , this one guy built a garage which i thought was freaking great you have to literately download it and look at it in the editor before you can see how great it is because it\u0027s a nut-buster at times to get parts the way you want them, sorry if my spelling is a little off or i miss something while typing nerves in my left hand are destroyed so use of my left hand is limited, now that garage im guessing here- is meant to be a one way ticket once you deploy it on a moon, planet etc it\u0027s a giant paper weight,, well sure you can leave it there and park what ever back into it like a reg garage but that\u0027s it unless you add-on/mod/ ect it, wanted to TRY make something similar but not to replace the garage but add-on to the original idea im pretty sure both can be combined for some cool possibility\u0027s - i haven\u0027t tryed too busy working on SPV35-CARGO ! now while working on her i wanted something that could be used for more then purpose ATM a person can tweak it as they fit for what ever purpose they desire, right now SPV35-CARGO setup to be (Drive in/out Vehicle transporter) load it up with some Vehicle\u0027s launch her to the moon when done drive the Vehicle\u0027s back on the SPV35-CARGO and set off for home!!
