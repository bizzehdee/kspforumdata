As a mild disclaimer this is my first vehicle thread and will likely be updated often as I get more savvy in my presentation style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As referenced in my corporate thread, the principle design parameter of the Pathfinder is versatility and safety. Each vehicle has been thoroughly tested at every stage as well as under many contingencies. Each craft is designed to allow for rescue docking, multi-stage docking, orbital assembly, and transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part counts are higher than I\u0027d like with the 250 count being the upper end for launch, but they all quickly drop away as the mission gets under way. Without further delay, I present the initial line of the Pathfinder Mission Series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft link will take you to one of the lighter crafts of the series and the earliest new design, the Pathfinder Microlander. It has a tighter fuel budget than others in the series but carries more than enough to go from Kerbin to the Munar surface and back to Kerbin. It was largely my prototype for designing in the .21 environment as as such is the least modular of the entire line. What you see here is pretty much what you get- a small effective mission vehicle. It carries its return fuel sequestered in tanks along the main axis to preserve it for pumping prior to return ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://sphotos-a-atl.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/559997_10100444126314306_272171882_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022559997_10100444126314306_272171882_n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8H23P7FAtL4d3pKb2VBdXlsbjg/edit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8H23P7FAtL4d3pKb2VBdXlsbjg/edit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/d0kty78wj2yesjq/IA%20Pathfinder%20Microlander%20Stock.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/d0kty78wj2yesjq/IA%20Pathfinder%20Microlander%20Stock.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up is the larger 3-Kerbal craft, the Pathfinder Explorer. It uses a larger core and transfer stage to give it a wider array of mission profiles within the Kerbin system. It is equipped with a host of docking port sizes to accommodate specialized mission needs as well as emergency roles. It proved to be a highly successful design capable of Duna transfer and landing along with return to Duna orbit. With the right teasing of fuel and creative use of Ike it might allow for a return trip but my Duna testing led me to the craft design that follows this one. Before I get too far ahead of myself however here is the link to the Pathfinder Explorer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://sphotos-a-atl.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/3670_10100444126234466_1025946505_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223670_10100444126234466_1025946505_n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1004485_10100444126219496_1078619608_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221004485_10100444126219496_1078619608_n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8H23P7FAtL4ZFhBaGdJaEhMelE/edit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8H23P7FAtL4ZFhBaGdJaEhMelE/edit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/rdwcc9p4orutnaf/IA%20Pathfinder%20Explorer%20Stock.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rdwcc9p4orutnaf/IA%20Pathfinder%20Explorer%20Stock.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding upon the success of the Pathfinder Explorer I iterated the design into the MR or Medium Range variant. This vehicle is replaces the previous design\u0027s transfer stage decoupler with a large docking port. The successful intent was to utilize an Apollo style mission portfolio system to allow for mission module descent and later re-docking for return to Kerbin. This vehicle is capable of Duna and Eve return (Although the lander shouldn\u0027t be capable of Eve escape I haven\u0027t tested so who knows), possibly Dres. The Explorer MR will get your Kerbals where they need to go and provide you with options to adapt to any unforeseen mission complication. Finally, like the previous vehicles it carries 2 sets of parachutes: a set for mission use and a set for Kerbin re-entry. This also provides redundancy for a trip to the Mun or Minmus and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/547693_10100444126279376_515583545_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022547693_10100444126279376_515583545_n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8H23P7FAtL4ZnpfSGppc1Q5eHM/edit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8H23P7FAtL4ZnpfSGppc1Q5eHM/edit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wbfhrmfnrc0cwk/IA%20Pathfinder%20Explorer%20MR%20Stock.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/5wbfhrmfnrc0cwk/IA%20Pathfinder%20Explorer%20MR%20Stock.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my next vehicle in the series, I present the Pathfinder Habitat module. It uses the same basic design platform of the Explorer MR to give it a wide deployment profile. It further has the capacity to act as an emergency return vehicle though the margins are tighter than would be provided by an Explorer module. Its main mission is to deliver Kerbonauts a safe, cozy place to live. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8H23P7FAtL4UU5kMEEydVYzcjQ/edit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8H23P7FAtL4UU5kMEEydVYzcjQ/edit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ove30j3zwltp1l/IA%20Pathfinder%20Habitat%20Stock.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/1ove30j3zwltp1l/IA%20Pathfinder%20Habitat%20Stock.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional designs are to follow within the Pathfinder series as time allows for further refinement and development. As an aside all mission modules starting with the Explorer are capable of linking to form elements of a space station. In such a roll the primary ascent/descent engines are very much up to the task of functioning as tugs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will add screenshots and artwork, and more editing to this thread as time permits.
