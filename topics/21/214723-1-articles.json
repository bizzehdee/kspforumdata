His rockets/planes/stations were very capable and easy to use. Sadly, as of December 20th 2022, his crafts are no longer available. He was a great helper for many people, including me, who has not found\u00A0 an archive for his crafts.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is where we come in. Together, we can create something similar to Raptor9\u0027s massive catalouge.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe requirements are:\u003Cbr\u003E\nKronal Vessel Viewer (KVV) is required to submit crafts. This mod allows you to take blueprint-like screenshots of your rockets while in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRockets must be tested to confirm that they can complete their specified missions without regilar interruption or failure.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPart mods are allowed, but not recommended. The only one I will use is ReStock\u002B.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you do decide to use part mods, please look if the parts are somewhat stock or restock-like. Non-stocklike parts are still allowed, but not recommended at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrafts by me will be coming to this post shortly after being posted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T06:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Spacecraft Exchange\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stefsilver","CreatedById":181078,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-08T04:45:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vCbo0z2.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022102.00\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vCbo0z2.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
