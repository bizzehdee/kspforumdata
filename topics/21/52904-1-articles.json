Pitching down will allow you to move forwards or speed you up. Pitching up will allow you to move backwards or slow you down.

Yeah, I once experimented with trying to balance the fuel to try eliminating the tilting issues. Due to some of the newer features introduced in 0.21 and 0.22, it\u0027s a bit more feasible now (provided you use SAS\u0027 reaction wheels). While it is still prone to tilting due to fuel imbalance, the new SAS system helps a bit in that regard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually didn\u0027t start experimenting with designing such a thing again till I was working on a way to deliver rovers without tilting over the rocket earlier (though I actually accomplished that once in 0.21 or 0.20 somewhere).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
