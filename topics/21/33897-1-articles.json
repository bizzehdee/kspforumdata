Only thing is that it would require RCS blocks on the payload as well. Just launch one of those on your next resupply to your space station or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScottyDoesKnow","CreatedById":70796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T03:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EColonel_Panic has an awesome worker in this thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/34402-O-A-S-I-S-Stardock-and-launch-systems-picture-heavy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/34402-O-A-S-I-S-Stardock-and-launch-systems-picture-heavy\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has long beams that go down the sides of the payload with RCS jets on them. Otherwise you\u0027ll probably need RCS jets on the payload somewhere if it\u0027s large. This adds to part count which you really gotta keep down for a space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a picture of my worker, pretty standard I think. Large docking port on the top, regular on the bottom (I use large more). Nuclear engines for efficiency, lights for docking in the dark, ASAS, big RCS tank. The big RCS tank is probably overkill, but I decided to not add RCS to my payloads to keep part count down and just use mechjeb for the big stuff, which is very inefficient on RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ctYUYsO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ctYUYsO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"londarty","CreatedById":45980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T04:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI managed to create a small probe.
