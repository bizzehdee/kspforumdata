After all, I already had the Heinlein to perform the VSSTO duty, right? But the more time I spent on it, the more in love I fell with its simplicity and looks... and now? Well, somehow it has managed to earn a place on my first interplanetary stack, and an honourable one at that: primary crew lander for Moho (check the album for a pretty cool pic of the stack breaking orbit). And copies of it are planned to pretty much take over every job the Heinlein had, plus small satellite delivery, and general purpose shuttling. A true workhorse, and awesome-looking to boot!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W3oW8In.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W3oW8In.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the key to its versatility is its main difference with the Heinlein: it has a payload bay! That capsule was really killing that design, because this is lighter, has less thrust, carries one more kerbal if configured to do so (like it is in the file), and if you don\u0027t need crew, you can always chuck out the crew module and put up to 2.5mT of payload there and still make orbit. Or exchange modules once on orbit! And due to the relatively small launch mass (~50mT), it is a handy chemical lander to take around the kerbin system. Heck, it can handle Tylo if you have a refueling post there...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, you can\u0027t really work miracles, and it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E rather small (50 parts!), so really, it is SSTO, but only \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E, and only if you don\u0027t ever, under any circumstance, try to lift more than 2.5mT form Kerbin. Even a perfect launch profile will leave you fumes to perform deorbit/rendezvous. But that is something that it shares with the Heinlein, and if you are not the best pilot out there, or plain lazy, the low TWR at liftoff means a couple of SRB will increase the dV enormously, on account of lower gravity losses. Of course, almost anywhere else, the 4km/s in the tanks will be more than enough, even with larger payloads, but that is another thing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, it really is a \u0027\u0022T\u0022,\u0022Z\u0022,\u0022SPACE!\u0022\u0027 kind of ship, with almost no action groups and no staging events, so really the user manual is basically \u0022do a perfect gravity turn\u0022, so not much to tell you guys about how to fly it... just that the reentry is very easy and stable if you do it with the airbrakes out. Oh, I almost forgot, if you plan on maneuvering during reentry, you want to disable the winglets as control surfaces and enable the airbrakes, in order for them to work the right way on reentry when you are going bottom-first. Squad apparently hasn\u0027t figured out yet how to make control surfaces work when placed backwards... Other than that, it \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E survive an unpowered landing, no need to save fuel for the last second. That\u0027s why I spent to much time thinking about the fuel routing and such, so you don\u0027t have to pay attention to anything but the navball and the \u0022time to apoapsis\u0022 reading during ascent. Oh, and it also floats on water without tipping over... that was totally unintentional, but it is very awesome: water landings on Laythe are nothing to be afraid of! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mcerhob.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Mcerhob.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/39iQT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

It serves little purpose, but hey, no monoprop production needed! Besides, Vernors are cool. The downside is that you can actually run out of RCS with the main engines, the flip side is that whatever fuel you don\u0027t use is all RCS, so you don\u0027t need to balance it out and you never carry excess monoprop.

Judging by the pics, you seem to have an odd number of spikes (9) mounted on separate tanks like I did, and I think that is the source of your problems. If you check out the routing in the LackLuster, you will see that fuel is first pumped to two of the engines, then from those to the other two, keeping things nice and symmetrical and the CoM firmly in the longitudinal axis to not create engine torque. With yours, that just can\u0027t happen, since they are an odd number. And indeed, in the inflight pic, you can see that four engines have a certain remaining fuel level, and \u003Cem\u003Efive\u003C/em\u003E others a different one. There\u0027s your problem! Now let\u0027s fix it: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could instead pump to a central distribution tank inside the lower tank, and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E to the rest of the engines, symmetrically. An alternative is to put an even number of engines and mimic the way I did it, first to two of them, then to the rest in symmetrical order. That way some spikes will shut off before the end of the burn (at which point TWR is mostly irrelevant, and it might help to throttle down). Another option would be to put one of them in the middle without routing, and the other eight with a symmetrical fuel routing, I don\u0027t think the middle engine draining from the top down would be enough to offset the stability-inducing drain of the others (form the bottom up), and in fact the CoM might wander less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that the LackLuster is only stable on the way down because of the airbrakes, if yours becomes stable ass-first while it is still inside dense atmosphere, you will have flipping issues. On the Heinlein I just struck a fortuitous config that made it become stable the other way around only by the very end of the climb to orbit, when the front upper tank finally empties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

Which means I have an average of one rep per post, more or less. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to all of you guys, I\u0027m really glad you like my stuff so much!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
