I think I\\\u0027ll also change the rules around to try and allow more options; perhaps these changes...\n\n- Instead of having to choose a base beforehand, just book a flight slot. This slot allows you one launch, use as you see fit.\n\n- Land no more than 1-2 controllable craft at any base per turn, but if your single launch that turn can drop rovers at every existing base go for it. Feel free to leave crew wandering on the surface too (since EVAs will be coming in 0.16)\n\n- Mods used shouldn\\\u0027t need any files aside from the persistent.sfs files to be handed off to the next player (No Space Dock mod or other similar ones.)\n\n- Creating new land bases will be allowed only if every existing base on that planet/moon has been landed at by at least 4 players. If multiple bases are full enough to create new ones, you can only create one new one per turn.\n\n- Space stations are allowed, if \u0026 when docking ends up being included. They\\\u0027ll count as a new base so only one per turn.\n\nAny other changes that would make sense? I wanted to avoid the space dock like mods to keep things simpler for handing off between turns, and to encourage building things that can actually get off the ground on their own.\n\nUpdating the list now. Sorry for missing your request, zekes, I\\\u0027ve put you in the list where you should have been if I hadn\\\u0027t derped.\n\nRedDwarfIV - I don\\\u0027t see a request to launch from you before now, does this mean you want to be put on the list?
