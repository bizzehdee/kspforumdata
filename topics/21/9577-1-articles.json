The idea being to get a small self-reliant capsule of my own design into orbit and back home safely. Introducing the Visigoth SC. I modelled it heavily after Soyuz and Apollo. It can carry extra cargo in heat-resistant boxes attached on the outside, which can be accessed through small air-tight panels on the inside. It is planned to dock with space stations to deliver important supplies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SbIUd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SbIUd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kD9Vd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kD9Vd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not providing a download on the account that this uses a SHITLOAD OF MODS!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exovian","CreatedById":17094,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-15T14:57:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this is going to be in the Spacecraft \u003Cem\u003EExchange\u003C/em\u003E, it needs a download.
