Democracy. Liberty. The folks over at Krumman hold these core principles of our nation close to their hearts throughout the design and construction process of every new fighter. And that is why Krumman produces the best fighters in the world. The F-14 is finely tailored to the needs of the K.S. Navy, built to achieve supreme air superiority and dominate the skies. If this just doesn\u0027t convince you of the necessity to have the F-14 in your fighter lineup, just watch the video below.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZzQ3eBerHfM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nNow, let\u0027s get back to business.\n\n*Inspired by the Grumman F-14 Tomcat*\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nThere are two versions of the Krumman F-14 Tomcat. One has its wings swept forward for maximum maneuverability and excellent handling at low airspeeds. The other has its wings swept backward for high speed performance and stability. (in reality, the maximum speed difference between the two versions is minimal)\n\nParts: 71\n\nMass: 15.2t\n\nCrew: 1-2\n\nHeight: 3.9m\n\nWingspan: 13.1m (wings forward version); \n\nLength: 11.7m\n\nPowerplant(s): 2x J-X4 Whiplash Turbo Ramjet Engines\n\nMaximum SL Speed: Mach 1\n\nMaximum Speed: Mach 3\u002B @18.0 km altitude\n\nOPERATIONAL GUIDE\n\nTakeoff\n\nThe Krumman F-14 Tomcat is stable on the takeoff run, but the pilot must be careful not to rotate too much, or critical rear fuselage components (such as the engines) may impact the ground. A slow rotation, with minimal pitch, is best especially for the wings forward version.\n\nFlight\n\nThe wings forward version is highly maneuverable and capable of astonishing aerobatics. Be careful at higher speeds however, as this supreme flight performance then becomes dangerous in the wrong hands: do not exceed the angle of attack too much or airframe integrity may be compromised. The wings backward version is slightly less maneuverable, but more stable - a trait especially useful at high speeds.\n\nLanding\n\nFor both versions, approach runway at 100 m/s. For the final approach, slow down to no less than 45 m/s in both versions. The airframe is rather sturdy and can handle bounces well, but do remember not to flair too much or the rear fuselage may impact the ground.\n\nLINK\n\n[http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230485-krumman-f-14-tomcat-stock-replica](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230485-krumman-f-14-tomcat-stock-replica)\n\nALBUM\n\nThe appearance of this craft for 1.0.3 has changed:\n\n![l6ekKRI.png](http://i.imgur.com/l6ekKRI.png)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
