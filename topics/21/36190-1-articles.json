It would have been made even more extravagant, and fitted with either a luxury or military load-out, had I not discovered that it\u0027s as structurally sound as wet cardboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was fun to build, but unfortunately impossible to test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery attempt I\u0027ve made at getting the thing to hold together has failed. It just loads on to the runway and immediately tears itself into neat little bits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve unofficially deemed it the \u0022KSS Humpty Dumpty\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pictures.

There is room below deck for a good amount of things as well. The rear end was designed for a smaller boat to fit into, like a life boat or something... You get the idea. Let me know if you want the craft file, as it seems silly to post a broken ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
