I\u0027ve lurked here and made stuff for years, but I\u0027ve finally decided to upload something for you fine folks. This is the \u003Cem\u003EVaria\u003C/em\u003E-class science dropship; Coram Technologies\u0027 workhorse and premier product. Designed as a multi-planetary landing craft, the \u003Cem\u003EVaria\u003C/em\u003E is capable of taking off from the Kerbal Space Center and making orbit with plenty of fuel to spare for orbital maneuvers, such as rendezvous and docking with a mothership. Additionally, when fueled in space, it\u0027s capable of landing on any point on Kerbin, and re-orbiting itself and re-docking with the orbital vessel. It\u0027s certified for usage on the Mun, Minmus, Duna, and Laythe with ease (provided it has a mothership transport it to a stable orbit above), and should be able to easily land and take off from any other moon with similar delta-v requirements. CORTEC does not warrant or guarantee the safety of individuals who wish to use the vessel outside of these parameters, such as on Eve, Tylo, or possibly Vall. Such actions void the warranty of the product and CORTEC waives all liability herein.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, it works just fine with NEAR, though I typically use stock aero due to it being a baseline for the community. In fact, it can reach orbit with NEAR with more spare fuel than it can with stock aero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe uploaded version has an \u003Cem\u003Ealmost\u003C/em\u003E full scientific suite (minus the atmosphere cone thing, because there\u0027s no logical place to put one without clipping it, and I did some VAB acrobatics to ensure that nothing\u0027s clipped too badly in this, including the structural fuselage inside the primary fuel tank that anchors the engine pods).

Over \u003Cstrong\u003E23k\u003C/strong\u003E it is strongly recommended that you engage \u003Cstrong\u003ERCS\u003C/strong\u003E, as the vessel tends to veer when steering inputs are made above that altitude, or drift. The RCS adds sufficient control authority that lets you stay pointed forward (and thus keep the jets going) and is well worth the slight fuel cost.

If you can get this, you\u0027re golden for an ascent with roughly 1/3 the fuel left in your tank once you circularize at 75x75. Anything beyond this is definitely possible, but is just gravy. When you switch over to rockets (either manually by pressing \u003Cstrong\u003E[1]\u003C/strong\u003E to close intakes or automatically via air starvation) switch off RCS, press \u003Cstrong\u003E[1]\u003C/strong\u003E to close all intakes to minimize drag, and pitch up \u003Cstrong\u003E10-15\u003C/strong\u003E degrees beyond your current heading. Gradually nose back down, once your apoapsis hits \u003Cstrong\u003E60k\u003C/strong\u003E until it hits about \u003Cstrong\u003E80k\u003C/strong\u003E, and drift to the apoapsis to circularize. I\u0027ve found tilting up tends to get you through the remainder of the atmosphere quicker and leads to less delta-v loss than a shallower trajectory, but both will get you to orbit just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/37474018347913091/F1A5F2E121DEC4E77FFB0267E23CB8A20D3C2EAE/\u0022 alt=\u0022F1A5F2E121DEC4E77FFB0267E23CB8A20D3C2EAE\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations! You\u0027re in space.

When landing on Kerbin or Duna, a bit of thrust is required near at the moment of touchdown depending on the fuel remaining, moreso on Duna. It is recommended on planets with atmospheres to open up the intakes on descent to take advantage of additional drag. Additionally, on Kerbin or Laythe (other planets if you\u0027re really confident in your ability to re-orbit on whatever fuel you have left), you can forgo a traditional tail-end ballistic re-entry for a nose-in re-entry, using the RCS to keep the craft facing forward until you reach a sufficient altitude to re-engage the jet engines, allowing for some degree of inaccuracy when, say, returning to the Space Center. Just make sure to click on the engines and manually switch them over to airbreathing mode (and to re-open the intakes). It\u0027ll be a bit tricky until the craft is propelled primarily by the engines rather than its own inertia, but it definitely works well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAction Groups:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[1]\u003C/strong\u003E Toggle intakes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[2]\u003C/strong\u003E Toggle engines on and off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[3]\u003C/strong\u003E Toggle ladder\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[4]\u003C/strong\u003E Toggle solar panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a few pictures of it docked to some ships of mine.

First, the comment about T/W in lower atmosphere: while it makes getting to orbit more tedious, there is no need to hit some arbitrary speed number at some arbitrary height. As long as you can get to 20kms to start airhogging, with the airbreathing effective isp, you end up saving weight. Just consider the hover time you could get out of taking one of those RAPIERS out and substituting it with 1.75mT of aviation fuel. But I\u0027ll be the first to admit sometimes you just want to lift off faster, so YMMV. The same, of course, is very much not true for standard rocket engines and their \u0022poor\u0022 isp, there gravity losses matter a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the intakes, yeah, I had a hunch it would be close, but it doesn\u0027t surprise me that you got them right, you can tell at a glance this thing has a lot of work behind. And the common fuel for vernors and main engines... yeah, I could see that, but then again mine made do with the capsule\u0027s 30 monoprop units, and just 4 physics-less, massless, RCS thruster blocks. I have a hunch that is also efficient in weight \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Also, I took oxi out of the main tank to get the atmospheric juice, which makes it even lighter. But being slightly more serious, take into account that those vernors run through fuel \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E fast, and that the way you have them placed, most of the thrust is wasted on forwards-backwards translation, and a significant percentage in other translation axis.

I kind of rely on the forward angle of those on the front to give a slight push when docking, but in general I only need minor amounts of translation thrust when docking (in space,I set fine controls on and set the engine thrust limiters to 10%)--I need moderate amounts in brief bursts for atmospheric flight, so the apparent inefficiency of the design is something that was engineered into it with testing, if that makes any sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do appreciate the input though.

Any deviation of the nose past 15 degrees to either side starves off the RAPIER engines, causing a premature switch over to closed loop mode. Monopropellent isn\u0027t strong enough to compensate. Solveable with wings, but, well, not having them was kind of the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Three engines, while theoretically sufficient, with the current amount of intakes cannot supply enough power in the upper atmosphere before closed loop engages if they\u0027re throttled down to compensate for low amounts of air available. Solvable with more intakes, but there really isn\u0027t a spot to logically add more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second issue would likely be solved by solving the first, because one would be able to gain more velocity pre-changeover if the ship was simply better at loitering up there for long periods. It -is- good with loitering when Vernors are added, for whatever reason, and the fuel cost is really minor, but you suggested getting away from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByWw2AlvFMxQY1lhdy1VdEVLTE0/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E is the in-development version. To be honest, I\u0027d like to make it work, as the Varia kind of hit a sweet spot where any improvements one can make are marginal at best. I\u0027ve actually spent lots of time debating stuff like the aesthetic and \u0027realism\u0027 value of the shielded docking port versus the lighter weight of the regular Clamp-o-Tron among other things, but those are negligible gains at best.. I always love to iterate and actually make it better at its job while remaining somewhat true to its concept, so I was kind of excited at the prospect of a new direction with some outside input. Also, the three-engine version looks \u003Cem\u003Epretty cool.\u003C/em\u003E Feel free to mess around with it and see where it gets you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate ::\u003C/strong\u003E I spent the evening messing around with this, trying everything I could think of outside of restarting from scratch to get it to be stable enough in the upper atmosphere to really take advantage of its theoretically higher exoatmospheric delta-v, but the one time I successfully managed a Kerbin ascent, it still had less delta-v available than the four-engined Varia on a \u003Cem\u003Ebad\u003C/em\u003E ascent. The three engine configuration tends to suffer from quite a bit less stability than its cousin, and the design doesn\u0027t particularly lend itself well to a balanced RCS layout. While Vernors helped on this particular unit, the inability to place them in a configuration that let them really do their work without wasting tons of fuel, as well as the fact that they simply had to do \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E work, didn\u0027t really justify their use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, from the experimentation I have managed to dramatically improve the Vernor layout on the original Varia (No more awkwardly angled thrust due to the shape of the pod, and proper reverse thrusters!), so at least that issue has been solved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/37474018378496744/A9EE9314284995B7EB18E84ABA57B302BD3167F8/\u0022 alt=\u0022A9EE9314284995B7EB18E84ABA57B302BD3167F8\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-28T03:34:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2014 03:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tempestwrath\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T08:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOhhh, now I get it.

And the CoM moves slightly forwards as the flight progresses, too. The hard part is keeping it controlled on reentry without the chutes, actually. See, even though you don\u0027t have an indicator for it, there is also a \u0022Center of Drag\u0022. That \u0022CoD\u0022 basically depends on where the intakes are with respect to the CoM , and it will tend to place itself behind it in respect to the direction of movement. Remember, while most KSP parts have the same drag coefficient and will therefore fall at the same rate, some parts, notably nosecones and intakes, have different drag values (nosecones lower, intakes higher) and therefore create aerodynamic forces within the ship. Which means your design with most of the intakes before the CoM wants to fly backwards, basically. I imagine it is very stable in reentry, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, note how I take more fuel and empty mass (that electric drive system is anything but light), and still use just the three engines, but with a 4-1 intake ratio and with the intakes at the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

I\u0027ve improved the atmospheric performance of the Varia somewhat by using the techniques described there, and greatly reduced the need for Vernors to correct for the yawing. With the Entia, the issue is reduced but still present, but I\u0027m still working on that front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, the Varia has undergone a weight cutting regimen and I\u0027ve managed to reduce its tonnage by a whole ton without sacrificing much (The drogue chute, which was necessary in earlier versions with the much weaker part connections, smaller solar panels, etc). It\u0027s a cleaner, sleeker craft, and due to the tonnage decrease the delta-v has been increased by roughly 50 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe previous Varia (albiet, a version not here, but almost identical to the last posted) had 1655.67 m/s of delta-v with all tanks full and 1738.79 m/s with no fuel in the nacelles--a great trick to squeeze a bit more out in space for a landing. With my weight reduction, it\u0027s gone up to 1695.15 m/s with 1782.48 m/s without any in the outside tanks. It\u0027s a minor increase, but it allows for a bit more slack when doing a Duna landing, for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Entia (the three-engined version of the Varia) in comparison has 1889.83 m/s and 1970.95 m/s respectively--a pretty sizeable increase, but even if I sort out its issues, I\u0027m not sure if its worth it since the higher TWR of the Varia does a fine job of brute-forcing its way through the atmospheric drag before it becomes a delta-v robbing issue; Also, the TWR is simply a bit too low when back-throttling at high altitudes to postpone RAPIER switchover to actually gain any appreciable velocity while not losing altitude. Again, I might have to work on a different flight profile or more tweaking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
