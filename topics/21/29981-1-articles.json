Being the Spacecraft exchange I figure this is the best place to contain/showcase my harebrained ideas, perhaps to inspire and get feedback from the community.

Wade is my mobile \u0022base\u0022 the big guy is the product of my frustration with small, flimsy (efficient) rovers flipping over and crashing at the slightest alteration in the wind. The main difference between 01 and 02 is some communications antenna\u0027s and the addition of some thrusters in the back to improve driving up slopes. Here\u0027s Doodman, Wade 02\u0027s Official Pilot, when he was stranded on Eeloo, a daring rescue by all of you on the forums got his mission back up and running. The return and rescue craft is still on route to rendezvous with Wade 02 and extract Doodman once his mission is complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s22.postimg.org/8smm3bzxd/Save_Dude.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Save_Dude.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWINSTON\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWade now has a little brother who is serving on Eve, Winston. The landing gear on the sides where very helpful absorbing the shock of landing on the high G planet. I am presently in agreement with much of the forum concerning these new wheels, they\u0027re control is a little bit doddgy and tend to jerk when you maneuver. However I think I can attribute this to what I believe is intended to be very high traction. In addition I discovered that you can mount lights \u003Cem\u003Einside\u003C/em\u003E trusses (with a little rotational trickery) and they will still provide all the light they normally would, slims down the design a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s11.postimg.org/c2gh3tlrn/Winstin.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Winstin.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the best features about Winston, the new Cab (which will be implemented in Wade 03), rove around all day from the driver\u0027s seat!
