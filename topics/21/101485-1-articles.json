The result is the SKS-1 Trinity, which is of course very much based on the NASA shuttle. One big difference: I am using liquid fuel boosters instead of SRB because the ones in KSP are not powerful enough. Also: the shifting center of mass makes it necessary to have some degree of throttle control. The parachutes for the boosters are on the exact center of mass after depleting them. If you use stage recovery or flight manager you should be able to recover them.\n\nWhy am I using 3 skipper engines? Well if you take the S3 Kerbodyne cluster which is modelled after the NASA\u0027s SLS, the real world version consists of 4 RS-25 boosters, which are basically shuttle engines. So if you devide the cluster\u0027s thrust by 4, you get a thrust rating of 800 and the closest thing to that is the Skipper with its 650. \n\nFor the OMS I am using Monopropellant engines. Due to the CoM issue they can\u0027t be fired at more then 50-60% throttle unless you want your shuttle to spin around like crazy.\n\n**The gist of it:**\n\nOn Launch: Pitch up to get thrust vector straight, then ride until it tips over (around 11000 meters), throttle down to prevent catastrophe.\n\nAfter booster separation, throttle back up so TWR stays above 1.01\n\nUse OMS (final stage) carefully. Don\u0027t go much over 50% throttle and use RCS to balance your trajectory.\n\nAction groups:\n\n1 - toggle OMS\n\n3 - open cargo bay\n\n5 - decouple cargo\n\nLanding this thing is fairly easy once you get a good approach to the runway. You can see that in the video below.\n\nHere\u0027s the craft file:\n\n[http://www./download/wir7gevo8vea0d9/SKS-1_Trinity.craft](http://www./download/wir7gevo8vea0d9/SKS-1_Trinity.craft)\n\nThe mentioned video:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Y5d5-o_xvY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAnd some pics:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
