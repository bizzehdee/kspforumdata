First, this craft is *very* finicky, you will most likely have to tweak some sepratron values to get it to work.\n2. Launch the craft, and fill the truck with Kerbals. (Might I suggest this great mod: [Take Command](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120740-1-0-2-Take-Command-Launch-Kerbals-in-External-Command-Seats-v1-1-3-May-21-2015))\n3. Hit stage.\n4. Drive to your desired location (Better be somewhere flat).\n5. Stop the truck, then switch to the trailer and hit the parking brakes on that. (If the airbrakes deploy, set brakes to AG1)\n6. Hit AG1 on the trailer, to deploy the stability legs.\n7. Undock the front docking port first, then the back one.\n8. Hit AG2, and the rocket will (hopefully), be vertical, and stable, when the sepratrons burn out. (Sometimes a bit of W or S can help) If it isn\u0027t, then go back to the SPH, and adjust the farthest forward sepratron\u0027s fuel value.\n9. Hit the gears button, the hit AG3 (Maybe twice) to retract the launch gantry landing legs.\n10. Stage, and the launch gantry will retract.\n11. Drive far, far, far away.\n12. Launch the rocket by staging.\n13. ?\n14. ?\n15.
