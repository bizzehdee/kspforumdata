Downside, I still haven\u0027t fully worked out the whole plane building thing. It works, but testy when in flight. Even though originally perfectly symmetrical, it has a tendency to flip forward, partially overcome by adding some additional weight on one end, but also making it unsymmetrical. Flight tends to pull upwards, requiring constant supervision, and fighting. Doesn\u0027t turn great, probably to it\u0027s blocky nature. And I haven\u0027t been able to figure out how to land it without parachute assist. But since crafty kerbals can repack parachutes, that\u0027s just a luxury. Take off requires aft engines, and the 4 VTOL engines (Otherwise that forward flip thing happens again), but take off in the water is possible the same way.

(I think this works, never used Google Drive before.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I obviously need help. Can someone provide some insight on how to get a good VTOL going without needing crazy micro, or explain why perfectly symmetrical designs have a tendency to flip? Or point me in the right direction.
