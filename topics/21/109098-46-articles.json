This is because changing the angle of the wings slightly will provide a lot of longitudinal stability. Imagine viewing the aircraft from the side, orthographically (without perspective). With a slight up or down tilt to the wings, you\u0027ll notice that the lifting area you can see from the side will increase dramatically. This is because as wing surfaces get more vertical, they act more like rudders/vertical stabilizers. In addition to controlling Yaw, the Rudder also passively helps control Roll. Thus, by increasing the dihedral/anhedral, you can also improve roll stability and yaw stability.\n\nOther possibilities:\n\n1) you\u0027ve accidentally loaded fuel in one wing but not the other\n\n2) you\u0027ve done something in the editor that caused the other wing\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E properties to be messed up.\n\n3) the wings are not connected to the fuselage rigidly enough\n\n4) you have a controller plugged into your computer that is providing a constant input that you don\u0027t know about\n\n5) I\u0027m not familiar with KAX anymore, do the props generate torque?\n\n6) the physics engine has glitched and a wing mesh is \u0022colliding\u0022 with some other mesh on your vehicle, causing it to be slightly out of alignment\n\n7) your wings may be slightly out of alignment with the rest of the craft\n\nYou have to remember that in KSP, wings are perfectly symmetrical airfoils that produce no lift at 0^o^ \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Noticeably. If I trim out for level flight and go stick neutral within 2-3 seconds I have winged over to about 45\u00B0 of bank and am pitching downwards in a gradual death spiral. Recovery is easy and without any issue. I used to have red pitch values in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E analysis window and a yellow line heading upwards. The new design fixed both these issues, I have no more red values in any flight regime (60m/s\u002B) and my yellow line goes downwards. But the craft still rolls and it\u0027s done this since the beginning. I\u0027m fearing some fundamental flaw in how I put the whole thing together (I could swear those ailerons snapped on perfectly level) but before I re-build it from scratch I want to see if anyone else has thoughts. I\u0027m using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E with AJE and a joystick. I tried flying it without my joystick and without AJE and the roll persists as soon as it leaves the ground. it\u0027s not a yaw issue because the plane does not yaw in its takeoff roll at all and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E window shows only 0-0.5\u00B0 of sideslip when its rolling over.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If any additional info is needed let me know\n\u003E \n\n[@Drew Kerman](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/103177-drew-kerman/) first thing I\u0027ll suggest is to put the plane out on the runway and set the brakes, then begin playing with the roll controls (Q and E) to see which way your ailerons deflect (a little \u0022is it plugged-in?\u0022-esque diagnostic test). Two things I can think of that would cause the behavior you\u0027re describing - either one of the ailerons has been set to -100 control input (causing it to deflect in the wrong direction) or your wing surfaces were attached in radial mode instead of symmetric mode. That\u0027s just what I can think of off the top of my head. Some screenies with the parameters you\u0027ve set up for the control surfaces would be nice. Also, one or two with your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E turned on (top downs and side view) would be helpful.\n\nAs far as the dynamic stability simulator is concerned, what you\u0027re looking for there are oscillations. Plug in a starting value for the parameter you want to test (a value of 1 works for me) after you\u0027ve got your static parameters for the altitude and velocity you wish to test, and then mash go. If the graph oscillates from left to right but it dampens with time, you\u0027re fine. If the oscillation stays the same amplitude, you\u0027re probably okay. If it increases with time or if it flies wildly off, you\u0027ve got a dynamic instability problem that you\u0027ll have to address with your craft.\n\n[http://code7700.com/aero_stability_and_control.htm](http://code7700.com/aero_stability_and_control.htm)\n\n...which leads me to want to see a front-end screenie as well, to see how you\u0027ve set up your vertical stabilizer. Your craft may have a tendency to roll if the vertical stabilizers are slightly tilted to one side. Just something else to check.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-18T15:56:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2017 03:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**\n  \nadded the link to the code7700 site.

By which I mean that if you\u0027re looking at your plane nose-on, is the prop on the left spinning clockwise and the one on the right spinning counter-clockwise? If not, can you set them up that way and see what happens? You may have a yawing effect going on due to [asymmetric blade effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-factor), and yawing can induce rolling. It\u0027s something I didn\u0027t consider before; I\u0027m too used to working with the stock KSP engines. Just a thought.\n\nI did notice your stabilizer placement; I was more interested in making sure they weren\u0027t twisted five-degrees to one side or the other. A mod that could help with that determination is [Hangar Grid](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132775-121-130-hangar-grid-zero-deviation-v040-2016-oct-12/), which (incidentally) is also a good one for making sure you\u0027ve got your landing gear on straight.  \n\nI\u0027m trying to think what else might induce a roll with no control input, and how to go about fixing it. I might suggest adding some dihedral to that wing, if it wouldn\u0027t mess up the aesthetic you\u0027re going for there (looking back at the thread, I can see that Van Disaster already suggested that - and it\u0027s good advice). Larger ailerons wouldn\u0027t hurt either (a brute force solution, I know). But try the propeller thing first, if possible. And double-check all the numbers on your control surfaces for good measure.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-18T17:37:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2017 05:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-18T17:51:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 minutes ago, capi3101 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hmm...here\u0027s a question: are your props counter-rotating?

I\u0027m not even sure if KSP models such effects even with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E. I know it doesn\u0027t model prop torque because the Civvie design I linked to above does not have any tendency to yaw leftwards (except when I place a camera way out on the wing haha).\n\nI should probably also have mentioned to help give you all an idea of how much roll is going on that I need to apply so much rudder to cancel it out my plane is sideslipping at 5\u00B0! That is way more rudder than should be needed to counteract asymmetric blade effect"}]}
