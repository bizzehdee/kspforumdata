Basically, you de-stage the upper rover (which seats 2 kerbals) while descending through the atmosphere, make a small adjustment, then activate the main lander shutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon landing, you deploy 4 more - yes, four - rovers that each hold one kerbal. The possibilities now at your finger tips from having a fleet of 5 rovers on a planet are endless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/y9HTxj5\u0022 alt=\u0022y9HTxj5\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need the \u003Cstrong\u003ENovaPunch\u003C/strong\u003E mod parts set for this craft.
