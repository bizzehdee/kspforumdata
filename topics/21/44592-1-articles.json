To plan your launches, first work out which modules your mission requires. Notice that each module comes with two numerical values: the first indicates mass, the second parts count. So (36/14) would be a 36-ton module consisting of 14 parts. Launchers are rated for payload mass with a roughly 10% error margin. The example module could not fit on the Munshine VI (22 tons) but a Munshine V could easily lift it (55 tons). Pro tip: use any spare tonnage to bring auxiliary fuel tanks, because it\u0027s a rare day when you\u0027ll ever have too much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo assemble a MOMS launch, first select one module from the VAB. You can start pretty much anywhere. Then pick the rest of the payload together from the Subassembly Manager.
