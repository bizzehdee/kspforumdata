Probably has something to do with the fact that liquid rocket fuel isn\u0027t like gasoline, as in liquid at ambient conditions. Instead, it\u0027s an ambient gas that is unwillingly forced to be a liquid thanks to cryogenics and high pressure. Thus, in all tanks, the fuel is wanting to go back to being a gas, which means it really wants to expand from its penned-in, high-pressure condition to a roomier, lower-pressure condition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now think about what\u0027s happening in asparagus staging. The outer tanks are losing pressure faster than the center tank because they\u0027re feeding 2 outlets, their engines and the fuel lines, whereas the center tank is feeding only its own engine. In fact, the idea is that the center tank\u0027s pressure doesn\u0027t decrease at all thanks to the fuel coming in from the outer tanks. Thus, from the moment the outer engines fire, in reality the center tank\u0027s fuel will be trying to push out into the lower pressure of the outer tanks, and the less fuel remaining in the outer tanks, the harder the center fuel pushes out. Thus, to make asparagus work in real life, you\u0027d have to pump from the outer tanks against the pressure of the center tank at a rate equal to the current pressure difference PLUS the burn rate of the center engine. And the longer you burn, the harder you have to pump because the pressure difference increases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure the pump required to do this would need a couple of inconveniently large buildings to carry it around it, and would probably consume more energy than needed to lift the rest of the rocket itself. I mean, remembering from the shuttle program, it took them a full day or 2 to fill the orange tank on the ground, where they could have as big a land-based pump as they wanted feeding into huge storage tanks with even more pressure than what would end up in the rocket\u0027s tanks. Thus, having an essentially weightless and totally powerless yellow pipe do this work to me is extremely gamey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s why I don\u0027t like asparagus staging. But this is KSP, not the real world. Maybe the Kerbals have liquid rocket fuel that\u0027s liquid at ambient conditions and can be moved around as easily as gasoline. That\u0027s the only way the \u0022fuel duct\u0022 part could work. Do I use it? Yes. Do I worry too much about it? No. I mean, if I was totally into realism, I\u0027d play Orbiter instead of KSP. I find KSP a lot more fun, especially because you can build your own ships and watch them fail spectacularly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. But asparagus staging does nag at the engineer buried deep in my mind, so I try to avoid it if I don\u0027t really need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as others have pointed, asparagus doesn\u0027t make THAT much difference in the outcome. Hell, if you use FAR, not only do you not really need it, but your rockets fly better when they\u0027re long and tall as opposed to short and fat. So I use FAR, which I also think makes airplanes fly better, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to aesthetics, haven\u0027t you ever heard of craftsmanship? Regardless of whether your atmosphere is vanilla or FAR, you still have to option of brute-forcing your way through to LKO by just strapping more SRBs and/or tanks on the sides. It\u0027s crude, inelegant, but you don\u0027t have to pay for all those the parts (yet) and it gets the job done, so why worry about anything else? Any bonobo can do this. But it takes a craftsman to build something that does the job more efficiently (whether you\u0027re talking the actual rocketry, less cost/mass/parts, or the limitations of your computer), looks nice, AND flies nice. Recognizing this, I really appreciate designs of elegant simplicity that can, when properly flown, do the same jobs as the brute-force method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: I apologize to bonobos for blaming ugly rockets on them. Bonobos are fine craftsmen.
