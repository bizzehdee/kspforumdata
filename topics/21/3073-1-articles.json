So just set your throttle to low, hit space and watch them fly. When the boosters burn out, drop them and prepare for your first landing lesson. The Fat lander has the nonsymmetrical tri-coupler, so it\\\u0027s also equipped with RCS and the advanced stability system (which incidentally also simulate the heavier payload). Hit R, T then space for the best possible start. You can also keep RCT and stability control on while landing, makes it much easier to hover in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth craft use all stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-19T15:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder what will happen when you are hovering in place but the mun is rotating and moving away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprobably hovering in place, while useful and a good starting point, may not be the best solution for touching down; I think one should try to match land speed due planet rotation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat is, if the moon rotates ;P\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-19T16:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, yeah, the trick is to hover relative to the moon, I guess \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-20T02:06:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe moon will be stationary relative to you when you\\\u0027re on or near the surface\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JupiterII","CreatedById":8029,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-20T21:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was only able to lan with the fat 1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-20T21:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fat one is easier, since you can use the stability system to keep the nose up, and just nudge it the way you want it to go.
