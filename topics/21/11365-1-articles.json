The first aircraft was a clumsy twin engine aircraft that couldn\\\u0027t escape the runway, never mind Kerbin. It required you to bounce around on the ground until the drop before the ocean just to take off. \n\nStarting with my initial failure I used what I learned until I made a successful spy aircraft, the scout v2. From then on I built, and rebuilt a series of successful high altitude spy aircraft until i reached my ultimate goal of 20\u002Bkm flight. Here are the aircraft.\n\nScout\n\nAlias: The early scout prototype\n\nPeak Velocity: 650m/s\n\nMaximum Altitude: 16.6KM\n\nRange: 400km\n\nDescription: Primitive compared to later models, most of the aircraft\\\u0027s weight is just air inlets. It was the beginning that set the basis for what was to come.\n\n![iH1Qv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iH1Qv.jpg)\n\nScout V3\n\nAlias: The light ray\n\nPeak Velocity: 710m/s\n\nMaximum Altitude: 18.6KM\n\nRange: 600km\n\nDescription: At this point I had very little idea what a high altitude spyplane in KSP should look like. I realized the engines could stand on their own with the fuel in the fuselage to cut down on the extra weight, a recurring theme. Ultimately it was an extremely high velocity aircraft for only 7 engines. Later models could only hope to match the light ray\\\u0027s speed with many more engines.\n\n![WevVQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WevVQ.jpg)\n\nScout V4\n\n**Failure**\n\nDescription: The V4 broke on the launch pad. After dozens of redesigns it became little more than a mosh pit of structural connecters but no matter how hard I tried it always broke. Alas, We will never know your potential scout V4.\n\nScout V5\n\nAlias: The bi-jet\n\nPeak Velocity: 620m/s\n\nMaximum Altitude: 19.4KM\n\nRange: 600km\n\nDescription: The twin wing design gave the aircraft a very unique flight pattern. The aircraft had incredible lift that brought it to previously unmatched altitudes with the lowest maximum velocity. It\\\u0027s flight was also uniquely level with very little difference between the peak and minimum altitudes/velocities. It was also the most stable of the scouts at high altitudes. \n\n![JHo7H.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JHo7H.jpg)\n\n![QY6OI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QY6OI.jpg)\n\nScout V6\n\n**Underperformer**\n\nDescription: A modified V5, the V6 was outperformed by its predecessor in every way. At least the V4 might have been a good craft if it worked. This one was Grade-A certified terrible.\n\nScout V7\n\nAlias: Big Dog \n\n**Success:** \u003E20km flight achieved.\n\nPeak Velocity: 730m/s\n\nMaximum Altitude: 20.4km\n\nRange: 1,200km\n\nDescription: Jettison-able fuel tanks define this aircraft\\\u0027s performance. It has twice the range of any previous aircraft, about 1/3 the diameter of Kerbin but its performance is weak in early flight. The extra fuel means it\\\u0027s only traveling about 630m/s at 14km at the beginning of the flight and steadily climbs to its maximum velocity by the end of its journey. At the very last 100km or so of its flight it also becomes very back-heavy, sending it into an uncontrollable climb.\n\n![oHPDi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oHPDi.jpg)\n\nI hope you enjoyed my scout series of aircraft.

Those things must be taxing on the CPU. I\\\u0027ve been trying something similar, but with a much simpler design.\n\nI managed to hit 726 m/s using just 2 TurboJets. Using 5 tanks of fuel, the plane, named Floater, flew 700km North from the KSC at an altitude of 18.5 km before coasting down just short of the polar ice cap.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot38.png](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6_Ef19CXVQk/T768wnlzBZI/AAAAAAAABcQ/P4Q4sumH-dg/s1600/screenshot38.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot37.png](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ckerOjeg2Xo/T768vFeS4GI/AAAAAAAABcI/VRz_9sfndM0/s1600/screenshot37.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\\*\\*\\* \n[Ship Download Link](https://kerbal.blogspot.com/2012/05/high-speed-no-rockets-floater.html) \\*\\*\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkthespy","CreatedById":7644,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T02:40:29Z","Content":".\\_."},{"CreatedByName":".ADestroyer360","CreatedById":3959,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T03:38:16Z","Content":"Now I can spy on those Nigerian phone scammers."},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T03:39:59Z","Content":"Now.\n\ni love it, but my PC will explode if i try this\n\n[move]NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!![/move]\n\nthats too bad, but good work anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"toastar","CreatedById":17389,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T03:52:44Z","Content":"I tried it and had a hard time taking off, I added some front canards and it takes off like a dream\n\nEdit: on second though maybe I should of put them on the front drop tanks?\n\nEdit2: nope bad idea."},{"CreatedByName":"rspeed","CreatedById":8514,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T05:00:03Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ve done a few planes along the same lines, none named.
