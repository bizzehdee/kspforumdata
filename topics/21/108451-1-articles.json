I also make to many requests. But who cares. \n\nI would love a lot of cool creative colony modules, rovers, greenhouses and other supplies. I can build some but it would be awesome to see what others can build. \n\nAlso, if anyone who builds these can make internals (Made out of wings and MK3 bays and stuff).\n\nNo need for lifters or Launchers.\n\nAnyone who builds this or takes time to read, thank you.\n\nDMSP\n\nGet your creativeness on!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kozak","CreatedById":128114,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:28:12Z","Content":"This gives me an idea..... un momento...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n![I8SYy2P.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/I8SYy2P.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:39:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This gives me an idea..... un momento...\n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/I8SYy2P.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/I8SYy2P.jpg)\n\nNow that is exactly what I need!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kozak","CreatedById":128114,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:56:04Z","Content":"will post download in a sec"},{"CreatedByName":"ScriptKitt3h","CreatedById":82780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T22:51:32Z","Content":"Hollow-top habitat, complete with 16-kerbals worth of living space.\n\nLands on its own.\n\n![ftss956.png](http://i.imgur.com/ftss956.png)\n\n![De9kyXD.png](http://i.imgur.com/De9kyXD.png)\n\n![0rTxreC.png](http://i.imgur.com/0rTxreC.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T07:22:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E will post download in a sec\n\nAlright, thank you!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hollow-top habitat, complete with 16-kerbals worth of living space.\n\u003E Lands on its own.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/ftss956.png](http://i.imgur.com/ftss956.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/De9kyXD.png](http://i.imgur.com/De9kyXD.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/0rTxreC.png](http://i.imgur.com/0rTxreC.png)\n\nWow!

It got into Mun orbit, but the Nuclear Motor overheated. The spacecraft was an Ore Carrier, and was part count heavy. The centrifuge was taking up space too. It had two drop-pods, one of which I had used to return a Kerbal I rescued. I got Barra Kerman (Engineer) and she hit the weak-spot (Some reaction wheels) and knocked off the whole Ore stack. She survived. The drop-pod didn\u0027t. However, the maneuver saved around 150 parts. Now the crew needs to be rescued.\n\nJust a small story.\n\nThe base is doing fine."},{"CreatedByName":"Nik_601","CreatedById":104747,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:48:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hollow-top habitat, complete with 16-kerbals worth of living space.\n\u003E Lands on its own.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/ftss956.png](http://i.imgur.com/ftss956.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/De9kyXD.png](http://i.imgur.com/De9kyXD.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/0rTxreC.png](http://i.imgur.com/0rTxreC.png)\n\n2001: A Kerbal Odyssey? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
