I\u0027ve done it numerous times. I actually failed a lot at first because I was determined to do my first Mun landing semi-apollo style (one launch, separate lander and csm, didn\u0027t get fancy with 2-stage landers but I like playing stock without part clipping and that\u0027s tough without it). This album I\u0027m posting is of a heavy lander I was testing in 0.21 (was planning on this really big Mun buggy to strap to the side in future launches but never got around to it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took a ton of screenshots during the mission so here is all of them. Funny enough though I didn\u0027t take any screenshots of the lander launch, which I launched unmanned and separate from the CSM. I then launched the CSM, made a LKO rendezvous, and performed the Transmunar Injection Burn. I don\u0027t like leaving debris so when I dumped the injection stage I made sure I was on a direct collision course with the Mun. Made a correction burn on approach afterwards to get off of that collision course and then got myself into an equatorial orbit around the Mun. Transferred two of the three Kerbals into the lander can, made a successful landing, got out, planted my flag, got back in and blasted off the ascent stage of the lander. Successfully made the rendezvous back with the CSM, transferred the Kerbals back to the CSM. I then reduced my oribital velocity to dump the empty lander (since it had no probe core to bring it down remotely), sped back up to stay in orbit and then made my way home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qUQC1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Each lander carried a Kerbal, contained all five relevant science instruments (goo, materials bay, gravioli detector, accelerometer, thermometer) and was fully return-capable by itself. And since it worked on the Mun, that automatically meant it also worked on Minmus with ease. The number three was chosen specifically because there are 15 biomes on the Mun and 9 on Minmus, both of which are divisible by 3. Therefore I can simply launch five of these rockets towards the Mun and three towards Minmus, and in doing so harvest all available surface science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would provide screenshots, but unfortunately that must wait until I am back home later today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen after I had finished gathering science from the two moons, I prepared for interplanetary travel... and got distracted by RSS instead. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E In the full size solar system, getting to the Mun is a whole lot harder, and I am still experimenting with how much delta-V I need.

It was not enough - about 800 m/s short on the final deceleration. A lot of which I could probably have saved if I had throttleable launch engines at my disposal so I wouldn\u0027t be forced to launch my rockets to the tune of fiery atmosphere effects and a near-unsteerable gravity turn.
