Many hours of building and rebuilding and a lot of launches went into this before I got enough fuel on to where it would finish the circularization burn without having to stage off and finish with the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander design was done first and tested to land on Kerbin. Then I just got the idea to build an SSTO launcher under it. IIRC it\u0027s all stock, unless the reaction wheel on top of the lander isn\u0027t, that might be a ReStock part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tested it in .22 with dev build 118 of MechJeb 2.1. Terminal velocity limit off (it can\u0027t hit it anyway), corrective steering on, don\u0027t edit the ascent path, go for 71KM orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/EzkWZks7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/EzkWZks7\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally!

It has three OKTO2 with 100 unit batteries so it can be deorbited using the small amount of fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7373/9913629963_11228a42a4_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229913629963_11228a42a4_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the large decoupler was swapped for a RockoOKTOClampo and the lander modified to be able to dock to it amongst the upper tanks (perhaps just extending the clampotron up on a girder and adding strut guns or docking struts), this might be usable as a return from somewhere stage, assuming there\u0027s a way at somewhere to refuel. Would also have to refuel this beast in Kerbin orbit before taking off to somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launchers is also easy to reconfigure to asparagus staging by moving and removing some fuel pipes and altering the radial decoupler staging. I did that and IIRC went to Mun with it for my second manned Mun landing to plant the \u0022What? This place again?\u0022 flag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do something with it, I\u0027d like to see pics here. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I should try moving some of the radial decouplers up to the lander stage to see if the booster can be kept all together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
