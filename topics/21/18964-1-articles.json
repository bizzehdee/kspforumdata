You are supposed to use the end of the interplanetary stage to put yourself on a landing trajectory, jettison it, then throw the parachutes, throttle very low and turn on the landing engines, then x them off. when you are near ground, you will be travelling about 20 m/s, use the engines to land at 2 m/s. Try to use less than a 20th of the gas in the first set of tanks for this. What you have left will get you back into an 80 Km equatorial eastward orbit, assuming you jettison the empty tanks when they become empty (it\u0027s a so-called asparagus stalk design)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher needs a little work. it can\u0027t really get into a parking orbit without eating into stages designed for the interplanetary departure burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I thought I would post this since the lander is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s stock, but I suggest you put a mechjeb on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14567061/boysun-2.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/14567061/boysun-2.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4emKm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224emKm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0RdTw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220RdTw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-10T03:44:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2012 03:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by nhnifong\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartan117","CreatedById":25092,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-10T04:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA question, if I may.
