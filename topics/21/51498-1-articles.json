I have finally come up with a design that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional! This is my first functional Space Shuttle design and it works like a dream (it also works exactly like the space shuttle itself) Although, unlike the space shuttle I removed the cargo bay doors and replaced it with fuel modules (primarily because I\u0027m going to be using this to refuel my space stations). It can carry \u003Cstrong\u003E1440\u002B\u003C/strong\u003E units into low kerbin orbit. But the fuel modules can be replaced with cargo bay doors if I wished. It would only be a matter of balancing. I used KerbPaint on the stock wing parts on the bottom to make a \u0022heat shield\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I also used it on StretchyTanks to make the ET.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s ascent is much like the real Space Shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the launchpad, the SSME\u0027s would be activated at zero throttle and moved into 100% throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce at max, the SRB\u0027s would be activated and the launch clamps released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon clearing the launchpad, the SSME\u0027s would throttle down to about 80% to maintain efficiency \u0026amp; balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt about 10-12,000m the force of the SRB\u0027s would push the Orbiter Vehicle and External Tank unto an angle until it runs out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SRB\u0027s would detach leaving the OV and ET at an angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe OV would continue ascending until the apoapsis reaches 70,000m (above the Karman line).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the apoapsis reaches 70,000m the ET would have run out of fuel and it would be jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon reaching 70,000m the orbital maneuvering engines would take over and complete the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle would dock to the space station and deliver it\u0027s payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDe-orbiting proceedure would take place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle would glide back into KSC and land on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/04Pfz5z.png\u0022 alt=\u002204Pfz5z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GX4eXI8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GX4eXI8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JHWTzTz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JHWTzTz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1uT3YkA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221uT3YkA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hCGfazx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hCGfazx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MSyDmxP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MSyDmxP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V6Q5qtQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V6Q5qtQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-03T02:39:38Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2013 02:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Christian365\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KissSh0t","CreatedById":57142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T03:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery well done... good stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zuni","CreatedById":85203,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T03:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice!
