It has taken a lot of redesign and testing to get it right, as there have been a lot of little quirks of it. There is actually a balance to it, to where if the balance is not right then it does not move correctly in the water. The original idea for this frigate design was that of a kethane driller in the littoral. The current iteration of the frigate does not serve that purpose, although it will eventually. Currently it serves more as a large, general purpose science vessel, and a stopping point for small, short range VTOLs and helicopters. It contains just short of a staggering 600 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship is equipped with an 8x24 area that is used to land small VTOL craft and helicopters. KAS is used to secure small craft while the frigate is in transit. There is a 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) robotic arm near the stern, again equipped with a KAS winch and electromagnet for loading purposes. There are six rockets up front that basically fires probes equipped with parachutes and science equipment. The KSC figured that firing science equipment at a shoreline with rockets was more fun than gently transporting the science equipment. Essentially, the rockets are sea launched probes that are intended to be fired at a shore line. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe helicopter pictured was the craft that I produced for the frigate, the H-1 \u0022Bumble Bee\u0022. It is pretty basic and simple at only 30 parts; it\u0027s a helicopter built using Firespitter, B9, and KAS. The variant shown is the science version configured with mystery goo containers, atmospheric analysis and sensor payloads. It has a 0.625 docking port on the bottom for expansion that has in the past been used for dropping probes. Minus the advanced sensor payloads that are located way up the tech tree, this would be a great career mode craft. It\u0027s range (about 100 km) and top speed (60m/s for an experienced pilot) are not great, as it is not intended to be a long range or a long endurance flier. It is intended for missions launched from the frigate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used to construct the ship are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24845-Boat-Parts-SubmarineParts-R4-NEW!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBoat Parts R4 (hull of the ship)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25241-0-22-B9-Aerospace-Pack-R4-0c-New-pods-IVAs-engines-fuselages-structures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EB9 Aerospace (structural Paneling, lights, and helicopter)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24551\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFirespitter (helicopter)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24906-WIP-LLL-Lack-Luster-Labs-0-10-7-3-for-KSP-0-23-Updated-18DEC2013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELack Luster Labs (ship super structure and antennas)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-23-Techtree-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts-Infernal-Robotics-0-11-%2812-26-2013%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInfernal Robotics (prereg for Dromoman)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37680-DROMOMAN-modular-arm-parts-for-Damned-Infernal-Robotics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDROMOMAN (used for robotic arm)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24646-0-23-Figaro-Global-Navigation-Satellite-System-Launch-a-Working-Kerbal-GPS-System\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFigaro Global Navigation Satellite System (Navigation system)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52014-Parts-Stack-Inline-Lights-update-29-10-2013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStack Inline Lights (used on the robotic arm)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53134\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Attachment System (used for robotic arm and heli-deck)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/1fQQ0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
