If you\u0027re having trouble getting to orbit just jettison the LES and fairing sooner, so you don\u0027t have to drag those along. Before launch, double tap 0 to lock a whole bunch of gimbals. 1 activates the solar panels and antenna, 2 jettisons the LES and the fairing. When launching the Soyuz, make sure you control it from the probe core. This is because I made it a 2-man craft by clipping 2 pods together, which results in a slightly turned artificial horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/hqgf83rrbkrke6j/Soyuz.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003ESoyuz\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iqLzeZm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iqLzeZm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/l1pj7t96ie17ah3/Progress.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EProgress\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/piW91LL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022piW91LL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve tried replacing the adapter on the Progress with a nosecone and cubic strut. Looks way more like the real thing and doesn\u0027t give any problems... until you dock. Then the craft starts pivoting around the cubic strut, and when undocked again stays frozen in the twisted position it was undocked in, sometimes even explodes after undocking. Anybody know what causes this? I do use clipping a lot, through the debug menu, is it just that or is it an actual bug?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E**EDIT**\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the problem is mostly fixed. The orbital module looks way better and doesn\u0027t make stuff go wonky. However, when docking the Soyuz craft, the steering will often get stuck. This is easily fixed by switching to another craft or going back to the Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-22T00:30:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2013 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kurotenshi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shuttle","CreatedById":5225,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T16:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kurotenshi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kurotenshi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Euntil you dock.

That was on the orbital module, and also, like now, it looked way better that the six RCS tanks. But as expected, that spazzed out when docked. So now, I tried moving the strut back, so the new version had it on the descend module. It should have been fine, since the strut was connected to a decoupler, and the docking port to the probe core. But alas, to no avail. It definitely has to do with the docking port and strut combo, not the nosecone.
