Carrying 720 units of fuel, this vehicle can deliver a strike team quickly onto almost any location on Kerbin. Designed with infiltration missions in mind, the Aquaraeus is capable of high reentry speeds due to rigid, yet simple construction that keeps the vehicle cheap and tough. It also holds a full avionics suite, and has very excellent handling ratings, an easy craft to fly for anyone with some experience in spaceflight.

I used Quantum struts to give it structural rigidity, otherwise every one of those pods would start to fish-tail every time i moved the ship, and each drop pod contains 8 CP inflatable airbags for extra cushoning, or for my ODST style landing method (see below) However, one could probably get away with removing both and having a perfectly functional stock craft (Post if you want a stock version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/quantum-strut/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EQuantum Struts Mod\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/cp-airbag-system/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAirbags Mod - No plugins required!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilot\u0027s Notes: I\u0027ve barely flight tested it, but my heavy launcher was able to get it into orbit with a nearly full Orange \u002B Mainsail booster. Others with smaller lifters may want to beef up for this, it\u0027s easy to launch, but it is still heavy. Main drop method is to deorbit above a target, PRESS \u00221,\u0022 which decouples the first four aft landers and deploys their chutes (You can\u0027t switch to them in atmo, but the chutes will land them anywhere just fine.). PRESSING \u00222\u0022 will release 3 of the four pods nearest the bow, leaving the one \u0022above\u0022 the main cockpit. The carrier\u0027s pilot may use this, and you can control your Kerbal\u0027s descent by PRESSING \u00223,\u0022 releasing the final pod \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E deploying chutes. \u003Cstrong\u003ENOTE:\u003C/strong\u003E I recommend releasing the pods \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E the thicker atmo of Kerbin at around 30km. While Aquaraeus vehicles are very spaceworthy, DO NOT trust them to handle atmo well. You may kill your kerbs by sending the carrier into a spinning fit that rips the ship apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EODST Landing method: This is an optional choice for Jebediah-ites looking for an extra fast insertion (NOTE: You need the CP Airbags part for this one):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeed to get in the hot zone fast? Here\u0027s the way real kerbals Helljump into battle!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You\u0027ll need to stay in the cockpit for this one once we hit ~5km (depending on landing site) .While you\u0027re there, befriend your radar altimeter, find him and say \u0022hi.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Keep attitude retrograde down to 20km, prevent all spins to best ability\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Now you\u0027re in the thick of it. Don\u0027t deploy chutes, but keep an eye on any spin tendency\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At 5km, switch to cockpit mode (In other words, press \u0022C\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. As much as the scenery beckons to you, glue your eyes to the radar altimeter. You\u0027ll be screaming in at ~150 m/s, so stay frosty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. At about 300m AGL, (or 2 sec before impact o_0) DEPLOY CHUTES.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Now, exit the cockpit view and press G to inflate landing bags. Once done, stage again to get rid of your chutes (recommended only at 250m AGL \u0026amp; below) and drop into hell!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/5u4iq9xd5kiuqs5/Aquaraeus_Assault_Vehicle.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/5u4iq9xd5kiuqs5/Aquaraeus_Assault_Vehicle.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave Fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AustralianFries","CreatedById":57660,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T05:58:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat looks awesome, mate!
