Alternate between the drill and the ISRU to make LF\u002BO. \n\nWhen the tanks are all topped off its time to launch. It will make 100km orbit from sea-level OK but any additional launch altitude will provide a safety dV margin. \n\nRight after lighting the first stage, decouple all the mining stuff. \n\nMJ can get it to orbit if you are feeling lazy: Turn start alt 10km, turn end alt 90km, final angle 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, shape 90% (yes, really).\n\nCraft file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/7tkjq5ww5qiswzm/Eve%20lifter%209.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7tkjq5ww5qiswzm/Eve%20lifter%209.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T09:01:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 09:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T00:43:13Z","Content":"Interesting use of airbrakes."},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T01:14:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Interesting use of airbrakes.\n\nIt is actually surprisingly effective to use them to orient an aircraft.\n\nFoxter, very interesting that you refuel on the surface.

Looks like a pretty small ship.\n\nThis craft has atmos/vac 2219/8251 dV (according to MJ) at launch with all the landing stuff decoupled. From sea-level, it makes a 100km orbit with a few hundred dV left over. \nSo, the dV requirement is considerably less than with 0.9 where you would have needed (IIRC) closer to 12000 dV. \n\nThe \u0027secrets\u0027 are to punch through the low level atmosphere as quickly as possible (a high TWR in the first stage) and to make sure that the engines you use have a useful TWR at the altitudes they will burn at (you can use Engineer Redux to check that).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T06:31:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T16:07:30Z","Content":"\u003E Foxter, very interesting that you refuel on the surface.
