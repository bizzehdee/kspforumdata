I went to Mun, minmus, got back from mun , sent some bases there. Even landed at duna once. What I have problem with is return trip. I started to use drills on my ship and making fuel, but problem were usualy bad choice of engines, or wrong fuel tanks and ofc, bad timing. So I wanted to ask, is there any easier way to set Duna window? Also, I could use ship suggestion for duna return trip. Not to forget I still preffer to use Mechjeb for my burn calculations, but i did not find any way to plan my trip right from start, to minimist fuel cost. I hope this was clear enough lol. Anyway, if you have video link to nice and simple classic rocket for duna return trip, I would apreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-15T00:08:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm. If your ship can get to Duna, it should be able to get back. How exactly are things going wrong?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, if you are looking for example ships, you might have better luck posting in the ship exchange subforum.
