I\u0027ve done it for you. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I\u0027ve had a fun and productive day learning about part welding and its\u0027 limitations. I wasn\u0027t able to do some of what I wanted, but made good progress overall.\n\u003E The Duna Descent Vehicle, I reduced to the way it appears on Duna, since it doesn\u0027t need the fairing etc.. I turned the whole thing into a single part, down from the original 23 parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Comms Tower you already know about.. a reduction of 34 parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Hab gave me some trouble.. I was hoping to be able to lose another 20 or so parts by welding the underlying frame and the frame of the Solar Array, but even with the \u0027special\u0027 parts stripped off, those bits just would not weld correctly.. the part .cfg files were full of NaN, and they wouldn\u0027t display. However, I was able to turn the entire interior of the Hab into a single part, and rebuild the rest of the Hab around it, so that it looks and functions exactly the same as before, but instead of being 132 parts, its\u0027 now just 73 parts!\n\u003E \n\u003E All told, those three items result in a combined reduction of 115 parts. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E The part-reduced craft can be downloaded [**here**](https://app.box.com/s/4rk6rxlnwbqc7zrk07cpehqwe086xvc8).\n\u003E \n\u003E I would have done the debris from the Ares 3 Duna Ascent Vehicle as well, but I\u0027m having some trouble getting the welded parts re-attached to the core ship, so they can be dumped on the ground realistically.. if I can get that sorted out, it will result in another 40-45 less parts onsite.\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E Yes.. See the OP on page 1 for all the things that have been done so far. \n\u003E \n\u003E Well, that\u0027s a bit outside the scope of this project..\n\nWith the parts we are saving it should end up bittery smooth\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just watched *The Martian* and now I can say how awesome the Hermes is, how cute Sojourner is and how much the food tastes like potatoes, have you made the MAV yet?

I want to keep the second rover in this case, movie be damned. In the book he had to carry about 30 solar panels on the roof of the rovers, and his life support equipment was hab sized and wouldn\u0027t fit in the rover normally which is why he had to create a tent. I\u0027m OK with Ute rovers as I actually think a flatbed would be more use on mars than a van type of rover.\n\nThe descent vehicle can have a welded version for scenery purposes and a working one in case someone wants to do the mission."},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderSpock","CreatedById":147594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T23:29:04Z","Content":"I think I have an idea for the MAV.......

That first entry looks like it would do nicely.. with a Duna flyby altitude of almost 1300km, it would present a nice challenge, on a par with what Watney faced, in having to fully escape Mars gravity to rendezvous with Hermes:\n\n![Capture_zpss4y0gaqk.png~original](http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp159/ElYoda69/Capture_zpss4y0gaqk.png~original)\n\n![Capture2_zpspsc8y6mn.png~original](http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp159/ElYoda69/Capture2_zpspsc8y6mn.png~original)\n\nDouble-clicking on an entry brings up specific details.
