It\u0027s limited to tier 5 (the first time you get airbreather parts), so no docking ports, but it has RCS to approach other ships (so it can do crew transfer at LKO). Add a docking port as soon as you get them below the materials bay to refuel it for flights beyond LKO. Oh, and full science compliment for that tier, of course \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/3LjXiUp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3LjXiUp.png\u0022 alt=\u00223LjXiUp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s quite heavy for a single jet with all that rocket fuel, so it\u0027ll take forever to climb to 10k (where the jet engine starts to become crap and you have to light the rocket engine and start behaving like a rocket), but you could always speed things up by doing some short bursts with the rocket (you waste fuel, though, and carry more excess jet fuel to orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the glide characteristics when empty, or the flying characteristics at all times, are awesome. And the fuel load allows you to buzz the tower a few times before going to orbit, so be sure to check it out, and don\u0027t worry too much about reentry precision. Well, perhaps a little because those jets won\u0027t allow you to correct trajectory when you are going real fast and a little fuel goes a long way. But you have the endurance to cross oceans, albeit slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/K2JC8jP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K2JC8jP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022K2JC8jP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, that\u0027s what I do when I\u0027m overshooting KSC: an inverted loop at reentry speeds and low altitudes. With full control of the craft even without cabin torque. And the plus side of having a SSTO that transitions to rocket power at 10kms and ~150m/s: if you refuel it on LKO, you have a craft with stupendous T/W \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E delta-v (on the order of 3km/s I believe, no kerbal engineer yet). That flight ended smoothly without engine use during the glide to the runway:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/YbXFDMf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YbXFDMf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YbXFDMf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/GkJde\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
