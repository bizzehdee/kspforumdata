Early designs had far more propulsion capacity, but the structural elements required to support these massive arrays of engines proved impossible to implement and launch, and yielded diminishing returns at any rate. The largest design problem was how to stow all of the requisite colonial equipment compactly and in a manner that was easy to deploy in no specific order, and without risking damage during launch, flight, or deployment. In this dilemma, the largest single problem was stowing the large prefabricated colony base in such a way that it was a) easy to deploy, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E not impeding regular operation during flight or deployment of other colonial elements, and c) not going to be destroyed by the incredible heat generated by the engines. To this end, it was mounted at the far aft of the ship, and the engines set on structural standoffs around it, such that it was protected from the hot exhaust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital assembly of the spacecraft core was deemed impractical, due to the large concentration of gyroscopic control units in the aft section (which would have caused far too much rotational strain on the ship\u0027s spine without adequate reinforcement), and the precision maneuvers required to dock some of the elements, all of which lack RCS (especially the habitation block and colony base, which both have tight clearances around fragile elements).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlbum:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKES Far Horizon on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iPdNgNd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iPdNgNd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KES Far Horizon, the first of its class, in orbit of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/svkKPQ9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022svkKPQ9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKES Far Horizon, leaving Kerbin far behind on the way to Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ADDu0dd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ADDu0dd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres insertion burn, showing off the powerful engine array.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DDR1Khg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DDR1Khg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe prefabricated colony base, loaded with 64 colonists, separates from its dock at the stern of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/727jvW5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022727jvW5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe colony base, landed on the surface of Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D9EOKoG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022D9EOKoG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESunrise on the surface.
