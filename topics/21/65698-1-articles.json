It would transport crew and cargo to a station. Then, it would de-orbit with the crew inside, and return. I don\u0027t have pictures, considering this is theoretical. But, here we go, top to bottom, if someone wants to test this and post pictures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, mods. Deadly Reentry, MJ2, TAC LS, and Home Grown Rocket Parts. I\u0027ll put links at the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll start with a Clamp-O-Tron Jr. That will go on top of the Spherical Pod from HGR. Then, we\u0027ll have a 1.25m Heatshield. Mount an AR202 case on the back of the Spherical Pod. Attach 2 Mk2 R-Radial mount parachutes on the sides. This is our re-entry and command pod. Now our cargo space. Place an Oxygen Container, then a Food Container, then a Water Container. Then add an Fl R 25 RCS Fuel Tank. Next up we\u0027ve got an FL-T200 Liquid Fuel Tank. Our engine will be an LV-909. Around the FL-T200, we have 2 OX Stat 1x6\u0027s. Attach to a launcher of your choice and launch. Once docked to the station, transfer all life support to it, all of your rcs, and half of your liquid fuel. Now, deorbit the craft. After the effects of reentry have stopped, activate the chutes. The flight is over.

Also, make sure those chutes and the MechJeb case are located high and completely covered when viewed from the bottom, otherwise they\u0027re likely to explode under reentry heat (happened when I tested the pod with DRE, good thing the test was unmanned).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WJDubs","CreatedById":102431,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T20:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter finishing tests, I have concluded that it is unsafe.
