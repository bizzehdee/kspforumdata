This helps Artemis greatly, letting us ditch 4.5 tonnes worth of weight (If KSP\u0027s \u0022weight\u0022 is tonnes?). I was also dissatisfied with the unpredictability of the RealChutes so they were swapped out for stock drogue and radial main chutes. The LES system proved to be sufficient for an in-flight emergency, but was lacking for an on-pad abort contingency, so it needed a full reworking. The service module\u0027s design was also updated, to be more in line with Orion\u0027s actual look (The whole step-down from the width of the command pod to the SM). Lastly, the main fairing for protecting Artemis during ascent has been reworked to cover the entire vehicle, as per Orion\u0027s actual design.
