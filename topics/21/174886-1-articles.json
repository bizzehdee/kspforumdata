This is my first post. I\u0027ve been playing for ages, since .20, and have quite a number of craft I feel are of sufficient quality to post, but I\u0027m not normally a forum kind of person, so for now I\u0027m showing this off. It\u0027s all the hardware I\u0027ll need to replace both Laythe and Vall station and build about half of a new station around Tylo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fMeQVtg.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fMeQVtg.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s drive section is actually 2 landers and 2 intraplanetary range crew transfer vessels which pull triple duty as station tugs and service vehicles for landing missions. The landers are cabable of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E on Kerbin and should represent the first realistic chance I have of setting down on Tylo. The second one will haul giant ore tanks up and down from Vall, fueling my whole operation out there. You can probably see for yourself and guess the purpose of the 2 spaceplanes and the smaller more conventional lander docked nearer the bow of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, it\u0027s specs aren\u0027t too impressive for a big interplanetary ship. It\u0027s got just north of 2500m/s in the tanks, not fully fueled. Just enough to get itself to Jool with a decent margin for error. It\u0027s about twice as large as the next largest thing i\u0027ve ever built though, so I felt it noteworthy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-13T20:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is an interesting ship. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
