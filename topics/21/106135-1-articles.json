My first functional SSTO. Works like a charm for me. Got it into LKO, back on the runway safely.\n\nI built it to be somewhat modular - so if you click on the short LF/LOX tank, it should seperate the entire back half from the cargo bay and cockpit. This way, you can replace the cargo bay with a docking port and crew cabin (which I plan to do when shipping Kerbonauts to a Space Station) or replace it with liquid fuel if you\u0027re cruising around Kerbin, ect.\n\nThe engines are tricky. The back elevon / fins are attached so if you want to swap the engines out, make sure you put the fins on how they were. The CR-7 RAPIER engines aren\u0027t the most powerful - nominal speed for this craft is around ~350m/s at 7km. It does handle fairly well, and is capable of delivering Kerbonauts or tiny satellites into orbit.\n\nIf you fly it around, let me know how it went!\n\n[**Single-Stage-To-Orbit Modular Space Plane - Aurora (v6)**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c4pxhk43yr1amkx/CTNsstomsp.zip)\n\nNot sure if there needs to be a license for craft files but the license is \u0022do whatever you want.\u0022\n\n![11174910_10206336173313597_2049134211732364713_n.jpg?oh=46d78a545aac122225305db9be63a32d\u0026oe=55CC6EA3](https://scontent-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11174910_10206336173313597_2049134211732364713_n.jpg?oh=46d78a545aac122225305db9be63a32d\u0026oe=55CC6EA3)\n\n![10418447_10206336173673606_2716566044611378628_n.jpg?oh=ec3b42f44908626d76a4cbf35f4c37c5\u0026oe=55986400](https://scontent-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10418447_10206336173673606_2716566044611378628_n.jpg?oh=ec3b42f44908626d76a4cbf35f4c37c5\u0026oe=55986400)\n\n![11206082_10206336174953638_253927302914927930_n.jpg?oh=946cabed6152c5c73e4508132035243d\u0026oe=55DACCC6](https://scontent-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11206082_10206336174953638_253927302914927930_n.jpg?oh=946cabed6152c5c73e4508132035243d\u0026oe=55DACCC6)"},{"CreatedByName":"PolloPlays","CreatedById":142146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:54:46Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117528-First-set-of-1-0-planes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117528-First-set-of-1-0-planes)\n\nLooks we had the same idea.
