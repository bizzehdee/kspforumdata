Space stations are nice and all, but they tend to get large, unwieldy, and crowded. I wanted a small, lightweight 1-2 Kerbal permanent, self-sustaining (use your imagination here) home in space. Thus I bring you SpaceHaus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/eTkFw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

A total of just 52 parts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceHaus 1: Contains the living space for up to two Kerbals with a splendid view from the cupola. Contains enough air and snacks to last 1 week on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceHaus Supply module: Contains a hydroponic garden to supply food, oxygen, and waste recycling to the main SpaceHaus module (it\u0027s totally not a fuel tank, what ever made you think that?). It also provides solar panels, RCS for orbit adjustments, three extra docking ports, and extra batteries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what\u0027s this? the last three images are showcasing the SpaceHaus Resupply module! This lightweight and fast robotic shuttle can bring up to 5.5 tons of additional supplies (snacks) and can either be discarded after use, or turned into a permanent storage module. With this ship attached, the total part count for the SpaceHaus hits just 90 parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of the main modules are easy to get into LKO (I went to about 150km here), and I parked the ship in the images above in a 500km orbit. I would send up and position the main module first, as it does not have solar panels, just a large battery. The supply module should have more than enough fuel once in orbit to maneuver into position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe resupply ship can be hard to control on takeoff, and I will link a updated version once I\u0027ve found a good solution that doesn\u0027t overdo it \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E much. To fly this one, use RCS as needed to keep the ship steady until the four outer fuel tanks drop off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft files: (right-click and save as)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1162156/SpaceHaus%201%20%28stock%29.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpaceHaus 1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1162156/SpaceHaus%20Supply%20Module%20%28stock%29.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpaceHaus Supply\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1162156/SpaceHaus%20Resupply%20%28Stock%29.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpaceHaus Resupply\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you think!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"littlebattler","CreatedById":73508,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T16:34:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECute little orbital vacation home for the kerbals wheee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotally \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Estealing the design\u003C/span\u003E downloading when/if life support becomes a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silentdragon","CreatedById":73451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T22:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it would also be interesting as a small research station around some of the smaller moons, or as space hotel of some sort...
