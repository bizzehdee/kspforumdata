Here\u0027s the pictures of them. The first few pictures are of a kerbin-circumnavigating plane; cruising altitude 13km at around 900 m/s. The other SSTOs range from Mk1 being the least delta V to Mk3 which landed on Minmus. Hope you guys like them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/0TucC#4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
