I removed the small alieron controls and buttoned down that stray wing panel (I didn\u0027t see what you meant until I accelerated time, then WOAH). Also, when trouble shooting I found a completely superfluous fuselage part that I had placed early in the build process when I was going to arrange my intakes in a different way.

I\u0027m glad the design resonates with you. Your design so far even looks a little cleaner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been pretty quiet this week in this sub forum because i\u0027ve been testing and improving the same ship. These big, complicated designs take a bunch of careful tweaking. Especially considering this one has so many flight regimes that it must perform in. Jet /rocket flight LKO, Planetary Transfer, Duna gliding and powered parachute STOL landing (see below), Payload sequence, Rocket SSTO to LDO, Transfer again, Kerban Reentry and powered landing while much, much lighter. That\u0027s a lot of stuff to get right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne place I don\u0027t think I really succeeded in this case is that I\u0027m sure now that, with the heavy rover, I don\u0027t have enough internal DV to get to Duna. I will have to have an assist tug. That\u0027s OK though because I will use the tug in orbit around Duna as a mobile Gas Station wich will help future missions tremedously. So it is kind of a \u0022two missions in one\u0022 package (Or atleast that\u0027s how I\u0027m rationalizing it)! In any case I designed craft with contingencies like that in mind with the CoM and CoT lined up on that Shielded Docking Port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI streamlined the skinning a bit up at the front because I moved the intakes to the back of the craft to fix the common \u0022drag-flipping\u0022 problem that forward-mounted intakes induce upon reentry. This let me smooth out the lines up front, and I like the way it looks and handles much better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4IEcSXz.png\u0022 alt=\u00224IEcSXz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been testing various landing techniques, and I think I found one that is reliable and safe. Essentially it is powered paragliding! Deploying drogue chutes right at the CoM slows the aircraft and power from the rockets propels it forward generating lift from the wing surfaces. At the last second I fire some retrorockets to further slow it down. On Kerban I\u0027ve gotten landing speeds as low as 25 m/s horizontal and 1m/s vertical fully loaded. Even if the parachute performance is twice as bad on Duna (which is not really the case) this should be pretty darn safe. Here is an early test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fIQsQNb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fIQsQNb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the parachutes make the top view look like a maniacally happy four-eyed snaggletooth monster.
