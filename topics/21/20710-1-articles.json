However, Once I get in the upper atmosphere my shuttle basically spins out of control and I have to decouple all my engines and In order to be able to sit the plane down without crashing. I was hoping I could post my craft file and maybe get some ideas on what I could do to get this thing into orbit. Any suggestions would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to my craft file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3t6q5ypoj13860/Shuttle%20V5.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/n3t6q5ypoj13860/Shuttle%20V5.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(BTW its actually a space plane so you should probably put in your space plane hangar folder)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
