This idea however focuses on specific craft recommendations and referrals. Not as expansive as previous craft repositories, but more narrow showcasing what we as a community generally agree are great crafts (With available download links). Basically taking the Rep Worthy thread idea and opening it up to submitting other ppls crafts and requiring a download and narrowing the field to like the top 10 for each category.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-19T20:59:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2015 08:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by inigma**"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T21:07:54Z","Content":"I like the idea.

Yea, I was just wondering what everyone\u0027s opinion was on the best of this or that out there. I mean, its what led me to build off the backs of others to create awesome crafts of my own. I mean, if I could see the top 3 apollo style launchers, I might be able to reverse engineer and come up with one with the best of all worlds... sort of like what I did with the nasa shuttles I found. It\u0027s all in the name of finding the best craft in order to raise the bar. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAlso I don\u0027t want to run it lest my own impartiality be called into question (and I already manage the behmouth that is the Showcase Master thread). But if I can pass the idea to someone else to run, that would be awesome!\n\nTop 3-10 crafts in each practical spacecraft category would be ideal, and keep the list updated every 3-6 months. Even better if data from KerbalX, curse, reddit, and other forums could be included and collected and published so as to give a pretty large scope covering most craft in existence. Just not sure how to go about it. I mean, I could ask you guys:\n\nwhat is your favorite apollo launcher?\n\nwhat is your favorite VTOL SSTO?\n\nwhat is your favorite runway SSTO?\n\nwhat is your favorite satellite launcher?\n\nwhat is your favorite long range launcher?\n\nwhat is your favorite planetary lander?\n\nwhat is your favorite space station core or station package?\n\nwhat is your favorite Constellation style mission package?\n\nwhat is your favorite Russian style Mun mission package?\n\netc...\n\nI also like the idea of not submitting your own craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T23:10:16Z","Content":"Hey inigma,\n\nIt\u0027s a great idea to have a \u0022starter pack\u0022 for new players, showing to newcomers what can be done with the editor.\n\nHowever I ain\u0027t sure if those craft need to be labelled \u0022best craft on the forum\u0022 for the pack to be worth downloading, and also this would assume you can judge them all perfectly partially, understand each craft perfectly, which is kind of impossible ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)\n\nSome craft actually don\u0027t make any sense and are still great you know!\n\nI think the trick is to simply name it \u0022starter craft pack\u0022 and not \u0022award craft pack\u0022 and include the craft that you think are the best.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-19T23:57:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2015 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RevanCorana**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T02:48:31Z","Content":"It would be cool to have a sort of \u0022starter pack.\u0022 Easy-to-fly, relatively low part count ships from each category.
