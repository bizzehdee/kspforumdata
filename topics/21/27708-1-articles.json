I decided to break the silence today to share the concept for a space base I designed and of which I\u0027m very proud, since I feel it looks great, but also to ask for advice on how to fix a few issues with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s take a look at it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZQvQuaBmoBk/UZoHHb6bONI/AAAAAAAAAM8/K1SoU5M6Km4/s640/screenshot41.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot41.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the modular base \u0022landed\u0022 at the Kerbal Space Center (where I was testing it). The basic idea is that the modules are going to land on their own power separately, and then will be joined together by the Lerner MkI rover (seen on the foreground).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-O94VZDVM7OY/UZoHHa3jOrI/AAAAAAAAANA/Z5IWKWcfL2c/s640/screenshot42.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot42.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen a few videos of self-assembling bases (most notably Scott Manley\u0027s Reusable Space Program), where spaceplane landing gear and RCS are used to move the modules. I choose to have the rover do the pushing around, since it\u0027s better maneauvering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe modules start coming together nicely:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CueCOXZ5noo/UZoHH2qYMnI/AAAAAAAAANE/eLh-Z8eiPTk/s640/screenshot43.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot43.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the whole base is assembled. It has a command/communications center, three habitation modules, a docking hub for two rovers, and a refueling station for a plane/rover hybrid inspired on brotoro\u0027s BirdDog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sCs-y0aOdmo/UZoHK8T9CCI/AAAAAAAAANQ/tjMiH7yXxbY/s640/screenshot47.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot47.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next and more delicate step is to raise the landing gear, so the base will rest on the ground.

I was planning to test it at Kerbin\u0027s North Pole, but it appears the rover can\u0027t move properly on ice. I\u0027m glad I did the test before launching, though, since I hit a few issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of them were expected. There\u0027s a framerate drop around the base, but nothing so bad. Also, every time you dock a new part, the whole thing jerks, and it\u0027s adisable to do a quick save before each docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut one thing I didn\u0027t anticipated: while resting on the ground (landing gear raised), if the base is loaded, the whole thing hops when the physics kick in, causing something to explode half of the times. The base already split in two while I was approaching it with the plane, although you can\u0027t see it from the pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone has experienced something similar and know a way around the issue, I\u0027d really appreciate some advice. I\u0027m thinking the problem is the raised landing gear clipping the ground, but I\u0027m not sure. Maybe I should add some small structural parts to support the modules and prevent the gear from touching the ground while raised?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T19:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the way this looks (those ramps are a great idea). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually when you get weird kicks or explosions when the physics starts it means that something is not aligned right. I think usually something is getting forced into the ground so it tends to get bounced out. You have to be very careful to get everything lined up right or this can happen. It might also have to do with the way that everything is resting on the ground. I\u0027ve never done it this way, I always have everything on legs.

I tested this on Mun with a simple recharging platform for a rover, poor thing low on juice would return to it only to have it blow up. Even those ramps will cause trouble, and technically rovers cant use them anyway. For whatever reason command parts don\u0027t get raised by ramps, so you can only go up as high as your suspension can compress.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rampage9112","CreatedById":34840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T20:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese look really good, I\u0027ve been working on something similar but I\u0027m having trouble keeping everything at the same height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, are you the same Parkaboy who made all of those adventures and stuff on spore?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
