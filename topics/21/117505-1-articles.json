All the ships and assets are in the file and placed where they need to be in order to take an interesting rover trip across Duna loosely based on \u0027The Martian\u0027 a novel by Andy Weir.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You start at the Ares 3 base abandoned by your crew, only the base of their Duna Ascent Vehicle left behind. It\u0027s not their fault, they think you are dead. It\u0027s up to you to get your assets together and take your rovers from the Ares 3 base and trek across Duna (seeing interesting sites like mountains, craters, canyons and anomalies along the way) to reach the Ares 4 Duna Ascent Vehicle. There you take off and rendezvous with the Hermes ready for your trip back to Kerbin.\n\u003E \n\nI am trying to keep a common design theme around the Ares/Mars Direct missions the book is based on. It is meant to be able to be played with a stock install. Some mods will be recommended to add to the game-play.\n\nI hope you all have some fun with it and thanks for coming to check out my pack.
