I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s anything I can do to fix that?\n\u003E \n\nIt\u0027s common for people new to FAR to not use enough yaw stabilization. It\u0027s not simply a case of throwing a big fin on the plane - sometimes you don\u0027t need a big fin! but some basics:\n\n\\* Control force ( moment, to be a little more accurate ) is just basic lever physics, so there\u0027s two parts: the arm, which is the distance of the surface from CoM, and the force which is proportional to the size of it \\* airspeed.  \n\n\\* Lots of things count here: overall lift usually doesn\u0027t act straight through CoM, so a proportion of it is trying to rotate the craft around CoM. In this case we\u0027re talking about yaw, so if the craft starts yawing then the body being at an angle to the airflow will cause a rotation force on each side of CoM. Usually there\u0027s more force in front of CoM than behind, so we need a fin - in your case CoM is quite a long way aft and the distance from CoM to your fin is not so great, so you will need a bigger fin for both reasons.  \n\n\\* All-moving surfaces are not as naturally stable as fixed ones.  \n\n\\* The red derivatives do matter - Lr is usually fixed by fiddling with dihedral... BUT: your panel is showing your craft being stable at 27 degrees AoA, which is almost out of bounds of the simulation! at nearly 120m/s that is a really large AoA. I\u0027d recommend adding some more wing before you do too much more fiddling.\n\nYou don\u0027t really need quite that much incidence for a spaceplane, you might find it ends up pitched down a bit at very high speed \u0026 you\u0027ll have negative body lift at that point. For spaceplanes usually my main wing\u0027s angle of incidence is zero \u0026 it cruises naturally slightly pitched up, engines \u0026 all. On the other hand I take the view that spaceplanes are only vaguely aircraft.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T08:32:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 08:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T12:15:00Z","Content":"Hm, this is a tricky thing to get right ( not least with the fat front end to the stock cockpit... )\n\nSpoiler\n\n[![27005851605_63b18b31a6_b.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7778/27005851605_63b18b31a6_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/H9q3P8)  \n[![26911498642_415d269686_b.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7156/26911498642_415d269686_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/H15sXU)  \n[![26401857923_7efa7a91e0_b.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7473/26401857923_7efa7a91e0_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/Ge3qwX)\n\nMebbe the horizontal tail needs something? hard to tell.

I never found flaps useless, regardless of wing shape, is it delta, straight or swept wing. You need to set other control surfaces properly to counterpart negative pitching down effect from flaps. I have used slats only on some heavy weight crafts where flaps were not enough because of overall craft weight, just to lower down pitching momentum, so craft can be easier to control.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I found pitching down effect from flaps quite usefull. Designs with slightly tilted down nose worked best for me on take off landing procedures, less likely that craft will bounce during takeoff or steer left and right without controle.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Here is small album that explain how I use flaps on my designs.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/8M3nQ/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\nThe thing is I think your wings have to much sweep for them and the overall design is short.  While it is a medium weight craft in my books, you have a good take off speed 120-140m/s.  That is pretty usual for most modern aircraft.   My larger SSTOs have a take off speed of 150-180m/s. \n\n![JxF9aHI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JxF9aHI.jpg)\n\n![bVYYUdR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bVYYUdR.jpg)\n\nThe wing designs on most of my previous version aircraft followed this style of cranked arrow delta.

Pictures on runway were taken before ones in SPH and I loaded wrong craft.  \n\nBoth crafts are similar in shape and size to show flaps usage, though. Craft in SPH have only one engine. Main problem with it is that runway is not long enough to reach take off speed. For take off purposes, I temporary use rocket mode, to accelerate fast enough for take off, switch back to air breathing mode once craft lift off.\n\nOnce in air, single engine is enough to push craft in orbit, however, in upper atmosphere, single engine does not have enough power in air breathing mode, you need to switch to rocket mode much sooner. Whole thing is just not effective enough for practical usage, that is a reason why I created similar craft with two engines.\n\nBoth crafts are still WIP, I need to learn again optimal re-entry procedure. It is much different from KSP 1.0.x. I was able to return both crafts to runway, but with a lot of trouble in re-entry. Figured out \u0022Kerbal\u0022 method of re-entry, to put craft in uncontrolable spin around 50 km in atmosphere. Atmosphere is thin enough to be safe from ripping off wings apart, Q is arond 1-2 kPa, but craft in uncontolable spin was heated more equaly, preventing cockpit to explode. Once craft is slowed down enough, around 15km, I put spin under control and fly to runway as usual.\n\nI never needed any kind of additional thermal control parts, now I need to add those on craft too, to be able to have more reliable method of re-entry.\n\nI experiment with different design aproach, short and wide crafts, swept vs various delta designs, with and without elevators on tail, with and without canards, etc.  \n\nDon\u0027t know if you are noticed, but that craft on first picture use elevators on main wings, without small horisontal wing on tail, but with canards to help in pitching.  \n\nDrawback is that it need small power from engine to have more controls with engine gimbals. Whole point is to create craft capable to reach orbit with least amount of force, trough sleek craft design, rather than brute force power from engines.\n\nOh, I also upoaded bunch of new small aircrafts powered by jet engines. All of them with decent maneuverability, some of them can survive 15-18g turns at sea level. Just recently I have installed EVE and scaterrer, so I need to take new screenshots from test flight, for better entertainment when you watch all those crashes ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T15:23:15Z","Content":"Seems rather easier to build spaceplanes recently, not quite sure why.

I use the shuttle re-entry profile.  I try to keep the nose up to about 15-20deg AoA.  And a rate of decent of around  100-200m/s at max.

Craft properly slow down. at 30 km I\u0027m at 5 mach or less. Problem is that cockpit still overheat too much. It need additional radiators near cockpit to keep it cool. Even slight mistake in re-entry profile lead to ka-boom. I want larger error margines, as I\u0027m not always precise in piloting procedure."}]}
