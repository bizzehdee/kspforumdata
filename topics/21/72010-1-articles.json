It has the science module for remote analysis, a habitation module for the crew that will man it and the 3 man pod which should have a de-coupler on it before the fuel tank. In this state it wont ever re-enter Kerbin without exploding on impact. Its engines will detach and blow up when I manage to get it to the mun. Station has pink lights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fueling ship is a new design. I was using one that only managed to dock at 1400 fuel in its tank. This design met the same station and has about 5,000 fuel in it to transfer over. Fuel ship has one blue spotlight for docking in the dark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Version 2.01 of this has fuel lines from each of the small tanks to the large tank. Less clicking to transfer fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i60.tinypic.com/nv8ufs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nv8ufs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-10T20:58:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2014 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Stickyhammy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
