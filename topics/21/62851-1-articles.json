If you\u0027re like me, you find dumping an entire ship, nukes and all, just to bring a couple of kerbals back home rather wasteful. As such, you now can just aerobrake your mothership into Kerbin orbit, bring your crew (and science!) home, then refuel it and launch again for another planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is, in short, what the Space Shuttle was originally going to be, a reusable crew transporter to low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeedback is always welcomed, and happy flying!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://download1493./wffa202zfj6g/cqsuz5dk970eb28/Heavy\u002BCrew\u002BTransfer\u002BVehicle.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027arial black\u0027;\u0022\u003EDOWNLOAD\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-18T10:24:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2014 10:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CalculusWarrior\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ravenchant","CreatedById":84260,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T03:27:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice!
