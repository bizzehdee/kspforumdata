Feel free to remove the boosters, they are really only there to save some time on ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrior to launch, hit G to hide the lander wheels and extend the landing feet. For some reason extended wheels make it extremely unstable on the pad (like, constant 8-9g standing still unstable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaging should be self-explanatory: boosters ignite together with first stage, get into orbit with first stage or into high orbit with the second, second stage for the transmunar burn, orbital injection and corrections around the Mun, third stage for the deorbit burn and most of the descent, and the little engine for the actual landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo RCS is really needed until you are on the Munar surface, however you might want to use it for maneuvering with the second and third stages still on, because the craft is kind of heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter landing, shut off the engine and turn off the SAS. Stage, separating the rover from the lander. Extend the rover wheels and enable RCS. Use some forward translation to just separate the rover from the lander, and tilt it wheels down. Let the rover fall to the surface - it should hold up, the lander isn\\\u0027t very high. Congratulations, you have a rover on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo drive, use RCS forward/backward translation. Turn it with yaw controls, attention - it\\\u0027s reversed for some reason. Pay attention to where you\\\u0027re going, the rover tends to pull to the left rather a lot. It will also roll in tight turns - use roll control to counter, and to recover if you actually roll the thing over. The highest speed at which I felt comfortable going in a straight line was about 10 m/s. If you use the wheel brakes, be \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E careful - it\\\u0027ll tip over and self-destruct very easily; retroburning with RCS is much safer. The three RCS tanks should be good for about 2-3km of driving on the Munar surface, more if you can modify it to go straight without constantly correcting the sideways pull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun with it, and let me know if you have any comments, suggestions or improvements!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amamateur","CreatedById":32649,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T00:32:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks great, I hadn\\\u0027t really considered making a rover until I saw this.
