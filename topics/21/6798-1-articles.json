It is capable of both direct ascents, and flying to the Mun from a 70-150 km parking orbit, though the latter seems to use less fuel. The integral RCS tank and blocks are to make it easier to rotate while the engines are off. The Lander should be capable of getting you from LKO to the munar surface and back to Kerbin. The \u0027pod\u0027 can theoretically fly from the Munar surface into Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere, if the RCS is not exhausted on other maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPotential dangers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe relatively low TWR of the lander (6.5-18 N/kg) means that descents require a great deal of care, and ascents from Kerbin cannot be performed when the outer tanks are more than ~1/3 to 1/2 full. One may need to begin burning at altitudes of 50\u002B km. Despite reinforcements, the structure is unlikely to survive impacting the Kerbin surface at all but the lowest speeds. Ejecting the pod and activating the parachute is recommended for water landings. The pod can survive an unpowered land impact under most conditions, but water landings typically require active braking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: I forgot the .craft file. \u0026gt;_\u0026lt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Don_Klats","CreatedById":16873,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-19T01:45:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like this!
