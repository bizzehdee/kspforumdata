The Flairiet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter studying some information from online sources and Microsoft Flight Simulator X (Yes, the latter also contains information about parts of certain aircraft), I was finally able to achieve a pretty stable flight (though too much rolling can still have a bit of stability issues if not careful). You can even land with it as long proper care is taken. Due to a lack of any avionics package, you may need a bit of skill at landing this craft. However, not too much skill is required. ;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThought I would go ahead and also share the craft design for those who want to study from it or even tweak it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Flairiet1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Flairiet1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Flairiet2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Flairiet2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Flairiet3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Flairiet3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m5o5","CreatedById":13690,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T05:52:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, thats alot smaller than my first working spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T05:55:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest using some hardpoints to mount some gear on the wings, otherwise, when you land, it could tip over and crash.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bandock","CreatedById":28934,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T07:01:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sss\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sss\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest using some hardpoints to mount some gear on the wings, otherwise, when you land, it could tip over and crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll give hardpoints a try for landing gears in future air/space plane designs.
