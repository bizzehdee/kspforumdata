Look at most of those aircraft in that challenge or in this thread, and you will see that most of the successful designs are very simple in shape, but yet elegant in their own way. \n\nLength will make the area rule number go down, but dont get fixated on that number, you still need to make sure it flies right. So you may have to balance it a bit and have a less than ideal number. \n\nLets look at this one...\n\n![96E3VvD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/96E3VvD.jpg)\n\nIt has an area rule number of around 1.3, but it can achieve orbit through brute force, and it still flies quite nicely even at lower speeds."},{"CreatedByName":"FourGreenFields","CreatedById":139309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T06:27:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m still noob at nuFAR stuff, how do I area rule aircraft properly? \n\u003E This is my simple plane using procedural B9 and procedural parts:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/1rIQZWQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1rIQZWQ.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/vtEfqU4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vtEfqU4.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The plane have 1.2 m^2^ wave drag area, but from the generation 5 fighter challenge I\u0027ve seen designs that can go as low as 0.5 m^2^ wave drag area, how do they do it?\n\u003E \n\u003E And how do I use spoilers and flaps?\n\nFirst of all raise the gear. Otherwise you won\u0027t get proper data.\n\nYou want a cross section distribution like this: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A4chenregel#/media/File:Sears-Haack.png](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A4chenregel#/media/File:Sears-Haack.png), so basicly rising of the green graph, followed by steady reduction or a cut to 0 as 2. best, and more practical option.\n\nTo achieve a clean cut at the rear, try to make your delta wings end where your engine ends.\n\nThe radial intakes are poorly placed and lead to an increase in cross-section, followed by a reduction in cross section. With the increased stability from moving the delta wings back, it should be possible to move the canards slightly to the front, and put the intakes behind them.\n\nSpoilers and flaps: When not inside a building nor flying a vehicle you can acces the FAR settings (top-right of screen), and set the default action groups for them. Or you can modify the action groups manually (SBH/VAB top-left of screen). Keep in mind that the control surface needs to be set as spoiler/flap in the right-click-options."},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T09:16:35Z","Content":"I have found that trying to build a supersonic craft before getting the hang of building subsonic craft to be... rather frustrating. The main reason being that *all* craft fly subsonic at one stage or another (even if the wheels are on the ground). Thus, especially when dealing with flaps and spoilers, it is best to focus on subsonic craft until you get a bit of a feel for how things work in that regime before tackling transonic and supersonic since you never use either when going that fast (FAR will rip them off if you try).\n\n[edit] Well, not never, but certainly not at relatively low altitudes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-19T09:19:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2015 09:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by taniwha**"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T16:18:29Z","Content":"Do the B9 wings work with KSP 1.02 or 1.0.4 and associated F.A.R?
