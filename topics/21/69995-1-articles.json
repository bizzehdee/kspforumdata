Wish you could go just a little faster, without having to worry about this? Need a way to transport your kerbals quickly over long distances, during the day or night? Than you have come to the right place!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHello my fellow Kerbalites! I haven\u0027t posted on the forums yet with one of my creations, but my recent rover creation was too much fun not to share! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It is currently finished initial testing on Kerban and I will soon be testing it out on different planets and moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax speed on flat kerban ground: 22.4m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWARNING: Do not exceed 60m/s as the wheels will all bust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis rover does not have a built in probe, so you will need a Kerbal in the driving seat!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh beams and Low Beams toggled using customs 1 and 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterior lighting can be toggled using 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rear entry door can be opened and closed using 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing custom 5 you can toggle the rear wheel steering on.

The wheels might burst but you can pump those up again. It is incredible to ram full speed into a wall (22.4m/s) and literally bounce off. Sometimes the whiplash (\u002B8Gs) can kill the kerbals inside though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions?
