Is that ok?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not 100% sure about having an open account like that, but carry on and lets see how it goes. My concern is that 1 user of that account could come in a mess up any of the other craft in that account (delete, write spam, replace craft with wrong craft, etc) and there will be no way of knowing who was the culprit. It also means that if someone using that account does start posting spam then it makes blocking that user a problem. If you just give the login to a known group of players who you personally invite and are then responsible for (in a sorta moderator capacity) that would be fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso having an open account like that kinda makes it seem like there might be a cost implied in signing up for an account for themselves (which of course there isn\u0027t). Ideally, I\u0027d really rather each user signs up with their own account. But as I said, we\u0027ll see how it goes, if it causes the site a problem then we\u0027ll revisit it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hakan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hakan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it possible to modify the image of a craft after upload? I have a few vessels on kerbalx with the default image and would love to upload the \u0022real\u0022 image as I got around to make screenshots by now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes v possible. View your craft that you want to edit and in the middle of the header bar there will be edit and delete links. Go to edit and then you can click on the current image and it will change to show you the text that holds the url for an image. Delete the text and replace it with either [noparse]\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/msil77y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022msil77y.jpg\u0022\u003E or [img:http://i.imgur.com/msil77y.jpg][/noparse] (the first syntax is the same BBcode style that we use here, alternatively you can write it in the 2nd slightly less brackety style). The url for the image needs to be a url that ends in the image extension. When you\u0027ve changed the text click outside of it and it should update to show the new image. You can add multiple images, I recommend adding each image to its own \u0022container\u0022 so you can resize/move each image individually. The first image on the page will be used as the thumbnail image for the craft. Ideally host your images on imgur (cos I can dynamically select different resolutions from imgur which I can\u0027t (don\u0027t know how to) with other image hosts). But if you already use another image host that\u0027s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(When you click on a container to edit it a little tab will appear to one side with some help links, The first will bring up a cheat sheet for how to add text style using either BBcode, github-style markdown or my own KerbDown syntax.

Hangars are just another way of having \u0022Favourites\u0022 and tracking which craft you\u0027ve downloaded. You have two hangars (favourites and downloads) by default and they are private hangars. You can make them public if you want so other users can see and you can also create other hangars if you want (other hangars are public by default but you can change their settings). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main point of them is to have tracking of downloaded craft and favourites, but with other custom hangars you can create groups of craft as you like ie if you\u0027ve got a craft that has subassembles that go with it, why not put them all in one hangar and then link that hangar on the main craft\u0027s page. (I will be adding more in to automatically bring hangar and associated craft info into each craft page).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also set a hangar to be \u0022Open\u0022, although this is still a work in progress. The idea of an open hangar is that other users can add their craft into your open hangar, but only their craft (they can also remove just their craft from it). The idea is for users who run challenges to create an open hangar and then other users can submit their craft to the challenge hangar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill got some rough edges to smooth out with this and some more Hangar related features to add (like notifications when craft in your hangar are updated, or when someone adds a craft you open hangars etc).

I was expecting mod craft to massively out number stock craft, but that doesn\u0027t seem to be the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVarious minor fixes deployed today. Most important of which was a fix in the craft votes system, craft where getting votes, but the sort by votes in the search wasn\u0027t correct. That\u0027s now fixed, if you sort craft by points it now has the highest scoring craft first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe user menu had some odd issues which I think I\u0027ve ironed out now (wouldn\u0027t always register you clicking on it). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuite a lot of little style changes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still working on the much larger update that will bring in CKAN integration.

The problem is that the PartMapper can only work of what is present in the GameData folder and there are several styles that modders use for what I call \u0022sub mods\u0022. In some cases you have the root folder in GameData and then inside that you have each sub mod in a discrete sub folders. I could work with that, but it\u0027s not the standard. Some have .version files which could help, but lots don\u0027t. Really it\u0027s a mess and that B9 procedural mod is the hardest case. Infact it is completely impossible to distinguish it from B9 because it just unpacks right into the B9 parts folder, once its unpacked there is no way to tell it apart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was even less of a standard when I wrote the PartMapper so it does the safest thing it can, and assumes that the mod folder in the root of GameData is the mod name and all parts contained within it belong to that mod. This works for most mods, but it is too simplistic. The other mod that this approach really fails on is Karbonite and all the other sub-mods that unpack into UmbraSpaceIndustries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E it\u0027s just a bit complicated and requires a pretty big overhaul to the current mod database structure. The idea is to use CKAN as it seems to be the largest single knowledge base of mod information, and it has a very nice structure from a coding point of view. But CKAN doesn\u0027t track specific details about what parts mods have, only what they are called and where they are. It also doesn\u0027t know about every single mod, but it does know a fair few and at least all the \u0022core\u0022 mods. That means I can\u0027t move to total CKAN dependency and will have to keep the PartMapper in play too (which complicates things somewhat). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to use ckan to tell me where to fetch a mod, download it, unpack just it\u0027s cfg files and parse them for part-names. By doing this mod-by-mod I know exactly which mod a part comes from and I also gain more info about the mod than the PartMapper ever could. I get the mods url, it\u0027s \u0022human\u0022 name, it\u0027s ckan \u0022Identifier\u0022 name and it\u0027s \u0022root-GameData-folder name\u0022 (which is the name KX will know it as). This is enough into to be able to distinguish between things like B9 and B9 procedural but it\u0027s still going require a change to the mod database on KX because the root-GameData-folder name which up till now has been a unique attribute will now have to be non-unique and the ckan identifier will have to take it\u0027s place. But with the PartMapper still in play that isn\u0027t straight forward, but I think I have a way forward now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027ve built so far is the tool that interrogates the ckan repository, downloads the current version of the mods, unpacks them, parses cfg files and produces a json file containing an accurate mapping of part-names to mods (and a load of additional info about each mod) for every single mod on ckan. The problem is this tool can\u0027t actually run on the site itself as it has to download each mod and some of them are huge. Just one of the really big ones will exceed my hosting space limits. So I have to run it locally for now. So yes, I have now downloaded every single mod known to ckan (only took my crummy internet connection about 4 hours!). But now I\u0027ve downloaded and parsed them all, from now on I just need to download new mods and existing mods that have updated (I can also exclude some of the really massive ones like the astronomers pack which just provide game textures and no parts). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, so that part is build and working pretty well. I\u0027ll either try to find a free host I can set that up on with enough space for it to function, or I\u0027ll dedicate an old machine to running it once a day somewhere in the corner of my office.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have to make some quite significant changes to the structure of the mod DB on KX so it can deal with both the more accurate CKAN data and still cope with PartMapper data. I think I have a good solution, but I\u0027m taking my time over it because I really don\u0027t want to break current functionality on the site. When I\u0027m happy with it in dev mode I\u0027ll trial it against my staging server and then I\u0027ll probably have to take KX offline for a couple hours while I push up the changes. And like Squad I\u0027m making no promises as to when this will happen (soon I hope!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis solution does bring a load of extra nice things with it as well as better resolution on the mods. For one all the mods indexed by CKAN will now have their correct download urls present on KX and it also means that those mods will know their ckan Identifier name. This will enable the site to produce ckan-meta files that can be used with the CKAN mod manager tool to automatically fetch the mods that a craft uses (at least for the mods it has which are tracked by CKAN).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso thanks for your earlier reply, hadn\u0027t got round to answering that yet.

[\u0022AB_Launchers\u0022, \u0022FederalProductions\u0022, \u0022ALaCarteParts\u0022, \u0022oldtantparts\u0022, \u0022RKE_Kanadarm\u0022, \u0022TacSelfDestruct\u0022]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah you\u0027re right, more instructions needed! I need to add a bunch of help docs to the site and that\u0027s certainly one area that needs it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh interesting that it got stuck on the mechjeb cfgs, it should ignore all cfgs that have \u0022mechjeb_settings\u0022 in their name. did the ones it choked on have a different format? If you can tell me the names (or just a couple examples) of the files it got stuck on I shall add a rule about them too.
