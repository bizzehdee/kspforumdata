Or you could so something more complicated with nodes, or use the RCS tank as spacers, then surface-attach something to that... the possibilities are probably endless to do something similar, but I have some very compact 0.625m kethane probes that work like a charm (I never saw the reason for the big kethane scanners, if you scan way faster the lower your orbit is).

Note how the drive pods draw fuel through the jr. docking ports, they would do the same if they were docked by any of the other stadard-sized docking ports, either to the side or axially, a detail of which I am very proud since there are no fuel lines there and I clipped like crazy to get those aesthetics.
