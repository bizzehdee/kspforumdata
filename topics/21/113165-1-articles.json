Indeed I will. Any mods that actually feature a cool functioning airlock?"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T02:41:37Z","Content":"well, the Mk I Lander Can works pretty well as a one person airlock, and the Mk 2 Crew Cabin works well for multiple Kerbal EVAs, and they\u0027re both stock. I would take one of those and attack them to another part with crew capacity, and dock that to the station. The other part would be the equipment storage area, and the Lander Can or Crew Cabin would be where the Kerbals exit the station for spacewalks.\n\nmostly, airlocks are just for pretend/rolepay. I don\u0027t know whether it would be feasible to make an airlock mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T02:48:12Z","Content":"Yea I know I technically don\u0027t NEED one but I like the idea. It would be cool to have a mod where pressurization matters, sort of like how DRM turns up the stakes."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:29:32Z","Content":"You might be able to use a combination of CLS and one of those mods that adds kerbal death to cobble together some sort of airlock mod. It all seems very complicated though. Kerbals wouldn\u0027t do that, they\u0027d just open the door and hope for the best."}]}
