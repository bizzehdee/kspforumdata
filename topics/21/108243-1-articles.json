(Confusingly, the mk. 1 is based off of a Mk. 2 drone core, and the mk. 2 is based off of a mk. 1 probe core.). \n\n![7EK7kzS.png](http://i.imgur.com/7EK7kzS.png)\n\nMk. 1 on a suborbital trajectory. Honestly, I couldn\u0027t actually get this thing orbital, but I\u0027m not a terribly good pilot, no matter how much I enjoy flying. I seem to remember the design from some scramjet test vehicle or other.\n\n[Download Lawn Dart mk. 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x8y4obqo0jyij9d/KHI%20Lawn%20Dart.craft?dl=0)\n\n![wILc4If.png](http://i.imgur.com/wILc4If.png)\n\nthe Lawn Dart Mk. 2 doing a remarkable job of not blowing up in the atmosphere. Note the acceleration numbers: it\u0027s pulling around eight gees. This is normal. \n\n![Mo3N849.png](http://i.imgur.com/Mo3N849.png)\n\nthe Lawn Dart mk. 2\u0027s final orbit. Eccentric because I just stuck it at the horizon and burned away the rest of my thousand-odd m/s of dV (!). \n\n[Download the Lawn Dart mk. 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1kehly8j1fhwvs3/Mk_%202%20Lawn%20Dart.craft?dl=0)\n\nAscent profile: Engage SAS. 100% throttle until the wheels leave ground, then IMMEDIATELY throttle back down to 30%. Start a 30 degree climb. Forget about it until the apoapsis hits 80km, then circularize once you\u0027ve left atmosphere. \n\nThat\u0027s all for today, folks. I\u0027m going to see if I can apply my newly found piloting skills to something able to carry a useful amount of cargo...![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nBTW, these are designed to work with nuStock aero, but seeing as they\u0027re just ridiculously fast pipes with tiny wings, they might work under nuFAR.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T17:23:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kagame**\n  \nWoops, aero."}]}
