I\\\u0027d like to get the whole thing into orbit but anything I add makes her launch unstable. I\\\u0027ve attached the craft file here and maybe someone can figure a delivery vehicle to get more out of her. The reason I want a stock version is so that it will stand the test of time through all the updates. The biggest challenge is that the stock version is a lot heavier than its mod counterpart and uses most of its fuel getting to altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eupdate: I\\\u0027ve added the mod version as requested ;D You will need novapunch remix, c7 and the c7 experimental packs. You can do a lot with this one and I love the look of the C7 experimental parts. Novapunch is used for the delivery vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeviouslyDeviant","CreatedById":22509,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-19T08:14:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKEWL BRO! look @ this! \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10717.msg163224#msg163224\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10717.msg163224#msg163224\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-22T20:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDD, please don\\\u0027t promote your shit in others threads.
