Just finished the nth station assembly and are looking for new and challenging construction projects? Or perhaps you are just as awed as I am by humongous, multi-part behemoths assembled and designed purely for deep space. The Grand Tour is a challenge very few kerbals ever seriously consider, much less attempt, but in this great enterprise, the real value is the struggle itself: Your can\u0027t equal the pride you feel when you turn on a Medusa-class main drives on for the first time! (Don\u0027t worry, you will have plenty of time to look at the ship during burns. PLENTY).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/0xrR6dz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0xrR6dz.png\u0022 alt=\u00220xrR6dz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust you look at that big guy! Now some juicy details on how that works. You will notice that I provide 4 craft files at the end, but the ship itself is just the first one. The thing is, as it comes, it\u0027s just a completely useless heatshield (completely crucial in the aesthetics department, of course) and the long spine that houses the habitat, comm gear, and a lab to process the scientific data (equally useless of course, since you need pretty much the whole tech tree to build this). No engines, no fuel, but everything docks here. Oh, and a tiny probe you can drop during Jool aerocapture to explore the atmosphere of that unlandable planet. 6 chutes on the probe means I\u0027ll actually try to land it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the second file is the tanker that lifts big reds to build the fuel section. This is where it gets interesting. See, the whole idea is to have a reconfigurable ship that you can tailor for a specific mission, and alter as you go. I have no idea the delta-v I\u0027m going to end up using to do a grand Tour, but I\u0027m pretty sure I won\u0027t be able to pack it in a single stage, so I\u0027ve accepted that the mission will have to be flexible and preposition some extra supplies along the way (the most important, the yet-to-be-designed Eve Lander). So, the number of fuel tanks and drive nacelles you install is entirely up to you, and will change you range and possibilities to make this one of the most flexible designs I have ever made. In fact, I\u0027m in the process of repurposing it to transport base modules across the system, more on that soon I hope. This is how it looks once you bring the first tank to orbit and unpack the structural section and the heatshield:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/McaOXMp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/McaOXMp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022McaOXMp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must admit doing the exact same flight 9 times can be boring, of course, but for most destinations you don\u0027t need that many tanks, and you could always pick some other launcher and launch the tanks two at a time or more. I recommend Temstar\u0027s wonderful Nova (the one I use for everything here is a fairly basic orange tank\u002Bskipper x6booster asparagus capable of putting 50mT on orbit). Here are some delta-v\u0027s I came up with for different example configurations of engines and tanks, with the payload being the 2 SSTOs and the Tylo Lander (about 60mT total):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDelta-V\u0027s without dropping tanks:\u003Cp\u003EMinimal configuration (1xTanks - 4xDrive pods, 141.04mT): 2019m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh T/W configuration (3xTanks - 8xDrive pods, 231.64mT): 4200m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMedium configuration (5xTanks - 8xDrive pods, 308.64mT): 5734m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign configuration (9xTanks - 8xDrive pods, 454.64mT): 7876m/s \u003Cem\u003E(Note: MR=~e, 530parts)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax. configuration (17xTanks - 12xDrive pods, 761.4mT): 9836m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, auxiliary vehicles! I\u0027m especially proud of the chemical Tylo-Class lander, it is an absolute beast in a very compact package. It sports a full science suite and weights only 50mT, and yet it packs more than 4km/s in each of the two stages and T/W 1.2 under kerbin gravity. Yeah, huge overkill, but I want the dreaded Tylo landing to be as easy as possible. And since I put landing gear on the upper stage, well, it can double as a short of universal lander. It carries itself to orbit with a bit of fuel rom the upper stage, and careful! it carries no RCS tanks, so you have a very limited RCS supply. The two SSTOs are mostly to look good, if chutes were added to the lander you could make do without them, but I wanted to do the atmospheric planets special, and besides, they are really light in both parts and weight (7.25mT and 41 parts). And they can ferry the crew to and from the ship, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/TNt5IOt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TNt5IOt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TNt5IOt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/S1gz0av\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S1gz0av.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S1gz0av.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Eve lander is notoriously missing, mostly because I haven\u0027t done anything more than a very preliminary design, and because it\u0027ll join the expedition in orbit around the target.

It\u0027s mostly a matter of experience, I think, you can learn a lot in the forums! And I guess that the fact it\u0027s not just my hobby, but I also study this kind of stuff in the real world also helps. This is in fact a homage to all the Grand Tour mothership concepts in real life that I\u0027ve seen over the years, with a few other ideas thrown in (like puller nuclear engines, those were inspired half by the Avatar ship and half by the real-life concept MEDUSA for nuclear pulsed propulsion). Notice how the hab section is in the shadow of the nuclear reactors, protected by the fuel tanks, and the exhaust angles slightly under thrust away from the ship. Also, I specifically redesigned the Tylo lander so no nuclear engines are close to it and all RTG\u0027s are at the other side of the ship. Couple that with the heatshield, and this manages to look realistic! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of other points I forgot to mention, call them assembly tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tankers are the key to the assembly. Even though the spine and the heatshield have independent RCS subsystems, the tanks don\u0027t, so to perform the dockings you must rely on cleverly placed drive pods and their RCS systems. But, with the help of the reaction wheels that I placed in the auxiliary tanks you can see in some the pictures, you can handle the tanks just as they come form the launcher into a docking, even if you have to take things slow when trying a dual side dock. The \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/dock-align-indicator/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDock align indicator\u003C/a\u003E mod is awesome to ease the task once you familiarize yourself with it, especially for night dockings, I do those completely by instruments even though the ship is decently illuminated. I totally recommend it, and I mastered docking long before it appeared. It just eases a task that can become repetitive once you master it, \u003Cem\u003Efast\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe extra fuel that is there in the grey tanks doesn\u0027t only make the tanker look good and ease assembly, it is also useful to refuel the auxiliary crafts, and you have more than enough for an assembly, so you might keep some of them (by this point, I don\u0027t have to tell you how to dock them, or where, or point the fact the nuclear engines can also dock behind what they push, not just at the side). They add torque power, and let me tell you, turning this monster takes time. Very stable during burn if you align the nukes properly, though. They do, however, have much, MUCH excess RCS fuel, so they will make you take a hit on delta-V if you keep them, I\u0027m not sure it is worth it. But perhaps for the shorter range versions you could keep them on instead of the rear tanks and use the RCS like it\u0027s free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

Glad to see a fellow masochist. Well, I for sure have it less planned than you do! I have no idea the delta-v I\u0027m going to end up using, so basically I\u0027m packing them most I see reasonable. But I think I do have a couple of tips to pass on on the general trip direction. First, Jool is much better to do first. Why Jool and not Eve? Well, several things. First, it has an atmosphere to break with. That means shaving a big chunk of delta-v, when your ship is heaviest. Yeah, that could also apply to Eve, but the breaking burn at Eve is much smaller. Second, you need one of the big landers for Tylo. Yeah, the Eve lander is going to be bigger. But you pretty much have to choose one of those, because if you want to carry both at the same time you are going to be running into memory issues due to the part count alone. Even if doable in theory, you have to choose in reality. And since you eliminate one of the landers, well... how about only taking the light one with you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Jool sits at a vantage point on the system, and has a freakingly huge gravity well. Means from there I can pretty much go anywhere, and the hop to Eeelo is so tiny, I would make it on a lander if it wans\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A1t one of the \u003Cem\u003Elong\u003C/em\u003E ones., But, once you have stopped fooling around the outer system for some small change in delta-v after the initial big kick in the butt out of kerbin, getting back to the inner system is really, really easy: that\u0027s when Eve is awesome to break with. Or even better, Duna, to not miss the middle part of the system. Eeelo-Duna with aerobrake is basically nothing in delta-v (and \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of precision in maneuvers), and puts me in a very good position to go first to Dres, then back in to Eve for the third aerobrake. I think I could squeeze that just by staging tanks around, after dropping the heavy Tylo lander. Then comes the second delta-v hogger: Moho. You just can\u0027t cheat there, you have to pay the energy to slow down that much. So better to do it after picking up supplies at either Eve\u0027s or Duna\u0027s orbit, as close as I can make it on the original fuel. Considering that the SSTO\u0027s stop being useful at Duna and get ditched there, so Duna-Eve is done by a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E light ship, I might make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat puts the two biggest burns (LKO-Jool and Eve-Moho) on opposite sides of the trip, one with the full ship right at the start (pretty much unavoidable) and the second with an empty ship with a tiny lander (the Tylo lander upper stage). Getting back from Moho to kerbin is also hard, but at least you only have to pay half the ticket price again, since you can aerobrake for a... fourth time? fifth if you brake at Laythe inside Jool\u0027s system? Anyhow, the idea is to maximize the number of times you get free delta-v. Short of doing several flybys for gravity assists (I might try when going Eeloo-Duna, if the planets are halfway close to a decent position, if only to drop some velocity from the most demanding aerobrake of the trip), I think that is as good as you can get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the SSTO\u0027s, it\u0027s one of the iffiest things in the whole thing. They just pull 1,700m/s when doing 100% rocket, and that\u0027s barely enough to make orbit, I think. Which means you have to land unpowered. On Duna. Yikes. I think before departure, I might want to look more closely at that... perhaps a doubling of wing area is on order. Or just modifying a White Dart, which is much more suited to Duna operation. Or now that I think about it... just ditching them at Laythe, really, the Tylo lander ascent stage can do powered descents and ascents on Duna (the little bugger has 4 point something km/s), and that would be lighter in fact, and have a cascading effect by saving mass at a lot of other earlier burns. Yeah, I think that is what I \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. And now the reason for the useless heatshield becomes evident: that things is pretending to be half my fuel supply, not putting anything would feel cheaty.

I only have the first stage in orbit right now, so changing things won\u0027t be too much of a problem. I have learned that I probably don\u0027t have enough fuel though! Currently I have plans for six big red tanks of fuel running eight nukes. I have some skipper engines that will be attached at some point in case I need a lot of thrust right away. I\u0027ve never made it past Duna, but I have learned that nukes are very slow! Much like your design, I have intended my ship to be completely robotic in assembly. The concern I have is if I will be getting enough solar energy at the outermost planets. I don\u0027t see any way to shut down the robotic controls, so they will be a constant drain on energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T22:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you mean robotic because I\u0027m using Mechjeb?
