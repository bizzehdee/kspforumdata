They have since been my only rockets flown in the x1 experimental.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Triangle series is centred around a common lower stage. The 6 LFEs and 3 LFE-Gs will burn for the first 3 and a half minutes (the larger LFEs extinguish about 20 seconds beforehand). Following that, the SRBs will inject the payload into a holding orbit (some designs require a small auxiliary burn for this). After that, the payload is free to go pretty much anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Triangle I is the simplest of the bunch and was my first model. It was flown within 2 Gm of the sun but was not capable of return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Triangle II-ix is tailored towards Mun landing missions, with a small upper stage (awaiting stock landing legs - please add your legs of choice in the meantime).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Triangle III-ix was tailored towards the mission of escaping the Sun\\\u0027s gravity, a task it excelled at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
