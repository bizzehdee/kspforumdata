For the lightest module, on Mun, I had to hit the brakes and let the carrier\u00A0levitate to the center and then raise the legs of the module,\u00A0basically dropping it to dock.

When the game updated to 1.1.2 it produced some error, so I had to do a fresh install and decided it\u0027s a fun challenge to do the base the hard way, before installing the mods. Also the mods I\u0027ve used before aren\u0027t all updated, so I can\u0027t use the saved games from 1.0.5 and probably never will.\u00A0Who knows what bugs they have now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, it\u0027s a lot of fun building complex stuff, especially when your choice of parts is so damn limited and you can\u0027t even scale things or chose tank contents.
