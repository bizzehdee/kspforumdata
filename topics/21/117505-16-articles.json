If so, the Flyby tool runs perfectly on Wine 1.6.2. I\u0027ve just tested it on my Mint 17 install.. (yes, I prefer Linux too, and only run KSP on Win7 because no matter what I do, I cannot get KSP to run properly on Linux. And yes, I\u0027ve been and carefully checked that I\u0027ve done everything I\u0027m supposed to to get it to work.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We probably want a shorter faster flyby if possible. It might require some playing with figures. In my head I am playing at a starting altitude of 100km, it probably makes no difference but that is what I have optimised the craft for.\n\nWell, free-return trajectories to Duna don\u0027t come around as often as ordinary launch windows.. you kind of have to take what you can get. The starting altitude at Kerbin makes only a tiny difference to the numbers.. Starting at 100km instead of 75km adds just 22m/s of delta-V difference, all told.\n\nNow, if you want a lower Pe at Duna, orbital mechanics being what they are, to some extent you get whatever you get, but there is a second possible course, also starting on day 520, requiring a slightly different equatorial z velocity. It gets there 40 days later than the first route, but passes Duna at just 57km up. The other downside is that the Hermes will be moving about 300m/s faster at encounter, and the return trip Duna-Kerbin takes an extra 31 days.\n\nMy next plan is to take both of those trajectories and plug them in to [KSP TOT](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476-WIN-MAC-KSP-Trajectory-Optimization-Tool-v1-5-0-Optimizations!) to fine-tune and tighten up the numbers, so that we have something that can be plugged into MechJeb or PreciseNode.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E Good?\n\nLooks good.. what\u0027s its\u0027 delta V? By the looks of things, it\u0027s going to need 4500-5000 m/s to rendezvous with the Hermes flyby.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-04T13:46:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2015 01:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JAFO**"},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderSpock","CreatedById":147594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T13:45:02Z","Content":"Not sure, but it gets 150km orbit with about 1/2 fuel left with a TWR of close to 7....\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI\u0027ll check, though.\n\nRover movie-style:\n\n![Sck9WTV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Sck9WTV.jpg)\n\nBarely started, so I have lots of work ahead of me."},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderSpock","CreatedById":147594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T16:08:45Z","Content":"![zCCit9A.png](http://i.imgur.com/zCCit9A.png)\n\n![OEtsnk2.png](http://i.imgur.com/OEtsnk2.png)\n\nGettin\u0027 there\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAlso got an alternate Hermes in the works:\n\n![YENAKMt.png](http://i.imgur.com/YENAKMt.png)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n![JkbKpPm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JkbKpPm.jpg)\n\n![ul8cgVL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ul8cgVL.jpg)\n\nNearly done, has the twr of an ion engine (.03 in vac) bit part heavy (354) and I have no clue how I should do the ring."},{"CreatedByName":"JAFO","CreatedById":132901,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T17:07:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/zCCit9A.png](http://i.imgur.com/zCCit9A.png)\n\u003E Gettin\u0027 there\n\nNot bad at all..
