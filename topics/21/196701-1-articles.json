You are aiming for as fast as possible before using up 70k fuel at 98,100 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E remaining. Might change the fuel to 90k if needed. 70k is better for in space \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E. Might need to change out two fuel tanks for liquid fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the aerodynamics are basically perfect at high speeds. Just have to figure out how to get to 400m/s faster to start gaining speed. If I can do this with the current fuel this ship is basically maximized as far as abilities. Edit: BTW, I used to make it to 400m/s in 15000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E usage. That means 153,000 remaining in the current configuration. Having hard time achieving this now. I\u0027m currently hitting this at about 25k use or 143,000lf. If the latter part can be aggressively speed up this might be doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, this thing can maintain perfect heading to 00.0 degrees of control. It occasionally needs to be tapped back in the other direction. This does allow for very minute dips of the nose for speed though. This is imperative to gaining speed. Tapping up and down at lower speed can be costly. It\u0027s something I\u0022m still testing for low speed gains. High speed is about getting past mach 4 and as close as 5 to possible within the fuel allotment. Edit: Some of the roll stability was lost at higher speeds. Not sure how as I was afk. (It was user error. Fuel tanks were not burning symmetrically..)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n780 parts(2 are an old marker for the potential empty spot from fuel/cargo being removed.) Takes several hours to get to orbit real time. I think a max of 11 minutes in game time. Not sure with new more optimized speed gains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve almost made my perfect cargo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. After god knows how many years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis big change happened after I change the tail wings then put the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E as close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E as possible in the new position. Once you get to high speeds you can nudge the nose down to get insane speed gains. Like 50m/s or more per nudge. Not sure on max speed yet. It may max out near 1400-1500m/s. This requires lots of manual adjustments to maximize speed gains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get off the runway you have to hold up at the end of the runway about where those last two sets of shapes are. Then hold up to 10 degrees and keep it until you get fast enough or high enough. I usually hold up to 10 degrees then let it drop\u00A0 a little then pull it back up. Watch out for splashes though. Not sure if gaining altitude is better first. Still working out the most optimal early flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-04T20:55:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2020 08:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceFace545","CreatedById":196943,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-04T16:09:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwow thats a chunky plane\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-05T05:33:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6245746688\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalAcademy/comments/801odm/ssto_ascent_profile/\u0022 style=\u0022height:287px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is basically like his second example. Gain speed at the ocean, but get as fast as possible at sea level. Unless I\u0027m missing something. I get between 1100m/s and 1350m/s. Then allow it to build up vertical velocity and punch past 28,000km. Although my last attempt blew it self up mysteriously at 1200m/s. Might have been that I had heat gauges off and didn\u0027t notice something. Edit: BTW, once gaining vertical velocity/climb rate, don\u0027t let it drop for anything. It will let you cruise past the 20k-28k gap extremely fast on rapier fumes. Any slow down will get you stuck like mud. I\u0027ve been using around 250m/s climb rate to get past. It might be able to be lower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure what altitude. I think the closer to the water the better. Except to nose down a little to get between 360 and 400m/s. I haven\u0027t tried letting it nose up after 500m/s without additional speed gain. That might work for the 70k fuel version. That might net it more delta v in space from oxidizer. I may have been trying to get it to too high of a velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis plane was originally designed around having stacked engines. It had around 64-72 stacks with a nuke, rapier, whiplash, and toroidal spike. Although It started with just nuke and rapier and I added in with different designs. This meant it originally used similar to example 3 to get to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-05T06:17:42Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2020 06:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
