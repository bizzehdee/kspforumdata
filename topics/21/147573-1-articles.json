I really hate Vista engines because of their weight and not being able to scale down properly, so after lots of fiddling around with combinations of reactors and engines this came up as a viable design, I wanted closed solution without beaming power, so combination of the 1,875 m antimatter reactor/generator and Vasimir plasma engine resulted in tremendous 40 000 delta V (about), and 317 kn of thrust at minimum throttle. Only one medium sized tank of hydrazine.The biggest problem was naturally waste heat... lots of radiators. But after all it weights \u0022only\u0022 28 tons, compared to Vista alone 13 tones its quite an improvement...\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vSwyHTp.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vSwyHTp.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T02:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait, why are you still a curious George when you have 32 posts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeverEnoughFuel!!","CreatedById":147738,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T18:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally don\u0027t know... and don\u0027t care...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
