Originally conceived to carry a submarine to the water as part of the Deep Diver challenge. She\u0027s a capable little hauler, well that is from Land to Sea. Getting it out of the drink... Well, try not to have too much fuel eh?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe\u0027s got some state-of-the-art features, like a temperamental ladder connected to a structural fuselage to allow cargo bay access, nifty little water brakes that assure you\u0027ll be stopped in no time at all, and above all, benign handling that means she\u0027s actually a piece of cake to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty much if you can fit it in the cargo bay, it\u0027ll fly it to some water. I know. Amazing. Guaranteed to lift at least 40 tonnes from the runway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAG-7: Lights!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAG-8: Cargo Doors\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAG-9: Flaps (make sure these are down for water take offs, and if you\u0027ve got full fuel...
