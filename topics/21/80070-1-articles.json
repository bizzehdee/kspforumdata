Seats five and can fly at high altitudes. The best part is that it takes 10 minutes for it to plumit to the ground without player influence it just flys in loops and will not get quicker than half of the terminal velocity.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlimJim89","CreatedById":107281,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T07:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I were you, I\u0027d try find a way to use wings where you can place enough of the flat non-deployable solar panels on its wings, and at the same time keep the aircraft slim enough to fit in there.

I might make it ion powered I will think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
