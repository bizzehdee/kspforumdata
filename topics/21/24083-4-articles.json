I did eventually end up with something that worked, 9.7km/s of delta-v in 40.2t. It lands on Thud just fine with Mechjeb\u0027s translatron as you guessed. Unfortunately the landing autopilot can\u0027t seem to cope with the ridiculous gravity and mountainous terrain so i\u0027ll struggle to make the descent any more efficient, but I never intended to return anyway. I\u0027m actually working a tour of the whole Sentar system, hence the rather tight mass budget for the Thud landing stage. I\u0027m using two landers total, one for Thud which is single-use, staged and cannot return, and one for everywhere else which is single-stage and refueled after each landing. It was also quite challenging to design because the balance between a slow, efficient atmospheric ascent vehicle Skelton and Erin require and what is essentially a Tylo landing on Ringle in a single vehicle is a tough one. The full Sentar stage is 270t, with another 900t in the two parts of the transfer stage. Working out the final few teething problems with the launcher I\u0027m using to put 450t parts into space is the only thing holding me back now but i\u0027ve made good progress and I think I\u0027m 8 struts away from success, assuming something else doesn\u0027t crop up when I fix the issue I have now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually really curious to know what whoever does the first planet-factory-enabled grand tour has to use to make it a possibility. It has to be at least 50km/s of delta-v to do everything. The only way I can see that being met within the constraints of not crashing the game is to use Ion engines and a bunch of mini vehicles to do some of the more taxing transfers like Ablate and Moho and having the main body of the ship do Eve -\u0026gt; Jool -\u0026gt; Sentar, with sub-craft making all the other landings and transfers. Still gotta be a couple of thousand tons in LKOat a minimum. I guess it would depend on how far you could minaturize the Thud stage, I think with a couple of optimizatiosn to my design - namely bambaragus staging and a reduction in TWR for the lower stages where I\u0027m not in the final descent yet - I could see a land and return vehice in 55-60t. Eve stage is realistically another 20t minimum even with excellent optimization and some jetpacking, and it\u0027s not like those are the only tough landings. Overall, a seriously, seriously difficult challenge. I\u0027m a long way off try that one, that\u0027s for sure!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exothermos","CreatedById":41827,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T08:08:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn regards to your Bat\u0027leth SSI shuttle, you meantion \u0022...the ship has a tendency to not stick to exactly where you are pointing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy SSI shuttle does exactly the same thing, and it is what made me dump it on that community in exasperation.

In our over-clipped designs, we tend to not take much attention to longitudinal stability. You really need some lateral torque on the tail to get you back on track when you deviate from \u0022nose forwards\u0022. It\u0027s actually one of the reasons flying wings never really took off until there were computers to handle the control inputs, they tended to want to fly sideways. Well, mostly fall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, to put it simply, there is a reason for tails and big honking vertical stabilizers. A bit less in KSP, admittedly, (the nose creates no aerodynamic \u0022shadow\u0022, so the tail can be buried in the fuselage), but it still needs a decent arm to create the rectifying torque. Think lawn dart, or an arrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs further thoughts on the subject, and considering the weird nature of KSP\u0027s short-of-fly-by-wire-but-not-quite SAS system, perhaps you could do the same job with a control surface \u003Cstrong\u003Eon the nose\u003C/strong\u003E. Very counter-intuitive for me, since the resulting thing should be inherently unstable, but KSP seems to work very well with canard configurations, and those are just as unstable in the real world. You are bound to get a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E agile ship at least on the z axis. Just a suggestion so you can get over the \u0022most of my mass is on the engines at the back\u0022 problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. That could be interesting to pilot...

Time to get some SSTOs going! I went for elegance and utilitarianism on this one: It is not only beautiful, but it actually does something useful! It carries with it up to 10mT of payload in a bay that is very accessible and spacious. In fact, to show this usefulness while I was testing the hell out of it, I went ahead and designed a bundle of subassemblies (included) to assemble a deep-space vessel (about 5km/s delta-v in my version!) with independent science lander, and went through all the 7 missions (there was a faulty nuclear engine that had to be replaced and returned to the ground due to a clipping probe core messing with fuel flow ^^\u0027) from runway takeoff to runway takeoff. I even documented it quite extensively, check out the imgur album for a somewhat chronological graphical account. Plenty of MMU action in there, since I designed the payloads without any kind of control to save on parts, and just a couple of docking ports to grab it with MMU\u0027s for assembly: I think I get points for \u0022NASA style\u0022!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/cSj7GmX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cSj7GmX.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/cSj7GmX.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow some juicy details, because I\u0027m proud at how well this all worked out: it\u0027s simple, it\u0027s elegant, and it performs brilliantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe traditional wing\u002Btail arrangement gives it very good handling characteristics, and a low wing loading means it is an excellent glider, maintaining the agility of much smaller crafts. Combined with the clearance the raised tail gives you, it\u0027s very easy to take off and land, and flying it is a dream. The new ASAS doesn\u0027t always stick, but after a few tries I can usually lock \u0026gt;45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA pitch headings with ease at all altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel is a bit on the tight side, though, with the maximum payload: make sure you airhog below 30kms as much as you can before letting the RAPIERS transition to rocket power! That happens a bit after 30kms always, and by then you should aim to have \u0026gt;1600m/s speed, with a healthy vertical component (but RAPIERS give it such an awesome T/W on rocket power, you don\u0027t have to worry too much about that last one). Also, the part count is 150 without payload, so pretty good on that front for potato computers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome more interesting details on the payloads... the fuel on all payloads starts forbidden, just so you don\u0027t use it before you want to, and so it doesn\u0027t falsify your fuel readings, but you could of course use a drop tank to increase range, the fuel flow would work nicely. The payloads are also really part-limited, with the highest part count on the lander at 30 (and that\u0027s because of all the science instruments), so the resulting space station/deep space vessel is also quite light, at something like 100 parts in my configuration, which is enough for a roundtrip to Jool or Duna. The lander should be enough for Duna, too, and it is designed so you can do multiple landings, return the science to the ship, and then process and transmit it back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/viItB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/viItB\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDOWNLOADS:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/nob9ca7pd7g8f0m/Broadsword.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBroadsword SSTO shuttle\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/ccej9aqgpvgdod3/Subassemblies.rar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESubassembly Pack\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Sabre\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first addition from 0.22 (though old craft do still work): a low tech SSTO! It\u0027s a nice file to have if you are in career mode and don\u0027t have yet access to the higher tiers but want to start fooling around with serious SSTO\u0027s.

The sexiest addition to the SSTO fleet is here (in my humble opinion, of course), and because the design went so well, the engineers at R-SUV went ahead and modified the prototype to create two different serial models to appeal to the discerning customer, a VTOL and a nuclear powered long-range scout. Not that the prototype is short range (flown right, there is enough for a KSO mission and return to runway), but it is equipped with landing gear to allow tail landings on airless moons. But, you know, the discerning customer, mostly wants something that looks good and fast. This achieves both objectives with a minimal part count and awesome performance. And I seriously don\u0027t really know how I got it to look to... well, \u003Cem\u003Eclean\u003C/em\u003E. I just love it.

As such, the main rocket propulsion should only be used to provide 200-400 m/s on the climb to orbit: Milk those turbojets as long as you can! The prototype also has amazing T/W on rocket power, so if you don\u0027t like tedious waits on the way to orbit, that is definitely your version. It also has somewhat cleaner lines, with less parts due to the missing subsystems. But if you are after efficiency or plain VTOL awesomeness, the other two versions get the added performance at the cost of a low T/W ratio outside of the atmosphere, so remember to make sure you keep your apoapsis in front of you during the climb to orbit with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate!\u003C/strong\u003E HatBat has been so kind as to make a Showcase video featuring all variants of this craft.

And if I may say so myself, the results were great! The test flight was from runway, to VAB, then 120 circular orbit, then back to VAB roof. Because of reasons. I must warn you all, it\u0027s a complicated and demanding ship, and it\u0027s still not perfectly balanced. The reaction wheels allow full control at all times, even ignoring assimetrical flameouts and unbalaced fuel loads, but the ship has a tendency to not stick to exactly where you are pointing. Lots of manual flying to be precise on burns. Also, although I added boost engines, the full potential of this craft on range is very dependant on a good climb to orbit. The way this works best for this craft, is to level at about 25kms, build speed more or less horizontal until 1,500m/s, then light the rockets (I did so at 27,000m, see the album for details) in a soft climb to build vertical speed with good T/W, and then hope you can reach 1,800m/s or thereabouts before flameouts force you to go under 50% thrust (at around 30kms). Then turn off the jets and throttle back up, this is where you might turn on the boost engines, but I had a good trajectory so I didn\u0027t bother in the test flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ollmThq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ollmThq.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/ollmThq.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen coming back down, there was a hairy moment when I turned on the VTOL engines where the craft pitched up like a wild bronco. I got scared as hell, but apparently all it wanted to do was to bleed off horizontal speed, and \u003Cem\u003Efast\u003C/em\u003E. So since it is a decent glider, I would advise to transition back to VTOL at low speeds, and with a decent clearance to the ground. Don\u0027t worry, I made it to the VAB in the end without quickload, so you should be able to do so too, I\u0027m no piloting genius and I use a keyboard to play (and an unfamiliar keyboard this time). Without further due, the pics to prove my exploits, and the file I know you are waiting for. From pic 4 onwards on the album, that\u0027s the test flight, chronologically ordered, and without quickload used (but a jump to the SPH to fix a fuel line issue on the boost engines once on orbit). Oh, one final detail, I got around to pin a name on it.

All tanks are accessible to refuel, even if the ones carrying oxidizer are invisible (it\u0027s the reason the aviation tanks are upside down, not just looks), and it has one port of each size available. Plus, it\u0027s equipped to perform tail landing on airless moons (the normal landing gear is operated through action groups). And the best thing... it clocks in at 45 parts, so you can actually \u003Cem\u003Euse it\u003C/em\u003E in your game near to stations without having to resort to NASA supercomputers (as if NASA had those!) to run it without lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight instructions are rather simple: careful when taking off, since you can hit the runway if you pull up too sharply, get to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA until you hit 20 kms, then level off somewhat and gain speed until you get the first flameout at about 27-28kms and \u0026gt;1,500m/s. Then turn on the nuke, throttle back a bit (about 2/3rds works) to relight the jet, and build vertical velocity (you want at least 100m/s to get out of air quickly). Above 30kms you will have trouble to keep the jet working at more than half throttle, so turn it off and throttle back up to finish orbit insertion on the nuke, it should be simple. Circularize at desired altitude, and desired altitude can be Minmus orbit if you so wish. One-way interplanetary travels are also supported, but it\u0027s rather cramped in the cabin for that. Reentry and landing should be a breeze since it is pretty stable in atmosphere, and you have plenty of leftover liquid fuel after running the nukes dry, so go get somewhere interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ABLUM:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/GZ5ww\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/GZ5ww\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDOWNLOAD:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/1kz3sh7lam3d35a/Razor.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/1kz3sh7lam3d35a/Razor.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(NEW!!)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/b3uu885rb6n3gbc/Bat%27leth\u002BShuttlecraft\u002B0_23.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E0.23 version\u003C/a\u003E - 0.23 version equipped with RAPIER engines.

Don\u0027t ask about the Mk I... it was experimental. They are pretty similar between each other in functionality, though. The Mk II has the tightest delta-v budget (you could always deorbit on RCS, plenty of that), and the Mk IV has the most reserve, so if you are not a skilled pilot and don\u0027t get that \u0022gravity turn\u0022 thing all that well, that is the one I would recommend. Careful about the landing that one, though: you will need some leftover fuel (fumes) to do a tiny 5m/s reduction in speed just before touchdown.

When you can\u0027t keep it lit anymore, you can continue on nukes alone to orbit for maximum efficiency, but if you need a bit more oomph to land on, say, Duna, the boost radial engines will take your T/W to something close to one on kerbin.

The capsule looks kind of like a Dragon (and works just like one with an abort system feeding off the main tanks), and the rocket is a two-staged reusable booster. If by some miracle you can get the second stage to orbit with you (it should run out just before, but I\u0027m not the best pilot out there and I keep the fairing on until 2nd stage sep), don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s probed so you can deorbit it on residuals (You could want to move fuel to it to take it to orbit so you can refuel it later for interplanetary transfers, who knows). The capsule itself has like 1km/s in delta-v, so don\u0027t worry, she can make anything short of a lunar flyby... which she can do still, but it requires some proficient flying and has tight margins, a Minmus flyby will leave you with fumes on the tanks after a reasonably efficient launch. Also a lot of shenanigans like scientific instruments and an electrical system with lights, whatever I could think of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you want just a bit more performance, to offset your pilot errors, or perhaps do a Mun landing mission, there is another version with additional boosters, both liquid for lunar landing missions and solid for \u0022just a bit more punch\u0022, that is there for you. Or servicing a KSO station, whatever floats your boat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The coolest thing of it all is the useless fairing and the unnecessary abort sequence. In a nominal launch you won\u0027t use it, but just for kicks, launch the thing and the press, with full throttle engaged, 9 (jettison fairings), 0 (abort proper) and, once you are a safe distance away, backspace (chutes and landing gear, make sure to throttle down prior), and watch the pretty fireworks as you walk away unscathed. Guaranteed (*) to get you out of anything, including a pad abort under SRB power .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As to flight instructions, it\u0027s set up so you just have to press spacebar as fuel runs out to stage it (a rather spectacular second stage separation with the fairings blowing away, I must say), and optimal start of gravity turn is at about 10,000m, no throttling required along the way. I just explained the most complicated stuff which is the abort sequence... so yeah, that\u0027s basically it. There\u0027s a bunch more stuff action-grouped, but that\u0027s just for convenience, no preflight checks or nothing. As I said, simplicity and looks, the brain was sufficiently used during design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Note the initial version I came up with had both the SRB\u0027s and just four LVT-45\u0027s on the core (there might be some pics of that in the album), and no reusability stuff.

Just like the real thing! If you find yourself failing with a maneuver, you have probably already have and will have to abort the mission and start thinking up ways to save your kerbals. But now that that\u0027s out of the way, the nerdy details. First off, I knew this would be a mass-limited thing. I just couldn\u0027t afford more than 10 first stage tanks if I had to keep part count low. So, I had my first inspired idea of the day, and used the skippers as F-1 equivalents. That meant poodles for J-2\u0027s, and they actually fit the part quite well. With that, I just had 11 tanks with 11 engines for the whole booster, and I could even afford some fairing eye-candiness. However, a small rocket means a light payload. Then again, NASA also struggled to fit a lunar mission inside the Saturn\u0027s V fairing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E. But by keeping things light and simple (and very tight margins on the lander), we made do, and not one bit of realism suffered for it: as an example, the CM hangs from the fairing, and is not connected to the lander in any way, just like the real thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen of course I came up with a very stupid-looking lander, but some time off the project, a look at the various other apollo replicas out there, and a fit of inspiration about how to put things together, and a newer and much more sexy lander came about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/NwXdWzN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NwXdWzN.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/NwXdWzN.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I must confess to a slight inaccuracy. Turns out the fuel doesn\u0027t fit 100% perfect with an Apollo flight profile: The S-IVb should have about half/one third of the CM\u0027s fuel. I know, tiny detail, but make sure you do two things: first off, the coast to apoapsis is a very nice time to perform the lander retrieval. You will ditch the upper part of the fairing, keeping space clean, which is always nice, and also you will save precious delta-v for TMI. Mind you, you could also dispose of the fairings after TMI along with the S-IVb, to keep it even more accurate and have time to do the fancy docking maneuvers, but then the decouplers may push the fairings away from a free return trajectory and into the garbage category. Second, before TMI, make sure to top off the S-IVb tank with fuel from the CM. You won\u0027t need all of that, but it\u0027s always nice to not have the maneuver interrupted because you miscalculated. If it happens anyway don\u0027t worry, you have a lot of emergency fuel on the SM, just transfer some more. Call that the checkout Apollo crews had to perform before TMI. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, to comply with the clean space act, the S-IVb is left on a crash course with the Mun, and the mission continues with a stack that would run on a wristwatch:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ZL8fQtV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZL8fQtV.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/ZL8fQtV.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, the missions keeps on following (obviously) and Apollo-like profile. I performed the Munar sortie from a 10kmx50km parking orbit, but then again, I managed to land on dry tanks. That actually happened, running out of fuel less than five meters from the surface, and on both test missions, with the new and the old lander.

But this one is based on a very interesting concept, a VTOHL lifting body using aerospikes NASA once pursued.

Don\u0027t worry, purists: take out the turbojets and the aviation tanks, and it\u0027ll still be SSTO, probably with more delta-v in space.

Also, delta-v on low (about 100kms) orbit is around 0.5km/s, so not really interplanetary unless you refuel. All the usual stuff including docking capability.

This is going my first 0.20 release and it\u0027s not a ship, it\u0027s several! I figured it was time to update my station architecture (the old one has been discontinued). This time only two craft files, but that is only because you only need two launches to assemble a fully functional, six-module space station. But first, let\u0027s see the finished product, with room for 13 kerbals (only one included), three big grey tanks of fuel (only one full after assembly), and more monopropellant and docking ports (of all sizes) that you will know what to do with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/I6L9cCf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I6L9cCf.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/I6L9cCf.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that is only one of the possible configurations. See, there are two craft files, a station core pack, and an expansion pack. With the first launch, you are basically buying a minimally functional monolithic space station with a little manned tug/observation module (You can/will use it later on the space station construction) and lots of expansion docks. Here it is on orbit (you will have to use fuel form the station tanks to at least circularize, the launch is extremely tight). Notice I have already relocated the tug to free the front probe ports:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/UJ6mE3Q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UJ6mE3Q.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/UJ6mE3Q.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen comes the second launch, the expansion pack. It comes with two solar array wings, a habitat module for six kerbals, a big fuel tank, and a drive unit to push everything uphill (probed so you can dispose of it if you want, or relocate it to another port in the the station). You could keep on launching more expansion packs and try different station configurations (as big as your computer allows you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ), but I just made do with two launches to test out everything, though I will probably increase it later for the greater fuel capacity.

In fact, all modules are equipped with chutes on descent configuration, so the base is deployable not only to low gravity worlds, but also to any rock with atmosphere to brake with.

Not only do you save that, you can also \u0022stage\u0022 the nuclear cruise stages to get more effective range, which I might need on the next one, because it is going to Laythe, the maximum supported range in the brochure. I might have to eat into the fuel tanks of the base, but that\u0027s why I\u0027ll be taking a non-official kethane module to refill with (non-official modules not supported, but welcomed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).

Minmus is so easy to land in!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd speaking on the nuclear cruise sections... Yes, I know, the T/W is pitiful. But that\u0027s all you need in space! Just plan accordingly, and take it into account while launching: the stage you finish orbit insertion with has a T/W of about 0.1. So \u0022aim high\u0022 while going to orbit, because it will take a while to circularize. Or in other words, take your gravity turn with a lot of leisure. After staging each of them is capable of independent de-orbit maneuvers to comply with the clean space act, of course. So no need to worry about that. Some modules lose their RCS, though (no need for that on the ground), so might need to worry about that if you want to dock them somewhere afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch vehicle, by the way, is pretty much the same for everything, just slightly scaled on account of some modules weighting more than others. Not my most elegant launcher, but it is both simple and powerful enough to put these into the proper escape trajectories, and that\u0027s enough enoughs in my book. A bit of a weird wobble on the launchpad, I\u0027m not really sure why, but it\u0027ll ease on liftoff. I think the game doesn\u0027t like having docking ports as stress points. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Z7SBqGg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z7SBqGgs.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Z7SBqGgs.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch more pictures in the album, of course, from early testing on kerbin through orbital assembly to surface operations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/AHjJM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/AHjJM\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDOWNLOADS:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/b73wjam3ps9rsbl/Base_Shuttle.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBase Shuttle\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/r96c9nwu9q02a3a/Base_Comm.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBase Comm Module\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/512gj2qvjn5h6ls/Base_Hab.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBase Hab Module\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/d9nl4pzlww6zvc3/Base_Fuel.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBase Fuel Module\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Well, that is all... for now!

And yes, she is a beauty to land. It\u0027s just that with so much of the body being made of wings, she glides. A lot.\u003Cp\u003EEdit: After Broadsword 2 \u0022Nevada\u0022\u0027s testing of the EMUs, landing on the runway, and movement off the runway; Broadsword 3 \u0022Wingman\u0022 is ready to fly up and deploy the core module for station \u0022Republic Station\u0022. Broadsword 3 almost ran out of fuel, but I had to cheat to give me a bit more. She landed with just 70 oxidizer remaining. Republic was set up and Broadsword 3\u0027s crew was transferred aboard it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit II: It seems that PPPC is prone to exploding apart on the slightest touch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad you are enjoying the station assembly thing! I will upload the new file now for the broadsword so you can continue with the even-easier-to-use Mk II. And yeah, all that quantum superposition technology (A.K.A. clipping) on the PPPC, plus the fact the lading gear is barely capable of lifting it an inch off the ground (I was really strapped for mass by then) means any but thew softest landing ends with the tail hitting the ground, and a rather violent RUD follows. You could somewhat solve this by locking the suspension, then you have a bitmore clearance until you break the flimsy legs. Or you can switch legs to heavier ones and stay away from SSTM missions without refuel. I may be getting a tad too good a pilot, because that rarely happens tome. I do recommend landing under both parachute and engine power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: there it is, have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022USKnight\u0022 data-cite=\u0022USKnight\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERune,\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite White Dart is the original herself. I find myself fascinated by flying it. It\u0027s a whole new part of Kerbal Space Program that I\u0027ve only scratched the surface of, the SPH.

The prototype is indeed a nice ship to practice ascents with. Plenty of excess T/W along the way if you screw up! And with the same balanced aerodynamics as the rest of the family. As practice goes, actually, you can try and push the flameout faster and higher on each flight with throttle and pitch control, and by the time you can make 1,700m/s comfortably before you run out of air, you are ready to fly the nuke version to orbit (and pretty much any other airhogger).

But no, there\u0027s really no pure atmospheric version... though if you drain the prototype of oxidizer and forget about the rocket, that would probably turn out a rather nice long range airplane, you could just fly more-or-less ballistic to anywhere you wanted through the upper layer s of the atmosphere and have lots of low-altitude flight time to inspect stuff. Or even better, the jet VTOL! That one was designed to use around kerbin after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
