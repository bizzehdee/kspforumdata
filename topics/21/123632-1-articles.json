The Kenji was built with the dozens of mistakes in previous designs in mind, and the resulting craft saw gains in all critic areas of capability. The long- revered spaced fuel tank system was abandoned to fit more fuel, as it had never been successful in practice, raising the range to 3,000 m/s. The longstanding problem of the broken back of the XIV was solved by shortening the rear of the craft and removing a missile from the barrel and shortening it. To protect the spine, lifted wing was applied over the top and bottom of the craft, including the upright cockpit (which is not used for combat but for ferrying and rescue), which gave the ship a pagoda-like appearance. The forward two lifted wings covered four I-beams, the first for a service Drekevak, while retaining the minimum 3 missiles in the nose. Many of the exterior attachments were deleted or moved inward, and the engine fuel flow was changed from through fuel tanks to through the spine of the ship itself, increasing control even with battle damage. With the new improvements, the already strong XIV was transformed into a lighter, lower part count, longer range, more flexible and better armored craft.

Named the Jiji class, this ship carried one less guided missile but was 20 tons lighter and featured even shorter length, slightly less fuel range, and the same compliment if I-beams.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload for the Kenji\u00A0http://www.mediafire.com/download/0obu77dqta2wx4q/Kenji\u002BClass\u002BDrekevak.craft\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload for the Jiji http://www.mediafire.com/download/uao2wvy0m4z74re/Jiji\u002BClass\u002BDrekevak.craft\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GrxFGwR.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GrxFGwR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mhGabM3.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mhGabM3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-26T21:06:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2016 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by zekes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELink\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T19:44:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, the way those guided missiles fuel tanks are flickering I assume they have a lot of explosive potential.
