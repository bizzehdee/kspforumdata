I\u0027m gonna retrofit it later to be a tug vessel so I can let it burn on full throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso I\u0027m using mechjeb for the autopilot functions for the long burns because the previous propulsion block had some 30 hour burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enamed the Duna express as homage to scott manley.
