My usual solution has been to just place tons of struts between the lower stage and the one above it and hope for the best. Unfortunately, this often fails. I was thinking that this could possibly be solved by clever use of docking ports, similar to the way you might use them to get a quad coupler to link up properly on bottom, as seen here: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/t_3BxnxSOz4?t=2m6s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/t_3BxnxSOz4?t=2m6s\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking ports are built with a tiny gap between them so they dock when physics load. This allows you to have fairings on all outboard engines and should spread the mass of upper stages over more area. It definitely has an aesthetic purpose, since it eliminates unsightly gaps between stages, and it might also serve a practical purpose as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DJTimGw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DJTimGw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y7oSW43.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Y7oSW43.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FCnvlEA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FCnvlEA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe outboard fuel tanks are attached radially to the core.

Let me set it up a little better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1 is the lowest stage, and it consists of 5 Jumbo tanks by 5 Mainsails. Stage 2 is the stage above the lowest stage, and it consists of 5 Jumbo tanks powered by 5 Skippers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there are two basic ways of attaching Stage 1 and Stage 2 if you are building from the top down, Method 1 and Method 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Method 1, you begin by attaching a single decoupler to the bottom of the core skipper in Stage 1. Below that decoupler, you attach a Jumbo tank, then radially attach 4 more Jumbos. Then you attach the Mainsails to the bottom. Then you add struts. This method places all of the weight of the upper stages on top of the single Skipper and decoupler, which creates a weak point. When staging, Stage 1 will stay together in one piece. The image you posted is Method 1. From my experience, Method 1 requires a lot of struts, and even then, structural failures still happen unpredictably. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Method 2, you attach a decoupler to all 5 Skippers in Stage 2, then build downward, attaching the Jumbo tank then the Mainsail on each \u0022column.\u0022 One benefit of this method is that each engine gets a fairing, which creates a smoother looking rocket. This method creates 5 independent columns that can move independently from one another. This method would also seem to place less stress on a single point in the design, which should make for less failure-prone rockets. Upon staging, 5 different spent rockets fall independently from each other, usually colliding with each other and exploding. I think this looks silly, which is what prompted me to investigate this new method. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this new technique, the idea is to get all of the benefits of Method 2 (fairings on all engines, weight spread evenly between columns) without the major downside (a mess of rockets running into each other after staging).
