It was easier than I thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used a Stayputnik, FL-T200 fuel tank, 48-7S engine, and a small photovoltaic panel. You could get an even greater savings for minimalist contests with a Z100 battery pack instead of the panel. That would save you 20, for a net cost of 1105.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne purpose for this craft in actual use could be for use as a cheap long range science probe. You could attach a Clamp-o-tron Jr. to it and dock it for refueling, then send it off pretty much anywhere with small science instruments attached to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AzVwlsc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AzVwlsc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
