I know from past experiences this can cause problems with staging. I started to roll this one to a 45 degree when I reached about 31,000m then rolled again to about 80 when at 70,000m at this point things were getting to chancy late in the mission to do any further staging so I let the empty tanks ride until all the tanks were used up. I was on the last four engines with only a quarter tank of fuel left in each of the tanks and something went terribly wrong! (Picture 2) These large craft take hours to achieve orbit and at this time it was not too funny when this happened!
