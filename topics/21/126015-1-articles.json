It\u0026#39;s the Girasol Lander. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen deployed, the A.I.R.B.R.E.A.K.S. give the Girasol its distinctive look (girasol is spanish for Sunflower.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/TMr0GsV.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn 1.0.4, I successfully tested her entering Kerbin\u0026#39;s atmosphere from Minmus and Mun, and also Duna and Eve\u0026#39;s atmospheres. She can take off from Duna into orbit, also. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/KgVAhUY.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe aerobraking is enough to slow her down, and with the droughts and chutes, she\u0026#39;ll touchdown and not need boosters to slow her down. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/qmTAvky.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe trick I\u0026#39;ve found is to enter the atmosphere slowly (in Kerbin, for example, Periapsis of 45-50km is safe, no matter from what speed the craft is going.) Sure, you might do six orbits, but she\u0026#39;ll get you down to the surface alive. On Eve, especially, I do this to keep from overheating.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese pictures I uploaded have radiators on the sides. I still haven\u0026#39;t decided whether i truly need them or not, but from trial and error it seems like I don\u0026#39;t. Hell, the center fuel tank has a Clamp-o-tron senior on the bottom, not a heat shield (though a heat shield can be placed on the clap-o-tron and ejected after it\u0026#39;s no longer needed.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlease let me know what you think!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n~Jae\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T21:55:09Z","Content":"\nLooks great, and welcome to the forums!
