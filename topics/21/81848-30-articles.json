On planes that are meant to be acrobatic like the trainer and the Dragonfly X, the wings that you\u0027re using are too small for acrobatics and wild maneuvers. The designs are essentially lifting body planes; the wings offer little or no lift and function as mild roll stabilisers. For an acrobatic/highly maneuverable plane you need more lift to compensate for high speed turns, dives, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I add a relatively small trapezoidal wing with forward-facing and rear-facing control surfaces then the trainer can pull out of dives where the vertical speed is -65 or so. With the current wings, the limit is around 20. This is because the wings do not provide lift on their own due to their small size and limited horizontal speed; the lift of the craft is generated entirely by the vtol engine. With larger wings (delta, trapezoidal, whatever) the maneuverability increases tremendously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is meant to be a positive constructive criticism. I\u0027m not trying to take anything away from your excellent designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn an unrelated topic, there was a Soviet spaceplane called the MiG-105 that used staging similarly to yours.

You say you\u0027re running out of thrust, vertical or horizontal? If vertical, are you using the rockomax engines to fine tune vertical speed? And one last bit of advice: When flying like this, horizontal velocity kills. If you get into a dive going 150m/s nothing is going to be able to save you. Constant turning to avoid picking up a lot of speed is key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm.

I tried to replicate some of the stunts that you pulled and I was unable to generate enough thrust.\u003Cp\u003EWanderfound, please allow me to offer some slight constructive criticism. On planes that are meant to be acrobatic like the trainer and the Dragonfly X, the wings that you\u0027re using are too small for acrobatics and wild maneuvers. The designs are essentially lifting body planes; the wings offer little or no lift and function as mild roll stabilisers. For an acrobatic/highly maneuverable plane you need more lift to compensate for high speed turns, dives, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I add a relatively small trapezoidal wing with forward-facing and rear-facing control surfaces then the trainer can pull out of dives where the vertical speed is -65 or so. With the current wings, the limit is around 20. This is because the wings do not provide lift on their own due to their small size and limited horizontal speed; the lift of the craft is generated entirely by the vtol engine. With larger wings (delta, trapezoidal, whatever) the maneuverability increases tremendously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is meant to be a positive constructive criticism. I\u0027m not trying to take anything away from your excellent designs\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a fair call on the trainer; the design is optimised for straight-line speed. As I mention at the start of the demo video, if you want it to turn sharply at low speed you need to take advantage of the VIFFing ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Dragonfly, though...given that it\u0027s able to generate G-forces sufficient to snap the fuselage in half, I think it already has enough wing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Challenges/Kerbodyne%20Aerobatics%20Championship/Dragonfly%20Aero%201/screenshot1122_zpsd062b9f6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1122_zpsd062b9f6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(the 11G showing is post-snap, the meter was pegged a second earlier)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T12:11:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn update to my standard fuel depot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/media/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Instant%20Infrastructure%202015/screenshot422_zps4yinmpkp.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Instant%20Infrastructure%202015/screenshot422_zps4yinmpkp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot422_zps4yinmpkp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/media/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Instant%20Infrastructure%202015/screenshot394_zps1pcemadk.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Instant%20Infrastructure%202015/screenshot394_zps1pcemadk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot394_zps1pcemadk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/media/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Instant%20Infrastructure%202015/screenshot408_zpstviczcme.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Instant%20Infrastructure%202015/screenshot408_zpstviczcme.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot408_zpstviczcme.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight test at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Instant%20Infrastructure%202015/story\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Instant%20Infrastructure%202015/story\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternate format at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/slideshow/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Instant%20Infrastructure%202015\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/slideshow/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Instant%20Infrastructure%202015\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/rff371i1h9lzar6/Kerbodyne%20Instant%20Infrastructure%202015.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rff371i1h9lzar6/Kerbodyne%20Instant%20Infrastructure%202015.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-09T14:49:57Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T12:45:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI... have got to try a jet powered fuel depot now... made a little 3 man capsule with rapiers, never went bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T09:22:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Wanderfound (and other interested spaceplaners, since there seem to be a few in this thead \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E), mind if I shoot a couple of questions?

Nice work, Wander!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeddiew, I suspect that your trouble getting to orbit is 70% flying and 30% design. I think that I could get all of the planes that you designed to orbit. However, they\u0027re not optimal. The reason that Wander uses minimal wings on SSTOs is that larger wings actually work against you for spaceplanes. They\u0027re dead weight from 30km on up. They\u0027ll also serve to pull your nose down and keep you in the atmosphere when you try to break out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust by looking at your crafts, here is how I would expect them to fly with inexperienced piloting: they should reach 400-500m/s at around 24km and then the nose will pull down. If you attempt to pull the nose up, the nose will probably drift to the side. The plane might even flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is how I would pilot your Boomerang plane: fly it up to 20km then level off. Maintain altitude until your combined speed is 1200m/s or higher. Angle upwards by 5-10%. As soon as the thrust of your Rapiers drops to 50%, switch their mode from airbreathing to rockets. Angle upwards to 20% or so. Leave them on for about 10-15 seconds. That should get your apoapsis to 45km-50km. Cut your engines. Keep your nose pointing at 5-10% and do not let it dip down. If you do, it\u0027s not a huge problem. You\u0027ll lose height and speed, but you can make up for it with a sort burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re over the 40km mark, turn on the lv-n and angle upwards to 20%. Your momentum will mean that you will add very little vertical height, but you don\u0027t need to. At this point, as long as your time to apoapsis is staying the same or increasing you are fine. Actually, increasing your horizontal momentum is very important at this point because you\u0027re exploiting the Oberth effect and increasing your orbit. When your apoapsis is in the 80-90km range, tilt your nose down and burn horizontally. You should slip easily into orbit. If you have trouble at this point, toggle the rapiers back on to give yourself extra height and then try burning horizontally again with the lv-n.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T11:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasics to orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Get as high and as fast as you can before lighting the rockets.
