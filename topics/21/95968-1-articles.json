I was thinking it\u0027s time to invite a select few from the creme of the spacecraft engineering crop at KSP forums. We have a near-progressive space program. Sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis invitation is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eonly\u003C/span\u003E open to engineers, posters, and lurkers of the KSP Spacecraft Exchange forum since you have the dedication to KSP that we are looking for. You guys have the caliber and patience and humility to try other people\u0027s vessels, or share yours. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur server is invite only. PM me if interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe run the following major mods on our .90 KSP 2.0.1 DMP server:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameplay Changing Mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDark MultiPlayer - for multiplayer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite - A minable resource with parts to scan, mine, store, convert, and use Karbonite. Converters are capable of converting to fuel, oxidizer, and xenon gas. Useful for building fuel bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachment System - for attaching and detaching things via EVA, such as fuel lines between vessels to transfer fuel, winches, solar panels, thrusters, and all kinds of nifty EVA things\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb 2 - For players who can\u0027t fly. An autopilot, navigator, and tedium busting flight computer that you build onto a vessel to gain access to all kinds of flight data, or even control the ship with simple program selections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech - Requires all unmanned craft to have a radio link relayed back to Kerbal Space Center, or else you lose control of it. It forces us to build communication satellite networks. I have turned off the signal delay option though to avoid having to program flight computer instructions for unmanned ships outside of Kerbin\u0027s Sphere of Influence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditor:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditor Extensions - More Editor Options such as radial attachments, and other precise editing of craft building. If no one wants this we can remove it from the mod pack to decrease bloat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux - Who uses this if we\u0027re using MechJeb? Purists like me. If no one wants this we can remove it from the mod pack to decrease bloat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHyperedit - No cheating! Only use this to test your designs in space before committing them to gameplay. Also useful for fixing things broke by the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHullcam VDS - Come on, we know you want to record some awesome shots. Stick a camera on your rocket or rover for that additional immersion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS Build Aid - So basic it should be stock. Provides a center of thrust ball for editing RCS thruster placement in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakable Everything - Anything that can be tweaked is now tweakable in the editor and while flying. Works great for enhancing our multiplayer EVAs. NEW!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakscale - Automatically resize oversized parts to fit what you\u0027re building. Resize anything. This is required for Infernal Robotics to work. NEW!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand and Control:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToolbar - For keeping a number of these mods in a single area on your GUI. I have pre-programmed it for this pack so you shouldn\u0027t have to set it up. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock - For warp control and setting reminders on launch windows so you don\u0027t miss one, and preventing you from slamming into a space body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking Port Alignment Indicator - A docking pilot\u0027s must-have. Provides an easy GUI for docking spacecraft, even in the dark. See the video in the link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource Details in Tracking Center - Provide critical vessel info in the Tracking Station to help us determine which craft is which, especially when deciding which craft to terminate because DMP decided to duplicate one and is about to go supernova all over our well-laid deep space plans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer - Transfer fuel once between two vessels with this bad boy and you\u0027ll never go back to the old way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough the Eyes of a Kerbal - First person EVAs. We like EVAs. Coupled with KAS, this makes EVA immersion a reality. When on EVA hit \u0022c\u0022 to switch to the Kerbal\u0027s view, like any other camera. I\u0027ve toggled the helmet view on (default is off) for better immersion effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame Artifacts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChatterer - Kerbal radio. Seriously. You will need it to keep the immersion up, especially when you\u0027re flying a mission and no one from GotR is online to keep you company. This generates random Kerbal radio chatter as a welcome white noise to the aloneness that permeates space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDDSLoader - Helps load parts really fast. Decreases overall part loading times. Should make your KSP feel much more snappy when loading vessels. NEW!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDDS4KSP - Included in the modpack so you can run it to convert your Squad and NASA default KSP GameData folders to use DDS and load even faster. Read the modpack readme file in the download.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal Robotics - For movable attachable parts, robot arms, and more. NEW!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite Plus - Extra Karbonite modules. Currently including all Karbonite Plus items this time around. NEW!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk2 Cockpit Internals - That Mk2 Cockpit? Yeah. It has windows now. Zoom in on the larger red button in the cockpit and double click it for a surprise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Fairings - Really should be stock. Generates fairings for use to make launched ships less naked. See the link for instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCANsat - For mapping satellites and finding Karbonite deposits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSI Kolonization Systems - For making bases and stations using a modular system. Please read up on how to know how to start building awesome bases and stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-08T00:28:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2015 12:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by inigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T00:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the server as a whole sounds like a group I very much would like to play with, but Tweakscale does not play nicely with some of the Near Future stuff (which is at the top of my required mods list).

We\u0027re not looking for a time commitment. But we are looking for players who are dedicated to KSP for their foreseeable future, meaning they will stick around playing KSP, even months down the road, even if they themselves don\u0027t show up on the server for days or even weeks. Spacecraft Exchange regulars are of this caliber. You guys tend to spend time designing or testing or flying creations. Then take a break, do other stuff outside of KSP. Then come back to wow us with more KSP work. Our server plays out that way. We\u0027ve been running it since August, and we\u0027ve not even left Kerbin SOI yet with any manned missions, though you have freedom to do so. Currently about 12 guys, 5 of which are dedicated, 3 of which regularly show up at least once a week. We\u0027re looking to expand this crew to include both weekly and monthly players. We have no set time, so often the work is lonely, but everyone is usually working towards some goal together and every mission helps. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I don\u0027t like Tweakscale either, but unfortunately Infernal Robotics requires it, and a few players wanted IR. I might include near-future mod at some point, assuming those who want IR really don\u0027t use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m the mod manager, and another guy owns and runs the server. We use Teamspeak for when we are playing in case anyone else hops on and wants to chat or collaborate on a project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach person is free to start their own series of missions toward any desired goal, with the idea that others joining in on their adventure is the norm at some point. My pictures above are only work I\u0027ve done. The bases and stations are collaborative ventures by nature, as is our comsat network. I think we\u0027ve matured into a rather stable multiplayer KSP team.
