Obviously, of course, this is very hard to do - but it is possible. You\u0027re likely going to want to use a nuclear engine for the burn to Jool and the capture around Tylo. You might think the 48-7S engine is most efficient when landing on Tylo, but according to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W5tE1yo.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis chart\u003C/a\u003E, the LV-N is the most efficient engine to use with a Delta-V requirement of 5000 m/s, a TWR requirement of 0.8, and a payload (not including fuel tank mass) of over 2 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need 8,670 m/s of Delta-V to fly to Tylo and return (excluding 4,500 m/s to take off from Kerbin, as that\u0027s provided by jet engines). The maximum delta-V you can get from the LV-N is 17,244 m/s, but that\u0027s assuming no TWR constraint. With a TWR constraint of 1 (Kerbin\u0027s gravity), the maximum delta-V is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45155-Mass-optimal-engine-type-vs-delta-V-payload-and-min-TWR?p=580613\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post580613\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eonly 6,477\u003C/a\u003E. Unfortunately I don\u0027t know what it would be at 0.8 TWR. I suspect it would be close to 6,477, and I highly doubt it would be more than 8,670. Either way, the margins are too slim. And of course this is assuming that 100% of your ship is fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I decided to use a small detachable lander to actually land and return from Tylo\u0027s surface.
