This is the result. If you want to verify that my craft are indeed identical apart from the extra staging, you can click on the images below to see the craft that each dV table represents. You can also download each craft file if you wish to compare them in detail (or use them for other purposes - feel free to do so!

Perhaps someone could get a higher gain than I did, though. This is a relatively small craft, so as kidolvski said earlier, I think the gain would be higher with larger crafts.
