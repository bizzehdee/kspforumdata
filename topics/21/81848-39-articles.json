You are essentially fling manned missiles. Have you ever considered adding a bit more wing to your craft to increase your low speed handling?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re pretty much all intended for orbit, so I don\u0027t do a lot of low-altitude low-speed. In order to reduce atmospheric drag and post-atmosphere mass, I tend to aim for as little wing as possible while maintaining good flight behaviour from supersonic to hypersonic. While building, I\u0027ll generally check the FAR numbers at 25,000m/Mach4 and work to eliminate the reds there; I\u0027ll often also check 500m/Mach0.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost takeoff, I\u0027m climbing as steeply as possible to 20,000m or so; on reentry, I\u0027m usually supersonic above 10,000m until I pass the mountains west of KSC, when I drop to the deck and bleed off the speed. The only part of the flight where the small wings are an issue is during final landing approach; I\u0027m generally still substantially above 100m/s at touchdown. But that\u0027s no problem if you\u0027ve got your gear set up right; half the runway is generally enough stopping distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith most of \u0027em, the canards will go into a minor stall long before anything serious happens, and I try to design for good stall behaviour. With a lot of mine, they\u0027ll happily sit in a minor stall all day long without any undesired yaw, pitch or roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy takeoff routine is generally to pull up hard into a minor stall, hold that posture until I\u0027ve got 50\u002Bm of air under me, then drop the nose back down to clear the stall before gradually pulling up into a climb of a steepness sufficient to almost but not quite negate my acceleration. I\u0027ve then got several minutes of just letting the SAS hold pitch while I climb; by the time there\u0027s any further need for manoeuvring, I\u0027m generally over 20,000m and supersonic, and therefore virtually stall-proof.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stalling stops once you go supersonic; even tiny-winged things can pull large AoAs without stalling once they have sufficient speed up, and the only subsonic parts of most of my flights are the bits immediately before and after the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T14:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo basically you have really high TWR, manned missiles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is a completely different design philosophy than any of my craft, fascinating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my craft have very good low speed handling characteristics and are a breeze to fly at low speeds down to 70m/s on some and yet still capable of achieving a 100km orbit with ease. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever considered increasing your wing area for more low speed handling? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch like this craft, that is nothing more than a flying wing, and has an amazing glide slope. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9qW2xpd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229qW2xpd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T14:35:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo basically you have really high TWR, manned missiles. \u003Cp\u003EThat is a completely different design philosophy than any of my craft, fascinating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to get there \u003Cem\u003Efast\u003C/em\u003E.
