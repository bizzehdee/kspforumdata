I present to you my latest creation, a model of the Rifter from EVE Online. I built this myself and adjusted it until it was flyable. It has enough struts to hold itself together and it is quite able to take off from the runway if you can keep it going in a straight line. It tends to veer to the side due to not having a tail fin--I didn\u0027t want to add one because it would make it look un-Rifter-like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t really look exactly like a Rifter, so I\u0027m sure some of you can do better.
