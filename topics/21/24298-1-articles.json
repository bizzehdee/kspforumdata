However, as I\u0027m forcing myself to do a semi- campaign runthrough of KSP, I had to go the the Mun and back first to test crew-rated heavy launch vehicles and various lander/ CM designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot wanting to take the time to develop a medium-weight carrier rocket from the existing Medium Crew Launch Vehicle (16 tons to LKO), I decided to go all out and use my Heavy-6 (Super Heavy) Launch Vehicle to launch a single-use Mun mission. Due to stupidity, the rocket wound up having enough dV to bring the CM/ Lander out to Duna and then have the CM fly back- though I\u0027m not sure on Duna ascent dV (it\u0027s 3300 or so, right?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously KW was used, and you can see a Kerbal Engineer chip in one of the pics- there are enough little snippets of various mods that I won\u0027t list them all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout further adieu, prepare for image-spam:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESitting on the launch pad, she is a volatile beast. 40,000 units of liquid fuel can move up to 55-60 tons to LKO, which would turn out to be gross overkill during the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZCw7nVt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZCw7nVt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage falls away with the payload fairings a minute after the 6 boosters separate, and the capable second stage powers itself with a substantial amount of fuel and the CM/ Lander assembly to LKO for transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CQCzci0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CQCzci0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA better shot of the assembly- note the lack of RCS on the CM. In the VAB, it seemed perfectly logical to save weight and size by doing this. While docking the two together? Not so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jo2tMyK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Jo2tMyK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowing down in Lunar orbit, I had already jettisoned the final stage tank after using its engines for the Munar transfer burn. It pained me to see those 1800 units of liquid fuel fly away, but I couldn\u0027t use the lander without jettisoning it- future missions kept it to the bitter end, using it to brake the lander and ejecting it to impact on the Munar surface mere meters from landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cZyOyN2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cZyOyN2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo very happy Kerbals wander around the Mun wishing for rovers- maybe in the next mission, but there wasn\u0027t space in the fairings for rovers this time around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TseBCh4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TseBCh4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscending from the Mun\u0027s surface, tiny solar panels refilling the empty batteries. Because I am an idiot, I always land on the dark side of the Mun, and run out of batteries on the landing lights. On the plus side, I\u0027m very good at night landings now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zuoQrVd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zuoQrVd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s more efficient to use the CM\u0027s engines, and the command pod torque actually produces some minor translation effects, growing more intense as it lightens (the thing flies sideways during a hard turn). Thanks to this breach of the conservation of momentum, docking becomes easier if I mess up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LzLU8oQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LzLU8oQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably should\u0027ve put Crew Manifest on these, as docking to pretend to transfer the crew is pointless when you EVA them anyways. Ah well, we got some extra fuel from the lander, which is being left in a Munar orbit until it can be recovered by the as-of-yet unfinished MunStation I.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mlBp1al.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mlBp1al.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaying goodbye to the Mun- I\u0027ve never really known what the best way to get back to Kerbin is from the Mun, so I\u0027ve just burned until I escape and then burn retrograde until I get a low apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2NXpKSM.png\u0022 alt=\u00222NXpKSM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanded safely in the fading light of dusk, the crew poses in front of the landed capsule before they\u0027re transported home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MVrvqPe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MVrvqPe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComments, criticisms, and suggestions are appreciated as always.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T02:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also preparing for my first manned landing on Duna.
