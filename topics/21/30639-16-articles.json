The only thing that I would add is a comment on engines: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few configurations that work, and some that don\u0027t. The balance between jet T/W and rocket T/W is tricky, and engines count as payload that you have to take from orbit. Generally, you want as few jet engines as you can while still being able to climb form 10km to 20km, and enough rocket so you can accelerate once you shut the jets off. A good combo for beginners is one single jet (so you don\u0027t have to worry about flameouts) and a couple of LV-909\u0027s. That will carry up a FL-T800 fuel tank, a jet engine fuel tank, and 2-5mT of other stuff, if you have enough wing. Go with multiples to go bigger, but remember that having a jet placed last in the middle gives you a good flameout warning, and that you are going for vacuum isp, because by the time you light the rockets you are pretty much out of atmo (which is why the aerospike is \u003Cem\u003Ethe worst\u003C/em\u003E engine for SSTO\u0027s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
