Main problems was overheat causing the main engine cluster to explode.

It was a hybrid SSTO with the main power from aerospikes and support from turbojets. The design worked really well when it came to getting into LKO. The vision grew a little and I wanted to reach the stars. This is why XKM-5 series is the only one with air breathing engines inside the main vessel. The XKM-5 series had \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E8 TurboJet engines, 16 Aerospike rockets and 8 LV-N rockets. I did explor the KR-2L option but overheats resulting in explosions and the first death of Jeb made me put that idea on the shelf for now. The turbojets on the 5-series forced a power-up on them for about 10 sec. before igniting the other engines so the TWR came above 1.
