Everything about this plane was about size. I didn\u0027t want to cut corners either, so as you can see I didn\u0027t use any mods and I didn\u0027t use the aid of SRBs for takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, due to its size, I can\u0027t properly test it. I don\u0027t know what the range of it is, or the max speed, or its flight ceiling, or its agility. It\u0027s too laggy for me to test. But hey, I got it off the ground, I\u0027m sure it can do more than that.
