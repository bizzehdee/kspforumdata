Today, I would like to present to you: The Forever Plane, a plane that can (theoretically) fly, you guessed it, forever! The reason is simple: I have the USI mods installed, and the plane\u0027s engine runs on Karbonite, and there are enough Karbonite intakes to power it! The one downside is: All the intakes and the engine take up A LOT of power, and since flying forever means flying at night, too, no solar panels. I need SIXTY-FOUR of the superpowered Near Future Electrical RTGs to provide enough power (at least according to AmpYear, which I trust). Still in the prototyping stages, so no .craft file yet, but it\u0027s coming soon. What are your thoughts on this idea/plane? (When Jeb was asked about it, he suggested getting rid of the emergency parachutes, because \u0022Safety is for sissies\u0022. Bob suggested adding more emergency parachutes. I compromised by keeping the amount of emergency parachutes at four.) To test the plane, I decided to return Val from a space station (Kelgee II), because Jeb, my normal test pilot, REFUSES to deploy the emergency parachutes and save his life if something goes wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T16:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is nice ... however not very practical :-P\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP crashes before you reach forever, or you shut it down to install 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAL 9000","CreatedById":140704,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T17:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222417121\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132407\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455812936\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002250750\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Azimech\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n39 minutes ago, Azimech said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is nice ... however not very practical :-P\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP crashes before you reach forever, or you shut it down to install 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt flies forever...
