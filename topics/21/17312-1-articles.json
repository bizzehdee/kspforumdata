Using some sort of magical science known as worm hole theory, we can teleport a spacecraft from one side of the Kerniverse to the other!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing was an absolute pain to get into orbit. I had to use the Gravitsapa mod part to even achieve lift off, and then I had a very weak thrust. Once I got into 0 atmosphere, I started to tilt, slowly gaining apoapsis and periapsis. The map informed me of a big problem - it was flying off into Kerbol orbit - so I had to use the vertical speed kill with the Gravitsapa, and with that, I forged an excellent orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy challenge to you, Kerbal Space Program forums...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... is to film / make a picture, of you, not only managing to fly this leviathan into orbit, but also flying a ship through it!
