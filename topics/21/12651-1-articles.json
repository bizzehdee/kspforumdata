The concept with Falcon 9 Heavy is taking their existing Falcon 9 rocket and adding two more of them as boosters, the boosters crossfeed fuel into the main rocket, so when the boosters drop off, the main rocket is still at full fuel. This lets it get more cargo to orbit by essentially placing a fully loaded Falcon 9 at a higher altitude and speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my design, I have 8 boosters, and they are dropped in pairs. All engines except the upper stage are firing constantly, so unlike a multi-stage design your lower stages aren\\\u0027t pushing up too much dead weight in engines, and you\\\u0027re always getting maximum thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second stage is just a generic lander... Land on Mun or Minmus with it, it has enough fuel to take back off and splash down on Kerbol. Or swap it out for your own lander or cargo for your own missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need less payload to orbit and want more fuel efficiency, just remove either pairs of boosters from the front (i.e. the first ones to drop off), or fuel tanks from the back (from the last stages to drop off).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T03:58:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPics are usually recommended, so we can see what we\\\u0027re talking about...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Analogy","CreatedById":28969,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T08:22:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MaverickSawyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MaverickSawyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPics are usually recommended, so we can see what we\\\u0027re talking about...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst shot: In the editor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: Just after launch, you can see that it is only burning fuel from two tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird: After first booster separation, you can see how the boosters fall off in pairs, leaving the other boosters burning and still full of fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth: On orbit of Kerbal with 15 tanks of fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFifth: On orbit of Minmus with about 11.5 tanks of fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s probably possible to beat these numbers for efficiency, I haven\\\u0027t experimented much with launch trajectories.

You want lots of thrust in the atmosphere where you\\\u0027re countering air resistance, but on orbit you want the least weight possible to get the most delta-v out of your fuel... Ideally I think you want to stage it so that it\\\u0027s down to a single engine by the time it\\\u0027s out of the atmosphere. The exact nature of the staging is highly dependent on the load you\\\u0027re carrying to orbit on the top stage (a heavier load means more gravity losses and time spent in the atmosphere), but I think efficiency will be improved by moving fuel tanks between the stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klopchuck","CreatedById":13421,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T22:34:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat system.
