Your flight profile should be to aim high and use the power of the first stage to give you a nice high apoapsis (40km) and a lead time until Ap of about 55s. You should stage at 20-23km and be at about 60 degrees. You can then use this time to gain some horizontal speed with the second stage while trying to keep as much vertical speed as you can. Start at 50 degrees at drop to about 20 degrees when you Ap is about 50-55km, you should level off before the end of the second stage with an Ap of 60-65Km At the end of the second stage you should have an Ap of about 60Km which is then about 90s away and a Pe under 20km. Burn until your Ap reaches 80Km. your Pe should then be about 50Km, circularise at Ap. Including the circularization burn you should have used about 100-150m/s of your third stage leaving you with about 900-950m/s. If flown using a FRT you will use 872m/s to perform Munar insertion leaving a small amount for adjustment and to send the remains of the S\u002BIVB into the Munar surface (if facing RAD\u002B when staged then the seperatrons will do that automatically), then no debris will be left except for the portion of the descent stage left on the Munar surface, a rover, the A.L.S.E.P and a flag if you planted one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI advise to land using the efficient method for low TWR craft (from a 15km orbit, set your Pe to 7km on the far side of the mun from your target, start to burn retro about 62-63 Km from your chosen landing spot, maintain height at least 2km above terrain unless fairly flat, choose landing spot when doing 150-200m/s, land)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elie this but better, hehe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XR4AktA82I8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Equicksave then stage the ALSEP to clear room for the rover.

You can then use this time to gain some horizontal speed with the second stage while trying to keep as much vertical speed as you can. Stage the escape tower after the second stage has started up without issues and is burning ok. Keep your nose at least 22 degrees above the horizon to preserve vertical speed. Your lead time until Ap wil drop to about 23 seconds then start to rise again. You should level off before the end of the second stage at about 50km when your Ap is 55Km and you have a lead time of 55s. At the end of the second stage you should still have an Ap of about 55Km which should then be at least 70s away. Carry on burning horizontally until your Ap reaches 80Km. your Pe should then be about 50Km and including the circularization burn you should have used about 300m/s of your third stage leaving you with about 950m/s if you are careful (my last flight I was left with 942m/s which is 1028 liquid fuel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA free return trajectory uses about 870m/s so there is a little room for error of about 80m/s which you could use for small mid course adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next stage splits the CM, MEM, fairing and dumps the empty stage 3. Switch focus to the MEM and undock the decoupler, switch back to the CM and dock the CM to the MEM trying not to trap the decoupler between the two. Your debris is then on a FRT to burn up back at Kerbin so you are free to adjust your mun approach to have a Pe of 10Km whenever you like. Enter orbit around Mun at 10km, transfer two idiots to the lander, separate and, early on the dark side, drop the Pe of your lander to 5Km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt your Pe early on the day side follow the landing procedure described by Astro-Not being careful not to slam into the side of a crater. The lander wants to tip down so keep your SAS on. There is a little spare maneuver fuel in the descent stage so you can pick a decent landing site to within a few km and avoid crater walls to some degree. try not to leave it as late as I did last time to touchdown, I was 5m up...

These have a probe core and so will happily roll across the surface and light up anything you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are done get back into the lander.

I have added SCIENCE! Refined fuel levels and redesigned the CM and lander (which are now completely stock)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have decided to release a few flavours. The most modded is the stretchy tanks, proc fairings, remotetech, mechjeb version. Then you also have the stretchy tanks, proc fairings and mechjeb version. The manually controlled stretchy tanks and proc fairings version and finally for the purists the stock CM and lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWork is still in progress, I will keep you informed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was guided to this design from looking at the Apollo engines, their relative power and the KSP engines and their relative power. I found obviously that the Mainsail with the thrust of 1500 matched the 1,500,000 thrust of the F1 and the 1.25T 215 power engine was the closest match for the J2 at 220,000 (which was also described as being very optimised for weight). I used the 1.5T 200 power engine for the centre engine as it had gimballing. I decided to use the poodle for the third stage as the J2 on the third stage was reportedly not as heavily refined for weight but had higher thrust(266,000). My strategy of having 750 mono as a placeholder for science worked well as science weighed a lot less so I no longer have the Dv issue with the CM. I have changed the engine for the CM to a more reasonable 30kn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upshot of this is that as with the Saturn V there is a very overpowered first stage and a relatively underpowered second and third stages especially if you compare this craft to many kerbal craft which means your flight profile should be to aim high and use the power of the first stage to give you a nice high apoapsis and a lead time until Ap of about 55s. You can then use this time to gain some horizontal speed with the second stage while trying to keep as much vertical speed as you can. you should level off before the end of the second stage with an Ap of 55Km At the end of the second stage you should have an Ap of about 60Km which is then about 90s away. Carry on burning horizontally until your Ap reaches 80Km. your Pe should then be about 50Km and including the circularization burn you should have used about 300m/s of your third stage leaving you with about 950m/s if you are careful (my last flight I was left with 923m/s which is 1031 liquid fuel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA free return trajectory uses about 870m/s so there is a little room for error of about 50m/s which you could use for small mid course adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next stage splits the CM, MEM, fairing and dumps the empty stage 3. Switch focus to the MEM and undock the decoupler, switch back to the CM and dock the CM to the MEM trying not to trap the decoupler between the two. Your debris is then on a FRT to burn up back at Kerbin so you are free to adjust your mun approach to have a Pe of 10Km whenever you like. Enter orbit around Mun at 10km, transfer two idiots to the lander, separate and, on the dark side, drop the Pe of your lander to 5Km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt your Pe on the day side follow the landing procedure described by Astro-Not being careful not to slam into the side of a crater. The lander wants to tip down so keep your SAS on. There is a little maneuver fuel in the descent stage so you can pick a decent landing site to within a few km and avoid crater walls to some degree. try not to leave it as late as I did last time to touchdown, I had 1m/s Dv left...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen landed press action group 1 which will turn on your lights, drop the rover (after putting on its lights and brakes), extend the ladder and put on some classical music (not really about the last one, you have to do that yourself)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalk on the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the rover is upside down then use the landing gear to right it.
