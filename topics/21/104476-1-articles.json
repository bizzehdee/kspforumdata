The limitation is rocket mass (up to 50t) and weight distributio - very top-heavy rockets are not recommended. Platform has crane with 8 reaction wheels and balancing fuel tanks that works as counter-weights. Basic operations is very simple: put rocket on platform\u0027s decupler (empty upper stages fuel tanks - you will pump fuel to them after crane is in vertical position). Drive to launch site. Break connection between platform rover and crane by decoupling small docking port (by right-clicking or action group 1). Raise 2 landing legs on rover part, that holds crane from turning. Switch to crane and rotate it to vertical position. Raise crane\u0027s legs to make sure it will not move after rocket liftoff. Pump fuel from balancing tanks to rocket. Launch!\n\nPlatform has interrior with 2 ladders for access from ground and to upper deck. Download includes stanalone platform and platform with mounted 45t 3-stage rocket with upper stage (1-kerbal lander) capable to reach Moon (with return), Duna, etc Jool (one way).\n\nParts count: 251 (all stock)\n\nDry weight: 60t (16t - fuel in balancing tanks)\n\nMaximum launch weight: ~50t\n\nMax speed: 12 m/s (on flat surface) up 25 m/s (downhill)\n\nMax slope: 25 degrees\n\nCrew: 2 kerbals\n\n**Projections:** (made with help of \u0022Exploded ship view\u0022 plugin! best editor plugin ever!):\n\n![1eVgg9x.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1eVgg9x.jpg)\n\n**Operator manual:**\n\n![8hFockn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8hFockn.jpg)\n\n**GALLERY**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I think it is possible to make such platform for 3.5 m parts size and 150-200 launch mass, but parts count will be arount ~1000 (you need many structural elements and struts to make big chassis)."},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T15:49:13Z","Content":"I wonder how far you could cut down the part count using UbioWelding?"},{"CreatedByName":"1greywind","CreatedById":82369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T15:53:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I wonder how far you could cut down the part count using UbioWelding?\n\nIt is possible - chassis, casing, crane base - all can be welded together.
