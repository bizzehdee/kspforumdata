Demonstrates the new part rotation in the Spaceplane Hangar, which, incidentally, allows you to build things horizontally then launch them vertically by rotating the command pod. Or build parts of them upside down. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot48gd.png](http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/5519/screenshot48gd.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot55b.png](http://img407.imageshack.us/img407/6703/screenshot55b.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot70c.png](http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/9062/screenshot70c.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot71l.png](http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/597/screenshot71l.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nIf only it could get into orbit... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nIt\\\u0027s a bit tricky to get to fly, one needs to turn on the ASAS, RCS and apply full throttle for takeoff, but keep an eye on the roll, because as fuel runs out and atmospheric conditions change it tends to wobble.\n\nEDIT: If anybody can get this thing to land in one piece, powered or unpowered, you get a medal.

I managed to glide it horizontally at 20m/s vertical speed, I\\\u0027m not sure if it could land at that speed however, so MOAR WHEELS. Fitted with drag chute and emergency chute, just in case. Also, all engines fire on take-off. I managed to get it halfway out the atmosphere before it ran out of fuel ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
