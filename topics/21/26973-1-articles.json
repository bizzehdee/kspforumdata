In theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this new mechjeb (2.0) all my SSTOs became much more efficient, thanks to that neat option that controls the thrust to avoid flame outs. So I decided to rework some of my successful SSTOs and voila, orbit with a generous amount of fuel left! taking a step further I swapped the engine it had for a nuclear engine and it still reached orbit with lots of fuel, but with that engine in orbit its reach is big enough for a mun travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a test trip, the plane had no landing struts, no ladders, no lights, just the essential. But I kept pushing it forward \u0022I wonder if I can get into mun orbit\u0022, then \u0022oh, I can. Nice. I wonder if nuclear engines are powerful enough to land\u0022, then \u0022I wonder if I can land the plane standing upright with no landing gears\u0022... \u0022IT CAN\u0022 The return trip was a bit tense though, there was a spit of fuel left but it was enough to leave mun and get an interception with kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. By pure dumb luck I ended up near the ksc\u0027s runway, not very close but it has plenty of lift so it\u0027s possible to glide between continents from very high altitudes, if you\u0027re careful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a couple of screenshots, I wasn\u0027t planning to document anything...

A rover drove from the base to the landing site carrying one of the base crew to the plane so it can return to kerbin. That would be the use of the space plane, carrying astronauts one at a time lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.minus.com/ibxNlHqUFCVuqr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ibxNlHqUFCVuqr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eback home \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E (and a bugged kerbal stuck in the T-pose)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.minus.com/imks3kSzwzjoq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022imks3kSzwzjoq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can upload the craft file if anyone\u0027s interested but there\u0027s an annoying problem with the fuel lines that ended up using fuel asymmetrically, so you might prefer waiting for an updated version.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-15T14:27:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2013 02:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by diegzumillo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunJumper","CreatedById":27062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T14:29:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think autopilot use still allows the craft to be stock, if you remove the autopilot.
