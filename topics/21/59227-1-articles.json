It is capable of 180 degree turns with pitch or yaw so you can turn the ship right around and fly her back in the opposite direction thanks to the large amount of SAS it carries, (50.3 I believe). This works best at half throttle but can also do this at full throttle. Although this ship is aerodynamically balanced I wouldn\u0027t recommend flying without SAS as it is extremely twitchy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe visible wings are fixed but there are control surfaces clipped into the body to aid in turning, balance and to give it a fair amount of lift if you need to glide into a landing. Try not to hit your landing spot too hard as there are so many parts clipped into the body that it may explode!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel tank is clipped into the cockpit so you will have to keep clicking on the underside of the ship to access that. There is also a small control ring under the nose tip for remote piloting. RCS thrusters and an RTG are clipped inside the cockpit too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting Jet Engine TWR = 3.63\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting Rocket DeltaV = 860 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFully fuelled Rocket DeltaV = 1229 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHotkey 1 = Jet engine toggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHotkey 2 = Rocket engine toggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHotkey 3 = Antenna toggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHotkey 4 = Toggle ladder\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hxeG3SD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hxeG3SD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/knUI3cM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022knUI3cM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oy1AxVQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oy1AxVQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cpdaexa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cpdaexa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/w228d5cjvizx2fg/Delta%20Flyer.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload here!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this will be of use to someone or at least fun to mess about with. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T21:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey that\u0027s cute.

I haven\u0027t tried but if you mean get into a 120km orbit and dock with a ship I\u0027m pretty sure that won\u0027t be a problem. Getting back to Kerbin and landing without refuel may be a problem though. There is potential to place extra fuel in the nose cone using 2 toroidal fuel tanks and 3 probe fuel tanks which would make it capable of that but when I tried it I couldn\u0027t get the ship to use the fuel and because the tanks are hidden in the nose I don\u0027t think you could transfer the spare fuel to the main tank in the cockpit. It\u0027ll easily get to a station in a 100km orbit for refuelling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
