It also burns about that much getting there. I haven\u0027t tried landing it yet, but I\u0027m guessing a KSC landing is a must and that the fuel should be near empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to building a plane based on the massive new tanks and engines. the 380 Isp (fourth best liquid-fueled in stock, behind the aerospike, the LV-909 and the nuke) and \u0026gt;39 vacuum TWR (best in stock) for the Kerbodyne KR-2L engine makes it ideal for such applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is of course that we currently don\u0027t have any efficient way to provide a satisfactory number of jet engines to match such monsters. Even sticking them on cubic octagonal struts, one might possibly be able to fit about 7 without bad clipping into the same area. But this generates severe drag in FAR. The alternatives aren\u0027t much better, quad-adapters can attach only to 2.5 meter parts and take up awkwardly little space on 3.75. I guess putting a ring of orange tanks and quad-adapters around an S3-14400 might work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-02T09:32:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2014 09:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
