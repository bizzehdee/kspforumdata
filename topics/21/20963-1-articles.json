The IV has a very simple, and small launch stage, and the LARP has very very awesome upper stages. All of them are capable of my goals for all my interplanetary ships, reaching my favorite planet, Jool, and its awesome moon system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIP-B IV (Interplanetary Probe, Second Program Restart, Fourth Ship in the Program)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIP-B IV is the top picture in the attachments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IV is the latest in the IP series. It was designed for the single purpose of getting a much fuel as possible into space without lagging my computer to the next decade.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IV was used to place ships in orbit of all of Jool\u0027s moons except Bop. It also landed at Laythe, Orbited both Duna and Eve, Touched down on Ike (for a second, I had to abort right after the ship touched the ground), it also landed on both Duna and Eve, and from Duna returned to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IV, however barely had enough fuel to park into one of Jool\u0027s three closest moons, it took too much fuel to get to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IV, also, was unable to reach Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a Few pics of my journeys with the ship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/xGjVY#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/xGjVY#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL.A.R.P. I (Long Range Atmospheric Probe, first [maybe last] ship in the program)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarp is the second attached picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Larp was designed to have higher delta v than the IV, and also to be smaller and easier to control. All of the goals have been completed spectacularly, in fact there have been no changes to the ship since the very first test flight except the addition of the heat shield mod and a back shell! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom stage gets this ship well into space, the second circularizes, and is the interplanetary booster stage, getting the ship as far as Duna and most of the way to Jool. The third stage has plenty of fuel to visit every Joolian moon and return to Kerbin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage Galleries of the ship can be found here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/bwf4o#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/bwf4o#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
