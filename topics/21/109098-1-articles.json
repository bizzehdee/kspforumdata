But it\u0027s compensated for by the reduction in altitude available to jets: you can get off the runway with much less engine, but you need to carry a lot more oxidiser. And, as in stock, the RAPIERs have a substantial flat spot in their powerband around the transsonic region. Get \u0027em up to speed and they accelerate very rapidly, but if your streamlining isn\u0027t good enough you\u0027ll never get up to speed in the first place.\n\nIt\u0027s different, but not \u0022wrong\u0022. And the power boost means that you no longer need to strap on a dozen engines just to get a Mk3 off the ground; four turbojets will do just fine for 747-sized monsters."},{"CreatedByName":"Hektos","CreatedById":84721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T15:18:01Z","Content":"What are yall using to get those propeller engines?"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T15:33:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What are yall using to get those propeller engines?\n\nWe are using KAX.\n\nIt\u0027s a bit overpowered for FAR without AJE, but it should update anytime soon."},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T15:42:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I see lots of big SSTOs running on very few rapiers, I did not make SSTOs on nuFAR, but does it feel overpowered?\n\u003E @FourGreenFields: They look awesome!\n\u003E \n\u003E You just reminded me that I need to give a pass on my propeller airplanes!\n\u003E \n\u003E New screenshot key?

They certainly have a lot of power at sea level, maybe even too much, but once you reach 20 km and above where you need to gain speed above 4 mach, RAPIERS start to loose thrust quickly. While it is possible to bring nearly 100t craft to 20 km with only 2 rapiers, you need 4 rapiers to be able to gain speed.\n\nNew temperature feature, either if you use stock or deadly re-entry certainly brings some more stuff to pay attention when you design plane."},{"CreatedByName":"Sterbehilfe","CreatedById":143748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T15:50:11Z","Content":"\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

(mostly for intakes)\n\u003E As you can see it has a nice curvature cross sectional area drag profile:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/31867631257700713/6BCE522270D7227DA8D65ED3F9C6F65DBDD59BE2/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/31867631257700713/6BCE522270D7227DA8D65ED3F9C6F65DBDD59BE2/)\n\u003E \n\u003E I think I was reaching about 30km in altitude before I fired up the rocket engines. And about mach 5.5 usually... My goal of this craft was to bring fuel or cargo into space and then land back at the base.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/31865257804887491/653C6BFF12317FAA34576764C760EF10BFE21FE3/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/31865257804887491/653C6BFF12317FAA34576764C760EF10BFE21FE3/)\n\u003E \n\u003E In that shot I was already on my way back to Kerbin and had still half of my fuel left. I felt great considering that I had so much fuel to spare and had such a huge weight on board.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/31865257804874909/4F30E2B5CF188FF16E305BD19810FC546BDFCD65/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/31865257804874909/4F30E2B5CF188FF16E305BD19810FC546BDFCD65/)\n\u003E \n\u003E I had the idea of slowing down with a parachute. I landed on the runway and pretty much stopped faster than I thought I would... I haven\u0027t yet tried new chutes since nuFAR... But this plane was amazing with the old FAR ... I\u0027ll make a version two of this when I get a proc wing mod working with nuFAR.\n\u003E \n\u003E By the way, this planes cargo was a Rockomax 64 jumbo fuel tank that weighs about 34 ton. Most peoples SSTO\u0027s are about that. I could probably carry the average SSTO with this beast. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nDidn\u0027t think B9 worked yet with the nuFAR yet or 1.0.2."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T19:16:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Didn\u0027t think B9 worked yet with the nuFAR yet or 1.0.2.\n\nnuFAR compatibility doesn\u0027t require many changes (if any). Wings are still using the same modules, and everything else is done based on part shape. As for general 1.0.2 compatibility there are some more serious issues like heating and the new thrust curves for airbreathers."}]}
