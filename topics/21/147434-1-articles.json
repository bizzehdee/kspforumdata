There are currently 12 different modules (7 of which are included below) which can be arranged in whatever way is necessary to explore the inner planets. There are currently three configurations: crew transport (which includes a centrifuge module and is the only version that can go as far as Jool), freight transport (which is uncrewed and has a lot of cargo space) and compound crew/cargo transport (such as the IPT Red Star below). Initial cargoes (such as a Duna Exploration Vehicle) are shipped in the cargo bay whilst the vehicle is being constructed, and future cargoes will be shipped independently. Spent heat shields must be replaced using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrgana-class transports are primarily designed for exploring planets between Eve and Dres (or Arkas and Richell with those mods installed). The crew transport configuration can carry more kerbals and travel as far as Jool, but it has a limited cargo capacity and so cannot effectively conduct exploration missions on its own. In the early game, the compound configurations (like below) are most effective, whereas later on it becomes more cost-effective to use a separate freighter and crew transport for a planet. The convenient thing about the modular system is that a compound crew/cargo transport can easily be changed into either of the more specific variants by simply moving modules around until the correct ones are included.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tvMwCz6.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tvMwCz6.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vessel above is constructed from 8 Organa-class modules (2 of which are identical).
