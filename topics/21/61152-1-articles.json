One of the most cool things I found is that it can turn/move around with the RCS thrusts with no noticeable wobble. I did use MechJeb to get it at a circularized orbit as well as launching at right times to be able to dock without too many worries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HEiCNA6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HEiCNA6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyHook","CreatedById":31496,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T21:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, welcome to the forums! I think your station looks excellent. Now that mechjeb has shown you how to dock, you should try to master it yourself. It really is a great skill to learn and will open doors for you. great station, and keep up to good work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cobalt60","CreatedById":101465,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T22:52:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat job!
