Well, here it is, I hope you like it! Personally, I think this is the best one of the line, even though it looks deceptively simple. Here, a promo pic with the company flag!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EcwCCzH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EcwCCzH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E the White Dart? Well, historically it is a light SSTO, the best looking one I manage to make, which I offer in several versions. This time, I actually outdid myself on that front: \u003Cem\u003Eeven though there is only one file with a 80 part craft, I am still giving four different White Dart versions: VTOL, Science!, Shuttle, and Scout\u003C/em\u003E. Yup, \u003Cstrong\u003Efour ships in one\u003C/strong\u003E. Let me explain that further, and for that I need the picture directly below. THAT is what you load in the SPH looks like. Obviously, it won\u0027t fly like that. The idea is that there is a mission module right in the middle of the ship, and you select each one depending on the mission. By default it is configured in the \u0022Science!\u0022 version, which includes all science instruments in a downwards-opening bay (so your kerbals have no trouble accessing it on the surface), plus a couple of rocket VTOL auxiliary engines to handle Duna/low gravity landings. But if you want to go further, or explore kerbin being able to land atop mountains, or you want to rescue up to five kerbals stranded in orbit, there is another version of the Dart just waiting for you to take out the middle module, stick one of the ones on the back, and put the engine section back in. Just remember to grab the engine section by the shielded docking port, and you may have to turn on part clipping to get things to connect again, the editor is sometimes finicky. There is an exploded view on the album, BTW, in case you need the diagram to work things out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2rgrzjh.png\u0022 alt=\u00222rgrzjh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is the most obvious feature of the family, and the one you need to know about the most, but there a ton of others, so let\u0027s get to it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, it draws fuel from both tanks at the same time. That is not only difficult to do, it also means that the CoM stays put in the same spot for 80% of the flight, and even on almost-empty tanks it doesn\u0027t move to where you can\u0027t compensate with thrust vectoring and reaction wheels. So perfect VTOL handling from full to empty, whether it is on airbreathing or rocket VTOL engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Science!\u0022 and \u0022Scout\u0022 versions sport VTOL rocket engines, and have the delta-V to make a Duna SSTO run, up-and-down or the other way around. So they are more or less designed to be able to land on most places (save the usual suspects, Tylo and Eve) and take off again, if starting from low orbit. The scout, in fact, is mostly just a stripped-down version with the least dry mass and the greatest fuel capacity. Unrefueled, it is capable of Minmus orbital missions, and I have a hunch if you do things very, very well, and burn the monoprop when yo have to (ASAP, since it\u0027s the lowest-isp propulsion), it has enough oomph to do a Minmus surface mission (which, done right, takes a lot less delta-v than a Munar landing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamic handling is what you should be expecting on a ship by me with this name: a dream. You can lock pretty much any heading on SAS at any time, and if you drop controls it will still stabilize by itself prograde in almost no time. The low wing loading means it lands on a breeze and takes off at about 50m/s, and it still has the T/W to make a rather fast climb. Having the single engine means that airhogging is simple as it can be, and you milk every last m/s out of the atmosphere before switching on rockets (the RAPIER is on manual setting by default so you can push it further after it flames out by dropping throttle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZHZGtQf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZHZGtQf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this is mostly subjective, but the looks have also been a staple of the family: across all versions, the thing that has made the White Dart distinctive in my mind from the other SSTO\u0027s I build is, that when I\u0027m done with them I just can\u0027t imagine how to build a cooler looking one. Seriously, this is perhaps what took the longest: a hundred little details and tiny corrections in the placement of parts to get the cleanest, coolest lines possible without screwing with the practicality of the design. As a tiny example, consider how the docking port is placed: it faces down, so when you dock you get enough clearance, you kerbal can exit the ship without bumping into anything, it puts the RCS tank close to the CoM to help balance, and it means these things can still dock in pairs to my Medusa class transports and look even better than they did when docked (check the last pic at the album). I hope you guys think the same thing about the aesthetics, because it is the reason I didn\u0027t release this \u003Cem\u003Eweeks\u003C/em\u003E ago: I knew I could make it look better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, part count is plain ridiculous. All versions are between 50 and 55, if I recall correctly. So even if you play KSP on a crappy netbook, this is still a ship you can use. Consider that the whole file with the three extra modules is just 80 parts: I outdid myself there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/6HXR0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Yeah, the rear tank (as well as the engine) is isolated form normal fuel flow by clipping stuff to its end nodes. I then use the top structural intake as a kind of fuel distribution system, with both tanks the same number of connections away, so they have the same priority drawing fuel. Works like a charm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the backwards-facing intakes, used to be they would work just fine. I think they worked with the angle relative to velocity vector, but it had to be capped a 90 degrees or something, because 180 would work just as fine as 0. However, that might have been fixed in 0.24, because now the trick works much worse. They do still draw air like non-compressing intakes do, I think, but the effect seems to be less dramatic now. But, you can\u0027t deny it looks really sweet the way they merge with the tail and that is the biggest reason they are there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Used to be backwards-facing intakes made less drag, too. But now I\u0027m sure of nothing, so don\u0027t believe me and experiment yourself! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"omen124","CreatedById":100602,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T17:17:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love this new design it looks so awesome BUT i kind of miss the fact that there was always a way to dock (on top of the other features) and the tail landing struts allowed for a VTOL like landing with the nose up and the ladder you could climb down.

It just opens on the belly so you have even more clearance and don\u0027t have to worry about the tailplanes hitting something. Plus, it\u0027s the main RCS tank... maybe I should have shown it open in the pictures. And as to landings, well... apart from the shuttle and the Jet-powered VTOL versions, the others have rocket VTOL engines for airless landings, that way I can handle all kinds of landings with the single, light set of landing gear. Ends up saving parts and weight marginally, and improving the smoothness of the design greatly.

You get the most range, and robust rocket VTOL systems with fast response. Being chemical it doesn\u0027t have tremendous range, but you can always refuel along the way.
