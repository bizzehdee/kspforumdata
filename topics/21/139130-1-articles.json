For easier reenrty: use a 2.5m heatshield and adjust the ablator to 160 or 240, that makes it easier and avoids flips in the atmosphere (pe on reentry around 25km).

Of course that will do more harm than good. But it will of course also add significant power to the SAS system, which could easily make the difference between ending up upright vs. sideways. Anyway, I seldom find that I make somebody feel like they\u0027ve actually been helped by telling them they\u0027re doing it all wrong from the get-go. YMMV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t forgotten, I never used RCS to land on the Mun, ever.\u00A0 It\u0027s not that hard to do it without it.\u00A0 All I can think is maybe you have a different approach to actually landing because none of the ways I have ever landed needed RCS. \u00A0 Even back when I was doing the whole inefficient, \u0022kill your orbit and come straight down method\u0022\u00A0 I still didn\u0027t use RCS\u00A0 (which I will also not teach btw, it\u0027s a terrible way to land and again it just teaches you to do it badly).\u00A0 Practice makes perfect of course, I didn\u0027t land on my first try, but it was probably only the 4th or 5th attempt that I got it to stick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour last sentence is just ridiculous outright.\u00A0 I have no idea what you are referencing there.\u00A0 I told him how to improve his craft, that is what he asked for.\u00A0 In fact if you are going to try and make thinly veiled accusations that don\u0027t even make sense I\u0027m done discussing it with you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
