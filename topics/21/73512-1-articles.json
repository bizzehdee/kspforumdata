It has good suspension due to inherent chassis flexibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe signature Tri-Star wheels don\u0027t spin, and they should have 8 wheels on the ground instead of 4, but I couldn\u0027t get them to work that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe front and rear wheels spun in opposite directions, so I had to rotate the tri-Stars to \u0022raised\u0022 position. This provides plenty of ground clearance at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal Robotics would likely be an excellent addition to the TriStar wheels if the RoveMax XL3 rotation problem had a fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafe turn speed about 10m/s, but don\u0027t try to exceed 30m/s, because the RoveMax XL3 wheels will break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI accidentally included an S2 fuel tank in the center pod, but that can be easily exchanged for a crew pod or other utility pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFour Goodspeed nuclear UNSFE-400 reactors contained in the wheel assemblies provide plenty of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFour mono tanks are included to take advantage of the S2 command pod RCS for stability control and decent guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore work can be done with the gantry, perhaps bringing it along the sides instead of over the spine, but that would require\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eheavier structure and further reduce TWR. I\u0027ll probably experiment with standard I-beams on my next version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was quite fun building the launch rig for this beast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use MechJeb, which had no problems launching. There is a slight CoM imbalance, so manual launches should be interesting. I used Sarbian\u0027s AutoGimbal to adjust for the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface TWR is pretty low at 1.18, so expect a slow ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a standard 40% curve, 75x75 LKO, then transfer to Mun with a nuclear engine which is ejected prior to descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small probe core at the top of the gantry provides a convenient control point, and plenty of struts ensure the LandMaster is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eperfectly stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce landed, you can either launch the gantry vertically, or use the stack separators to eject the gantry end caps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the staging would make it appear that the nuclear engine doesn\u0027t contain enough DV for Mun circularization, creative use of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Fuel balancer should ensure you make a safe orbit. Transfer any remaining fuel back into the decent gantry prior to attempting landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also pull out the extra fuel from the LandMaster to maximize your DV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: I used 276 DV to circularize at 93x93, dumped all the extra liquid fuel, and still had 1100 DV for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only used about 700, so there is plenty of margin. (i.e., I over-built)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings to fix:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS is not balanced, they are off center due to current gantry configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGantry/LandMaster CoM could use some love. A lighter gantry would help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsymmetric gantry mass(tail is heavier than front) causes some abnormalities during decent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdated Munshine lifter rated for 95 (LandMaster \u002B gantry) tons with TWR \u0026gt; 2 would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA series of functional center pods (Kethane mining, communications, kerbal transport, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would LOVE an S2 tail section with a cargo door, so a small rover can be carried!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve played with some part welding to reduce my partcount, and have had some success, but i still have a long way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 (S2 fuselages, lights)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHyomoto (Blade Antenna)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Future Propulsion (Modular Girders)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoodspeed (Clamp-o-tron 2i Sr. Docking Ports, Nuclear Reactors)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote Tech 2 (antennas)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKWRocketry (EAS-4 Struts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunshine Lifters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESarbian\u0027s AutoGimbal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/zP9ZH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMy IMGUR Gallery\u003C/a\u003E I\u0027ve updated the image descriptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrafts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeath Valley Gen 1, test article:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/cpnt5m2cskyw3jh/Death%20Valley%20Mk%201.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/cpnt5m2cskyw3jh/Death%20Valley%20Mk%201.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeath Valley Gen 2, Fully kitted out, with 4 nuclear reactors for power.:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ol94ud1icc52kkc/Death%20Valley.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ol94ud1icc52kkc/Death%20Valley.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeath Valley Gen 4, Nuclear Generators removed from wheels, small kethane generator installed.
