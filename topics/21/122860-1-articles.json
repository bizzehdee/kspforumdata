This build was just something that i tought might be a little more interesting/special than making another Concordeish replica, so i desided to choose this a little more unknown aircraft that was one of Boeings plans of entering in to the world of supersonic passenger transport. The real aircraft is very interesting in terms of its landing/flight mode aka when the aircraft is landing the nose gets folded down from two points (it gets folded down forward of the windshield and also the very tip of the nose gets folded up to avoid it from hitting the ground), also the wings fold out like you would see in an F-14 or the Panavia Tornado \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
