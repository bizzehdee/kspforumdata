You know what I mean... That moment when you\u0026#39;ve just finished rescuing your fourth and final Kerbal stranded around Kerbin and finished your transfer burn to go pick up the one on the Mun, after which you will head to Min, grab two there, then head out of Kerbin\u0026#39;s SOI just for a second, following which you will return home to Kerba Firma for a well deserved day off, sitting on the veranda sipping cold hydrazine with some friends... oh but wait... did I remember to put parachutes on this craft? OOOPS!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMost of us have had moments like these, and it really sucks! How will you get back?!?! It\u0026#39;s really embarrassing to return to Kerbin orbit and make that radio call... \u0022Flight, this is rescue 7, requesting you send up a ship with parachutes to bring the rescuers and rescuees home.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFriends, I have a solution and it\u0026#39;s a great one! We all know how critical weight is on these multi-landing missions. Every ton you take up with you costs you 10 tons or more in fuel, so imagine taking that ton (or 3) up, then through half a dozen transfers around Kerbin for local rescues, to the Mun, landing on the Mun, lifting off again, then to Min, out of Kerb SOI, and back again? How much fuel does hauling 1-3 tons of gear that will only be needed for Kerbin landing support all around the system cost? So next time you forget chutes, don\u0026#39;t sweat it. When you make that radio call, let them know that the chutes were left behind on purpose to save the expense of hauling them everywhere, and have them send up this craft for an orbital rendezvous!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[imgur]E8j2n[/imgur]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/9edfz6awmwdd6vc/OoopsIForgotSomething.craft?dl=0\u0022]Craft File[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMods Used: \u003Cbr\u003E\nLithobrake Exploration Technologies\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpaceY Lifters\u003Cbr\u003E\nProcedural Fairings\u003Cbr\u003E\nNear Future Construction\u003Cbr\u003E\nStockalike Station Parts\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanny\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T21:49:33Z","Content":"\nYou didn\u0026#39;t really describe what it does?

It also has reaction wheels, batteries, solar panels, and a HECS, so it could be an autonomous craft. I suppose you could even put a claw in place of the docking port and then use it as an RCS tug with chutes to rescue smaller craft in Kerbit orbit and bring them safely down without risking another Kerbal... But mainly it just gives you a way to save face when you forgot to add that stuff to your ship: Oh yeah - I meant to leave that behind so I would save fuel! :cool:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanny\n"}]}
