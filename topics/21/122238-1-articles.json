Sounds great! But how, I mused, does one pull an asteroid? None of the ships I had built so far really had any such capability. So Bill and I set to work on the problem and here is our solution; The \u0027Roid Puller! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch vehicle shown in some of the shots is not stock. The \u0027Roid Puller itself is stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027The Roid puller is designed for a solo pilot and may also be flown remotely. Her four nuclear rocket engines are fed by 32000 units of liquid fuel stored along her wings. She is 22.9m across either direction and 10.2m in height. She was designed with class E asteroids in mind and should be able to handle smaller objects with ease. 189 parts and 210 tons of pure \u0027roid pullin\u0027 love!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/1ZrGg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
