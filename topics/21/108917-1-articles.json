A spaceplane able to reach every planet or moon in the Kerbol System. I tried many times to achieve a similar result in a more stock(ish) way.\n\nAfter days of hard work and nights of projecting, I\u0027m here to present to you the mighty \u0022THREE KATS\u0022\n\n![sesl92L.png](http://i.imgur.com/sesl92L.png)\n\n![F2U2xhY.png](http://i.imgur.com/F2U2xhY.png)\n\n![vUH26fO.png](http://i.imgur.com/vUH26fO.png)\n\nHe can deliver great payloads in LKO, Eve, Duna and probably also Laythe. Be careful, in case of landing on one of those planets, you\u0027ll be probably unable to return.\n\nRequested Mods:\n\nTweak Scale: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112693-1-0-2-TweakScale-v2-1%28May-2%29-recompile-new-Stock-part](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112693-1-0-2-TweakScale-v2-1%28May-2%29-recompile-new-Stock-part) (for the wings)\n\nInstell Incorporated Experimental Technologies: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119735-1-0-2-Instell-Incorporated-Experimental-Technologies](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119735-1-0-2-Instell-Incorporated-Experimental-Technologies) (the very useful Scramjet engines)\n\nSpacey Heavy Lifter: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408-1-0-2-SpaceY-Heavy-Lifter-Parts-Pack-v0-13-%282015-05-09%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408-1-0-2-SpaceY-Heavy-Lifter-Parts-Pack-v0-13-%282015-05-09%29) (the cluster of Ramjet engines)\n\nFully compatible with FAR and the new version of DRE.\n\nFlight Plan: Engage the Ramjet with the AG 2, take off and go very steeply to a high pitch (50/60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0), while throttle down the engines. From 5/6 Km of altitude, reduce your pitch at 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, throttle up until you reach 400 m/s, enable the Scramjets with the AG 3, maintain a pitch of 10/15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, reached the 700 m/s, engage also the nukes with AG 1.\n\nCongratulations, you\u0027re in orbit with 75% of fuel in your tanks.\n\nShip Download: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/2l96an3mcy1eorw/Three%20Kats.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2l96an3mcy1eorw/Three%20Kats.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T16:12:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nansuchao**"},{"CreatedByName":"8bitsblu","CreatedById":61636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T17:41:48Z","Content":"It\u0027s great to see people taking interest in my mod! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I just added a new electronic engine if you wanna try that too, I bet you could find a good use for it."},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T18:03:03Z","Content":"Very good.

I know it\u0027s not still perfect. I used intake for nukes cause I hate to spam intakes all over a ship. \n\nWith the nuFAR if you want to manage supersonic speed is mandatory to avoid excessive wing area, that\u0027s the reason for the fins used as wings, they\u0027re not so huge as area and have good control surfaces.\n\nTAC Fuel Balancer is highly recommended as you said for the nukes and for the balance of the ship.\n\nI put RCS to help stability during re entry, cause the ship is pretty manageable, but it can happen to yaw and roll.\n\nHoudini seems pretty balanced, for that high speed requested. \n\nI was able with that configuration to reach Eve easily and also Laythe, but short with fuel. \n\nAn issue with that ship for the moment is the low TWR for orbital maneuvers. But I\u0027m not sure about another couple of nukes...\n\nIf you have some ideas, feel free to suggest, I would like to improve this design, it seems promising:-)"},{"CreatedByName":"8bitsblu","CreatedById":61636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T03:11:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Tried it.

Now I saw some Dr. Jet Chop Shop engines that seems very useful and can replace the NERVA in Vacuum.
