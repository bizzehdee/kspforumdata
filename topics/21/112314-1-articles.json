This saves a ton of money over detaching the command pod and landing it (and junking everything else.) The obvious problem however is how to get kerbals and data back home. For years now I\u0027ve been trying to build the holy grail of crew rotation transports, which for me is a craft that is the following:\n\n1. Gets to orbit and precisely back to KSC with no staging or discarded parts.\n2. Carries at least 4 kerbals as passengers (can operate with 0).\n3. Is bloody effortless to fly, takes off vertically, lands vertically with parachutes. I am a rocket scientist, not a jet pilot.\n4. Has no wings. See #3 for why. (Some may remember my [previous thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95858-Wings-Who-needs-em-%28Serious-question-%29) about my troubled relationship with wings.)\n5. Vanilla parts.\n\nI believe at last I have done so. Behold, the Air Taxi.\n\n![6qalbAK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6qalbAK.jpg)\n\nThis thing is so easy to fly it brings tears to my eyes.

I really would love to know as I like this approach of a crew shuttle!\n\nHere\u0027s the profile I used in my test:\n\nLaunch with SAS on, incline 5 degrees East as you reach 50 m/s\n\nOnce your craft\u0027s direction and prograde indicator match (around 20 seconds later, or less), engage Prograde Hold on the SAS.\n\nLet it ride all the way to 21 km altitude, at which point you may engage the rocket.\n\nAt 26 km your jets will die. Your craft should be pointing roughly 45 degrees up East by then.\n\nCut thrust when Apoapsis reaches 75 km, place a maneuver node for circularization (you should have a minute or so to fiddle with it).\n\nPast 60 km altitude, point the craft to maneuver node, and apply full rocket thrust. Your Burn Time should indicate something around 2 minutes, and your ETA to maneuver should read 45-50 seconds. If you did not mess anything, you\u0027ll be in orbit with 10% of fuel remaining.\n\n[Edit] Oh, a couple tips: use Action Groups to enable/disable all the jets\u002Bintakes, and the rocket, seperately. And you should lock the liquid fuel on the two main tanks until just before lighting up the rocket, so the jets won\u0027t pull fuel from them and unbalance the LFO mix.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T10:40:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 10:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jesrad**"},{"CreatedByName":"Theysen","CreatedById":144656,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T14:56:43Z","Content":"Thank you very much Jesrad, I simply forgot to lock the tanks and ended up with less fuel to be burnt by the rocket, didnt check that the small hardpoints don\u0027t lock the fuel crossfeed! \n\nGot it into orbit now and I am kind of hooked with more designs like this.
