The rotational joints are from InfernalRobotics, almost everything else is stock. The 3 engine modules are rotatable through 90 degrees, although it\u0027s only really stable within roughly the middle 50 degrees (I need to write a small mod or use something to define a profile for the tail thruster angle to improve stability through all phases of flight). It is possible to do a normal config takeoff (i.e. with the engines fully forward, or a VTOL style takeoff as shown in the gallery, with the engines tilted to approx 60 degrees).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to the gallery: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/gyKHA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/gyKHA\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope it\u0027s inspiring, enjoy the gallery and I hope this might give some ideas for your KSP projects \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T00:49:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to The Spacecraft Exchange.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T16:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETagged with a tag \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sickle","CreatedById":76853,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T18:09:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGotta Love the V-22.
