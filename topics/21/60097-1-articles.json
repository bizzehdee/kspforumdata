I built it in parallel with my just released Co-23 Corvette and so both ships share many design features with a focus on aesthetics rather than armour. Stripping almost all of the armour allowed me to add in many more minor features to improve the appearance and also provided a dV boost compared to most of my previous ships allowing trips as far as Laythe. Numerous hard points including a pair of Sr. docking ports allows it to function effectively as a mother ship and additional fuel can be mounted for long journeys. As per usual I mounted a very large engine block as well as a Skipper boost engine to give the ship surprising acceleration considering its sheers size while 10 reaction wheels mean that orbital manoeuvres don\u0027t take too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have mounted both a linear bridge for controlling the ship while the lower mounted lander can is purely to enjoy the view and the ships should not be controlled from here. The ship should have SAS kept on as it is not perfectly balanced and will pitch slightly if left to its own devices. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t included weaponry with this ship so people can either arm it with their own or simply use it as a civilian vessel instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/nczrn6qr4x64tps/Ca-23A.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nczrn6qr4x64tps/Ca-23A.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHotkeys\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Nerva Engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Skipper\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10: Toggle panels and antennae \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStats\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts: 390\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV: 6700\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR: 0.61\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 230 Tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost:330,000 Kerbits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H2x6cCH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022H2x6cCH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LMHhZpU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LMHhZpU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3jgkWRZ.png\u0022 alt=\u00223jgkWRZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N6kPM1O.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N6kPM1O.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-16T00:08:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2014 12:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Comrade Jenkens\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tyrant264","CreatedById":44894,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T04:57:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDamn she fine!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kola2DONO","CreatedById":77488,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T07:12:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is the most awesome ship i\u0027ve ever seen in my life!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt probably laggs really much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OneRedBlock","CreatedById":60961,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T13:39:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStop this at once.
