I got to thinking about that, and I decided to do it myself! Only on Friday, because I have more time for KSP on Friday.\n\nWhen I supported it, I thought it would be easy, but it is not. I set threads to display to last week only, and in my first cut, I had at least 15 craft. All of them were awesome, but a narrowed it down to what I think are the 5 best craft. I\u0027m not going to have more than one craft by a single builder, and I\u0027ll make sure to have at least one craft by a new builder.\n\nWho are you to decide this, I hear you asking, and here\u0027s the answer: No one. I was not elected, I just decided to do it. If you\u0027re unhappy with my decision, we can work something out. This is just my opinion, since there\u0027s no objective way to judge \u0022Quality\u0022 of crafts.\n\nIf anyone feels that their craft is missed because of any kind of time-zone difference, or any kind of difference in when spacecraft fridays is put up, tell me.\n\nIf your craft is really good and was made before, and someone posts in it within that week, then it will be considered. Just to clarify, I am not encouraging necros for the sake of bumping your craft.\n\nThis works on a first come, first serve basis, and if the person on the top can\u0027t do it, the person right below will do it. If you want to do it, remember, I will only taking submissions on this thread, not on the week\u0027s list.\n\n**Maintainer list:**\n\n**Rules for maintainers:**\n\n1. Don\u0027t use your own crafts. Not because they\u0027re not good, but because people will feel like you\u0027re trying to get attention with it.\n\n2. Don\u0027t pick two craft from one builder.\n\n3. Try not to just pick from a small group of builders every week.\n\n4. 5 to 10 craft is about right.\n\n5. To decide maintainers, we will have a first come, first serve system.\n\n6. Try to test stuff, but it\u0027s not necessary.\n\n7. If you have extra time, you can select single craft from showcases, following the same rules as normal craft.\n\n8.

a extra-special craft. The clever engine design is of particular interest, it uses a clipped pre-cooler for a fan effect.\n\nThe compact missles are very accurate, and the bomb is a, I believe, unique design.\n\n[**Zais\u0027 Class L \u0022Say my name\u0022 lifters:**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130764-The-Class-L-Say-My-Name-lifters)\n\n\u003Ciframe frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nSomething that we don\u0027t have enough of on the Spacecraft exchange: Lifters! These are exemplary in many ways: Cost, part count, and ease of use.
