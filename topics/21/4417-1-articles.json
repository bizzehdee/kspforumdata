Because in rocket science, bigger and heavier always means better, right? So, the new Munlab would have to be bigger and carry more sciency stuff. More importantly, it would have to look cooler. Also, it needs a way more imaginative name than the boring old Munlab-1. After much deliberation, a bold new direction in the naming scheme was adopted, and the mission had a new name: Munlab-2! Ah, the imagination. Let\\\u0027s say I intend to send a smaller lander to pick up the crew once the mission is over so I don\\\u0027t have to bother with a return stage this time. At least, let\\\u0027s say that to the crew. I may actually send a retrieval craft. If I feel like it. But that\\\u0027s not important - whatever the outcome, it was all for science! So, I slapped on a lot of sciencey stuff on a lander, thanks to Nova and his pretty cool Probodobdyne Construction Kit.

But on the bright side, the betting game has totally livened up now! 1:10000 on them making it to orbit alive. Good odds, but you have to get in on the action before launch. Incidentally, the entire engineering department bet against them making it to orbit, saying it\\\u0027s a bad idea to have a heavy top and bottom and a thin middle section.

Get away from us, empty stage! We used you up and now we\\\u0027re tossing you. Let\\\u0027s bring RCS back up and orient ourselves.. wait. RCS just stopped working. Seems my meticulous design phase managed to miss the fact that after decoupling RCS is also cut off from it\\\u0027s fuel source. Well, there\\\u0027s plenty of fuel left to abort and go home. That would be the sensible thing to do. Thankfully, this is KSP and sensible doesn\\\u0027t factor in. On the bright side, the betting scene is literally erupting with activity now. Will they make a new crater on the Mun? Or will they manage to kill all horizontal velocity using only the main engines, with no RCS to assist? A sensible person would know how to bet.

A big comm dish, 4 sensor packages, and 4 cameras (so someone doesn\\\u0027t steal it and drive off. Someone suggested they might also work to survey the Munar surface by remote, but the cameras are actually fake, just there to scare off burglars). That\\\u0027s all on a big strut thing that looks cool and adds to rocket length. That\\\u0027s stuck on a small satellite that kinda looks like it also might be a habitable module with a bunch of windows, so I\\\u0027ll pretend that\\\u0027s what it is. That\\\u0027s stuck on a service module that\\\u0027s there to.. service.. whatever. Come to think of it, didn\\\u0027t the service module contain RCS fuel? RCS should really work, then. Could be a bug, but since this uses almost every mod under the Sun I can\\\u0027t exactly go report it. I don\\\u0027t think even I could reproduce this if I had to reinstall, would have to remember what it is I had installed first. Also starring, 2 My First Science Kit\\\u0027s. Not sure why they packed frog dissecting equipment in there? 2 RTG\\\u0027s, 4 solar panels, probe core, 4x parachute adapter with 4 small tanks and 4 lander engines.

On hard land, on legs. Chutes allowed to slow down and stabilize, though so far I\\\u0027ve had a problem with them. I\\\u0027ve tried to put chutes on the Munlab-2 but for some reason they won\\\u0027t activate on only the lander during atmo tests on Kerbin. If they\\\u0027re stuck on a lifter rocket, then once the lander is detached and I ignite it\\\u0027s engines the chutes auto-activate. I don\\\u0027t want this because those engines fire for the first time somewhere over the Mun surface. Meh, I think I\\\u0027ll just wait for 0.13 before I make a ship that lands on the Mun and then back on Kerbin, on dry land using lander legs or wheels, without detaching stages.
