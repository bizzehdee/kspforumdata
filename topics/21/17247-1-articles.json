I only place them now if the rocket is rolling badly, or sometimes just because fins look cool. However, Kodemunkey, you won\u0027t be able to manuever much in vacuum without an RCS tank and some thrusters. The weight you save by removing the two extra ASAS means the RCS won\u0027t make your rocket heavier. Perhaps not important now, but fun to play with on you get into orbit. Also, if you are working toward the goal of keeping the little guys alive, which I realize may not be #1 on Kodemunkey Aerospace\u0027s agenda, consider placing a decoupler between the capsule and that fuel tank. That way, when you\u0027re ready to come down the parachute will only have to support the weight of the capsule, and you\u0027ll land more gently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(And upgrade to the full game when you get a chance.

In fact, for a ship that small the capsule\u0027s inherent attitude control might be enough. But to change trajectory as well as attitude, you\u0027d have to call on the main engine because it\u0027s the only source of thrust. An RCS tank and some thrusters adds negilble mass while giving you all kinds of additional utility, such as translating on other axes beside that of the engine. Like I said, perhaps not important now, but fun to play with and good practice for later. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kodemunkey","CreatedById":41146,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-19T07:14:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont think gimballed engines are in the demo, unless you\u0027re talking about the two liquid fueled engines? ...Wait, that\u0027s a small ship?
