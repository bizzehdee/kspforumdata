guess there are a few players from an older generation who will remember this craft from a puppet show for kids from the early 1960\u0027s.\u00A0 Produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, who went on to give us Thunderbirds amongst others, I guess you could call Fireball XL5 the forerunner of it\u0027s more well known cousin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFireball XL5 in KSP is a recreation designed to give a flavour of the original, rather than be an attempt to produce a nuts and bolts faithful replica.\u00A0 Having said that, the complete craft has reasonably docile flying characteristics in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, and Fireball Junior and the main Fireball body can be both flown independently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFireball Junior is the trickiest to fly; it\u0027s not too difficult flying around, but it has the glide characteristics of a brick which makes landings tricky.\u00A0 When flying Fireball Junior I recommend it be done with flaps deployed as this improves the flying characteristics at the expense of maximum speed, as they do slow the craft down.\u00A0 It\u0027s not recommended that the complete craft be flown with flaps deployed however, as the flaps are all situated in Fireball Junior, and deploying them can make the craft unstable when using large amounts of elevator input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAction group keys :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 Toggle Fireball Junior rocket

have a lot of wing area to keep it airborne with full tanks, so the tanks have only been filled to maintain balance and flight characteristics, which requires infinite fuel be used if you want a
