Definitely much harder than building a rocket. It took me weeks to figure out how to design this ship to do what I wanted it to do. It\u0027s main objective was to be able to get into a 100km orbit and dock with my fueling station. It can also survive re-entry to Kerbin and land (chutes are for an emergency).\n\n![X-14%20Complete_zpsjjqeiltl.png](http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/X-14%20Complete_zpsjjqeiltl.png)\n\nIt\u0027s not the best looking but it does the job. Complete with 5 engines. The R.A.P.I.E.R. and turbo jet engines get it into orbit and then I use the nuke and RCS for the rest. \n\nThen here it is docked with the fuel station, It\u0027s the one all the way to the left. The other ships are previous designs.\n\n![space%20plane%20depo_zpsyvxwi6b2.png](http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/space%20plane%20depo_zpsyvxwi6b2.png)\n\nI also have another variant that will carry a total of 2 crew. \n\nI\u0027ll probably use this SSTO for a while then design another one that can hold more Kerbals. \n\nI also want it to look better as well, that\u0027s why we make SSTO\u0027s right???\n\nIf anyone has anything to share or critique feel free, any input helps as SSTO\u0027s are very difficult."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T15:29:22Z","Content":"Welcome to the club, and welcome aboard in general ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Palec","CreatedById":64875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T15:38:10Z","Content":"Nice results for first SSTO!\n\nBut for only 2 crew SSTO, you don\u0027t need that many engines, especially not nukes as it is not worth the weight if you need to get only to 100km orbit. You should be perfectly fine with 2 rapiers. What is most important one - ascent profile. Be sure to have at least 1100m/s in jet mode on rapiers, before you will switch to rocket mode. Then you need only approx. 1500dv in rocket mode to get to 100km orbit and get back"},{"CreatedByName":"spudman2","CreatedById":84199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T18:11:52Z","Content":"Doesn\u0027t it feel great finally seeing it orbit freely, no aerodynamic forces on it at all?\n\nI\u0027ve had great success with SSTO\u0027s that use 2 RAPIERs, 1 LV-N, and no oxidizer.

I actually just changed the design to something a little more appealing. It functions pretty much the same but it can re-enter Kerbin atmosphere much better. I know 5 engines is a lot but this thing can get to orbit stupid fast and very easily. Basically all you do pitch to 30 degrees then around 10km go to 10 degrees or so and you\u0027re in space.\n\n![QO-2%20runway%202_zpswqfvkznb.png](http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/QO-2%20runway%202_zpswqfvkznb.png)\n\nThis was after re-entry so the nose is a little damaged.
