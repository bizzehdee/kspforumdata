This may be your last chance to try these rides before the laws of physics turn upside down, so don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t miss the chance\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\n![wSk72yd.png](http://i.imgur.com/wSk72yd.png)\n\n![0lM3ad4.png](http://i.imgur.com/0lM3ad4.png)\n\n**The UA Industries range.**\n\nRequires FAR (1.4.6 or 1.4.7): [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-90-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-14-7-4-2-15](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-90-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-14-7-4-2-15)\n\nand Kerbal Joint Reinforcement: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657-0-90-Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement-v3-1-2-3-26-15](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657-0-90-Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement-v3-1-2-3-26-15) \n\nAll spaceplanes have action groups for engines, flaps, cargo bay and docking ports, solar panels, etc. \n\nA fuel balancer is recommended.

Both will carry a wide range of satellite and probes to a variety of orbits. Both are equipped for docking and orbital refueling.\n\n-SR mission examples:\n\nCircularize keostationary orbit.\n\nSatellite to Munar polar transfer orbit.\n\n-SRC mission examples:\n\nCrew transfer to Munar orbit.\n\nLand on Mun or Minmus if refuelled from LKO.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Minmus is a walk in the park for this ship.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
