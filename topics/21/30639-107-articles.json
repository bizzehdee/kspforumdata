See, its exponential nature means than when you go over a mass ratio (fuelled weight/empty weight) of \u0022e\u0022 (2.72etc), you get into diminishing returns very quickly if you just add fuel. An LV-N allows you to go twice as far just by having twice the isp (dV=\u003Cstrong\u003Eisp\u003C/strong\u003E*9.81*Ln(MR), so directly proportional), so that\u0027s probably your best bet: having a single of those doubles your delta-v in orbit.

Plus, a dedicated lander stowed in the bay is always going to be easier to land on airless worlds, because it was designed for it form the start: never mind that it will have a fraction of the weight to carry to the surface and back (which is awesome in itself), it\u0027s worth it just for the maneuverability and the landing legs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eddiew\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eddiew\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...strangely familiar...\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.transformerscustomtoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Transformers-TheArk-www.transformerscustomtoys.com_.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.transformerscustomtoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Transformers-TheArk-www.transformerscustomtoys.com_.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EBut boo \u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3E3E3E;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EYou must spread some Reputation around before giving it to Rune again.\u0022 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhoo... my first successful foray into an MK3 heavy lifter.

I do have a mix of both on the big Tigerclaw, but I\u0027ve arranged them as rapiers on the outside and turbos hugging the body, so that when the turbos begin to stutter and flameout, the change of thrust torque is minimal compared to the rapier rockets under the wings. Seems I can just let them fizzle without getting thrown off course at 35km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there kind of is a nerf on turbos, if you use B9 - by default it limits them and cuts power after mach 3.2. Happily the config is easily removed and you can get back onto a level playing field with everyone else when you want to make a \u003Cem\u003Estock\u003C/em\u003E design!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
