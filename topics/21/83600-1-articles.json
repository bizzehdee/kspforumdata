Now, there will be exceptions where I won\u0027t be able to fix your craft without changing too much, meaning that it will look more different than preferable (the craft could also have something wrong with it that completely breaks everything, but is the essential good looking part of the craft), but you can decide if you want that modified version. I\u0027m decently good at KSP now, and I think fixing some of your designs will give: 1. me more experience, 2. you a fixed craft 3. good feelings for me and you. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EOk, as a little rule, your description must have:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E - all listed problems with the craft\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E - anything that you don\u0027t know how to do (but is possible), and you would like me to do it\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E - tell me anything that is particular about the craft that I have to keep in mind when fixing it\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E - you must give me the download for the craft, too\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ETell me anything about your craft, really.

From your recent designs, you seem to be getting really good at the structural panel 3d modeling. This design was hard to fix though. The structural panels are really heavy and making hulls like that, makes the plane ridiculously heavy. I recommend using wings to model your spacecrafts in the future, it gives the craft less weight, and more lift. I know the wings don\u0027t offer as much detail. Anyways, to your fixed craft. I see what you craft had problems with and you did specify to only fix the outer wing part, but that means you had issues with mass and lift, which is why I had to clip a bunch of wings into the hull. I also removed some fuel and added some engines (still looks the same) to make it fly faster. It can lift off early now (idk, your craft didn\u0027t even have wheels \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E). The problem with the stalling part was because your craft\u0027s yaw wings helped roll the craft, which may work on smaller crafts, but not on these kind of behemoths. I sadly increased the part count to something around 500 (my 2008 macbook pro can handle it so your computer should 100% work). Giving a lot of flaps yaw authority, but not roll authority makes the craft more stable (also, the more your yaw wings are away from your CoM, the more likely it is to flip out into a yaw spin). I might not know what I\u0027m saying, but your craft now looks basically the same, is more maneuverable, might be a paid assassin to kill your computer, and it can take off and fly stably. Have fun getting one of these into orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/V2Gr7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

From your recent designs, you seem to be getting really good at the structural panel 3d modeling. This design was hard to fix though. The structural panels are really heavy and making hulls like that, makes the plane ridiculously heavy. I recommend using wings to model your spacecrafts in the future, it gives the craft less weight, and more lift. I know the wings don\u0027t offer as much detail. Anyways, to your fixed craft. I see what you craft had problems with and you did specify to only fix the outer wing part, but that means you had issues with mass and lift, which is why I had to clip a bunch of wings into the hull. I also removed some fuel and added some engines (still looks the same) to make it fly faster. It can lift off early now (idk, your craft didn\u0027t even have wheels \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E). The problem with the stalling part was because your craft\u0027s yaw wings helped roll the craft, which may work on smaller crafts, but not on these kind of behemoths. I sadly increased the part count to something around 500 (my 2008 macbook pro can handle it so your computer should 100% work). Giving a lot of flaps yaw authority, but not roll authority makes the craft more stable (also, the more your yaw wings are away from your CoM, the more likely it is to flip out into a yaw spin). I might not know what I\u0027m saying, but your craft now looks basically the same, is more maneuverable, might be a paid assassin to kill your computer, and it can take off and fly stably.
