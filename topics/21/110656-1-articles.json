What you could do is replace the adtapter with the equal fuel sized normal shape mk3 tank, and then put your shuttle cockpit on that. Bearing in mind to reenter and fly to land after having used up fuel, you will have to pump the fuel around as the diagram in my thread shows. This will prevent flatspins and other craziness.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI could have done this I suppose but I liked the pointyness of the design ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) and of course you cab still put the pointy thing back on to the shuttle cockpit for a laugh"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T21:52:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What on Kerbin......

The streamlined LF tanks hung on the sides of the fuselage and the wings are for aero purposes that don\u0027t apply in stock; ditching those would probably help it in stock.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T09:24:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 09:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"}]}
