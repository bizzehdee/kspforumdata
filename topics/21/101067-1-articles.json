Or crashed a plane but wish you could retrieve it for full recovery of funds, minus the exploded bits? We might all need to deliver heavy mining equipment across Kerbin when resource harvesting is added to KSP.\n\nThese cranes harness the lifting power of the Basic Jet, augmented by the Rockomax Mk55 to fill gaps in the jets\u0027 throttle response. The Mk55\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s large gimbal range helps stabilize touchy VTOL operations and acts as a panic button to abort missed approaches. Effective range depends on how much rocket-panic is invoked, since they share LiquidFuel with the jets.\n\n Control POV is vertical, allowing SAS-Radial to automatically settle into a stable hover, freeing the pilot to concentrate on precise translation and manage their sink rate. Craft are tested and intended for keyboard operation in a completely stock game.\n\nModels are defined by payload capacity and mission type:\n\n- Gosling delivers payloads up to 18 tons, Gull retrieves them.\n- Goose delivers payloads up to 45 tons, Pelican retrieves them.\n- Albatross delivers payloads up to 60 tons, Vulture retrieves them.\n\nRetrieval cranes handle payloads using a Klaw. They can launch from the Pad and grapple a payload from the Runway for delivery abroad if you don\u0027t wish to add a docking port to the payload.\n\nDelivery cranes are loaded as a subassembly and attached to a docking port on the payload centerline. They feature a pendulum joint that allows a larger pitch axis for more lateral speed. The pendulum, docked with the payload, acts as a separate craft from the crane. It includes solar panels to provide power to undock from the payload after delivery, along with a disconnected emergency battery for night operation.\n\nThe first model is named Gosling because the pendulum joint was inspired by Firefly\u0027s Serenity. Some people may juggle geese, but Krazy Ivans are not recommended with these craft.\n\n![bk7nuMD.png](https://i.imgur.com/bk7nuMD.png)\n\n **Action groups for all cranes:**\n\n1 Toggle rockets\n\n2 Toggle intakes\n\n3 Arm Klaw\n\n4 Release Klaw or docking port\n\n**Gosling Delivery Crane**\n\n[KerbalX link](http://kerbalx.com/Torquimedes/Gosling%20PDS%20v13)\n\nMass: 11,677\n\nCost: 16,240\n\nParts: 35\n\nEndurance: 18 ton payload deliverable 50-100km from launch point on Kerbin\n\nApprox one minute of rocket assist is available.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
