Again, like the X-1 StarFighter, it has very surprising stability, although it can\u0027t climb as high as it\u0027s predecessor, it still makes up in power. It tends to flap a little bit with SAS on, but not so bad that it\u0027s annoying. The flapping will subside once it gets past 8,000 metres. Once again, Happy Flying! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
