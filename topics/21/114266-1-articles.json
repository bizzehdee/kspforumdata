Other than that, they are all entirely original. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nI skipped the few I was unable to build stock ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif) maybe some other time.\n\n[Craft files](https://www.dropbox.com/s/179dd93ooqozz1k/X-planes.zip?dl=0)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/yREDCDvTcMs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n![DctNiwJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/DctNiwJ.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:12:12Z","Content":"Awesome work! \u002Brep"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiaK","CreatedById":80590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:18:33Z","Content":"Great work on the X-33!"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T21:00:37Z","Content":"There are rare times I feel compelled to push the rep button more than once...this is one of those times.

You must of had some serious time on your hands. I have made the X-3, X-29, and a X-15 (with a bomber) in my *Kerbal Imitations* series (Link in my signature), but you really did well with a large number of craft. It looks like I used the same method as you (Wikipedia!) for information. I had to Rep you for this."}]}
