A single wheel will have a certain carrying threshold; more force required = more wheels can be placed in parallel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMyth 2: Hard to control\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKraken drive force is no different to an un-gimballed engine: put the force along the centre of mass and it will work fine. There are some complexities, primarily around where the centre of force on a wheel/lander leg is generated, but these are simply things to be aware of in the vessel design. There is a maximum amount of force you can put through a wheel before it deforms, creating less predicable effects, and also wheels can only be compressed by a given amount before they warp and twist, also reducing their predictability and effectiveness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMyth 3: Cannot be used in time warp\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrior to self-interaction, this was true. These days Kraken drives can be time warped without any issue. Interestingly they only work at full power in single physics time, however. Physics warp appears to maintain their output but over a longer time frame (i.e. reducing their actual force), and this can even be used to make more precise manoeuvres\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMyth 4: Cannot be used in interstellar space\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis myth is based on a true fact: applying kraken force to a wheel in Kerbol \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E (particularly further out than the Kerbin orbit) generates a tremendous amount of wheel stress which can cause the wheel to buckle a few seconds after being turned on. This can be alleviated by reducing the spring and damper strength to 0, but the real trick is to add a KAL which \u0022cycles\u0022 any kraken drive wheels, toggling their self-interaction on and off over a period of about 3-4 seconds (from my testing this only needs to be off for \u0026lt;0.5s, so the power loss is limited, and if this is staggered over all wheels then the effect is smoothed) as this stops the wheel damage from occurring while allowing thrust to be maintained indefinitely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo provide evidence that these myths are indeed just that I knocked together a rocket which took 10500 units of Ore from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to Dres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xF3yLuS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xF3yLuS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving spent many dozens of hours investigating their use, I have already shared some of my creations here and on KerbalX, but could also think about making a longer tutorial, if there is interest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-01T13:35:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2020 01:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by dnbattley\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dnbattley","CreatedById":176526,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-08T13:12:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome further more quantitative investigation from testing the above lander in other orbits:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMyth: (and to my surprise, given my anecdotal experience) excluding low-level effects near a planetary surface, kraken force is NOT subject to the\u00A0local gravity well/body of influence: a k-drive generates the same acceleration in Low Eve Orbit as it does in high Pol orbit. What does vary, however, is the wheel stress experienced around each body. Wheel stress varies by local body, and is a function of\u00A0craft mass\u00A0and inverse function of\u00A0distance\u00A0(i.e. it is higher further out), but\u00A0it is NOT related\u00A0to the level of leg/wheel\u00A0compression, nor can it be \u0022shared\u0022 across multiple k-drives (i.e. each k-drive experiences that same amount of stress resulting from the full mass of the craft). However, per myth 4, and as a further update, this \u003Cstrong\u003Estress is only applied approximately 8.4 seconds after the drive is engaged\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInformation: K-drive power is relative to the wheel used. The LY-05 is my \u0022go to\u0022 leg as it is easiest to build with, is robust (except to temperature), physically small, cheap and lightweight generates a \u003Cstrong\u003Eforce per wheel of up to around \u003Cs\u003E500 kiloNewtons*\u003C/s\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E (i.e. a craft of c.123T can be accelerated to about 3g using a parallel build of 8 LY-05 K-drives with a \u0022high\u0022 compression, without distortion). Higher values may be possible but at the risk of distortion and consequently uncontrollable acceleration. Lower values are possible, though fine control can be very challenging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* My calculations are going very wrong here: either I\u0027ve forgotten my high school physics, or the Kerbal universe throws normal force calculation out the window. If anyone can correct me here I\u0027d appreciate it. I\u0027m calculating 50,000 (units) from the data, but then in practice I\u0027m finding the acceleration equivalent to 4 Vectors (which should be 4,000 kN, or 500kN per engine)\u00A0- AND THEN\u00A0(and this is truly bizarre) when I stick a Mammoth engine onto the rocket (with infinite propellant to\u00A0control my variables\u00A0and reduced ore to keep the launch weight to 123T), the K-drive alone generates more than double the\u00A0amount of thrust than it did before the Mammoth was attached, now making 7.6g acceleration!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset

effect is one I haven\u0027t really explored scientifically, but have some anecdotal observations that might help here. You are right that for an object launched from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E the transition point is around 200m, and it dramatically increases velocity above that, but it seems to be more fundamental than that: when approaching from the other direction (i.e. at speed from space) the k-drive effect works differently, and is able to convert almost any vertical velocity to its \u0022upward speed\u0022, generating extraordinary forces to do so. As a case in point, I generated g forces in excess of 10000g utilising this effect for a recent challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy theory here is that the physics engine generates the speed (and the force required to do so is a derived value) at low altitudes, but at high altitudes it generates a force (from which the speed is derived).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the transition height: landing the vessel in some locations can dramatically change the transition height (and touching down vs landing - or switching craft - may not be the same thing in the game\u0027s logic here), and sometimes I have experienced transition heights of 1000s of metres, even in close proximity to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. My theory there is that the transition height is X metres above a value for the \u0022baseline location\u0022 for the craft, though whether that is a function of biome or locale is something I haven\u0027t properly explored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your purposes you might want to try flying over grasslands/water and then switching/landing craft to see if that helps consistently create the effect you want.
