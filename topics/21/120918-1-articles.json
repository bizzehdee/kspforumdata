Yikes. Still can\u0027t believe I accepted that contract. But it\u0027s secondary purpose is that it is re-usable, so with this one ~$500k craft without re-supply I can throw as many class Es into kerbin orbit (or quite a few other places) as needed. Industrial asteroid hauling. The pictures are of it throwing a 2100 ton asteroid out of Sol SOI. It could certainly tackle the 3500\u002B ton monster E-class asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s76dzSS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022s76dzSS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BIcu8GB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BIcu8GB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to pull rather than push which required that I have engine which can clear the edges of a class E. I pretend to ignore the fact that engine backwash only extends a relatively short distance in Kerbal physics and act like I actually have to clear the asteroid as in real life. So it is long, tall, and has engines set on a slight angle to avoid hitting the asteroid with rocket backwash. This robs a bit of power and efficiency but still not too bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign Features:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStructural spine: All power is transimitted to the claw through connected trusses with high strength. Nothing weak and destructable like in-line reaction wheels. Very tough and very rigid. Mk I and Mk II failed due to Kraken attacks. Mk III has so far has resisted all Krakens. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDimensions: The final stage is about the tallest thing that can be built in the VAB and still manipulate all the pieces. 57.5 meters tall and fairly wide at 25 meters width.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELow part count: Parts were shaved constantly to keep lag low. Precision flying is needed for craft this large and lag is a killer. Final stage is a modest-for-the-size 271 parts and 153 tons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaction probes: Features four small detachable and re-dockable probes which are basically just double stacks of large reaction wheels and rcs thrusters that can be distributed around the asteroid to improve handling. When docked they help the mothership turn during maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMining: Double drills and ISRUs flow fuel up to the main engines through a set of interconnected small tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVerdict: Unladen it flies pretty well, one of the least wobbly craft I have piloted especially considering it\u0027s size. When laden it is capable of holding a flight direction with only minor wobble and the ISRUs and drills mostly keep up with fuel consumption. Doing 180 turns while hauling the 2100 ton asteroid are no problem at all. Burn times are long, but it was designed to set on a course and be able to leave it alone while it does its thing. Except there is one problem: there is a bug in Kerbal\u0027s fuel model which restricts fuel to one of the four engines if I run the ISRU\u0027s at the same time. Needless to say unbalanced engine output is disasterous in a craft this large. So this one is getting mothballed until they fix that bug. But in the meantime the $1.1 million Sisyphus Heavy is currently in flight testing over Kerbin. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oPNcl51.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oPNcl51.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nT9yO9I.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nT9yO9I.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MKYyMjy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MKYyMjy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T03:59:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love how it looks prepared for launch!

Four nukes, right? And you say only one of them could be run with the refinery?

Even with full tanks, if I turned on the ISRU it throttled down one of the four engines. So I would be getting three engines running at full and one at \u0026lt; 50% or so which would unbalance the flight pattern pretty quickly. I tried throttling down the opposite side\u0027s engine to compensate, but then a different engine would have trouble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m impressed you could get a class E hauler into a cargo bay! Probably a lot closer to something we would use in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went multi-engine and big when I started looking at things like ~50 hour burns. With it throttled down due to the bug, maybe even more like 80 hours?
