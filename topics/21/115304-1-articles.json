The Farnsworth engineering department has guaranteed us that this is not magic.\n\nRubber toast not included.\n\nOur pilots report trips from Kerbin station to the surface of Minmus and back to be a trivial affair. One brave large bladder equipped test pilot took it as far as Ike without episode. Refueling was performed at the Ike refueling station. Inconclusive data on if the Dragonfly could make a round trip without refueling.\n\nThe specificity of the specifics are as such and so forth as follows:\n\nParts= 72\n\nFull weight= 27.2 tons\n\nEmpty weight= 11.2 tons\n\nDV= 3045 (vacuum) Delta V calculations came from [http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html](http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html)\n\n![Onornlq.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/Onornlq.png?1)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
