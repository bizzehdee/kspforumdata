In the end I just went with it, and tried to make it as close to identical as possible.\n\n![i99e2jI.png](http://i.imgur.com/i99e2jI.png)\n\nLaunched empty, it can achieve LKO with enough delta-v left to exit the Kerbin SOI. It can also carry ten tons on the nose docking port, as long as the payload includes winglets -- the craft is already a bit nose-heavy. A 10t drop tank is enough to take this ship to Duna and back. If refuelled in space, it can easily reach Jool or Moho, even without external fuel.\n\nThe first time I tried to lift a 10t payload, I got a little hung up on the acceleration stage, and didn\u0027t have enough fuel left to circularize. I\u0027m pretty sure I can get it up there with a little practice, though.\n\n![3OWYKsf.png](http://i.imgur.com/3OWYKsf.png)\n\n -c.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T22:39:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 10:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Overgoats**"},{"CreatedByName":"quasarrgames","CreatedById":91692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T00:51:27Z","Content":"NOICE!\n\nFinally, another tower SSTO\u0027er!

The LV-Ns don\u0027t even contribute before about 10 km up, but after 18 km they\u0027re outperforming the jets, so I run both at once. Finally, when the jets flame out at about 22 km, I go back to the Mainsail to grab a fistful of apoapsis. The Mainsail runs out of fuel, the LV-Ns keep pushing, and before you know it you\u0027re in space!\n\n -c."},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T05:19:04Z","Content":"So, how does this thing land?"},{"CreatedByName":"Overgoats","CreatedById":147767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T05:41:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, how does this thing land?\n\nVertically, on parachutes and landing legs. Assuming it\u0027s landing on Kerbin or Laythe, the jets will be on to soften the landing a bit. My initial tests showed that the chutes slow the craft enough for the \\*\\*landing legs\\*\\* to survive, but for all that I\u0027ve strutted the bejeezus out of the engines, I don\u0027t know if that would extend to every linkage.

Outfitted with a grappling claw, the Gunstar linked up with a fuel tank in orbit (not pictured). Incidentally, I learned that grappling counts as docking, and you can suck fuel out through the punctures.
