I decided to try my hand at creating a modular model. I succeeded, technically, though there is no provision for launch or for assembly. I recommend that existing infrastructure be used to assemble\u00A0it on-orbit, or simply that it be launched in one piece under a giant fairing.

The whole thing should now actually fit inside of a Size3 fairing(fairing included in craft file for demonstration). Additionally, I\u0027ve replaced the Swivel engines with Vectors, which should allow a fully assembled Kentipede to land under its own power, if you can provide the deltaV(I recommend drop tanks.

The carriage rides a lot lower now, which combines to allow the twin Vectors with only 10 kNm of torque. Should also make launches much more stable. Unfortunately, the lower carriage means that the particularly cool-looking bottom hatch is now broken, but I\u0027ve added ladders to the cupola to make it so you can still EVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T21:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks amazing!

The form factor has been redesigned, so that you should actually be able to dock the modules together on the surface now, but unfortunately there is now no way to fit it in a cargo bay. The side modules have been phased out in favour of directly attached wheels, to limit part count and save players the hassle of trying to dock them. The NERV has been phased out for impractically long burn times, with a massive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E transport being provided instead(Three parts, to be attached in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E). Still ion engines, in case you can stand the burn times, but the xenon is there mostly for fulfilling contract parameters. The package includes one of each module, but if you\u0027re accepting contracts\u00A0for mobile bases\u00A0you\u0027re going to be needing none of some and multiples of others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"idamoofus","CreatedById":170167,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-05T23:26:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s 404ed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SingABrightSong","CreatedById":158346,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-05T23:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170167-mrlake/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022170167\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170167-mrlake/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@MrLake\u003C/a\u003E Ah, guess the new filename changed the URL.
