She boasts a thin width, allowing the ship to cut through the water easily and with grace, never bouncing and splashing as other water models do. She\\\u0027s got enough fuel to run around 10-20 Kilometers, depending on the travel path, and boasts 4 turbine engines, basically jet engines on a boat, capable of putting a total amount of 400 units of thrust on the water. All of this culminates into an average cruise speed of 5.5 m/s, although the maximum is 6.3 m/s. Certainly not the fastest, but definitely able to defend your turf from another ship, should the need arise. In addition, the ship can be outfitted with railguns to increase the power of this vessel.\n\nNow for some images - \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![5638aad0f734710e41d0.jpg](http://www.use.com/images/s_3/5638aad0f734710e41d0.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![6481b8cdeb244492d8c9.jpg](http://www.use.com/images/s_3/6481b8cdeb244492d8c9.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![8af45774b42c191ce7fb.jpg](http://www.use.com/images/s_3/8af45774b42c191ce7fb.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2428a6d1cafbb3fc34db.jpg](http://www.use.com/images/s_3/2428a6d1cafbb3fc34db.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![df243fbc10412e434780.jpg](http://www.use.com/images/s_3/df243fbc10412e434780.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![f43b13b28345eccf5c34.jpg](http://www.use.com/images/s_3/f43b13b28345eccf5c34.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![6d796f4cee07ddf16a52.jpg](http://www.use.com/images/s_3/6d796f4cee07ddf16a52.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![3edd12fde91057bdf2a8.jpg](http://www.use.com/images/s_3/3edd12fde91057bdf2a8.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2d38307208e698e80b85.jpg](http://www.use.com/images/s_3/2d38307208e698e80b85.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![3d9dad86417840b0b0f8.jpg](http://www.use.com/images/s_3/3d9dad86417840b0b0f8.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Calbino","CreatedById":1368,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T01:34:49Z","Content":"Nicely done, very creative."},{"CreatedByName":"One01","CreatedById":21745,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T06:48:58Z","Content":"Very good.
