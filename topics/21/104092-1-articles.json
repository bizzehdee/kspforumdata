Skylab was the first American space station, and was inhabited on and off until its fiery demise in 1979 over western Australia. \n\n**Craft Info:** Skylab is 225 parts and 27 tons, Apollo is 38 parts and 28 tons. It has a crew capacity of 4.\n\n**Craft Downloads:** (Mediafire) [_Skylab.craft\u0022\\]Skylab](http://www./download/rld8yfrju4ngqs5/%5BREPLICA) and [_Apollo_Command_and_Service_Module.craft\u0022\\]Apollo](http://www./download/9yjef5tx6dcsn3z/%5BREPLICA)\n\nNow for some beauty shots!\n\n![x83LlGn.png](http://i.imgur.com/x83LlGn.png)\n\n![44q4EoA.png](http://i.imgur.com/44q4EoA.png)\n\n![8xEwqMR.png](http://i.imgur.com/8xEwqMR.png)\n\n![Eus44Md.png](http://i.imgur.com/Eus44Md.png)\n\nThanks for viewing, and leave some rep if you enjoyed!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-14T01:22:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2015 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zucal**\n  \nMore info"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T00:50:22Z","Content":"Is this all stock?
