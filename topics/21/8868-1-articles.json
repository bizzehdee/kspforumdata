It relies on two bug exploits to fly effectively. The first is the ability to place stabilizers inside each other, which greatly increases the lift ratio. The second is the ability for a properly balanced AV-R8 in canard configuration to generate thrust. For this reason, no fuel is needed after the first stage takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight instructions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit is important to note that the airplane is carefully balanced, so it will not be statically stable until after the fuel tank is empty and the launch stage has been separated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Turn on Advanced SAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Throttle up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Press space to launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: After running out of fuel, press space to separate from booster and advanced SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Fly around as much as you like. Pitch up or down to accelerate, this works best while banked and at lower altitudes. Note that the roll controls are very sensitive and that conventional landings are not possible. Use roll and pitch to turn, not yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: Press space again to separate from flight stage and engage parachute. Note: do not attempt to land on mountain tops.

This can be done by adding more AV-R8s and removing parts like the parachute and stage decoupler, but this makes the game more laggy and makes crew recovery nigh impossible.

This is for anyone that likes the idea but wants to go faster. This one has no parachute though! It can get around 320 m/s at sea level. the primary limitation on speed there is computer performance. I used a fixed rear horizontal stabilizer because it helps reduce the sudden pitch while maneuvering. I don\\\u0027t think anything can be done about the roll sensitivity. Its a good idea to wait a second after stage separation to help prevent stabilizer damage also. Another point, which is probably obvious, is that it will be easier to lose control at higher altitude since the air is thinner, so the stabilizers are not as effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpect this version to lag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Potatum","CreatedById":15742,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-31T00:33:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis is so much fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E thank you for sharing. i put the cart mod on the bottom for landing gear and it works. if you\\\u0027re takeing off from the strip the takeoff speed is about 64 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-01T19:06:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHAAAAAAX *flings monitor*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell done!

It still has infinite range using pitch controls to increase speed. It is mostly stable during launch so there is no advanced SAS. Just press space once and you are flying. Do not deploy the drag chute until you have touched down on the runway. I recommend landing under 70 m/s, and be gentle on the touchdown. It is not possible to takeoff again with the same ship once you come to a stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImportant notes: As long as you have not deployed the chute, you can abort landings (for touch-and-gos) even after you have touched down by pulling up and retracting the landing gear. This works down to 20 m/s. Slower than that and you make a runway crater. Also, make sure the landing gear are deployed before you land.
