This is much closer to real life spacecraft like the Shuttle or Buran, launching vertically and coming back as a glider. The \u0022SSTO\u0022 part just indicates that nothing drops off, and it can all return back to solid ground for re-use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working on a larger version..... around 1800 tons, but with all-rocket SSTOs adding more DV is pretty difficult. When you add more fuel you have to add more engines to keep the TWR above 1, and you quickly reach a point where you add 100\u0027s of tons for barely any extra DV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next version should be able to do a flyby of the moon and minmus, but that\u0027s probably about it. Maybe Eve and Duna if it\u0027s possible to get a free return encounter. To maximise DV I think I\u0027ve probably gotta go smaller and add atomic engines, but that\u0027ll come after the jumbo version I\u0027m working on now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new patch should actually help a lot...... because with the tweakables I can drain the fuel tanks and see where the center of mass and lift are when it\u0027s coming back to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
