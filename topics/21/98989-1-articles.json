Then switch engine modes to get up to orbital velocity. Gets into a 100km orbit easily although I haven\u0027t tried higher orbits. Has enough DeltaV to de-orbit and land in rocket mode if you are landing with MechJeb otherwise you can switch back to air-breathing mode and land manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using MechJeb or manoeuvre nodes you can switch control to the radar dome on the top of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/uZweg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Having the bays face down is a good idea as it would make it more versatile. Didn\u0027t think of that. It might require different placement of engines though. Plus the side tanks might need shifting around. It\u0027s do-able though. Also the shield docking port is a good idea.

Simple, really, and you can always stick a circular probe and a downwards facing port in the same spot. Actually, if you have the downwards facing standard port to sling cargo from the CoM, that in itself creates a nice attachment point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
