I think SCF is fun for all involved, and something I\u0027d like to see continued, however picking 5 craft from the forums is a fairly hard and time-consuming task.  \n\nDo any of you have any ideas about what to do about the future of SCF?  Here\u0027s the possibilities I\u0027ve considered:\n\n1. Continue as is, maybe with someone else doing my job\n2. Drop it down to just one craft a week\n3. Only do a a SCF every month\n\nThose are by no means the only possibilities out there.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-02T02:26:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2016 02:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mad Rocket Scientist**"}]}
