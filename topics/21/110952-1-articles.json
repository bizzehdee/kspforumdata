View full album](//imgur.com/a/I33hR)\n\nStats:\n\nParts: 102\n\nWeight wet/dry: 64.5/38.1 metric tons\n\nEngines: 6 turbojets (offset tooled together), 2 aerospikes (offset into the turbojets), 3 nukes, and 6 vernors for vacuum takeoff\n\nCrew: 2 pilots 4 passengers\n\nHow to fly:\n\nFirst, use 5 to make sure the vernors are off, you don\u0027t need them yet and they will waste fuel now.\n\n2, cut thrust, and stage, this turns on all engines, press 2 and 3 to turn off rockets for now.\n\n3, full throttle, pitch up and take off, and pitch up to 45 degrees.\n\n4, when you are at 5000 m up pitch down to 30 degrees, now you\u0027re going supersonic.\n\n5, at 10000m pitch down to 20 degrees, and you\u0027ll really start to go fast!\n\n6, at 15000m pitch down to 15 degrees, remain this way for now. you will be cooking properly by now!\n\n7, at 20000m press 3 to turn on nukes, this will assist the turbojets as they weaken, dont need aerospikes yet.\n\n8, at 24000m the jets assisted by the nukes will not be enough, so press 2 to activate aerospikes\n\n9, remain at your 15 degree pitch while you\u0027re in the aerospike \u002B nuke mode\n\n10, when the onboard oxidiser runs out, you should have got to just over 1800m/s. the nukes will do the rest of the work now.\n\n11. pitch down more to horison the closer to orbital speed you go, eventually at 40000m its best to be flat on the horison to get the most speed.\n\n12. apoapis goes above atmosphere, but be wary, there is a long coasting phase where you are still in the atmosphere until your apoapsis, so keep the nukes at a low thrust just to counteract the drag, past 60 km you wont nedd to though.\n\n13, circularise!\n\n14, if you want to go to the mun and back, you now need to refuel at a station in low kerbin orbit. fill up all the tanks with liquid fuel, and put a small amount of oxidiser, about 200 units, into the oxidiser tanks, this is for the vernors.\n\n15, standard mun transfer and orbital insertion.\n\n16, mun landing is done in the optimal method to save a lot of fuel. perfect example shown here:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/zBa4c-YA3g8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n17, to take off from the mun , first use 5 to make sure the vernors are on. turn off the brakes if you have them on, then go full throttle, at exactly the same time, press K to make the vernors fire, you only need to do this for a few seconds, this will make the craft lift off and pitch up, so you dont smash back into the ground again, the just turn the vernors back off, pitch up and just continue to orbit.\n\n18, get into mun orbit and burn to return to kerbin, make periapsis 20km\n\n19, pump remaining fuel into the FLT-800 tanks evenly, and if therer is more liquidfuel than the flt800 can carry put that in the big s wing strakes, evenly. doing this ensures that the center of lift and center of mass are aligned correctly for stable flight.\n\n20, reenter with a 45 degree from prograde angle off attack and you will slow down enough and you wil not explode ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) use airbrakes if you think it\u0027s to fast and hot.\n\n21, good thing there is plenty of liquidfuel left, as you may need this to use the jest, to assist your landing glide.\n\nGood luck with it and have fun!\n\ntell me if it still gets to orbit in 1.0.2. \n\nDownload:\n\n.CRAFT file:[http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230948-n-4k-arrowhead-ssto](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230948-n-4k-arrowhead-ssto)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T08:03:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 08:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Screeno**"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T02:03:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E (**Warning! in my game i\u0027m playing with an aerodynamics config numbers exactly between that of 1.0 and 1.0.2 because i hate the 1.0.2 too much drag thing, and i thought 1.0 was fun but don\u0027t want to stray to far from \u0022stock\u0022 personally i think squad should implement this best of both worlds config in the next patch as it would please many.\\* i have not tested this in the 1.0.2 configs, do so at your own risk!!!\\* lol)**\n\n.... \\*leaves\\*\n\nEDIT : Now that this has been tested, Great work actually ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T03:47:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 03:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SHiftER2O**"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T02:23:50Z","Content":"Let\u0027s not be too trigger-happy on the dismissal.
