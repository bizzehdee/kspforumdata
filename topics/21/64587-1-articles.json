The Cutlass was said to be ahead of its time. However, this ship had a high accident rate that it didn\u0027t stay in service for that long... But unlike the one in real life, I put a reaction wheel into my version of the Cutlass. In KSP, that thing can take off at a really short distance, and fly really high. I managed to fly it around Kerbin, but fell short of reaching the runway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Rj4rs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
