The idea is to also encourage others to try someone\u0027s craft build at least once in a while. I am really not one that does this often because I get caught in my own circle of building and posting. The ideas is to try someone\u0027s craft and tag them saying a little something positive about their\u00A0craft. There are a lot of builders but some craft may not be all that it seems to be, I myself have some that you may find looks nice but handling is not so great, if someone tries it they may choose not to post it here. This will give us a place see and try craft that we may have never tried at all if they had not gotten someone\u0027s\u00A0opinion about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease if you think of a better title or anything that can be added to this thread to make it work better let me know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is my Example Format\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/50750-azimech/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Azimech\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Today I flew the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/98700-stock-helicopters-turboprops-first-flight-around-kerbin-page-49/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2856324\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E77I - Azi19 Jolly Jinn\u003C/a\u003E I applied the brakes to allow the engines to gain some RPM\u0027S then press AG 1 as directed, gave it full throttle and the craft looked so awesome vibrating much like a real one.
