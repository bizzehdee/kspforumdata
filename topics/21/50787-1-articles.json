Obviously, air intake engines will not work so the plane has to fly under rocket power, be capable of landing and be capable of being refueled both on the ground and in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost your ideas here, stock parts only, no mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of what I have so far. This SSTO flew from Kerban all the way to Duna with only its two NERVA engines.

This idea comes from docking tugs. A docking tug needs to have rockets that point in both directions to stop heavy payloads quickly because turning around isn\u0027t an option. I also have mini docking ports on the top and bottom of the plane. The top port is for orbital refuel and the bottom port is for surface refuel. Ideally, I\u0027d like to have a rover on the ground that can slide an arm under the plane and dock to the port on the bottom and then refuel it. I still need to develop this rover though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the rockets need to be controlled with action groups for quick use when it comes time to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
