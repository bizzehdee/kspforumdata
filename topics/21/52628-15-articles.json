I\u0027ve made some refinements to the launcher; keep in mind that the original was a test case. The next iteration uses an additional second stage engine (4 now) and replaces the 12 UA1205 boosters with 8 Space Shuttle SRBs. This gives a much better TWR off the pad and for circularization, which makes it easier to control overall. It also carries a 15m payload fairing base for 575 tons to LEO.
