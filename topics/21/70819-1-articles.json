What are some arrangements of parts that you like to use in your ships?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my first game, I used B9 parts to make interplanetary space shuttle designs. Picture a NASA orbiter with Star Trek warp nacelles instead of wings, and that\u0027s what they looked like. They worked pretty well, too -- with some careful planning, I could fit a Mun lander inside and carry it all the way to Dres and back. That was fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second game made use of Talisar\u0027s doughnut-shaped fuel tanks, resulting in ships like the one in my signature. They were my favorite, aesthetics-wise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy third (and current) game uses SLS parts to make transfer stages for whatever payload I want to carry around. Not as pretty, but very practical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voculus","CreatedById":85437,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T12:20:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always try to live by the Rule of Cool.
