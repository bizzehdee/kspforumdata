Looks (short of) like a shuttle, flies like a much more useful 20mT SSTO.","CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T16:28:04Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T16:28:04Z","Content":"So yeah, today is really release day. Another one! This time, a true workhorse: a medium sized cargo bay you can fill to the brim (half a Big Red, or in other words, big enough for any of my base modules), and ample cabin to carry passengers and do crew rotations and stuff. And pretty simple to use! \n\n![8dn5nGU.png](http://i.imgur.com/8dn5nGU.png)\n\nThe only note of caution would be to remember to turn on the fuel cell in the cargo bay, really. Yes, I know, that means it can\u0027t stay up forever, but I actually like that it\u0027ll take you resources to stay up long unless you are docked to a station. It is also equipped with a handy rear-facing Sr. docking port (if you launch with a nosecone in there, you drag will be considerably less, BTW), so you can actually tug it around and/or use it to tug around stuff. Don\u0027t now why you would like to deploy it elsewhere, but maybe you have an amazing crane in Laythe to put cargoes in and out of the bay... or an idea to build one with the new KAS like I do. There\u0027s room in there for the container to store the parts in, too... ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n![qoMBHw5.png](http://i.imgur.com/qoMBHw5.png)\n\nAs for payload, most of the cargoes you can fit there, volume wise, will be lighter than a X200-32, and there is enough room in there for a Munar lander or something. Meaning this can fulfil from satellite contracts, to launching Munar science missions, to ferrying tourists onwards to their destinations, or deploying interplanetary probes.\n\nAnyhow, the build is really so straightforward that there is really not much else for me to tell you about it. It won\u0027t slow down your game at all (80 parts only), it is quite simple to use (action groups explained on the file), and it makes a great general-purpose shuttle. So have fun trying it out if you do, and if not at least enjoy the pretty pictures!\n\n**IMGUR ALBUM**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

But I\u0027m running out of pointy things I haven\u0027t used at some point! Spatha kinda worked since was short of the intermediate of the three... am I foreshadowing the next one much? Hahaha, anyhow, you have all seen it in the SSTO thread as I built them if you were paying attention.\n\nAs to the Eagle, the last version I built before 0.90 abandoned the idea of SSTOing on airbreathers and returned to its 100% chemical origins, so it actually short of works already... but the nuke changes has me rethinking the whole thing. Might abandon the whole idea of two separate drive systems, or come up with something else, or just rebalance and isolate both fuel systems... don\u0027t know yet, really. But I can tell you that I already have the Base Pack repackaged, and I built a cute, very symmetric robotic chemical-only stand-in for the Eagle that can do the same job in much less parts. Basically a shorter version of the lander that gets a whole pack on the ground, for individual module dropping/launching. It is much less awesome-looking than this, tough...\n\n![V8HbyHC.png](http://i.imgur.com/V8HbyHC.png)\n\nRune.

Thanks to the new heating effects the nuke engines have been rendered quite inert when it comes to using them on long distance burns.

This is what happened when I though about a nuke-less Eagle...\n\n![jTRe8LO.png](http://i.imgur.com/jTRe8LO.png)\n\nIt went something like this: *...well, balancing the fuel for nukes sounds like work. But if I ditch the nukes, there is no point in having two different axis of propulsion, if both are going to have similar isp. Unless one of them is airbreathers, of course. And the VTOL part would Duna-rate it... hey, remember that cool way of putting the BigS wings together? You could use that...* the rest is a couple hours fiddling, this is the pre-production test just before test-flying it, which can wait for when I\u0027ve not spent the whole afternoon on KSP.\n\nRune.

Also, I forgot to turn on the fuel cell and run out of juice without pilots inside: it still made orbit unguided.
