I would love to have bay doors that slide back (and wingtips that fold), But we need Infernal Robotics to make that happen.\n\n(Also the new landing gear that porkjet is working on are absolutely perfect for this craft. That will be great.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T08:42:05Z","Content":"Another seriously \u0022seksy\u0022 plane you got there, Exo... and you know, if the new aerodynamic model is supposed to work more like reality, this kind of thing *should* work even better under it.

In fact, the only way that I seriously expect it to change how flying feels is in the middle to high altitudes (10-20kms).\n\nRune.

In my experience with FAR and NEAR, most of my craft were totally unusable because of using wing parts as structural members, fuselage skinning, duct ramps, etc. FAR had no idea what to make of those pieces that are largely there for aesthetic reasons and weren\u0027t meant to be lifting surfaces."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T16:30:53Z","Content":"Nice plane EXO I took it for a spin.

I haven\u0027t been able to play much recently, and haven\u0027t tested any of my existing stuff in the newer versions.\n\nI gave it a try in v1.0.4 and I couldn\u0027t get to VR on the KSC runway. It only reached about 122 m/s and it was still solidly on the runway, and there wasn\u0027t a runway any more.\n\nIt looks good, but either I am doing something wrong or the new aerodynamics can mess up complex wing structures.\n\nI shall try a few things when I have the time, maybe approximating JATO bottles with an SRB.\n\nA mod I can see a use for would be a small-diameter SRB with built-in decoupler and a fairly short burn time to get something up to flying speed. Size-0 (0.625m) with a nose-cone and a high ejection force decoupler."}]}
