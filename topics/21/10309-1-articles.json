For instance, the radial decoupler is half the weight of a vertical - so it makes more sense to have a wider ship than a taller one simply from that. Since I also gain more stability during launch, this also helps in ways I did not expect.\n\nMechjeb 1.8.1 added an interesting feature for its autopilot for launching to orbit which gives you statistics for how your ship\\\u0027s thrust is being used. I was shocked when I discovered 3/4 of all the thrust being put out by the first stage of my ship was being eaten by drag alone.\n\nI was even more surprised when I discovered that simply by letting the solid boosters act alone in this design rather than having the liquid engines fire right off the pad the ship actually has slightly more fuel left in orbit.\n\nThis particular variant of the design can get to a 100km orbit via mechjeb with a tiny bit of fuel remaining in the launch phase tanks with four full tanks on the lander. The ship can then land on the mun, as well as fly back and land on kerbin with the remaining fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"Hikaru","CreatedById":9643,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T00:45:43Z","Content":"This is a minor revision to V17; after thoroughly testing it the design unfortunately was topheavy and tended to flip over during the second booster stage. This revision prevents this problem by putting all of the boosters at the bottom of the ship.\n\nIt puts quite a bit of torque on the entire ship while firing the boosters due to weight and thrust changes, but the winglets appear to be enough to keep it on course during this difficult phase. Honestly I\\\u0027d like to come up with something less failure prone, but it appears I will need to either rethink the entire design from scratch again or come up with an idea I haven\\\u0027t yet to correct this problem."},{"CreatedByName":"mGGCwnAnnwn","CreatedById":25108,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T01:35:00Z","Content":"The problem is its width. You can use radial decouplers without building a horizontal ship aswell if you want to save on weight. Simply stack them and leave a small gap for ejection."},{"CreatedByName":"Hikaru","CreatedById":9643,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T05:25:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The problem is its width.

Randomly, launches will fail, or work. I can\\\u0027t really explain it - but the workaround appears to be to add struts to the top of the boosters and attach them somewhere higher on the ship.\n\nThis does NOT fix its torquing at launch time, nor could I fly that beast on manual. So, I redesigned yet again...\n\nAfter doing several more redesigns of the booster stages, it seems that it\\\u0027s simply easier to add an extra three liquid fuel tanks to the stack than it is to make multiple booster stages work. To give some idea, the complicated booster staging I\\\u0027ve been working on for something like 23 revisions. I\\\u0027ve never been able to make it work like I wanted - this ship design is the first one that seems to fix all of the problems I have been having without driving me crazy by being weirdly unstable."}]}
