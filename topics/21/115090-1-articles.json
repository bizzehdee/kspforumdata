No? Anyway, it\u0027s received a 1.0 facelift and has been re-purposed as an heavy duty lander, cargo transporter and mother ship. \n\n![5bcz278.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5bcz278.jpg)\n\nThe bare bones version puts out 5.5k of Delta V and is Tylo capable to boot. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n![9zq3SsF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9zq3SsF.jpg)\n\nThe Bulldog Mk2 is unique among my designs in that the aft and tail sections are balanced around the drive section, meaning the chassis can be extended out to create a huge number of varients while still retaining perfect balance, pretty neat huh? ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n![yfdSSZz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yfdSSZz.jpg)\n\nThe Bulldog currently comes in three flavours, there\u0027s the standard model, cargo version (pictured bellow), the maxi edition which is built around the CRG-50 cargo bay, and finally the BYO or build your own version (pictured above), which comes preloaded with Moth Mk2 and Puff Puff ultralight dropships.\n\n![9U1mj9j.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9U1mj9j.jpg)\n\nDeveloped at the same time as the Bulldog is the Puff Puff, a ultralight RCS powered dropship designed from the ground up to serve as a base builder, light tug, micro lander, emergency escape vessel and generally awesome all rounder. \n\n![wGmfQ7K.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wGmfQ7K.jpg)\n\nComing in at just 25 parts the Puff Puff is simple, easy to use and robust. You can fit up to two Puff Puffs in the CRG-25 cargo bay in either over...\n\n![R7mBLOz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/R7mBLOz.jpg)\n\n...or under configurations.\n\n![HEzk507.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HEzk507.jpg)\n\nDespite its size it has some impressive hauling capabilities and can even build stuff on Tylo if needbe.\n\n![Lb6C3Ul.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Lb6C3Ul.jpg)\n\n**OWNERS GUIDE:**\n\n**BULLDOG MK 2** - By far the biggest dropship in the fleet the Bulldog Mk2 is a very powerful vessel but one that needs to be treated with respect. The handlings pretty good for its size but I\u0027d advise you to activate the RCS subsystem close to landing as this will make the craft a lot more agile. SAS should be left on at all times, and a joystick is highly recommended. Like my previous designs the Bulldog Mk2 features a horizontal cockpit for suborbital flying/landing and a vertically mounted docking port for orbital piloting. When performing burns with the navball the top docking port must be selected, this also applies if using Mechjeb. The Maxi version of the craft has its vertical axis docking port located inside the cargo bay.\n\n**PUFF PUFF** - The polar opposite of the Bulldog the Puff Puff is light, compact and extremely (maybe even too) agile. It\u0027s designed primarily as a base builder, emergency escape vessel and light tug although it can also serve a compact lander if needbe. It puts out around 2.7k of Delta V and can operate on most panetary bodies in the Kerbal system. It comes with a parachute allowing for safe landings back on Kerbin, it probably goes without saying but be sure to orient the vessel to protect the parachute during re-entry!\n\n**CONTROLS:**\n\n1 - Toggle Engines\n\n3 - Toggle Nav Lights (Bulldog Mk2 Only)\n\n5 - Undock/De-Couple Top Docking Port\n\n9 - Toggle Ladders (Bulldog Mk2 Only)\n\n0 - Toggle Cargo Bay Doors (Bulldog Mk2)/Cut Chute (Puff Puff)\n\nABORT - Undock/De-Couple Cargo Port\n\nSorry about the delay getting these out, things have just been a busy for me lately. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the crafts and if anyone needs a custom version of either of these vessels feel free to flick me a PM. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCupcake...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T06:09:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 06:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cupcake...**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T06:07:11Z","Content":"Very nice!
