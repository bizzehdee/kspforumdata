And at least in my experience they won\u0027t overheat. Next time try leaving them at max throttle and right click one to see it\u0027s power output. At around 700m/s they start to make max power, and they also start to overheat, but as they climb closer to 1km/s the power output will drop, and they will stop overheating. By 1.1km/s they\u0027re making essentially zero power and it\u0027s time to turn them off, even if you still have intake air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you want to try a VTOL with the radial Rockomax engines, I\u0027ve got a few, just check out the link in my sig.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWanderfound, great videos as always. I\u0027m going to have to try that trick with the canard pitch settings. For someone that says they suck at flying VTOLs you seemed to do just fine. One trick though, you use a lot of fuel using the vernors to arrest your climb rate by just thrusting downwards. On a craft like that one with a narrow wingspan, I\u0027d be more inclined to do a quick barrel roll, or just a quick roll 90* one way then 90* back the other way. This spills off a lot of your vertical thrust without having to adjust throttle or use a ton of fuel with the vernors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering, does that thing stay balanced when you\u0027re low on fuel?

I have a problem though: I downloaded the Kerbodyne Initiale, as I am in career mode, but when I launch it, it often pulls sharply to the right on the runway. I can keep it on course with manual steering but it\u0027s tricky to get to takeoff speed without tipping and smashing a wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly this wasn\u0027t happening for you when you made it, so I\u0027m wondering if a new FAR version changed something? I am in career mode, and only have basic action groups, which will change the jet\u0026gt;rocket transition, but shouldn\u0027t change runway performance. I am using the Level 2 Runway in career mode, but I\u0027ve tried the same .craft in Sandbox and it has the same problem. If I can get it off the runway with decent speed, it flies ok, but this is rare. Planes I\u0027ve made recently, although they have plenty of other problems, don\u0027t yaw so hard on the runway. I know that normally a pull to the side would mean too much weight on landing gear, but wouldn\u0027t that pull in random directions? Also this plane isn\u0027t too heavy. Reseating the landing gear with angle snap on doesn\u0027t change anything, so it\u0027s certainly on vertically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tried putting a T800 in the cargo bay in Sandbox. It pulls to the left as it starts, then at 50m/s it starts pulling right again. This is very confusing behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, possibly unrelated, most planes I make get very unstable around 20km-25km even though their stability derivatives at similar altitude and speed show green. They change attitude with controls, but this seems to have no effect on their course until I pitch so high that they suddenly flip and explode. Am I just piloting wrong? The few times I\u0027ve been able to try the Initiale at 20km it worked fairly well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn both scenarios, I\u0027m usually using FAR\u0027s flight assists, but I have tried all combinations of SAS, FAR, and no assist. I haven\u0027t tweaked SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
