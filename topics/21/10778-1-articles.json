Unlike current designs for real world applications, the Mothership vehicle in this case is sacrificial, and needs to be at a very steep angle to launch the rocket successfully. \n\n![woot.jpg](http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r2/omegasynth/woot.jpg)\n\nUpdated Image\n\n![woot2.jpg](http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r2/omegasynth/woot2.jpg)\n\nTips:\n\nOn take-off, throttle down to zero before launch.\n\nWatch your alignment, this thing likes to skate.\n\nAt 100m/s (75% throttle) turn off SAS and start leaning on that upward attitude adjustment, then punch the accelerator. Be careful, this thing likes to clip that first rocket stage! If you time it right, you can launch off the end of the runway where there\\\u0027s a small dip, big enough to get this thing at the right angle for a take-off.\n\nWhile in-flight, any time you need to dis-engage the SAS (say right before rocket launch) make sure to hold \u0027S\u0027 on your keyboard, the ship has a bad habit of wanting to bungee straight down when the SAS is offlined and this can cause...well...I\\\u0027m sure you get the picture. ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)\n\nIf you get this thing to the Mun, lemme know. Enjoy!\n\nDisclaimer: the creator of this aircraft started out with a record of 1 in 10 take-offs being successful, with the rest of the attempts ending in mulched Kerbals and mile-long wreckage trails. As of the time of this posting I am now closer to 3 in 5 take-offs being successful. This ship will make you want to pull your hair out just on the take-off, and yet the real challenge comes once you are in the air ???"},{"CreatedByName":"RayneCloud","CreatedById":11227,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T06:53:27Z","Content":"This thing doesn\\\u0027t work at all...crashes every single time..."},{"CreatedByName":"Omegalegion","CreatedById":9305,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T06:55:58Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ve gotten it up in the air, the rocket launch...now that\\\u0027s a bit more tricky\n\nEdit: here\\\u0027s a screenshot i took just now, proving its air-worthy.
