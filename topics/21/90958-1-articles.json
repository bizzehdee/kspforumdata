I put a lot of effort into this and even engineered the Lego using basic programs like paint and notepad on my computer to count and figure out what parts to use before ordering them part by part threw the Lego website \u0022pick a brick\u0022 in the end I used 92 different parts numbering over 400 in total parts. It was not cheep though about 100 dollars. If you wana try it yourself GO FOR IT! It took several weeks to design order and build. The whole lego plane is designed to move its parts and features JUST LIKE THE GAME! The lego engines are attached to a ball socket so it can maneuver just like the engine gimbals in the game. The Lego canards and flaps all move up down and side ways just like the game and the Lego wheels even move exactly like the game they can be retracted upwards and move to change direction or be lowered for the rover wheel just like the game! I even put lego robotic arms to be like the lander legs that keep the tanks in place just liek the game! The Lego Space plane can do everything my KSP Space plane can... except fly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I did everything on my own.

So I made my \u0022Butterfly Boar\u0022 space plane SINGLE STAGE TO ORBIT or SSTO into a lego, Along with its \u0022Space Dingy\u0022 which helps it create distant interplanetary space ships or DIPPS for short. I call them B.B. and D.I.P.S.S. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E DIPPS can also sustain artificial gravity when rotated. The KSP space plane can carry up to 6 tons of cargo into orbit around kerbal the cargo size and shape is usually in the shape and size of a 4.5 ton 1 meter wide fuel tank. It can also eject its tank in space and refuel by connecting to another tank. Using its rover wheel on the ground once it lands it can roam around. It can also repair it by raising it up with the three plane wheels. It has made successful trips to Laythe and Duna and back with very little cost 27 200 in kerbal money for lathe n back. If you wana be friends or satire thats cool too I enjoy it take care and FLY SAFE!!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-22T12:12:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2014 12:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by EvifNam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EBetter Communication threw an image\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
