I plan to do .625m and smaller engines next, then move on to 2.5m and then 3.75m as well, that is, if you guys are interested ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nHere\u0027s the first set:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It might get kinda complicated, tho... :/\n\nHey, by the way, I\u0027ll post a different thread on this later, but I figured out a really good way to organize your crafts.\n\nYou\u0027ll notice I had my test rockets named \u0022Experimental - \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u0022, well I figured out I could categorize all my crafts this way, with tags like Experimental, Station for station pieces, Lander, Base, etc. Also, I have Recreational and Indev tabs, which, recreational being just kinda like, a roleplay thing or a replica, and Indev is something In Development, so I know where to look when I wanna work on a certain craft. I also went into the save file and disabled stock vessels, they clutter up the list, especially when it\u0027s alphabetical.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n-Slab"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:28:52Z","Content":"For some reason, KER is not accounting for thrust/isp loss at low atmosphere.
