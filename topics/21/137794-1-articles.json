Before gunpowder artillery was invented, the trebuchet was the largest, most powerful weapon used against fortified castles, and many were so large that they had to be built on the site of the siege itself, as they were too massive to be transported easily. The biggest trebuchets were able to lob boulders weighing nearly half a ton hundreds of meters\u003Csup\u003E[citation needed]\u003C/sup\u003E. A trebuchet in general is actually quite simple, being essentially a first class lever. The energy needed to operate the arm is provided by gravity (or lots of really strong guys pulling on ropes, in the case of a traction trebuchet), and an extremely heavy counterweight is mounted on the end opposite the throwing arm. A sling is often used to transfer as much energy as possible to the projectile, and the counterweight is usually mounted on a hinge to relieve stress\u00A0on the arm and help conserve energy. This design proved so effective that trebuchets continued to be used in warfare long after gunpowder weapons arrived on the battlefield, and their construction is so simple that many people still build recreations of them today.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222qQAxCc.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2qQAxCc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThe projectile fired by my trebuchet is a stayputnik probe core. It may be too light to smash buildings, but because of its weight (or lack thereof), I can make the counterweight lighter and still get a cool looking projectile. The sling is a KAS winch, which can be extended to various lengths to allow for different release angles. The only problem with this (aside from the fact that I had to use a mod) is that the projectile must be released\u00A0by an action group, making it nearly impossible to achieve a consistent, repeatable release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022m0mvj8y.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m0mvj8y.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0As you can see, I can launch the projectile a considerable distance using nothing but the power of gravity and instinct. By tuning the length of the sling and finding the best time to release the projectile, I daresay that this machine could actually launch even farther, but I haven\u0027t tested it yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002225FkizT.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/25FkizT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nHere\u0027s the trebuchet after firing. Technically it can be reloaded because it uses a KAS winch, but I\u0027m not sure if the action group used to release the ball would remain.
