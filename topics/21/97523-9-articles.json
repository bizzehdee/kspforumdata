I\u0027m having so much fun with this shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running into one small problem consistently though (and I am fully prepared to learn that I am doing something asinine): I can\u0027t seem to get the RCS systems on the MMUs to work (the ones included in the Operations Module). I load a kerbal into the seat and decouple from the shuttle, and nothing. I can control my attitude via the reaction wheel in the probe core (at least I assume that\u0027s how I\u0027m doing it), but the RCS is doing nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I know or have tried:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) RCS is on (I\u0027m dumb, but not that dumb)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Plenty of monopropellant (haven\u0027t been able to use any!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Both MMUs with multiple kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) Refocused on multiple vessels (worth a shot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(5) Returned to space center and then back to ship (also worth a shot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(6) Load a new ship and launch all over again -- same result\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso potentially worth noting is that the right-click menu for the kerbal seems to still be the EVA one (e.g. has \u0022EVA Report\u0022 as an option) while he is sitting in the MMU seat. I don\u0027t have enough experience with the command seat to know if this is out of the ordinary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany idea what I could be doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T04:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TeeJaye85\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TeeJaye85\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-snip- \u003Cp\u003Eany idea what I could be doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you checked that the mono prop tanks are not forbidden?
