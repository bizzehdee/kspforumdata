But still it is about the Spacecraft Exchange Forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all I really really love all those nice crazy silly and crazy (yes crazy has to be said twice) ideas of Spaceships, Landers, Rovers, Space Stations or Bases. But honestly I would LOVE a little bit more of a structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldnt it be alot better if we would have 2 subforums? One for STOCK ONLY crafts and one for all those with modded parts (or those that can only work in modded enviroment like FAR stuff)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play mainly stock and honestly I find it a slightly annoying (nah wrong word... uncomfortable? aeh well hard to describe) to browse only those vehicles that I might actually be able to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCause of this I suggest/vote/hope/pray for a split subforum for Stock and Modded Crafts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreetings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoodle Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: If someone has a link to a small early (aka low tech) plane that works in 1.05 to get those close Survey missions around the KSP done it would be lovely.
