This isn\u0027t strictly necessary, but some parts of the ship stop functioning unless a kerbal is in the command seat. I have no clue why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn flat ground you can get her up to top speed from the wheels safely, and if you turn the engines on you can go even faster. I haven\u0027t broken her by going too fast on flat ground yet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe extremely careful when handling bumps or uneven terrain. When you move the craft off the runway be very careful in doing so, as the wheels have a habit of breaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a wheel breaks, don\u0027t panic. Stop the craft and get a kerbal out to repair the wheel(s). Don\u0027t attempt to continue driving with the broken wheel. This could lead to disastrous consequences. You can get the Kerbal back in via the ladder, though if you need to get the kerbal higher to activate the ladder (Or if the ladder clips through one of the wheel pontoons, making it unclimbable) you can climb on top of the pontoons using the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBraking is intentionally dulled on this craft, so be careful when you are approaching the ocean. I had to just leave the brakes on once I got to the beach rather than turn them on and off. You may want to increase the braking power slightly if you\u0027re having trouble getting it into the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in the water, stage the wheel pontoons, turn on the jets and sail off to whatever adventures you want to have! I haven\u0027t tested turning to the extent that I should\u0027ve, but I can say that doing basic turns at medium speeds should be safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalk kerbals on the deck of the ship while it is moving at your own risk. I recommend having all of them seated whenever you move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/7w8nkh3xdim7kbg/MV%20Seayuz.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClick on this line of text to download the beautiful craft!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/616221445686779537/B4DF3B7C39B3C85F5FE4957BB8D789B29223BBAB/\u0022 alt=\u0022B4DF3B7C39B3C85F5FE4957BB8D789B29223BBAB\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/616221445686778767/BF5B677D905C338F84BD84D98BB1743F9A75CE20/\u0022 alt=\u0022BF5B677D905C338F84BD84D98BB1743F9A75CE20\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/616221445686769404/F7944891CE6DCE37EF15062A312F1E49965A4549/\u0022 alt=\u0022F7944891CE6DCE37EF15062A312F1E49965A4549\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/616221445686778557/CB5EC6B1C0C429C949884EEF2C800405167C61AC/\u0022 alt=\u0022CB5EC6B1C0C429C949884EEF2C800405167C61AC\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, to anyone who did notice, yes, the smokestack is a bit off-center.
