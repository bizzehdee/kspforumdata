Thanks to the latest turboramjet technology it is capable of Mach 3.5 in the stratosphere while retaining a Mach 2\u002B dash speed at low altitude; allowing an emergency escape sprint unmatched even by alien-augmented fighters at low level. Troop deployment is by infantry fast-rope or ballistic drop of Mechanized Exoskeletal Cybersuits. We believe Dr. Shen\u0027s team can fabricate parachute-retarded pallets for deployment of SHIVs and other ground vehicles.\n\nShould you wish to evaluate the craft for your own purpose you may find blueprints for flight simulation attached below.\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/pandoraskitten/X-4A-Enforcer-Assault-Transport](http://kerbalx.com/pandoraskitten/X-4A-Enforcer-Assault-Transport)\n\nGood luck Commander.\n\n**=== TOP SECRET ===**\n\n**FOR X-COM EYES ONLY**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q2qPggkdF10?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T16:58:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 04:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalShade","CreatedById":139111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T12:15:48Z","Content":"I really love the way you used a cargo bay for the jet engines.

The resulting wing setup reminded me of the F-35. It\u0027s stubby and thick with visible bays near the wing root, but it generates a lot of lift. \n\nI was very surprised at the flight performance of this craft. It mimics 2k Games\u0027 intended visuals and craft performance quite perfectly, with the exception of not being able to do a vertical takeoff when fully laden with payload and fuel (that would be very impractical, but for short hauls in the tactical AO, no problems with this craft doing limited range VTOL. I guess in hindsight X-Com could use the Skyranger as a VTOL, but with aerial refuelling before doing supersonic intercontinental hops.\n\nThe takeoff roll is really short when fully laden, something that seems to be a trademark as I love STOL-like performance especially from large aircraft - real life C-17s look fantastic doing STOL full power takeoffs!\n\nI recorded enough inflight footage for a showcase video, so I will post and upload when I have time.

It just can\u0027t go straight over the runway, turning sharply the moment it crosses 50m/s.\n\nThankfully, if I spin up the VTOL engines early enough, it needs some 60-70m/s for take-off, which means some desperate maneuvering, struggling not to tear wings off, driving off the runway etc. Actually, the last one is the rescue: once the wheels are off the ground it stops misbehaving immediately.\n\nIt climbs to cruise altitude somewhat sluggishly - it got quite a bit of extra weight after all. Three rapiers, four LV-Ns, all fuel tanks full (both LF and OX), six shock cones (heavier but less draggy; need all six for the rapiers), and a big battery and a reaction wheel in the cargo bay. Add a full set of RCS, shielded port instead of the nose cone, and two solar panels from Asteroid Day mod, the only non-stock parts. Can be replaced with standard panels freely. Plus some fuel lines, some struts, heavier wheels... that all adds up. Anyway, 50m/s of vertical speed isn\u0027t too bad. \n\nAt cruising altitude it gains the 1000m/s in quite reasonable time, then it needs to be *carefully* pitched up, to 300m/s of climb. If you do this too fast, it will lose wings.\n\nOnce air starts running out I switch Rapiers to closed cycle (giving Whips a couple seconds more before they sputter out). That\u0027s when I fire the nukes too.\n\nThe oxidizer for Rapiers last until some 35km, with apoapsis of about 55km. The rest of the climb is done on Nukes, but by then, with 1800m/s and a long time until apoapsis circularizing is just a formality.\n\nUnfortunately in the orbit it had some 150m/s of dV left. Barely enough to reach an LKO fuel station.\n\nAlso: as I burned for the selfies, I brought apoapsis low enough for reentry. I put phys-warp at 4x and one of the cubic octagonal struts by which Nukes are attached exploded to overheating (bug). The crippled plane with some pieces of wing missing failed to perform the reentry, lost all wings on some 32km, and the hull plummeted to death.\n\n So, it\u0027s just a proof-of-concept, a prototype, not a functional STOVLSSTO plane. Also, the cargo bay was mostly empty. If there was any cargo, it would need to include extra fuel. (although, due to Pilot Assistant glitching somewhere around 33km up, sending me spinning and wasting some dV, I guess I\u0027d reach the orbit with a bit more fuel.)

I might play with the SSTO craft you provided and work on balance and weight reduction but it\u0027s way beyond the original mission specifications. Still, sub-orbital point to point travel might not be out of reach of this design and I do have about 8 oxidizer tanks in the base design to play with, not counting the two in the tanks that may result in having to re-trim the airfoils for balance. So I might try an all-rapier or 4 Whiplash and 1 LVT-30 design since upper atmospheric drag is close to negligible. \n\nThe base design can cruise at Mach 2.5 around 15km altitude while consuming just 1.5 units of LF per second. Most of the fuel is used up climbing and accelerating to cruise speed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-15T05:04:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2015 05:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T07:29:58Z","Content":"I think giving it two or three aerospikes would easily make it suborbital.without all the mess I made to make it spaceworthy."},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T14:09:41Z","Content":"Great craft, so much cool for so few parts.
