I have 2 spaceplanes, an Astrotaxi with 4 tourists and a Light Cargo v1.5 (Great name, I know) in LKO waiting to come down. I\u0027m rather liking the Light Cargo, I\u0027ll post it after I tweak it once more after it\u0027s first full test flight. I\u0027m still having trouble on reentry with the Astrotaxi though. You said 20km Ap, 5-15 deg pitch, right? Well, holding 10 deg, by the time I get to 40km I lose control. It doesn\u0027t twitch suddenly, it just starts getting slowly less stable. I think the craft still has the control authority to hold it, it\u0027s just too hard to manage all 3 axes at once. I tried SAS tuning stock/your settings, FAR assist, Pilot Assistant\u0027s pitch hold (which I am probably using wrong because I don\u0027t understand the interface very well). What system do you use to keep it steady? Just tuned SAS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think I will mod the Astrotaxi with a docking port as you suggest - it looks like I will soon need a shuttle to de/orbit crew \u0026amp; experiments from lab stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T02:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lordcirth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lordcirth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat system do you use to keep it steady?
