Designed with the common plane n00b in mind, it was designed to be a stable platform to fly and have fun on, while also being a sleek, fast jet able to cut through the air at a top speed of 150m/s! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XCs22XY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XCs22XY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a fairly low partcount, the OS Trainer Jet is able to be flown on nearly any computer and may be able to land on the wonderful aircraft carriers some of you have made. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AjSK2TJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AjSK2TJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith it\u0027s patent pending clipping technology, it is made using the most recent advances in both the NADI and NASI technology department.
