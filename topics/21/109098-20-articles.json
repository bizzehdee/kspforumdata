I know the usual tricks for fixing this at this point, but I was wondering if there was a good way of predicting this kind of behavior from the stability derivatives prior to takeoff (you know, fix the problem ahead of time instead of getting up there and realizing the problem exists). So, how about it - is there a value in the stability derivatives that should say to me \u0022your pitch authority is going to go from suck to blow at this point\u0022? It\u0027d be a relatively high magnitude green number - I\u0027m thinking M\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E but I\u0027m not wholly sure.\n\nWhen you are looking at the FAR Control \u0026 Analysis tab in FAR, the one with all of the numbers, change the speed and altitude numbers to the altitude in KM and speed in mach that you are having the problem at. I am pretty sure you are going to see a Down Vel Derivatives authority number go well into the red. If the Mw number is in the red at a set speed you will find that you are having a loss of pitch authority. The easiest fix for this is canards.\n\n![dnPuHqI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dnPuHqI.jpg)\n\nBut what does the aircraft look like do you have any pictures?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T14:09:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 02:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo**"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T14:44:53Z","Content":"@Hodo: Canards to fiz positive Mw is a bad idea, he would need to tweak it for artificial stability I wouldn\u0027t suggest that.\n\nMoving the wings back is the easiest way to fix Mw.\n\n\\*I am just talking about fixing a red Mw by the way."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T15:07:20Z","Content":"Maybe I didn\u0027t ask the question well - at what *magnitude* of M\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E should I expect to see lawn dart behavior for a given speed and altitude?

This with the external weapons load causing a shifting drag issue when they are used, I would extend the body of the craft and switch to an internal weapons bay setup. This would keep the craft streamlined and would extend the craft length to smooth out your wave drag flow. This inturn will make the craft faster with less power.

Apparently they\u0027re lighter than procedural structural elements, so I just took a load of them and removed a lot of fuel, and hey presto, a lightweight plane! The procedural parts allowed me to make a much sleeker plane than my previous designs.\n\nSo yeah, it\u0027s another light fighter, this time with some additional inspiration drawn from the Mirage F1, in addition to other jets of a similar role. \n\nI also turned the difficulty up a notch by setting area ruling to full, and it still reaches Mach 2.2 with the same SNECMA Atar as the F1, courtesy of AJE. It did however require an intercontinental flight to reach that speed!\n\nThe handling is sublime. Easy to fly, pretty high AoAs, almost 9g turns at speed. It doesn\u0027t do cobras, at least with the low fuel amount I fly it with. It might reach higher AoAs with more weight.\n\nI\u0027ll put missiles on it at some point.
