It\u0027s main power comes from Turbo Ramjets and Swivels **only!**\n\nHere\u0027s the full album:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

To be honest, I didn\u0027t fly it in any special way, but I\u0027ll try to recall the most important parts of the flight:\n\n1. Climb on jets to about 20km\n\n2. Level your flight\n\n3. Accelerate up to something about 1100 m/s, then pitch up\n\n4. Watch the TWR and don\u0027t let it go down below 1.5 (You need KER for that)\n\n5. When it reaches 1.7-1.5 TWR hit ACTION GROUP 1 (toggle Swivels)\n\n6. When the jets run out of air hit ACTION GROUP 2 (toggle jets \u002B intakes)\n\n7. Rise the nose 20-30 degrees up and watch the Apoapsis grow.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt\u0027s mainly used as a crew ferry to LKO, but I\u0027m thinking about sending one of those to my future Laythe polar colony. I\u0027m going to keep tweaking and improving it, so you can expect updates if there\u0027s enough interest in this project.\n\nAnd here\u0027s the DL link: [http://www./download/shy1ii91jy2ub09/Roadrunner_MKVI.craft](http://www./download/shy1ii91jy2ub09/Roadrunner_MKVI.craft)\n\nOn KerbalX: [http://kerbalx.com/Wilcz/Roadrunner-MKVI](http://kerbalx.com/Wilcz/Roadrunner-MKVI)\n\n*Have a nice flight!*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T19:27:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T19:25:11Z","Content":"Should I upload this to something else, like KerbalSutff?

Just watching the numbers and reacting to them seems to be enough.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA new version is here! For those who haven\u0027t unlocked nodes beyond 550 science points!\n\n**ROADRUNNER X**\n\n![jnDSMRc.png](http://i.imgur.com/jnDSMRc.png)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/7f0I5)\n\nChangelog:\n\n-Added and relocated some RCS ports.\n\n-Got rid of one tail antenna (it was mirrored, now is asymmetrical).\n\n-Replaced the shock cone intakes with standard ones.\n\n-Replaced Elevon 5 with Elevon 2 (roll control).\n\n-Added second RCS tank in the cargo bay. Now it has more Monopropellant.\n\nIt\u0027s a design adapted from MKVI to fit my needs for mid-tech, low-budget career SSTO. Roadrunner MKVI should be treated as a prototyope of Roadrunner X (although the performance of both variants should be the same).\n\nThe cost of a single orbital mission is only ~2,000 credits! Take 4 tourists! Let them feel weightless! Go back! Be rich!\n\nThe X version is available here: [http://kerbalx.com/Wilcz/Roadrunner-X-KER-less](http://kerbalx.com/Wilcz/Roadrunner-X-KER-less)\n\n**WARNING!** Check action groups before flying this one! **WARNING!**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-23T13:40:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2015 01:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T14:11:34Z","Content":"Wait...

Uh, I would answer your question, but I don\u0027t remember even though I just finished another mission using the plane to save another Kerbal. About 450m/s in LKO IIRC? That\u0027s way more than enough to rendezvous and go back. But you need to remember not to be aggresive when docking, because it doesn\u0027t have much Monoprop.\n\nI totally forgot to include that info, didn\u0027t I?\n\n================EDIT================\n\nAnyway, here\u0027s another mission. See how much fuel is left in the last pic. For some reason KER gets confused whenever I fly it, so I couldn\u0027t check the dV.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
