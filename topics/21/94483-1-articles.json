My intent was to go to and from either or both moons and return safely to a Kerbin orbit all on one tank of fuel. It also had to have a lander and had to carry a probe for deployment. I fit both into a double long cargo bay with a little room to spare!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s it when it is fully loaded... By the way it holds a maximum of 9 crew members (8 if you dont want to occupy the small lander when you dock it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah320/viper45428/screenshot108_zps357c30bc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot108_zps357c30bc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander runs entirely on RCS engines, and it still packs quite a punch. The probe runs on Xenon gas; it surprisingly has a lot of thrust as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, More to come, such as... How the hell did I get this thing into space?
