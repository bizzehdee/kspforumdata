It\u0027s 2 stage. What it\u0027s carrying is close to it\u0027s limit but it can achieve a stable 100km orbit. If someone who knew what they were doing was doing it, maybe they could lift more. I kind of wish there was a wider tank type so I could make something bigger without worrying about where I\u0027m going to fit the engines and whether or not it can hold the weight of the upper stages without exploding (this was an issue in my design when I had another small tank on the second stage).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T16:35:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t this subforum for exchanging craft?
