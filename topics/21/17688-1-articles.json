Take off procedures are simple. Half throttle, SAS on, trim all the way nose down and she\u0027ll take off beautifully horizontally. Landing approaches and level flight require an almost fighteningly nose down attitude, but this is all the better for the pilots, as they have a nice clear view of the landing area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe jets and wings are obviously canted to help the ugly duck get off the ground quickly, as well as back onto it at a low, low speed of 30m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture plans include a payload slung underneath, such as remote controlled rovers, as well as kerbal transport in the form of crew tanks, as well as desert supply dropping, but those are currently on hold. while I pay attention to my girlfriend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFully stock.
