It glides well, and landing can be held off until the speed is below 35 m/s. In fact it prefers slower landings, as if you try to put it down at excess speed, it tends to veer off the runway.\n\nStaging a second time whilst in flight will have it doing what seagulls tend to do. I\u0027ll let you find out for yourself.\n\n![sg1.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/sg1.jpg)\n\n![sg2.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/sg2.jpg)\n\n![sg3.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/sg3.jpg)\n\n![sg4.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/sg4.jpg)\n\n[Craft download file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c8kzb2vw0dobf04/Seagull.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"whoshotdk","CreatedById":115018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T00:37:16Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never seen those Mk3/Mk2 adapters used as a plane fuselage before; really well done on an inspiring design that actually looks like a Seagull!\n\nIn-flight staging did exactly what I thought it would do; though it wasn\u0027t quite realistic as my car wasn\u0027t parked underneath ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nGreat job!"}]}
