The problem with less engines is the fuel burn per km - it seems more efficient to have extra engines \u0026 shut them down ( or in this case run them all throttled well back - that helps with heat too ) but get to economical altitudes faster, than claw your way up at bare minimum thrust - this is the biggest problem with Rapiers, it\u0027d be fixed if we had a model of a Reaction Engines Scimitar ( sure I\u0027ve seen one but no idea where ). A lot of this experimentation is going to help spaceplane design, of course... and this\u0027d be a much more sensible craft for RSS or 64x because by the time you\u0027ve got it settled at altitude it\u0027s 10 mins away from descent :P  \n\nI just left it at a suitable pitch \u0026 let it settle on an altitude - less pitch means less drag of course, but it\u0027ll also settle at higher dynamic pressure which brings drag back up so in the end nothing much changed. Wave drag area is about 5m^2, not really much I can do to bring that down without a complete redesign.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T15:32:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Doke","CreatedById":149975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T18:15:29Z","Content":"@Wanderfound  \n\nThere\u0027s something very rewarding about making a functional plane with the entry-level parts.
