My suggestion would be to add 2 more engines with 2 fuel tanks each. This will raise your thrust-to-weight ratio for the first critical portion of the flight. Have the the other two radial fuel stacks feed into these new engines and then from there to the center stack. That way, you\\\u0027ll be dumping more dry fuel tanks along with engines you don\\\u0027t need. That should leave you with a lot more fuel when you reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso consider shooting for a lower orbit around Kerbin. Not only will it save on fuel, but it will also save a little more fuel when doing your TMI due to the Oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you might want to consider is adding some wings to land on.
