Glad someone\u0027s still flying this!!\n\nI actually JUST tested it on 1.1.2 now (this is the first time I\u0027ve fired up 1.1.2 lol), and it seems to fly fine to me.  I was able to get it up to a circular 500km orbit and back using the same \u0022realistic\u0022 flight profile as I used to fly (auto-pilot Radial mode out to about 2km-ish, then switch to prograde, roll to heads up about 30s after booster separation), but was with an empty cargo bay.\n\nManeuver nodes are tricky.  I don\u0027t really have any good advice for that, I\u0027ve always just ended up overbudgeting on fuel to make up for it.  I was working on a version that has gimbalable OMS engines instead, but never got around to finishing.  Other \u0022trick\u0022 I\u0027d thought of trying was putting in a small probe core that was properly offset along the thrust axis so that you can switch to controlling from there for burns, but again wasn\u0027t something I got around to before I stopped playing. (ninja edit: looks like you already did this! does it work ok?)\n\nFor landing, couple tips.  Make sure you dump fuel to bring your CG forward as much as possible, you should only need a little bit for the entry maneuvering.  Keep your nose high about 30 degrees up from the direction of travel, you should be able to do S-Turns.  I usually have it set to just stability assist during re-entry.  From 100km altitude I\u0027d aim even more aggressively for the periapsis, there\u0027s a lot of hypersonic life when you keep your nose that high.  Nose down once you get past the heating stage (around 1200m/s I think), and try keep your speed up above 150m/s or so during the glide or you won\u0027t be able to pull out in time.\n\nReally glad someone\u0027s still enjoying this craft =)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-07T02:47:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2016 02:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Naito**"},{"CreatedByName":"Naito","CreatedById":18126,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T16:24:20Z","Content":"Updated for 1.1x\n\n[https://kerbalx.com/Naito/KSP1-Shuttle2016](https://kerbalx.com/Naito/KSP1-Shuttle2016)\n\n![MWV7hV9l.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/MWV7hV9l.jpg)\n\n### \nNew for this version:\n\n- Uses new KSP SSMEs\n- Certified to launch 0 to 68T without adjustments!

If you use SRBs in KSP, you\u0027re gonna have a hard time rolling because SRBs in KSP still don\u0027t gimbal, so you\u0027re reliant on the SSMEs to maneuver.  Inigma\u0027s SRB shuttle overcomes this with a ton of SAS units to induce the necessary torque, I used liquid engines instead partly because of the gimbal difference.\n\nSecondly make sure the \u0022neutral\u0022 state of all your engines point towards the CG of the ET and Shuttle as closely as possible.  The closer they are, the more they can gimbal in every other direction for maneuvering.  If they point straight up, then you use up almost all of your gimbal range already just pointing towards the initial launch CG, leaving much less available to adjust course and roll etc.  That\u0027ll make your shuttle more likely to pitch and twist out of control whenever you try to give it any control inputs."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T09:28:27Z","Content":"You can do it, but you need to roll early, and end quickly, you can\u0027t muck around\n\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/?app=core\u0026module=system\u0026controller=embed\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fgfycat.com%2FSecondhandFarawayEchidna\u0022 style=\u0022height:535px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nYou don\u0027t need huge amount\u0027s of SAS but it needs to be placed in the right spots, like a tripod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-12T09:30:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2016 09:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by selfish\\_meme**"},{"CreatedByName":"He_162","CreatedById":152811,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T13:14:42Z","Content":"\\*Finds this awesome ship\\*\n\nWHY HAVE I NOT SEEN THIS BEFORE ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png \u0022:o\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Naito","CreatedById":18126,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T20:51:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, selfish\\_meme said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You don\u0027t need huge amount\u0027s of SAS but it needs to be placed in the right spots, like a tripod.\n\u003E \n\nThat\u0027s one way to do it yes.

Thus the GPC software was divided into multiple OPS modes. Each was specialized in a specific area of flight.\n\nThis KSP shuttle sorta simulates this by having 4 distinct control points: Cockpit, Docking port, Orbit computer, Re-entry computer.\n\n- The cockpit is obvious, it defaults to a 0 degree alpha making the orbiter fly most like an airplane. This is also the preferred mode to fly during initial launch while SRBs are attached.\n- The docking port is also pretty obvious, it is best used during docking operations\n- There are TWO additional control points located below the rudder and above the center SSME.  The lower one is the \u0022on-orbit ops\u0022 mode computer.  It defaults to a 15degree alpha, which points the OMS engines better through the CG of the orbiter in orbit, allowing for more precise adjustment burns.\n- The upper one is the \u0022re-entry\u0022 mode computer.  It defaults to a 40 degree alpha, which corresponds to the recommended re-entry angle for optimal heat control and S-turns.\n\nSwitch to the Orbit computer once you separate from the ET. Recommend you keep it here for the duration of on-orbit operations, aside from docking.\n\nFor Re-entry, the new re-entry mode makes S-Turns a cinch!\n\n- Switch to the Re-entry computer once you complete your de-orbit burn and select hold prograde\n- You\u2019ll now be able to complete proper S-Turns simply by using the roll controls. The computer will keep you at the proper 40 degree nose up position.\n- Switch to the Orbit computer once you\u2019re down to about 1300m/s, you\u2019ll see your pitch trim saturate about then.\n- Switch to stability assist mode, and switch back to the cockpit for control and land from there!"},{"CreatedByName":"Naito","CreatedById":18126,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T16:07:20Z","Content":"Re-Entry with S-Turns using new \u0022Reentry OPS\u0022 computer ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n![giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/26BRq0PjSrwWhATsI/giphy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-15T15:20:09Z","Content":"Very interesting way of simulating the GPCs!
