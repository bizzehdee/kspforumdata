This one came out too beautiful not to share it with you guys straight away. Look at those lines!\n\n![W6O1iLA.png](http://i.imgur.com/W6O1iLA.png)\n\nAnd it is not only for looks. While it looks simple, and it is a mere 41 parts, the thing still has more than 1,800m/s on LKO, and can be refueled for an astounding 4,5km/s thanks to the hidden nuke. Which, BTW, you need to go transonic because the thing flies exactly like a spaceplane should: TWR\u003C1 at all points of the airbreathing flight, and barely over that on rockets. As a result, it is a bit long in getting to orbit, and it requires precise piloting (basically, going very very shallow), but just by switching autopilots you can handle things with just the mouse. \n\nIt is very gentle maneuvering, and it accelerates so slowly that the curvature of kerbin is perfect to increase AoA as you build speed when you level for a speed run (I did so at 10kms, 15, *and* 20). But hey, I took plenty of pics with the UI up so you can check all the relevant numbers and what I did at each step to milk the RAPIER until I was going at 1,500m/s and it switched to closed cycle on its own for brief kick into suborbital flight. I did take care to check that you can actually burn the tanks dry with the nuke without anything getting even close to blow up, of course (with a radiator stowed!), which is why the orbital pic you see has two radiators and the file you get has just the one and a docking port in the place of the other. Enjoy the pics and tell me how it goes if you try it out!\n\n**IMGUR ALBUM:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

If not, it\u0027ll be harder to control vertical speed with the crappy stock indicator (it\u0027s on the top, to the right of the altimeter). Basically, you climb at 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA until 10kms (make sure to use the runway to get the RAPIERs some initial bite in the air, or spend some time at 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA to build speed up to 200m/s, you\u0027ll climb faster). Then you go supersonic either manually dropping the nose slowly, or by putting the autopilot on prograde and back to standard stability assist a few times to drop the nose *gradually*, to zero out your vertical velocity. It\u0027s tricky to go over the Mach barrier, so I usually help myself by lighting the nuke briefly until I go over 340m/s. I achieve it at about 5-10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA AoA over the horizon, as you can see in the pics. From then on it\u0027s much easier, you start building speed quickly and the wings bite more air, so watch you vertical velocity like a hawk and every time it goes above 50m/s or so, you drop the nose a bit (again, on and off the prograde autopilot is a handy trick). Give yourself time to accelerate. At about 15kms, drop all vertical speed (climb rate about zero), and lock stability assist in that heading: you will speed up *mucho mucho mucho*, and as the planet curves below you, your AoA will slowly creep up, building vertical speed for the climb to orbit. When you notice your speed stops increasing as fast, light the nuke again, and when the RAPIERs go under 50kN thrust you can switch them to closed cycle. When they give out, you should have a very respectable apoapsis, so change the autopilot back to prograde to save drag, push it out of the atmosphere, coast, and finish the orbital insertion on the nuke.\n\nRune. That is why I never fly without KER. I can, but I hate it, it\u0027s like rolling the dice to see what performance I get today, or hurting my brain doing maths on the fly from times and altitudes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T11:49:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 11:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rune**"},{"CreatedByName":"ryan234abc","CreatedById":136492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:22:14Z","Content":"\u003E Rune.

It\u0027s a new one, where I basically ripped off two engines, added some radiators for looks, removed the upper wing over the engines because it had a low thermal limit, and exchanged the front tank for a 100% liquid fuel one. In the end, it\u0027s lighter and carries more paylaod, so yeah, better in every way except TWR. It looks pretty much the same, tough.\n\nRune.

In my opinion, a planet is not \u0022tamed\u0022 until you have a fuel depot orbiting it and a base on the ground with fuel extraction capabilities, plus the shuttles to link the two.

This one is an edge case, but yeah, a single RAPIER can push about 20mT to orbit, given that enough of those 20mT is fuel, and you are a good pilot.

Ok, waht I was really after was cleaning up the bay of clipped parts so I could put useful equipment like Ore scanners, but hey, whatever works.

In order to get the performance I show on the pic, though (\u003E2km/s on LKO!), you *will* have to pull temperature gauges on the way up. And hope you are going fast enough, up enough, when the RAPIER gives out.
