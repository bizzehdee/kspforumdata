Is it just considered too unrealistic? Obviously you do see it discussed in terms of planes, but I am referring more to using jets as the first stage of rocket designs. For example, here is what I was just toying with. Keep in mind that the jet stage in these rockets is just the tiny part down at the bottom:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img200/2769/2013060800001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013060800001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img189/5662/2013060800004.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013060800004.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img542/126/2013060800003.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013060800003.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img189/5662/2013060800004.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013060800004.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img845/2576/2013060800005.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013060800005.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe jets are able to lift this not tiny payload to 21,000 \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003Efeet\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#00FF00;\u0022\u003Emeters\u003C/span\u003E with just this tank before you need to decouple.
