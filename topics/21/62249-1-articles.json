Not quite. It uses four BACC boosters to get it off the ground. It seems like taking off horizontally would be difficult if not impossible with something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first prototypes were what I call and \u0022MSSMTO\u0022 or Mostly Single Stage, Mostly To Orbit. That is, it lost about 35 tonnes on the way up by accident but still got to orbit. Missing 12 engines assymetrically, a command pod, several intakes, some fuel lines, some wings and more normally doesn\u0027t get you to orbit, but in this case it got there even under monotonous unplanned disassembly with fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing has a surprisingly high Delta-V after reaching LKO. Under the best-case scenario with the launch, it might be able to get 2000 m/s out of all that rocket fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt weighs about 330 tonnes at launch and 200-260 tonnes or so in orbit. Only about 150 tonnes dry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt carries an amazing, maybe even unprecedented for Pseudo-SSTO Spaceplanes that use stock parts and FAR, 77 Kerbals in internal seating to orbit and beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also has two of each comms device and 7 docking ports of all in areas with no nearby obstructions. 4 are Junior, 2 are standard, the Dorsal 1 is senior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 note is that despite having nearly 800 kg of monoprop, it has no RCS or non-cockpit SAS. I dread to see the sort of thing that IT would dock to. What? A 2000-tonne spacestation? Does anyone even make those? Well if they do, I\u0027m sure they can send a fuel tanker with an orange tank that happens to be docked there out to feed me fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, 77-Kerbal, 330 tonne wet / 150 tonne dry pseudo-SSTO spaceplane. that can get over 100 tonnes of fuel into Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhole thing is about 350 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/CPU2I\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

But I didn\u0027t think that it would actually work well. I thought MAYBE getting it into orbit would be possible with some other stages or hyper-editting it to 20 km and 1200 m/s or something, but not just with a normal launch. It is actually a surprisingly capable craft in that it can take fairly severe damage, stall irrecoverably, etc and still eventually reach orbit (while stalled irrecoverably until about 50 km, xD). It is also extremely flyable and arguably even acrobatic in its own blue whale-like way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T11:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Genolution\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Genolution\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou beat KSP.
