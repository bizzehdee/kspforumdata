(Assuming here that you have enough engine power, intake air, and minimum of drag, so that it\u0027s possible to overspeed the heat tolerances on your spaceplane.) \u00A0So naturally, we\u0027d think to put a heatshield on the nose of the craft to take advantage of its 3300K limit, highest in the game. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you\u0027ll find out something interesting about the heatshields - if both the inside and outside attachment nodes are occupied (like the configuration you\u0027d find in an ordinary rocket stack), they are very low drag pieces. \u00A0But if the outside node is not occupied (like you\u0027d have on a capsule re-entry) the heatshield drag is stupendous, totally out of line with other similar sized parts. \u00A0I assume this is one of the tweaks made to allow for safe and easy capsule reentry from a broad range of orbits. \u00A0So if you just slap a heatshield on the nose, you will likely never get to high speed at all. \u00A0So, hack the system - attach something to the outside, but use the build tools to offset that piece away from the front. \u00A0Even better, offset it into a service bay or fairing to hide it from drag entirely. \u00A0Doing this, I routinely find that the wings (all of which have the same 2400K limit) are the limiting factor. \u00A0Not much you can do about that short of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOlMlRf9qvo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eusing heatshields themselves for wings\u003C/a\u003E...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis simple hack has me routinely seeing 1650m/s on just airbreathing RAPIERs, instead of the 1200-1400m/s I used to normally see. \u00A0Then the rocket equation reaps benefits - that extra speed on ascent means less rocket fuel needed to reach orbital speed and circularize. \u00A0It\u0027s a bigger assist than one might think, and directly leads to smaller fuel tanks, fewer parts, less mass, less drag, fewer engines, fewer intakes... it\u0027s good fun to downsize for better performance rather than spiral bigger!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile we\u0027re misusing fairings to hide things from drag - consider that a fairing only needs to surround the centerpoint of an item (ie where the three Offset tool handles converge) to occlude it. \u00A0This makes it very easy for a central \u0027spine\u0027 of fairing to occlude lots of parts (fuel tanks, fuselages, even cockpits) from drag... and thus also from heating. \u00A0Hax! Cheating! \u00A0Definitely but it makes it possible to build some very small pocket SSTOs, things that fit in cargo bays. \u00A0This craft has no drag or heating on the entire front half due to a hidden extension to the fairing seen at the nose:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/fourfa/Starling-Science-SSTO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/fourfa/Starling-Science-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis craft hides the whole nacelle assemblies in interlocking fairings, plus the orbital engine in a tail fairing, plus attitude control \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E in the nose service bay, and I was surprised how small and simple it ended up for the payload capacity and ease of flight:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/fourfa/Sundiver-SSTO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/fourfa/Sundiver-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe node-occupied heatshield trick could make a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/196617-kerbin-circumnavigation-challenge-updated-for-ksp-110/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ecircumnavigation-record\u003C/a\u003E craft a little easier, something I might work on soon\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope someone finds this interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-08T23:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224063218\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221638987263\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151713\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fourfa\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, fourfa said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing this, I routinely find that the wings (all of which have the same 2400K limit) are the limiting factor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBig-S parts transfer heat to other parts half as fast as structural wings. For my high-speed aero stuff, I use structural wing parts only, but you need them for fuel. The first thing I\u0027d try is attaching them to the rear size adapters, because adapters tend to be much better radiators than straight-sided parts (check the cfg files). This will increase the rate at which heat fluxes through them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a big fan of using node-occlusion exploits, so my standard Mk3 nose is 1 or 2 precoolers and a hemispherical nose cone.
