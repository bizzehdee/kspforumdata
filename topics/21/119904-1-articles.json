Without thrust limiters I\u0027ve gotten it up to 2,800 so yeah, maybe a little OP. Service ceiling around 23.5km, VNE is somewhere around Mach 3.7 (has a bad habit of coming apart explosively) and maneuverability is much better suited to boom and zoom passes as you\u0027d expect.

The swept wings part, again, would have looked great but due to them being an ancient part the CoL is at the forward wing attachment point instead of in the middle--therefore unusable. The wings on this look proportionally too short the way they\u0027re built. It glides very well. A little TOO well which is why I had to configure control surfaces as airbrakes. There\u0027s no real yaw control during landings so last minute sideslip is not recommended. Limiter set to 50-60 produces semi-realistic performance (13km service ceiling but the rate of climb is a HELL of a lot more than 22m/sec) but 100 makes it frankly a really fun plane. Turn and burn works better than expected with the wide swept area and it\u0027s agile enough--especially for an early jet fighter--to pull off some impressive direction changes in not a lot of space. Energy conservation is always a factor with the lower thrust but not as much as I was expecting. I can see why this design won the competition based on wind tunnel results. Rotation happens...eventually. At 50% thrust, there\u0027s not a lot of runway left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/4mUsf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

This was designed to be a throwaway fighter and trials had severe glue problems as well as endurance problems--30 minutes. They were still fast (~550 mph at sea level) and with better range than the ME-163 rocket fighter. Notably the B variant was the actual inspiration for the minature fighter program...but it lost the cool wingtip dihedrals. The E variant, never built, integrated a mixed power plant, a BMW turbojet with a BMW liquid-fuel rocket mounted just behind the exhaust for \u0027boost power\u0027. I built this as a RAPIER engine with a very limited oxidizer reserve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 162 was what got me started on this mad project. I built a normal one, read about the E, and made that my first EFP plane. You can tell because I bothered to put something in that looked vaguely cannon-like. Rotation happens around 60-70 m/s, where the ramjet should be building useful thrust (historically), then 1 activates the rocket mode to zoom-climb to operational height in no time flat. Or, if you\u0027ve got the time, saved for later use. It maneuvers disgustingly well. In all respects this is a GOOD plane and has decent endurance at cruise. It\u0027s Wile E Coyote at its best but all the zany dihedrals actually bloody work...I have so much more respect for German engineering in general after being able to recreate things like this without massaging excessively. If I work on it further I\u0027ll probably smooth the gear in a little, but quick design time limits and all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/TV4LD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

This was hell trying to get together, finding a way that would blend fuselage and cockpit and intake without getting way too wide with the couplers and etc. I tossed a bunch of five-minute designs before coming up with this. Turns out that a fuselage with about 150 units of fuel weighs the same as a cockpit and nosecone. With the thrust limiter at something reasonable (~50-60) this flies surprisingly well, great lower-speed handling. With the thrust limiter at 100% it\u0027ll pull mad Gs, yo, without disintegrating. Heinkel was onto something here. Also possibly on something. I\u0027m not terribly happy with the proportions but--see Emergency Fighter Program. A little fiddly with yaw but these things tend to be.

I couldn\u0027t find a fast and decent way of replicating the sheer badassery of this (c\u0027mon, it looks like something out of Crimson Skies) with the Mk 1 parts so I wound up using a Mk 2 setup. This resulted in a craft that is, yes, considerably bigger than the original, but looks oh-so-good. Given the whole limited supplies I think that a recovery mechanism for the rocket engine isn\u0027t entirely insane. This flies VERY well. It\u0027s fast. Good god is it fast, even with 50% limiters. Generally you\u0027re rotating at ~120m/s, climbing out at 45-60 degrees when popping the engine at 1km and already nearly exceeding Mach 1! The residual momentum alone that imparts to the engine and chute means you can loop around and fly underneath it a couple times before it splashes down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I nearly cheated on this by spending more time getting it better after the first few launches. Hidden (sort of) struts and hidden (sort of) fuel lines, and control surfaces to mask ugly rear edges. There\u0027s a lot of turn-and-burn baked into this but without a good G-suit (vintage 1946) I wouldn\u0027t want to try it in combat. Honestly this is just FUN no matter what you\u0027re doing with it.

I\u0027m not a fan of the Huckabein or the high-tail Volksjaeger (not the one above!) just because they\u0027re basically the same design and they look weird and not aesthetically pleasing to me. This variant caught my eye and almost ran me over the time limit. Problem is, turbojets in KSP with Ven\u0027s weigh ~1.8 tons and that is a HELL of a lot of mass to put behind a physical airframe center on a short plane! I had to clip many, many, many tanks together to try and compensate (check out those bands). Once done it flew better than I had ever expected for something I figured was going to stay a display model. This gets a little bendy during manuevers but holds together better than expected.

The typical drunken weave involved with trying to keep one of these in a more or less straight line to intercept probably would\u0027ve helped to avoid fire. With boosters and pulsejet on at once rotation is a little north of 80m/s. For some reason KSP won\u0027t let me equalize out the fuel in the boosters--I keep setting the one at 16.8 to 18.2 and it reverts every time afterward so the last couple ms of thrust may act to unbalance the craft a little. Has a realistic cruise endurance. Screenshots were hard to get, every time I\u0027d let go of flight controls and swing the camera it\u0027d try to plow into the ground.

Apart from a degree or so of sideslip wibbling this can do a very credible turn-and-burn approach, like everything with a wide wing sweep and comparatively thin chord. I may have gone slightly overboard with fueling, cruising at 6K or so takes a couple notches of power and gives the proper 4 hours of range. Down at sea level that increases to ~8 hours as measured by FAR\u0027s data calculations. With external tanks that number goes way, way, way up. I might see if this can be a circumnavigator someday.

This will hit altitude in the alloted time, and how, pitches down a LOT easier than up, and glides in a reputable fashion. I hated to use a part that wasn\u0027t stock, but the ablating engine from Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp proved perfect for this where the aerospike and T30 were both wrong. 1 engages and disengages the engines...after climbing to altitude and diving down on imaginary bombers, there is a little bit of fuel left to do whatever one wants with. For what it\u0027s worth this does well as a glider, as the real one did, and landings may be just as big a problem. I had to clip things all over to make this work and there\u0027s a real shortage of small surfaces so the tail was more work than it needed to be. As far as overall layout of boosters and control surfaces this is a little closer to the B variant for the 0.5 of you who care. Fun fact, if you don\u0027t cut off the engines for an apogee of 12km it\u0027ll hit 40. Landing is via parachutes...two for the engine, one for the pilot.

Not responsible for dead zones causing hilarious chaos, especially in the yaw axis!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gaS5u\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
