After some experimentation and toil I have finally made a spaceplane capable of reaching orbit and returning with a bit of fuel to spare. Named after test pilot Bill Kerman\u0027s relentless bravery, I present \u0027Dauntless\u0027:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bP2zmKn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bP2zmKn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XWLgL1v.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XWLgL1v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tdhIWOt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tdhIWOt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DQDUTDz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DQDUTDz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDauntless handles pretty well in low altitude, has plenty of RCS for docking maneuvers, a radially attached shield docking port on it\u0027s nadir/belly side for said docking, and a communications dish on it\u0027s tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s certainly not the most elegant craft, but I like it just the same. As soon as I can figure out a good way to post a craft file, I would love for some feedback on how it flies. I am just starting to get the hang of planes, so any design tips would be appreciated too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
