I built an Eeloo capable ship like the one from \u0022Europa Report\u0022, now all I need is a lander like from the movie.

Note it needs to have normal and correct RCS placement for docking and must have at least 4 engines and a docking port underneath. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen someone builds this lander, I will post pics of the mission!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-31T14:01:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2013 02:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by iDan122\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iDan122","CreatedById":24439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T14:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone?
