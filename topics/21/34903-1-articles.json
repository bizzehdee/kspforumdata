Hell once its done i dont even want to launch stuff from kerbin anymore for exploring random planets around universe... if my goddamn station explodes to bits after loading, i think im gonna burn my computer...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadvices, comments and hints are mostly welcome, im a friggin newbie still, i just know how to attach stuff together lol, if somehow i can, im gonna make a huge friggin epic Project out of this, so back to docking more parts..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
