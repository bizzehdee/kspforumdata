It is composed of all stock parts, aside from the \u0027advanced decoupler\u0027 which has no advantage over the regular decoupler, I just think it looks cooler 8) . This was my third iteration of the model (hence the III), and the first one which I was able to reach the moon with. However, I\\\u0027m terrible at landing (not an issue of fuel, just terrible piloting :\\\u0027() and have never actually been able to cleanly land on the Moon. I\\\u0027ve reached there 4 times with about 80% of my fuel to spare, crashed twice, and the best I\\\u0027ve managed was a grazing that actually took off one of the wingtips as I lost control of my craft and I had to abort at the last second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI called it \u0027Ares\u0027 to keep with the NASA mythological nomenclature, and had no idea that there actually was an Ares rocket which was planned, but ultimately cancelled.

My initial concern was that using this engine would dry out the center tanks first, leaving me out of luck on my approach to the Mun, but then I experimented for the first time with the fuel lines and was excited to see that by routing all the outer tanks to the center tank, I could make use of the 15 other cells without touching the middle engines. This stage is mostly useful for establishing an orbit and most of the \u0027Mun-shot\u0027 (on my run where I took the pictures, the engines dried up just before my orbit extended within range of the Mun). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 3:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis stage is basically the separation of the radially coupled engines when the outer fuel cells are depleted. This leaves the Ares with the center LV-T45 engine with 2 full fuel cells which is adequate for the Mun\\\u0027s approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 4:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this stage, the main lander craft separates from the engine and 2 depleted fuel cells (I ran out of fuel while decelerating to land on the Mun, but I had plenty of fuel in the Lander to \u0027touch-down\u0027 and return home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope everyone enjoys flying it, any tips would be appreciated with building/landing the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Added on the Ares IV, which takes into account some of the suggestions (RCS, extra thrust on liftoff)...

Yes you need RCS. I suggest one tank as part of the lander/Mun return stage and one in the Mun transfer orbital stage. That lower one gets used up in maneuvering so can be thrown away just before landing, and the upper tank will help you with landing, and with getting home. (I ran out of liquid fuel for the trip back because I messed up my Mun escape trajectory. One RCS tank would have saved their lives).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Launch and first stage was sluggish, and therefore not fuel efficient. You need to add some SRBs (at least 3) for launch, and perhaps another 3 later in the first stage, to keep going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to hit 100 m/s vertical speed ASAP, then at least 160 m/s by 5000m and 270 m/s by 10000m.
