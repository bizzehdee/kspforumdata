Unfortunately, the mainsail burned up due to mistiming of stages.

We then dock nose to top with the lander module. The launch vehicle and the payload decouple, and with some weird physics, glitch into a nearly uncontrollable spin.

The craft actually has a full compliment of science equipment, excluding the atmospheric sensors meant to be mounted as a nosecone.

Plenty of fuel left, and if I wanted to, I could make a trip to Minmus. Unfortunately, though, that was not part of our original mission plan. Went back to Kerbin, used the abort sequence to separate the command pod, and make the final descent home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t plan too well, and ended up landing on hard ground instead of soft water, but the only thing damaged was the deorbit/abort engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not at my home computer right now, so I can\u0027t share a .craft file, but I hoped you liked the mission report!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
