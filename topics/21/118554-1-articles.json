Stock craft of 100 parts (after dropping launch stages provided).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4000kN of two Rhino engines on an extended arm allow it to haul the largest asteroids with over 1m/s of acceleration without burning the asteroid and without causing instabilities of pusher crafts. Five ISRU units and an array of gigantors provide rapid production of fuel right off the asteroid pulled, with about 200m/s of delta-V applied to the asteroid per burn-refuel cycle every game hour (and less than five minutes real time). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt arrives into orbit with over 3000m/s of delta-V, ready to tackle any incoming asteroids. Fully fueled, it carries 4500m/s of delta-V to tackle the next target (or almost 5000 with ore tanks full). Swivels of the engines allow rotation of the asteroid without need to undock and redock in case of direction change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/sharpy/Claymore-Asteroid-Wrangler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EKerbalX page\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/sharpy/Claymore-Asteroid-Wrangler.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDownload link\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the KerbalX page for operating instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/kerbalx/2015-08-08_00005.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015-08-08_00005.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T21:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt does look very much like a Claymore:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Scottish_claymore_replica_(Albion_Chieftain)2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Scottish_claymore_replica_(Albion_Chieftain)2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow the hell does it even reach orbit?

(there\u0027s also a cluster of SRBs to give the initial kick since the TWR with the mammoths is quite poor, and two extra boosters based on turbojets, simply exploiting the fact everything else is capped with shock cones.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ascent path is steep; a late, shallow gravity turn. It really seems like it can\u0027t fly in the atmosphere 20 degrees above the horizon. It\u0027s either 40 or -30. Start the gravity turn at 40m/s instead of 50 and you\u0027re ending up burning downwards. Anyway, the four booster stages (SRBs, first Mammoth pair, turbojets, second Mammoth pair) are just enough to set the apoapsis to some 80km at about 1200m/s of horizontal speed. The remainder is for the Rhinos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure it would be much, much easier if I brought only enough fuel to make it to the orbit, and then refuel there. Except this is a chicken-and-egg problem: this is a craft for people who don\u0027t have an orbital refueling station, and its purpose is to let them build one! So, for that purpose, it arrives into orbit with quite enough fuel to bootstrap the operation by intercepting the first asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T12:14:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool an all, but just the opposite way of how I\u0027m going about it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NtNw6uk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NtNw6uk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts can fit into a SSTO bay, and it can run the single nuke constantly a 2/3rds thrust while producing a bit excess ore.

Then again, the nuke implies I am already more than twice as mass-efficient as your design just on account of isp (never mind empty weight!), so I could just chuck it as inefficiencies. Regarding the engineer, tough... I was seeing 1ore/s on the drills without one, and assumed the engineer multiplier only applied when mining on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming a 1000mT E-class, I\u0027m looking at 40kN/1000mT=0.04m/s^2. Meaning a 100m/s orbit correction/circularization after aerobraking is on the order of 2500s, or 41 minutes and some change. At x4 timewarp, that\u0027s ten minutes of gameplay, and I can be web browsing at that. Obviously, solar orbit rendezvous and a rather firm aerobrake is required if you don\u0027t want to grow old doing a brute-force capture on your way out of the kerbin system. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
