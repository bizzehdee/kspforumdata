Originally Commisioned by Wu Industries from Rock Superstar David Kerbmore of Kink Floyd for his legendary Moon Tour. Due to lack of ticket sales, the tour was cancelled and the RZA XVII is up for sale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1346/rzaxvii1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rzaxvii1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/6348/rzaxvii2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rzaxvii2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9149/rzaxvii3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rzaxvii3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome notes on flying the RZA XVII:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat exactly T\u002B3:30, the secondary escape rockets burn out. throttle must be brought to zero before this happens, and decoupling must be done with the engines off. see video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealternatively, the craft can be converted to ride out the burn by jettisoning just enough to rebalance with the rockets. This can be done in the vehicle assembly building by taking the 2nd and 5th radial decouplers from stage 14, and creating a new 15th stage and putting them in it. I chose not to do this for reasons of efficiency, but it looks cool and you still get plenty of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you havent altered it, the second stage with the 4x tri couplers will burn fine for a while, but might pull down towards the end of the fuel cycle. hitting the stage release button at this time releases the rear bottom tanks and will rebalance the ship. Do this while at zero thrust or you might lose an engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, since the Lander stage uses only vertical symmetry, i found it was extremely difficult to design one that could stay balanced throughout the fuel cycle. As a result, you have to go very easy on the thrust at the beginning and end of the fuel cycle as the fuel inside sloshes around and changes the weight distribution. This was designed so that by the middle of the cycle, it was assumed you were in the act of landing on the moon and would need precision and lots of thrust the most. To keep the most control, have SAS on at all times, and RCS when you need it. If you\\\u0027re making non time-critical manoeuvers, its better to use less thrust with just SAS on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s it, I hope you like this ship. I just watched the movie REDLINE and was definitely going for a \u0027giant racecar\u0027 kind of look, and also seeing if i could really push the limits on using only vertical symmetry. If you can think of any improvements on the design I\\\u0027m all ears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT] I just updated to .14 and the RZA XVII was having problems on the launchpad. I tweaked it and reattached the .14 compatible file for it, labeled RZA XVIIb.craft\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"trbinsc","CreatedById":10144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-04T23:43:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, that\\\u0027s one heck of a second post!
