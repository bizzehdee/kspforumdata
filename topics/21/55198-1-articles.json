I originally tried copying(they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery) what was already made, with moderate success. Enter Persephone Mk 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://thatcraniumguy.net/screenshots/galleries/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot52.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot52.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was sufficient, but only barely made orbit and landed back at KSC. Nice, but not enough to rival anything already out there. So I needed to redesign a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk 2 was not much of a difference, just some repositioned intakes, and a different landing gear position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://thatcraniumguy.net/screenshots/galleries/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot58.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot58.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, it didn\u0027t make it any further than the original. So I think it\u0027s back to the drawing board for this one. Mk 3 is a complete redesign with more rocket fuel, a proper cockpit, and lighter landing gear(slightly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://thatcraniumguy.net/screenshots/galleries/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot84.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot84.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://thatcraniumguy.net/screenshots/galleries/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot87.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot87.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://thatcraniumguy.net/screenshots/galleries/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot86.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot86.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it looks kind of like an insect, so I\u0027m debating on a name change to be more appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did try a winged version, but it simply does NOT work at all after transitioning to horizontal movement. It may not have enough lift, and I probably need to add more wing to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://thatcraniumguy.net/screenshots/galleries/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot85.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot85.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I have yet to be able to test the Mk 3 properly, and attempt an extraplanetary mission. It does have a number of problems with it before I can test it completely, chief among being the issue I have with the amount of part clipping(no debug menu, just a lot of smart placement), it tends to perform a rapid, unplanned disassembly if the engine even touches the ground slightly. I don\u0027t think there would be any way for me to fix that without completely redesigning it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you think, and tell me what I can improve upon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownloads:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://thatcraniumguy.net/files/game%20files/KSP/SPH/Persephone%201.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPersephone Mk 1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://thatcraniumguy.net/files/game%20files/KSP/SPH/Persephone%202.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPersephone Mk 2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://thatcraniumguy.net/files/game%20files/KSP/SPH/Persephone%203.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPersephone Mk 3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://thatcraniumguy.net/files/game%20files/KSP/SPH/Persephone%203%20Aero.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPersephone Mk 3 Aero\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: All crafts have MechJeb installed.
