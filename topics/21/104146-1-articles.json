Then, throttle up to max and stage once to engage the rocket\u0027s 1st stage. Once you\u0027ve burnt out the 1st stage, stage again and use the trunk module for any further burns. Once the trunk is empty, stage once more to eject it and activate the landing/maneuvering engines on the NCV itself. (These can be switched on/off with action group 1.) To land, deorbit using a trunk module or the NCV\u0027s engines, and then use the parachutes and engines to slow descent. Deploy the gear once within 100 meters of the ground.\n\n**Downloads:**\n\n*Icarus NCV*: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/quuf0e039wa11n9/MU%20Icarus%20NCV.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/quuf0e039wa11n9/MU%20Icarus%20NCV.craft?dl=0)\n\n*Icarus NCV* with *Artemis* Booster Rocket: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/v7r2glgvjvur3yt/MU%20Icarus%20NCV%20w%20Artemis%20Booster.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v7r2glgvjvur3yt/MU%20Icarus%20NCV%20w%20Artemis%20Booster.craft?dl=0)\n\n*Artemis* Booster Rocket (subassembly): [https://www.dropbox.com/s/wia94yxpfh2zsiu/%28Gen.%201%29%20Artemis-Class%201st%20stage.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wia94yxpfh2zsiu/%28Gen.%201%29%20Artemis-Class%201st%20stage.craft?dl=0)\n\n*Warranty void if used as a boat or Eve/Tylo descent craft.*"},{"CreatedByName":"Zucal","CreatedById":139764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T00:20:21Z","Content":"Very nice!
