I always liked the design proposals for various Saturn variants, so I thought I\u0027d go ahead and approximate and expand upon what I\u0027ve seen. This will be a work in progress thread that I\u0027ll post in as I go along. Most of what I\u0027m working with are KWRockets parts in combination with FASA parts and some Bobcat parts, as well as a few other parts packs here and there. I\u0027ve got plans in the works to produce my own Saturn and SLS inspired parts packs at some point in the future, but for now these will hold me over and serve as my proof of concept stuff before I get to the real meat of modeling from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst up is the Jool C-3. I have no specs on this thing yet as I\u0027m working my way along the entire vehicle, but the original proposal specified that the C-3 would have been used to loft the CSM and the Lander in two separate launches for a Earth Orbit Rendezvous mission profile. I\u0027m going to be shooting for about the same performance. The original design called for two F-1s on the first stage, four J-2s on the the second stage, six RL10s on the third. For the most part I\u0027ll be sticking to similar engines in that regard, but I\u0027ll be taking some liberties in future variations. One in particular I have in mind will have an S-IV-B inspired third stage subbed in for the S-IV inspired stage for a simpler launch vehicle and probably a bit more payload. I\u0027ve also got some solid-booster assisted designs similar to the Saturn INT concepts in mind, which could be useful for launching satellites or individual mission modules for Duna missions etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJool C-3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/s/satc3.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022satc3.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFirst Stage Variants\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ES-1A-2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is based heavily on the graphic above found on astronautix.com, with some liberties.
