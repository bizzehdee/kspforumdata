His names ImpossibleAviation on KerbalX and he made \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/ImpossibleAviation/Flying-Saucer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis ridiculous flying saucer\u003C/a\u003E. This thing is awesome, great IVA environment. My problem is, I can\u0027t figure out how to get out of the thing. It uses all external seats with no command module and I can\u0027t find a hatch or way out. Hoping to find ImpossibleAviation for an answer here but if anyone wants to d/l the craft and play around to figure it out that\u0027d be awesome also; the craft is awesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
