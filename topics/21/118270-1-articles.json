My first orbital space shuttle, and the one I did the most orbital flights with (4). It did launch just like a shuttle, but it turned out to be a terrible glider. I had to land it either using parachutes or using RCS as assistance. The program was put on hiatus and eventually cancelled after it failed to lift a cargo into orbit.\n\n![E8D3D2B3D8CBDCA70DE60D33BA88F1BF6ED2A8AC](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/577875424649259163/E8D3D2B3D8CBDCA70DE60D33BA88F1BF6ED2A8AC/)\n\nOne of the launch pictures. I think its first successful orbital launch was on September 15, 2013. The shuttles were named Keburan and Ktechka not because they were attempting to emulate the Russian program but because they were competitors to Jon144\u0027s line of shuttles at the time (I think Katlantis was the most recent then).\n\n![6005160B7E78A9C76E5F2BF6D82A7EBCBED704B5](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/577875424649290216/6005160B7E78A9C76E5F2BF6D82A7EBCBED704B5/)\n\nWhat is significant about the shuttle is that it flew before the massive shuttle boom took place a month or two later. I can legitimately claim to have had a working space shuttle before many of the greats on this forum.\n\nSecond Vehicle:\n\n![AF9DF85A24F7C05895FCA6EBFF832F6505A50771](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/452906605981360583/AF9DF85A24F7C05895FCA6EBFF832F6505A50771/)\n\nThe Bushmaster class corvettes were my first warships I ever launched into orbit, and the only class which ever received more than 1 warship. They were armed with 6 1.25 SRb missiles and another large group of lighter seperatron missiles. They were designed to work in conjunction with a fleet that was never built for battling in the naval battle club. More advanced construction techniques rendered these ships obsolete pretty quickly.\n\nThird Vehicle:\n\n![TOnD7hQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TOnD7hQ.jpg)\n\nNAFA-4-A1 Cobra, built in May 2014. I still consider this old enough to go in the thread, seeing as some people are posting stuff from just a couple versions before the official release of the game. This was my first true fighter (The NAFA-1, 2, and 3 were all terrible aircraft, and only recieved their \u0022NAFA\u0022 designations after the NAFA-4 had been developed). NAFA-4-As were the mainstay of my air force throughout most of my summer, before being replaced by the NAFA-7 and then broken by the .25 update... for a little while. The updated NAFA-4s are still in service (Though looking very weak after the 1.0.3 patch), and new versions are still expected to be developed\n\n\u003E ![85D3F6C3DA644A7F56FB1C7C15C28523D4B686CE](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/26236580338585182/85D3F6C3DA644A7F56FB1C7C15C28523D4B686CE/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T17:33:36Z","Content":"This SSTO I made.
