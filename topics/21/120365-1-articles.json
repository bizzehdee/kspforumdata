Thanks for reminding me though! The engine is supposed to be the exhaust and generator. Fuel cells have no exhaust, unlike real life locomotives. The engine also makes driving more of a realistic task. Engineers of this deal with higher throttle (For engines!) on hills, engine start ups, stalls, etc. Oh and overheats too.
