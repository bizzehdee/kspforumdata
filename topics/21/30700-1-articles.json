I run out of fuel way before reaching orbit and the rocket was pretty wobbly\u0022. 90% of the time I don\u0027t need to ask for a screenshot or more information, I simply tell them \u0022check the fuel lines and struts against the proofing payload copy, you\u0027ll missing some due to Subassembly Saver/Loader\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve played with Subassembly Saver/Load you will know what I\u0027m talking about. One of the big bugs holding this amazing tool back is its inability accurately render struts and fuel lines. You take off the booster section of a Zenith rocket, save it as a subassembly and then load it up under an payload and chances are you\u0027ll get this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i49.tinypic.com/3aeu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223aeu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee that, the fuel lines are all messed up. To get the rocket to work properly they will have to be recreated. And while that\u0027s fairly easy for me since I know the ins and outs of my rockets like the back of my hand I can imagine this is a mighty annoying task for someone who\u0027s using a Zenith for the first time. So for the modernisation I decided to tackle this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard that this issue was due to the order the parts are rendered in - if the destination of the strut/fuel lines are not yet rendered by the game\u0027s engine due to the order they appear in in the subassembly file then the part goes missing. So the first thing I tried was opening up those .craft files in the subassembly folder and try to manually edit the file and put all the struts and fuel lines at the bottom. Save and load up the subassembly - no dice, still missing fuel lines. But from scrolling through that craft file I can see what the problem is. See when you save a subassembly you create a .craft file, only it doesn\u0027t resemble the original .craft file generated by KSP at all - it\u0027s all in some messed up order. No wonder when you then load up that subassembly some stuff goes missing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut while I have the .craft file open, I noticed something:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/jr5ic5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jr5ic5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmmmm, looks like this thing has the decoupler as the root part, that looks kind of like a KSP 0.20 .craft file now that we can have almost any part as a root part.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the apple falls from the tree, the bathtub overflows and I had a moment of epiphany:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA subassembly .craft file is not just like a KSP 0.20 craft file, a subassembly .craft file \u003Cstrong\u003EIS\u003C/strong\u003E a KSP 0.20 craft file\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if a subassembly is a 0.20 craft file, except with all the parts in messed up order, wouldn\u0027t that mean a KSP 0.20 craft file, generated by KSP and able to be correctly loaded by KSP is actually a subassembly with the parts in the correct order?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the Vehicle Assembly building!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://105.imagebam.com/download/bFuUSm7S2GOZ66sWW3xZJw/25765/257647458/screenshot184.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot184.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we start off with Zenith VII\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://102.imagebam.com/download/8c8zzefP6etecJW9A1O_dQ/25765/257647494/screenshot188.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot188.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe remove the proofing payload and use the new \u0022delete root part\u0022 trick to make a new decoupler root part and fit it to the rocket and save the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/350nn8k.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022350nn8k.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECopy the .craft file from save folder into the subassembly folder under lifters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://103.imagebam.com/download/g5E3i2-3mFDfrGJeY5P9zQ/25765/257647470/screenshot186.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot186.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart a new craft and upload up Zenith VII that we\u0027ve just saved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://105.imagebam.com/download/U1vorIKWPo2jjONoREVSyw/25765/257647481/screenshot187.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot187.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHallelujah!
