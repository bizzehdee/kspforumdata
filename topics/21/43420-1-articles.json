I can do that. What is the weight we are talking about here? Are we trying to lift a station core or a fuel tanker? In my case, that\u0027s \u0026gt;20 tons vs ~40 tons so it matters, a lot! Weight on an SSTO is at a premium. You specifically mentioned station parts, are we talking hab module or fuel tanker? There is a massive weight range in there and I need to know what we are lifting to actually guarantee results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T07:55:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say look at my threads. From 2.5mT to 25mT I\u0027ve got SSTO\u0027s for all tastes. Some even come with their own space station modules already designed. But in my skunkworks thread there is a B9 shuttle with cargo bay that I think you will like the most.
