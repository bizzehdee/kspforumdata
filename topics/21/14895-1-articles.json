The WRI launchpad isn\\\u0027t exactly the biggest, and our old shuttle designs tended to tip over before we even got the liftoff sequence finished, so our boys in the lab had to throw some pasta against the wall and see what stuck. They came up with this ingenious solution. The mirrored rockets and bracing struts allow for a vertical takeoff, and the booster system provides enough power to get the shuttle up into orbit without using any of its own fuel. The shuttle has plenty of fuel for all kinds of voyages. ((Originally was trying to do this stock, but the rockets were too big for the pad - going to try again with a different configuration.

The stage before that is meant for the initial deceleration/munar orbital correction. The RCS and prograde engines are not entirely balanced on the craft, and are best for the last few seconds before touchdown as they may cause unwanted rotation.

With this little venture they moved the cockpit to the rear of the craft and threw a few high-atmosphere engines under the main fuselage. It flies just as good as the other aircraft in the XJ-M series, but with the added benefit of being able to switch between high and low altitude. It can fly with just the single, center-mounted low-altitude engine at its rear, but it has a tendency to dip and is better suited for flight around 11km.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAs with all of the aircraft in the XJ-M series, WRI is doing some toying around with the possibility of turning this into an orbiter or trans-Munar craft.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xVrkA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xVrkA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vdRI7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vdRI7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6kpNZ.png\u0022 alt=\u00226kpNZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E**New** Light Aircraft\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E**New** Nubu Fighter - **New** The Strongarm - K-51 - The Palmer 13\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E**New** Nubu Fighter\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Yeah, we weren\\\u0027t inspired by anything at all for this.

Only give it about 30% throttle on the runway the first time if you decide to give it a try (if you haven\\\u0027t rebuilt it by now, anyway) and as soon as you notice it start to liftoff, tilt the nose back down or else you\\\u0027ll quickly transfer into VTOL mode and it can be a bit difficult to recover from, but it\\\u0027s possible to recover from pretty much any type of situation with the craft once you get the hang of how it handles. Try flying it upside down or on its side!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the design, I\\\u0027m probably going to be gearing for less-than-conventional/more Kerbalesque designs from here on out as I feel as though I\\\u0027ve expended my options when it comes to \u0027normal\u0027 craft on both the rocket and plane front. Toying with some lander designs based around the same concept as the Flightboy and am going to be reworking the launch vehicles for my orbiters in preparation for the Munolith race. Might give electrical energy/Z02 a try and go for an infinitely sustainable lander craft/munolith search vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh, and I\\\u0027m also putting together a Munar landing rocket that operates solely on SRB\\\u0027s except for the landing phase, but incorporating the landing phase into the SRB design might be a challenge I\\\u0027ll tackle in the future. The miniboosters from Novapunch are amazing for this type of construction and help with small changes, along with the narrow radial decouplers that come with the pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wildkittyv1","CreatedById":30893,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-30T00:45:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate for tonight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded the Narcissus I launch vehicle and shuttle. It\\\u0027s built using mods, but I\\\u0027m working on a stock version, just having difficulty since I need more rockets, and that means wider designs because of how weak the stock parts are on a size scale. With pad real estate already an issue with many designs, I\\\u0027m going to have to get creative to make this design work with stock parts. The dual-engine on the shuttle isn\\\u0027t necessary and only on this version for aesthetic purposes since I was using mods anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso added the MD (Marathon Distinction) Hammerhead heavy aircraft. I wanted to build a Hammerhead design, and am working on another variation of it. I was happy with it, but wanted it to last longer in the air so I added the decouplable tanks. I haven\\\u0027t tested how far it can fly, but I want to say that it\\\u0027s at least capable of going halfway around Kerbin before running out of fuel if you\\\u0027re smart with efficiency and throttle control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, added two new light aircraft, the Nubu Fighter and the Strongarm. The Nubu is obviously inspired after the Naboo fighters from Episode I of Star Wars, and the Strongarm is just a little craft I threw together since making tiny little planes is fun, they\\\u0027re fun to fly, and easy to fix any problems with. It has no landing gear if you detach them, but it\\\u0027s possible to do a controlled crash landing and survive with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few more designs to work on in the next couple of days, including a few more different launcher ideas for rockets and some more lander designs I want to try out. The hardest part with the lander designs is getting them into the air, as the connections tend to be relatively weak in them and they don\\\u0027t fit in fairings always. Working on different rocket designs to specifically fit the different landers. Also working on some plane designs that are more \u0027Kerbal-esque\u0027 like my Flightboy Nine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wildkittyv1","CreatedById":30893,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-30T15:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuick updated this afternoon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded the Uwizz-R, a long-distance capable VTOL made using stock parts and Damned Robotics/Aerospace.

The most fun one will probably be the redo of the Etola V R-R rendezvous mission with my low orbit space station since I will have EVAs for it. The KLOSS will actually be more of a low-orbit deal, have less \u0027dead\u0027 weight, and have that replaced with the mapsat/muon detector tools so I can get the map of Kerbin and try to find the second KSC. A few of my \u0027Marathon Distinction\u0027 class planes will do well on these missions, as the Hammerhead, when outfitted with the high-atmosphere engines, made a trip halfway around Kerbin. With some additional fuel tanks and the map sat, I should have no problem finding it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if I should do the pseudo-RP here or in general discussion, so let me know.
