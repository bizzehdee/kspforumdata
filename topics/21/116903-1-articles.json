There\u0027s also a spatula next to the pan, and some hand grips so you don\u0027t burn yourself when you decide to be an idiot and move the pan.\n\n![KjaZqyi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KjaZqyi.jpg)\n\nI should probably be doing something more productive with my Sunday afternoon, but instead I\u0027m here, building freakin\u0027 cookies in KSP.![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Someone help me, I\u0027m a danger to myself...\n\nI\u0027m not going to post a DL unless someone asks for it, because I can find no reason for anyone to want to download this other than to spite me for not thinking anyone would download this.\n\nEDIT: Someone asked for a download: [http://kerbalx.com/pTrevTrevs/Kerbal-Cookie-Program](http://kerbalx.com/pTrevTrevs/Kerbal-Cookie-Program)\n\nWatch this thread get like a hundred pages worth of replies.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T00:55:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pTrevTrevs**"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T19:15:00Z","Content":"Lol, anyway good work xD"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T19:27:52Z","Content":"Stupid!\n\n\u002Brep!"},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T19:28:35Z","Content":"This is amazing.
