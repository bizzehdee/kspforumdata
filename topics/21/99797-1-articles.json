I\u0027ve made a few things myself, but have mostly stuck to modifications of existing craft, and so was curious to see what you all may have come up with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a rocket that I call the Jupiter V Medium. It has the same dimensions as the saturn V, but the second stage engine is more powerful (I\u0027m using the Energia lower stage engine for the second stage), the first stage has more fuel, and I attached two space shuttle SRBs to the sides. If flown right, it could lift around 200T to LEO. Attached to it is a 45T lander with 9 km/s of delta-v I am going to try to use to land and take off from Mars. Like with the Saturn V, when not just carrying a payload to orbit, the third stage can be used as a transfer stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/6GXw3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
