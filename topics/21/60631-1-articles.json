I thought maybe something with this much capability could make it into orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second test showed that indeed, this rocket can. So I have apparently stumbled into an SSTO rocket design that can get into a 72 x 80 km orbit, and even have a bit of fuel (~ 1 %) leftover to deorbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dv8QGD7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dv8QGD7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk 1 (small, one Kerbal) pod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall parachute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall decoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall (not smallest) Rockomax, full-width fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall Rockomax engines, 0.1 mass and 30 thrust each, x5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 octagonal cubes (tiny), arranged with fourfold symmetry on the bottom of the fuel tank.

KER says it has about 4850m/s and it gets to a 72km orbit with about 350m/s left so that sounds about right. On re-entry, you keep a little fuel (about 50m/s worth to be safe) and disable 3 of the engines to reduce the TWR to manageable levels. Then pop the chute at about 1000m altitude and then wait. Once the chute fully opens it will slow to approx. 11.5m/s and you can use a little burst of throttle just before touchdown to get it low enough to not go bang...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 350m/s was enough to set up a rendezvous with my station at 200km but it didn\u0027t then have enough left to deorbit and brake-burn and had no way of docking so I\u0027m redesigning it for less weight, a docking port, remote control and radial chutes so it can be used as a station taxi.
