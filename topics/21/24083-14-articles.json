Could not for the life of me figure out how to decouple the LEM from the S-IVb. It was just stuck in there. That and the fairing would not eject. Twice. Argh.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOoohhh I see what happened to you (I think!). Totally my fault. See, the staging is slightly wrong because I like to do things manually, and I did them by the book. The problem is the S-IVb has no probe core! Let me explain. In the original mission, the CM would stage the LM and S-IVb, blowing only half the fairing, turn around, and dock with them as a unit, then extract the LM from the spent stage. So in my replica the order that works is undock the CM manually, dock it to the lander, drop the fairings, and then release it from the S-IVb. If you stage the LM without dropping the fairing, the S-IVb losses control and you end up with a stuck lander. You can still get it out with timewarp, though, but the most foolproof solution is to tweak staging slightly so the decoupler to the LM and the fairings go at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

You need a bit more vacuum dV and TWR than before, but with RAPIERs, pack ~1km/s of vacuum dV and you are set. Airbreathing TWR is the really permissive thing now. You can go as low as 0.5 on the runway, if you have enough wing! Though 0.7-1.0 is more reasonable and climbs faster. Oh, and the wing comment is crucial: being a good glider means you maintain a lower AoA for a given trajectory, which minimizes drag, and that is the killer now. You also need a buttload more of fuel (up to twice what would make the perfect rocket LF/Oxi ratio, if you climb very slow), but that is easy and cheap to pack. No, the real trick with SSTOs now is how to break Mach and go hypersonic to over 1,200-1,400m/s, so I leave you with myself, answering that very same question (flight profiles), for an extreme case of low TWR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you use some information-providing mod? If not, it\u0027ll be harder to control vertical speed with the crappy stock indicator (it\u0027s on the top, to the right of the altimeter). Basically, you climb at 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA until 10kms (make sure to use the runway to get the RAPIERs some initial bite in the air, or spend some time at 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA to build speed up to 200m/s, you\u0027ll climb faster). Then you go supersonic either manually dropping the nose slowly, or by putting the autopilot on prograde and back to standard stability assist a few times to drop the nose \u003Cem\u003Egradually\u003C/em\u003E, to zero out your vertical velocity. It\u0027s tricky to go over the Mach barrier, so I usually help myself by lighting the nuke briefly until I go over 340m/s. I achieve it at about 5-10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA AoA over the horizon, as you can see in the pics. From then on it\u0027s much easier, you start building speed quickly and the wings bite more air, so watch your vertical velocity like a hawk and every time it goes above 50m/s or so, you drop the nose a bit (again, on and off the prograde autopilot is a handy trick). Give yourself time to accelerate. At about 15kms, drop all vertical speed (climb rate about zero), and lock stability assist in that heading: you will speed up \u003Cem\u003Emucho mucho mucho\u003C/em\u003E, and as the planet curves below you, your AoA will slowly creep up, building vertical speed for the climb to orbit. When you notice your speed stops increasing as fast, light the nuke again, and when the RAPIERs go under 50kN thrust you can switch them to closed cycle. When they give out, you should have a very respectable apoapsis, so change the autopilot back to prograde to save drag, push it out of the atmosphere, coast, and finish the orbital insertion on the nuke.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
