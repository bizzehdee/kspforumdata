It can also be difficult to land until you are used to the high glide ratio.\n\n![8FD7Q.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8FD7Q.jpg)\n\n![vqGYi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vqGYi.jpg)\n\n![YXRLu.png](http://i.imgur.com/YXRLu.png)\n\n[Additional images](http://imgur.com/a/8Y1zm).\n\nPerformance specs:\n\n- [li]Liftoff speed, full fuel load: 100 m/s at 3 degree nose up.[/li]  \n[li]Full throttle cruise: 590 m/s at 16 km altitude (3 tanks empty)[/li]  \n[li]40% throttle cruise: 380 m/s at 15.5 km altitude (6 tanks empty)[/li]  \n[li]Max altitude sustained flight: 18.2 km, 20 degree nose up, full throttle. 460-480 m/s airspeed.
