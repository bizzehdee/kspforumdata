I\u0027ve noticed that your robots don\u0027t get much traction while running fast, or moving any speed, for that matter.

But one thing I did notice, is that there are no toes. Yes, toes....I know it sounds silly to put such a small thing as toes on a robot, but they mean a lot when you\u0027re dealing with robots with a large stride.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll see that as you stride forward, the leg you are putting the most weight on will flex your toes down, allowing you to have a longer platform for your weight to contact the ground with. This is especially important when you\u0027re running, and even more important when you\u0027ve got a leg structure like a raptor. Most of their weight is on the balls of their feet, and if you look at your model, once the flat part of the feet roll to the \u0022toe\u0022 section of the feet, the landing legs no longer are touching, and you slip for the rest of the stride.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d suggest moving your forward pointing landing legs past the edge of the strut you have there, so that when the weight shifts to the front of the foot, you still have traction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m1sz","CreatedById":93466,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T13:14:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes, toes are one of the things I want to include!, design is far from over yet =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your time helping me!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xxjetterxx","CreatedById":37766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T17:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, something else you can try, you may want to add some pistons between the feet and the legs; it helps keep the feet of the ground so you don\u0027t trip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space_Kraken","CreatedById":102655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T18:01:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027comic sans ms\u0027;\u0022\u003ELooks sweet, can\u0027t wait for the video!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
