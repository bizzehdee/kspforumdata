I know this thing isn\u0027t optimized, but it WORKS, dammit. Feel free to post any revised versions you come up with. Play with it - anything you do with the damned thing will make it safer by statistical probability!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis requires the latest version of MechJeb, which is packaged with the .rar file. Install it if you don\u0027t have it already. You will need it. Godspeed. Also included is a flight manual written by yours truly for procedures that work to get this quirky beast into LEO. I would suggest RTFM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: New version. QRF and ship updated slightly. Better stability, landing legs on the nuclear stage are in the proper position. I have also confirmed that it is capable - just barely - of hopscotch, landing on the mun, minmus, and then going home.
