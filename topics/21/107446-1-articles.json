It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve played and I\u0027m wondering with these new updates if this kind of craft is viable? I\u0027m limited right now with what I can access because I\u0027m in career mode. \n\n![5Bw0dwM.png](http://i.imgur.com/5Bw0dwM.png)\n\nThanks for any feedback! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nEdit: It\u0027d probably help to explain it a little x) Basically you strap a smaller vehicle on top of a plane then punch out to a high altitude and release the rocket on top. In theory it\u0027s a cost effective way to get payloads to orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T15:46:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 03:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chozo Nomad**"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:55:16Z","Content":"It\u0027s a little easier since the physics range was increased to around 20km in atmosphere. But you\u0027ll want to wait for at least turbojets because basic jets won\u0027t get you up high enough to orbit the little rocket without the plane de-spawning. \n\nIf you\u0027re using [Flight Manager for Reusable Stages](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292-0-90-0-Flight-Manager-for-Reusable-Stages-%28FMRS-v0-3-02%29) then it\u0027s a different story, but that mod hasn\u0027t been updated for 1.0 yet."}]}
