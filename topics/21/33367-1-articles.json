I don\u0027t think it has the dV for multiple stops, but I\u0027m hoping it can make a trip to one Jool\u0027s moons and back. The design is also multipurpose it could also be used for transporting many pieces of a Munar base to the Mun in one trip.

This is actually my fourth attempt at this ship, in the first design I accidentally had some docking port on upside down, then after correcting that I discovered you can only dock together by a single docking port, I was trying to dock together at three ports along the radial tanks and didn\u0027t discover this until I got the last section with the engines on and found they weren\u0027t getting fuel. The next design was the same as this but was just too wobbly so, in the final design you see here I added strut guns and quantum struts. She\u0027s I finally together and I just got here fueled up. All I need now it attach some landers and head out to the stars. The first mission will be to rescue a stranded Kerbanuat I\u0027ve got stuck on Laythe, the refuel and attempt another rescue mission to Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think? Comments?

It seemed pretty sturdy too, I even had to select undock on all three docking ports to separate it. Put when I got my last section up with the engines (the engine section was completely empty of fuel when it got to orbit) and docked it to the rest of the ship, I only had fuel for on set of engines, the other two were still empty. The one set of engine that did get fuel was on the side where the docking port was actually connected, and it only got fuel from the section immediately above it because that section was docked with only one docking port on the other side of the ship. I think what was happening was that one docking port was connecting and cross feeding fuel, but the other two which seemed like they were docked were only held together by the magnetic force of the docking ports and weren\u0027t actually connected and therefore couldn\u0027t cross feed.

I reloaded and this time set the Smart A.S.S. to prograde and put the engines at full throttle. 7 minutes later and I was still in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and only about a quarter of the way to were the Mun orbits. At this point I was getting too far away from my burn point so I shut off the engines and I\u0027m going to wait for it to loop around it\u0027s orbit again and do another burn. This is going to be a ship that takes some patience to fly. Still after 7 min of full throttle burning, my fuel gauge has hardly moved. I\u0027m packing it in for tonight, gunna pick this up where I left off tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-18T07:44:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2013 07:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by OUScooby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OUScooby","CreatedById":66208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T17:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBack at it this morning. It only took a few min to complete the burn out of Kerbin SOI. Now I\u0027ve set a Hohmann transfer to Jool, a 22min burn, yikes!

I\u0027ve lost two of my engines. Not sure how it happened, it think the craft started spinning when it was done with its burn and the SAS wasn\u0027t turned on then the engines got flung off. Things weren\u0027t looking so good for the mission anyway, after completing the burn to Jool, I was left with only about 1/3 of my fuel. Probably enough to get into a Jool orbit and then transfer to Laythe, but I very much doubt there would be enough to fly home after that. Good thing there is quick save, or 12 souls would be left floating out in deep space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/ouscooby/ksp/screenshot59_zps8e6844ba.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot59_zps8e6844ba.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure how effective this craft is going to be for long distance journey\u0027s. I think it could probably get to Duna and back, maybe Dres, but for now I\u0027m thinking of replacing the nuclear engines with 3 Mainsails and using the ship as a large Munar cargo transporter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
