I\u0027ve seen all them fancy space stations, interplanetary ships, and everything else related to the words \u0022Whoa that\u0027s a big craft!\u0022, but not much about landers. In my opinion these things have their own touch of beauty to the whole space program you\u0027re working on, especially if you have a reliable and/or stylish design. And another thing about landers, especially the ones designed for atmospheric entry and return capability to their command ships/modules, have to be meticulously designed to be able to do what they\u0027re supposed to. So if there are any pros here that have made their own masterpieces, don\u0027t hesitate to show them here, or better yet, give some building tips in making landers. I\u0027ve been playing KSP for about a month now, and even though I\u0027ve sent a ship to Jool and back just to see if it\u0027s capable of doing it, I find myself kinda hooked to building and refining lander designs and testing them on the Mun and Minmus, and have been having a lot of fun with it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But enough of that, let\u0027s get this thread started shall we? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd since it would be impolite to start a lander thread without showing any pics of my own, I present to you . . . the two-man lander which I\u0027ve named the \u0022Rhino\u0022, with it\u0027s command module. There\u0027s KWRocketry, Bobcat\u0027s H.O.M.E. pack, and B9 parts there too. Hope y\u0027all like it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ifM42cK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ifM42cK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r80fwzI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r80fwzI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DosYQ5e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DosYQ5e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QksT1F7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QksT1F7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/POLWRr5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022POLWRr5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
