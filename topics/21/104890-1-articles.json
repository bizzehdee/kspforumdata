A multi-year mission, Cassini has observed Saturn and its rings and moons. Along the way, it dropped off the ESA\u0027s Huygens probe on Titan (I used Laythe as an analogue) which functioned on the surface for almost an hour. I hope you like my rendition of it!\n\n**Craft Info:** 274 parts, 9.8 tons, and 900 m/s of dv for orbital maneuvers. Huygens is easy to land- it has 800 m/s and a single parachute.\n\n**Craft Download:** (Mediafire) [_Cassini-Huygens.craft\u0022\\]Link](http://www./download/dwyhrzrv8nffvwc/%5BREPLICA)\n\n\u003E ![VM7Om6R.png](http://i.imgur.com/VM7Om6R.png)\n\n\u003E  \n\n\u003E ![hrxwc7x.png](http://i.imgur.com/hrxwc7x.png)\n\nBeauty shots!\n\n![OztP8uT.png](http://i.imgur.com/OztP8uT.png)\n\n![uQ8NPiR.png](http://i.imgur.com/uQ8NPiR.png)\n\n![ClLm2E2.png](http://i.imgur.com/ClLm2E2.png)\n\n![Rj9vsq8.png](http://i.imgur.com/Rj9vsq8.png)\n\n![KloUZd0.png](http://i.imgur.com/KloUZd0.png)\n\nThanks for viewing, and feel free to leave some rep if you enjoyed! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T00:53:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You must spread some Reputation around before giving it to Zucal again.\n\nZucal,\n\nStop making awesome crafts.
