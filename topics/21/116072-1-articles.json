Aim for about 30-40km.\n\nIf the \u0022hab module\u0022 spazzes\u0022 around (which it will) just open and close it.\n\nHappy landings!\n\nDownload [https://www.dropbox.com/s/9j2qqwmfsu91xte/Moho%20ship.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9j2qqwmfsu91xte/Moho%20ship.craft?dl=0)\n\n[![screenshot4782_zpszgtsld0k.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot4782_zpszgtsld0k.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot4782_zpszgtsld0k.png.html)[![screenshot4823_zpset9txzpe.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot4823_zpset9txzpe.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot4823_zpset9txzpe.png.html)[![screenshot4944_zpsqscxmxjf.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot4944_zpsqscxmxjf.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot4944_zpsqscxmxjf.png.html)\n\n[![screenshot5010_zps93kfeozz.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot5010_zps93kfeozz.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot5010_zps93kfeozz.png.html)\n\n[![screenshot5059_zpstwr890jv.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot5059_zpstwr890jv.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot5059_zpstwr890jv.png.html)\n\n[![screenshot5151_zpspqjpy6jy.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot5151_zpspqjpy6jy.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot5151_zpspqjpy6jy.png.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T06:18:02Z","Content":"Great work!
