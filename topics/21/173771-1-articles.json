With eve\u0027s thicker atmosphere this concept could easily reduce fuel to something much more accessible and allow you to start from sea level anywhere on eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo use the craft open activate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E then hold Q to begin taking off. It can go to about 12.5m/s directly up with this slapped together design. When it starts to wobble to much hold E or let it stop rotating then generally realign with up, then hold Q again and repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/zabndivo5x8brfm/eve%20electric%20lifter.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zabndivo5x8brfm/eve electric lifter.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022a7XqZgb.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/a7XqZgb.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if you could use something as simple as angled aerobrake devices so that they can be stowed later and act as breaks. This could allow an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane Rocket hybrid design fairly easily.

If you use the minium authority limiter for the wings then increase it to max you get a sudden burst of speed. It\u0027s not much, and after a few seconds stabalizes, but if you could maximize this could you act like a flying saucer and rotate and suddenly increase to a larger amount of speed? Could you even get enough to shoot out of orbit or to close to neede velocity for escape on kerbin, even, laythe, or jool. And what about the sun. I think it technically has an atmosphere. So could you use this design idea to lauch from around teh sun as you have potentially infinite DeltaV. You could use it for completely different types of maneuvers. Both from sol and jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo use burst speed on this one you use E instead of Q. And the low setting is 150 and the highest speed is -150. If you take off with 150 and after taking off quickly slide it to -150 you will go instantly to about 15m/s upwards and it will then drop back down. This could be potentially maximized to get higher velocities in atmospheres. It\u0027s depends on how exploitable it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-11T13:15:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2018 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
