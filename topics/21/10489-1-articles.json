Just wanted to share with you my favorite orbital rocket.\n\nVORKUZ III\n\nAn orbital rocket designed to deliver a diverse range of payloads into a stable orbit. The body of the rocket is made from completely stock parts but is versatile enough to deliver payloads that aren\\\u0027t stock aswell.\n\n[![tf8cv.jpg](http://www.freeimagehosting.net/t/tf8cv.jpg)](http://www.freeimagehosting.net/tf8cv) \n\n(click for larger)\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nMain Body: 3 x Liquid Fuel Cells with LV-T30 Engine.\n\nSides: 4x Solid Rocket Boosters (stacked and fall away) with 2x additional liquid fuel cells linked to main thruster.\n\nAdd-ons: 1x ADV SAS, 2x AV-T1 Winglets, 6x RV-105 RCS Thruster Blocks\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nWith the ADV SAS and RCS turned on this rocket flies itself. It is a slow ascent rocket so initially your vertical speed will hover around 100 @ 90% throttle. The boosters for launch are more for getting the rocket into that speed so it can cruise on its large fuel capacity. Once you have jettisoned the boosters and external fuel cells your speed will pick up to around 600-1000 if you maintain 90% throttle. By the time you have reached the height for orbit you will have around 1 and a 1/2 fuel cells left for the transfer from vertical to horizontal speed. To make up for the lack of fuel I usually put the nose 15-20 degrees below the horizon so gravity can speed the craft up. This is usually enough to gain the magic number for orbit (around 2500 m/s if I remember correctly). What you do in orbit depends on the payload you have, which can be stock or not.\n\nWhat do you guys think???"},{"CreatedByName":"chillman1212","CreatedById":16988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T18:25:00Z","Content":"This isn\\\u0027t stock but I do like design very much =P"},{"CreatedByName":"mGGCwnAnnwn","CreatedById":25108,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T02:57:44Z","Content":"The capsule with nosecone and that isn\\\u0027t stock but everything below is. That is why I said the Rocket is stock but the payload (capsule) isn\\\u0027t. You can change the payload for anything you want.\n\nThanks for like though ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T03:34:20Z","Content":"The [stock] in the topic title implies that anyone with just the stock game can download and use it.
