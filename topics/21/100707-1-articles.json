I still have to find a way to make it centered like this during normal takeoff potentially. Unless the current design is better. The point was to get rid of issues with weight and fuel changes during takeoff and flight. The same reason most of my fuel is stacked on the wings.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=]()\n\n125kish orbit with lots of fuel. Not sure how far it can get though as it weighs 160t and It is very laggy. 3 real hours to get into orbit. So this will be more interesting when and if the game gets more optimized. I have gotten an earlie version to the mun but kept crashing it as I have virtually nil experience landing on low gravity bodies.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T11:19:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 11:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela**"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T15:54:44Z","Content":"THE PART CLIPPING IS STRONG IN THIS ONE\n\nawesome craft anyway ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T16:05:37Z","Content":"This originally had like 500k\u002B electric charge, but I simplified it a bit for parts counts sake. And the original version had 1200\u002B air intake. but when you do too much 8xradial in combination with complex wing setups it restricted me too much. I\u0027ve changed the plane design a bit though since then. so I may have to go back and do that from scratch. It would lighten the plane as most of them were radials instead of the longer surface ones.\n\nI discrovered putting endless electrical things in the engines front inside the control surface item was great way to sneak in large electrical power supplies and lesson the need for more annoying, if not heavier, solar arrays.\n\n [https://www./folder/4pq8jh4rb997ng8,gr2rggvrabhcu1p/shared](https://www./folder/4pq8jh4rb997ng8,gr2rggvrabhcu1p/shared) If this link works this is for the above mentioned version.(It\u0027s one of those aircraft I believe.) I had to stop because of parts limitation and I started building the Lifter IIRC. I was testing to see how much per engine I thought was needed to get full circular orbits below 70k on just jets. I think it was 66-100 air intake. In the lifter I settled for half at 66(800 total) hoping to get the same affect with half(only rapier or turbojet) of the engines running at max jet altitudes before it went out and I tried to get into higher orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T16:46:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 04:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela**"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T16:45:18Z","Content":"Interesting design.

Check my sig for more info and a little help on intakes.\n\nCan your plane get to orbit? Whats the range once there?

I\u0027m not sure what the speed but it\u0027s getting better every patch. I\u0027ll have to do a time comparison from the clock to real world time.\n\nVersion 3: [http://www./download/7plxvzf6epcewna/AEIOU_NIRDm_Lifter_v3.craft](http://www./download/7plxvzf6epcewna/AEIOU_NIRDm_Lifter_v3.craft)\n\nI\u0027m running:\n\nPhenom II 1100T\n\n560Ti 1gb edition\n\n8gb 1600 DDR3\n\n240gb SSD\n\nFedora 21 64bit\n\nThe rest of my computer runs fine while this is running. It\u0027s just the game that is slow. I chat on this and do other things while it is flying.\n\nI was running that many intakes to be able to keep pushing at 40-50k altitude. Waht I really need is an easier way to shut down the engines. I guess I\u0027ll have to try manually shutting some off when I\u0027m on the last stretch. If I fly correctly I should be able to circularize the orbit below 70k and then push up with that for alot less fuel. Not sure about the range. That is something I\u0022m still working on. But the design can get into space. It\u0027s just about how little none pure liquid fuel reserves I can use. Though I did just get up to 799 air intake and seems to have problems on the runway. I think it\u0027s a strut issue I introduced though. It\u0027s now at just under 1600 parts! 8p\n\nAnd, again, there is a point to the intakes. It allows you to fly more in the third level of atmosphere a lot better. This could allow for much cheaper runs if it can lift heavy loads for getting to orbital bodies. I\u0027m just not sure of it\u0027s limitations yet.\n\nAnd the intakes measure isn\u0027t the number of intakes it\u0027s the value on the runway. (Current/Max) Unless those are the same. I forget how much they add. I just came back from a break from the game. Kinda forgot.\n\nBTW, I kinda figured most people had better computers than me and could run this better! 8)\n\nI\u0027ll definetly try white lightning out. Just dled it. If it\u0027s more around 600 parts I should be able to use it with virtually no lag at all.\n\nRunway test:\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=]()\n\nIn game timer had around 18 seconds. Real world timer was around 9 minutes. I do almost nothing but this type of large count plane. I might just be used to it. BTW this is now V3. It has 799 max air intake and 1600 parts. My game crashed after taking the second pick. Not the normal occurrence but I\u0027ll have to see if I can get around it now.\n\nBTW this thing is in pure vertical ascent at about 2/3-3/4 of the runway. And you can go straight up to 20k or more then start circularizing. Or whatever works best. Haven\u0027t figured that out yet.\n\nEdit: Second run did around 19 seconds in 7 minutes! 8) And it\u0027s reaches 10k at around 1:30 on the game clock. so you can do the math(Actual test: 1:38 seconds in 35 minutes). I usually start some laundry, or eat something, or... pick anything. Mind you this is Rapier engines with Turbojets stacked on the ends though. So, it gets faster as you go up also.\n\nI\u0027m really hoping the 1.0 update, or one of them, introduce the physics fixes or some more performance boosts in some manner. It would be nice to fly this in a more timely manner.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T08:39:37Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 08:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela**"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T08:46:16Z","Content":"So basically, this is more like a \u0022Hey!

My computer isn\u0027t exactly new. the design was to maximize air intake to get into orbit with as little non liquid fuel as possible and figure out how to get as much range and destinations as possible. And carry out other objectives like maybe mining later or hauling to orbit. It\u0027s kind of meant to do a little of everything. But I\u0027m still testing it. And as you can see that testing takes a long time. Part of why I choose to put it up really. Hoping others could run it better and might get some feedback faster than me spending an hour or two flying it around.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T09:22:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 09:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela**"}]}
