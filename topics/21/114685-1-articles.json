It was this, rather than \u0022torque\u0022, which tended to make the WW2 single-engined fighters pull to one side during takeoff. Anyway, a clockwise prop would have an effect which a jet engine doesn\u0027t.\n\nPhotos of the real thing also show more streamlining of the crew pod. Maybe a Tail Connector rather than a reversed Nose Cone? There is a slight weight saving, but it would look a bit long. I\u0027m trying to stay Stock, but a Glass Nose nosecone would be a nice add-on part, whether for German WW2 aircraft or a B29/B36/B50. It doesn\u0027t have to do anything, just look different to solid metal-stuff.\n\n(The B36 feels rather Kerbalish: a mix of prop and jet engines, and they tested a \u0022parasite\u0022 fighter which could be deteched to defend the bomber.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Ojimak","CreatedById":57539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T14:46:31Z","Content":"I really wasn\u0027t going for a replica at all - I just wanted to test an asymmetrical airframe, and used this design since I knew it at least worked IRL.

They\u0027re a bit long for the crew pod, though some parts Mods have alternative 1.25m nosecones that are more pointy\n\n2: The setup needs adjusting for a prop engine. It has to be moved forward so as to clear the crew pod\u0027s nose.\n\n3: I also tried the 0.625m jet engine from Modular Rocket Systems. Plenty of power.\n\nIt all flew, and I could land it. I then did some messing around in the SPH and built a twin-turboprop transport plane using some KAX parts. It flew pretty well, first time, though I get a bit finger-tangled when flying planes in KSP. TweakScale and some sort of Fuel Switch mod helps a lot. You can easily replace oxidiser with fuel.\n\nI would be surprised if KSP couldn\u0027t cope with asymmetry: that\u0027s a feature of the Space Shuttle."},{"CreatedByName":"Thingymajigy","CreatedById":136332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T13:31:11Z","Content":"Well, I half-crashed my ssto and it still flew rather fine ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n![9AiqpH3.png](http://i.imgur.com/9AiqpH3.png)"}]}
