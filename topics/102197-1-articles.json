As you can see, it flies rather well acctually. The crash in the end is a result of electric based rotors and no solar panels.\n\nMy crafts biggest flaw is the throttle control, or the lack of one to be honest. I have to throttle up by increasing the \u0022Coarse Speed\u0022 in the right click menu little at the time. First the front rotor, then the back rotor, then the front again and so on... and it becomes a nightmare because when it lifts of, one of the rotors always has .1 more Coarse Speed so it begins to spin and one has to be quick as hell to get them to match. Once airborne, I have to much work just controlling yaw, pitch and roll to also control the to Coarse Speed.\n\nMy question is, is there any way to assign the Coarse Speed controls to any keys? Or can I assign them to the ordinary throttle control? I\u0027ve tried mounting the blades on a non-locked dish washer bearing and powering it witch them small Rockomax\u0027s but if I want the rotors to get speed I need ALOT of Rockomax\u0027s and that is just killer for my fuel consumption.\n\nI hope someone\u0027s got an answer, I really want my \u0027copter to work!! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThanks, Prillmeister\n\n**Video**:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/6-mB-yNYXbo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T14:19:42Z","Content":"first off, how is your copter constructed?
