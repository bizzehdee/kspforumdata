I am running the game in a window. For some reason I cannot get stage lock to turn off. I have tried Alt\u002BL (seems to be for Windows), Windows\u002BL (which locks my login), and RightShift\u002BL and none seem to be working. I can press RightShift\u002BF2 and bring up the KSP Debug Console which shows several lines showing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Log]: staging lock/unlock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen I press RightShift\u002BL, but the light stays purple. My mouse is not near the staging controls. I can launch a rocket by right clicking the engine and clicking the Activate Engine button, but since staging is still locked, I cannot do much but watch my rocket fall back to the ground. I just started a carrier and built a simple rocket from a capsule, a few tanks, an engine, and the communication antenna. Is there something I am missing? The only other odd thing I notice is the MET keeps flashing between green and yellow (though always at \u002B00:00:00). I have been searching around but have not come across any answers that have helped. The stage lock did turn off during the tutorial when controlled by the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Proply","CreatedById":65418,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T06:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[edit] nvm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-14T10:19:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2016 10:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Proply\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
