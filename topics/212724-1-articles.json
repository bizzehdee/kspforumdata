Eventually I started building something like the ISS.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nToday I loaded my save and when I went to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to build another module I saw that I cannot launch the spacecraft from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. I can only launch it from the launch pad but the thing is when I try to launch it from the launch pad I cannot revert to launch or revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. In addition to that bug I can\u0027t also quicksave or save. My last save is from yesterday and the game is not autosaving as well. Naturally I\u0027m stuck with no game save and I need some fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngryKerbs","CreatedById":226340,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T19:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame here, game saving stopped work during gameplay with no error message.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSave dialog had been working as expected but game did not create any save in savegames folder for two hours and I was not able to make any new save any way I have tried.
