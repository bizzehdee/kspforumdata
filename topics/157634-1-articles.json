It is likely that I won\u0027t be able to use KCT itself, since it doesn\u0027t get along with Custom Barn Kit, which I am definitely not dropping; so I\u0027m curious if there\u0027s an alternative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo, something that helps plan commnet capabilities of vessels. Something like a small window in the editor that sums up the total antenna power of all combinable antennas so I don\u0027t have to do it by hand (especially since I don\u0027t know where to look up the individual combinability exponents), and perhaps an input box where I can input another antenna power with which to calculate the communications range (for maximum and minimum signal strength) with the vessel that I am currently building. Does anything like that exist?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for suggestions \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-12T17:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;\u0022\u003EIt is likely that I won\u0027t be able to use KCT, since it \u003Cstrong\u003Edoesn\u0027t get along\u003C/strong\u003E with Custom Barn Kit, which I am definitely not dropping; so I\u0027m curious if there\u0027s an alternative\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv title=\u0022Protected by Grammarly\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you mean by this?
