I have a modded install, with about 60 different mods. I\u0027ll post the list of mods this evening when I get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal memory usage after initial startup is about 2.6 gig.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have my first space station, right now consisting of a zoology lab and a science lab docked together. This is in the save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried setting up a new mission, and things went screwy, so I restored from a backup and so far have isolated the problem to the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I reduced the new ship to a Stayputnik and an SRB, nothing else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I go to the launch pad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game will briefly show the ship on the launch pad, and then after 2-5 seconds, the screen goes blank. The normal toolbar is showing at the top right, and when I hit the escape key, the menu shows up in the center of the screen. However, it is unresponsive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe really annoying thing is that the game saves a new save file, but my space station is deleted. I can restart the game, but the station is gone. The size of the save file is about 200k, while the size of the file with the space station is over 300k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I replace the Stayputnik with a manned pod, it seems to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, before I start doing a lot of digging, I\u0027m wondering if anyone has experienced this before, and if so, are there any mods which might be causing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, I\u0027ll be posting the list of mods this evening, but am kind of hoping that someone can make a suggestion in the meantime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T23:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk.
