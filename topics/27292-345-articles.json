One of my earliest failures in the game, was launching a large central stack ship with a bunch of boosters at the base of it. Ship loaded up on the launchpad, I immediately cycled up the throttle and hit spacebar, then watched as my entire central stack just collapsed in a ball of fire as the rings of boosters went flying into the air. Turns out part of the problem was no struts on the ship at all, the rest was how physics loads in the game. Aside from your initial gravity turn during launch, the process of loading your ship onto the launchpad and then turning the physics of the world on is the most stressful time of the ship. So nowadays I always wait at least 30 seconds for my ship to stabilize after physics loading, even if it doesn\u0027t appear to need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruthgar","CreatedById":113799,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T04:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022munseeker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022munseeker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI still have five Kerbals stuck in solar orbit, low on fuel but high in spirit. \u003Cp\u003EI managed to resupply them (I\u0027m using TAC LS, so this was crucial) and add more living space, but just now I had two...
