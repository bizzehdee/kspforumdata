For rockets, I will say that I\u0027ve managed a best of around 3200 vacuum dv in 1.0.2 and 2900 dv in 1.0 with about a 1.7 starting TWR in both. Those however require an optimal ascent in their respective version, so I think around 3500-3600 should be about right for your baseline. However, your estimate might be even higher like 3700 if you like lower TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T03:32:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks. I\u0027m not a stickler on efficiency, but I try not to be TOO wasteful. I use 3600 as my number because it\u0027s enough that even if it gets a little sloppy on the ascent you\u0027re not gonna put your shiny new satellite into the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T04:10:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eive found 3300 is the absolute minimum dV you need (well ive never managed less in 1.0.2). For very bad TWR or crazy stuff like massive fairings you might need an excess of 4000 to pull it off (try launching a 30m radius fairing that has a capital ship inside it). Still, i use 1.0 aerodynamics as they felt better and more fun, so most rockets need around 3000dV to go orbital, and even those crazy fairings will still get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
