I have been modifying an orbital capsule for resuply runs on a recently started spacestation. it is well into the early hours of the morning in the UK and once again I am unable to sleep so I start up KSP and I had a brain wave lets do a test of the capsules capacity. So I load up the command pod and the crew pod (crew pod is the other side of the stack decoupler but I had not thought of that. We have a slight emergency in orbit, yes Jeb got a little carried away with the KER Bull (it gives you rockets) so I have a choice decouple or punch back upto orbit, I chose to punch to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moral\u0027s of the story,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Dont let Jeb have KER Bull (it gives you rockets)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Remember not to play KSP when your tired and kill more than half of your astronaut crew in one go. Rescue ships are on the pad as we speak.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manskal","CreatedById":73159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T08:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, thats why I choose StarBob\u0027s coffee every time I have to make early morning runs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
