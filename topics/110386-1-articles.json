It may sound stupid but I need your opinion on it, thank you.\n\nOkay, so I\u0027m having a little difficulty understanding this...\n\nSo it\u0027s got an engine on the bottom, to propel it up to space.\n\nIn space, it releases the fairings, revealing an engine. Flip ship 180 degrees.\n\nFire booster.\n\nComing back down, a heatshield appears where the first engine was? or do you decouple the first engine, revealing a heatshield below it?\n\nA few more nitpicks:\n\nIt seems that both engines would be drawing from the same fuel source, right?\n\nIf so, you would want your vaccum engine to be more efficient than your ascent engine... but having two engines adds more weight, potentially reversing any boost to efficiency.\n\nIf the engines use different types of fuel, why not just stage away the empty fuel tank/useless booster?\n\nAlso, a side note, your username reminds me of a \u0022joke\u0022 game I\u0027ve talked about with friends...
