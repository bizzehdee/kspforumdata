For the first few missions, Pilots are much better because they have access to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Without the Astronaut Complex\u00A0upgrade, they cannot EVA and this is where Scientist first shine. The major benefit of Scientist early is being able to reset experiments. You can take multiple Mystery goo / Material study experiments without having to bring extra copies. This allows for some pretty efficient and lucrative\u00A0mun / minmus fly-by / orbit missions. But when they really start to shine is once you unlock the \u0022Mobile Processing Lab MPL-LG-2\u0022 (known as \u0022Lab\u0022). It allows to boost your science gain tremendously but needs to be operated by one or more scientists. At this point in the game, Pilots have become quite superfluous because probe cores can do their job much better for lower mass. A niche application might be the newly added remote control feature for which I think pilots are required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: wording\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-10T10:30:08Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2016 10:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Three_Pounds\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skavies","CreatedById":172181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T10:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you. \u00A0So I am shooting myself in the foot using Bob. \u00A0Will have to take him on a ride along later to level him before shoving him in the lab, but by the time I unlock that, taking passengers to the mun is easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T11:50:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on how many biomes you plan to hit, resetting the goo and SciJr can be vital. And if you have a reasonable amount of science unlocked, then an OKTO is just one research step away -- and it\u0027s a pretty necessary step to take at some point early in the game anyway. But yes, you must either have a pilot or an OKTO on your ship. An OKTO gives you the freedom to bring Bob instead of a pilot. And in fact, I always go that route. My first major mission is a trip to Munmus with a science rover (including goo and SciJr) to hit all 9 biomes -- which means I unlock that OKTO damned quick and send Bob.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T17:14:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027re able to go on EVA and have the ability to take passengers to the Mun/Minmus, you can always take Bob (or any other scientist) along as a passenger to reset experiments that need it. \u00A0As mentioned above, it\u0027s worth leveling up your scientists if you plan on using the Mobile Processing Lab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T18:02:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E makes your life a whole lot easier, so in the early going it\u0027s worth it to stick with pilots just for safety\u0027s sake.
