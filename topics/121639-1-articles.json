Reason why i became a Minmus Epxlorer. However, i\u0027ve never ever circumvented Minmus until now. Time to correct that mistake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of my mission is to circumvent Minmus two times in succession. Once over the equator imediately followed by a circumvention over the poles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo document the journey i will take screenshots every 10 degrees and leave a probe every 30 degrees. I\u0027m using a lot of mods, mostly for esthetic reason, some for other purposes (like Historian). Mechjeb, Hyperedit and Kerbaljointsreinforcements will not be used during the land travel (mind you, i use Mechjeb to get the tractor in orbit around Minmus), i will drive the tractor every step of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I\u0027ve traveled 150 degrees along the equator and there are some things that {AHEM} could have been done better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one, i absentmindedly forgot to name the tractor correctly. It\u0027s called \u003Cstrong\u003EMinmus Tractor (MK2) - test\u003C/strong\u003E instead of Minmus Tractor (MK3). Furthermore, the probes i leave behind get marked on the map as questionmarks (I still haven\u0027t figured out why that occurs) .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let me present the tractor i\u0027m using:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14923883/Minmus%20Tractor%20MK3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Minmus%20Tractor%20MK3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeen here during a testdrive in the neighbourhood of the landingstrip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14923883/Testing%20Minmus%20Tractor%20MK3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Testing%20Minmus%20Tractor%20MK3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop speed of the craft is about 15-16 m/s and the empty weight is about 33 tons. It is equipped with eight RTG\u0027s which supply sufficient electricity for driving, even on steep hills. It is not sufficient for mining ore, converting the ore or converting the ore in required reources. The craft therefor has two aditional small generators which run on liquid fuel. The craft can hold up to 1700 units of ore and some liquid fuel, oxidizer and rcs fuel (mostly located in the middle of the craft). The craft has a low center of gravity and the four tracks provide ample stability to negociate steep hill\u0027s. Even the 25 degree incline which i\u0027ve encountered sofar pose no problem at all. The crew consists of six kerbals, two pilots, two engineers and two scientist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft has an ore drill on the tail, a small hydroponic garden, a 3d printer, a converter for producing fuel and a converter for rocketparts. It has four KAS containers for storing printed parts and several camera\u0027s, including a nightvision camera at the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, some communication and science devices and a lot of lights are included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDriving on Minmus can be dangerous. Minmus is notorious for it\u0027s slight incline changes, easily lulling a driver into a false feeling of safety. The unsuspecting driver often drives too fast and then suddenly is faced with a steep drop. His craft is launched into the sky which usually ends in several explosions when the craft crashes back to the ground (it has happened to me in the past).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop speed should be reserved exclusively for the Minmus\u0027s seas. In hilly country the speed should be 10 m/s or (a lot) less.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-25T09:06:57Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2015 09:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheCardinal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCardinal","CreatedById":22874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T11:33:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first part of my mission has been completed; the circumvention of Minmus along the equator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t have suspected the way this mission would change me. I know it sounds weird but Minmus and i have become closer to each other than ever before. I now understand that you NEED to embark on such a mission to get some understanding of a planet or a moon. Somehow, driving at a 45 degree angle upward or downward AND at the same time a 25 to 30 degree lateral angle does that to you. The voyage hasn\u0027t been without some suprises. I encountered two (temporal) rifts, one at position 0, 90 and one at position 0, 135. Apparently the omega 13 experiment (see\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLF4E798BCCBC36923\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E ) has had it\u0027s effects on Minmus as well.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve steered well clear of the rifts as the effects might have some desastrous consequences. Another surprise was the sudden end to a steep mountain. The rover was launched into the air but fortunately landed squarely on it\u0027s tracks without real damage. During the journey some defects developed. The camera\u0027s ceased to function and the 3d printer, containers and such stopped working. Bilrie Kerman was able to get things working again, although the content of the containers disappeared completely. The probes were placed at several places but were a complete failure. Those mounted on the ground exploded immediately and those dropped were broken. In the next leg i\u0027ll continue dropping probes but without much hope they will give any usefull information. No probe was dropped at 0, 270. The vertical angle (45 degrees) was much too steep. It was deemed too unsafe for Bilrie Kerman to allow him to exit the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most annoying defect which plagues the rover now is an imbalance in one of the drivetrains, possibly even both. When accelerating, the rover turns to the left. When braking the rover turns to the right. At first the deviation was small but it has become worse at the end of the first leg and so far Bilrie has been unable to rectify this situation. I have been considering ordering a replacement rover but this would be very costly and timeconsuming. Therefor the second leg will be undertaken with the same rover (even though the deviation is quite a nuisance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome pictures: \u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/yTa29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E//imgur.com/a/yTa29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill be reporting back when the second leg has been completed (failure is not an option!)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-30T08:40:20Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2015 08:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheCardinal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCardinal","CreatedById":22874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T08:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI completely forgot to mention that the navigational computer (Historian) has been on the blink.
