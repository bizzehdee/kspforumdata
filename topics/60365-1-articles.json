The MAKO is a swift all-terrain vehicle that while it rides very bumpy just like rovers in KSP, it is pretty resistant to tipping over--not like rovers in KSP. It can hold 3 crew members and explore rough terrain at breakneck speeds. At lower speeds, it can go up steep inclines easily, and is very nearly a cliff-climber. It features thruster jets that can fire in short bursts to launch it a few meters in the air. It is heavily armored and thus pretty resistant to impacts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I want to see is a rover design that mimics the M35 MAKO. Props if it looks similar and handles similar, but more important is that it be able to run across the surface pretty fast without tipping over, or maybe can use its thrusters to right itself if it does--and won\u0027t have parts breaking off if it rolls. Since this is KSP, obviously the thrusters won\u0027t fire in short bursts. It should have enough delta-V to be able to make a lot of short jumps before it runs out of fuel, being able to lift into m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit or being able to dock/refuel are both a plus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good design might involve a low center of mass, helping keep it from tipping due to vehicular acceleration, and helping to ensure if it rolls or flips, it\u0027ll land wheels-down. The ruggederized wheels are probably the best wheel option from the looks of it, though I hear the really big rover wheels are pretty sturdy after all. Ideally it should have balanced thrusters allowing it to lift off without rotating or tumbling, and they should stay balanced as the fuel drains, but it might also be good to have a significant amount of torque. Low torque can also be good, as it\u0027ll make the SAS softer and more cushion-y. Also great if it comes with a launch vehicle for easy transport from Kerbin to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. It\u0027s fine if you design it to work on Kerbin (or anywhere else), but the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn is where I will be most interested in driving it. Don\u0027t forget to mention where it has been tested/drives best, and include the craft file!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I won\u0027t be scoring these, I will place my favorites up here on the \u0022leaderboard\u0022, with a small pic of the vehicle and what I like about it. If I\u0027m interested in driving it, I\u0027ll give it a whirl and also mention what I liked about how it handles, what I didn\u0027t like, and what I learned from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M35_Mako\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M35_Mako\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ELEADERBOARD:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-19T11:41:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2014 11:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
