Today in KSP, I realized how often I use VAB exploits. What do I mean? Well, for example, did you know that if you can\u0027t place a part somewhere, just drop it somewhere else where you *can* place it and then, magically, you can pick it up again and drop it where you wanted to the first time? I use this exploit all the time when I want to place nosecones that clip slightly through other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also like to hide the short command module between an ASAS and a shielded docking port by attaching the ASAS to the top node of the CM instead of the bottom, then attaching the docking node above it. This allows me to create pretty-looking vehicles that function as both manned and unmanned while giving me an extra docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question to the community is what VAB exploits do you use, and what are some of the neat ways in which you use them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T20:09:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not an exploit... that\u0027s a workaround for a bug in VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Colonel_Panic","CreatedById":61997,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T20:17:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, those are features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso features: fitting toroidal fuel tanks between parts, using cubic octagonal struts to place things that require nodes, and tucking things into \u0027hollow\u0027 parts (like ASAS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes to get around the hassle of those radial attachment bugs, I\u0027ll use the debug menu to allow clipping, but it\u0027s still not an exploit if you\u0027re placing it somewhere you *should* be able to place it in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the only thing I\u0027ll intentionally exploit the debug menu for is placing radial RCS tanks inside of standard fuel tanks on small disposable landers (only way to keep the mass centered without using the weight of 2 of them when you don\u0027t need that much fuel.) and hiding OKTO2 probe cores between command modules in spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T21:44:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to have engine clusters but I stopped because I felt lke they made the mainsail pretty useless\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Qumefox","CreatedById":43197,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T22:03:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AmpsterMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AmpsterMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI used to have engine clusters but I stopped because I felt lke they made the mainsail pretty useless\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey don\u0027t. Mainsail is still the most bang for the buck (highest engine TWR) engine you can get.. However.. Using clusters, most non-huge rockets don\u0027t really need all the thrust mainsails provide.. So while clusters cut some of it\u0027s viability, they don\u0027t eliminate it... Since there are tradeoffs with using clusters.. Namely, higher part counts and lower engine TWR, (Clusters that match a mainsail\u0027s thrust are going to be much heavier than a mainsail.) so the ISP gains are offset by the increase in non-fuel mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frafor","CreatedById":57212,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T22:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always the little cubic struts for everything (almost all of my rockets hace clusters) and I place round RCS tanks inside ASAS modules and engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wayfare","CreatedById":52072,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T22:19:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love my cubic octagonal struts.
