Try making PONG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy PONG? Well, it is one of the simplest games ever, and it should be a very good learning project. The thing is, if you can\\\u0027t code pong, you simply won\\\u0027t be able to code your own game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t mean to discourage you. Pretty much all aspiring game designers have this one idea they think will be the next big revolution, and for all we know, it just as well might be. The problem is getting that idea into practice. What happens on 99% of cases is that they get themselves a game engine (usually Unity or UDK), and try to start making their game without any clue on where to start. What usually happens then is that they will quit in frustration a few days later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my advice to you is this: Get Unity, do a few of it\\\u0027s tutorials, then try to make pong all by yourself. Try to figure everything out, and when you succeed, you\\\u0027ll have a much clearer notion on how games work, and what it would take to make your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, don\\\u0027t start your own game yet, try a more advanced game, like Breakout. After that, try something else again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more projects you do, the better you\\\u0027ll be prepared when it\\\u0027s time for your own project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I don\\\u0027t mean this in any tone of discouragement. I\\\u0027ve been through this same process here, and I know how easily an idea can die off if you take a step longer than your leg is. If you truly care about your game concept and want to do it justice, trust me, make PONG first. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
