When the vehicle reached altitudes when the rotors stopped being efficient the rocket motors pointed mostly down while continuing to turn the rotors, which now switched to powering an awesome turbo pump that would provide pressure for a super big rocket engine at the roton\u0027s base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds crazy, but just maybe in the Kerbal-verse it could work.

However the wingtip engines would need to be jets which would not be any use for further vertical ascent, and it would need to switch to full rocket mode. The tip engines could be Rapiers (Sabre Analogues) which can switch from jet to rocket. I think it could be done. I doubt it would be as efficient as an ordinary spaceplane, a rotor stage recovery system would be much more interesting as it does not involve re-igniting the booster engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T21:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/14001-pandoras-kitten/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002214001\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/14001-pandoras-kitten/\u0022\u003E@pandoras kitten\u003C/a\u003E May have done the best one: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/101715-rotary-winged-vtol-rocket-with-free-spinning-center-section-inspired-by-roton-rotary-amp-triebflugel/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/101715-rotary-winged-vtol-rocket-with-free-spinning-center-section-inspired-by-roton-rotary-amp-triebflugel/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr Farnsworth","CreatedById":147177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T18:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAhh, the Roton. I always thought it was an interesting idea back then. However if I remember correctly, and I believe the web agrees with me: the Roton launched like a conventional rocket.
