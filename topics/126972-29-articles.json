Giant, kerbal-eating bugs.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbal-eating?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was good to hear Jonbald\u0027s voice after all this time, old and scratchy as it was, but Rosuki would\u0027ve preferred good news. It hadn\u0027t been easy reaching him; she\u0027d had to put the shuttlecraft into an eccentric twenty-plus-some-odd degree orbit just to have line-of-sight with NP-TAS or the North Pole.\u00A0An expensive move but one that bought them mostly unlimited conversation time. And what a dark conversation it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, kerbal-eating. Sadly. It all started when I realized the radio station in North Point had been quiet for weeks. That used to be one of the best college radio stations around. Blizzard Radio. Good stuff. Then your Worker Party friends took over and started polluting the airwaves with their propaganda. Well, I figured if it was quiet then things must be getting better. So I went for a drive.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And you found bugs?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Never seen any like em before. Completely docile during the day, hiding on rooftops, in trees, just everywhere. I wandered around North Point for at least an hour before I noticed them. Not that I was looking for bugs, mind you, I was trying to find someone. Anyone. Yet not a kerbal anywhere. And then I saw them, the bugs, it was just moments before the sun went down. If I hadn\u0027t made it back to my rover when I did, well....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They were worked up in a frenzy at just the sight of me. I may be old, but I\u0027m still faster than those pricks. And when they couldn\u0027t get their dinner they started eating each other. I\u0027ll not describe it. Once the sun came up they all went limp again. Dozed off. Sun barely sets up here at Ten-North, likely the only reason I\u0027m alive.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What,\u0022 Rosuki wasn\u0027t sure she should ask. Or needed to ask. \u0022What happened to our friends? There were at least a hundred of us from the previous....\u0022 No. Not like this. \u0022Please tell me someone made it out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No news from anyone. Not since your Worker Party compadres wrecked the place anyway. And with the bugs.... Maybe a few found a way to survive. We\u0027re a\u00A0crafty lot, us forgotten. Still, I figure after those madkerbs ruined the planet there weren\u0027t many of us left for the bugs to take.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve considered digging out one of the R-1s we buried in the snow to fly south and look for signs of life, but if something wen\u0027t wrong I\u0027d be stuck out in the dark. Think it\u0027s best to just wait it out. Hope for a better world. And soon. I\u0027ve got infinite air and water, but food\u0027s another story. Still, this isn\u0027t the first time I\u0027ve lost friends. It never gets easier.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe line was open for a few moments, Jonbald\u0027s whispers trailing off into the static. \u0022Speaking of friends, how\u0027s the prisoner doing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Quiet. Refuses to talk to anyone. We keep him locked in that old Nitrogen module, bring him food when he runs out. Ask questions that are only answered with angry stares. He still doesn\u0027t look familiar. I was hoping you or Elite would know who he was. Or maybe Sieta\u0027s pirate Lord, seeing as he\u0027s been around for some time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, Sieta. Poor girl. Not doing so well, despite being Queen. Increasingly agitated when I call her up.\u0022 Jonbald\u0027s voice scratched away again. For a moment Rosuki could almost hear other whispers, her ears playing tricks with the static. Sieta\u0027s ghosts. \u0022Some minds can only take so much. I\u0027ll have a word with her about your commsats and radios. For now you best get back to your flock. Might be all that\u0027s left, sad as that sounds. Hard to believe there used to be three hundred of us.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Three hundred?\u0022 She couldn\u0027t remember that many. Was it really three hundred? So many working behind the scenes to make The Plan work. The Plan had failed spectacularly. Rosuki checked the flight map and dialed in a rendezvous with Kelgee. The Plan. The one Elite and Jonbald had worked up with several of the others. \u0022About that. In light of recent events I\u0027ve decided Kerbin is no longer safe. The Plan had merit, but it\u0027s useless if we\u0027re all gassed by warlords or end up as beetle-chow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Girl\u0027s got a better idea?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re moving. To space. We\u0027re going to build a station. A big one. Someplace to live and work free from the madness and instability of Kerbin. Everything\u0027s moving up here. To orbit. Research, Development, Operations. All of it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You might be all of it already.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You know what I mean.\u0022 Did he? Did she? Not yet. Yet she knew where to start. \u0022The data caches on The M\u00FCn have our records and designs. If they don\u0027t work the Memory of Tomorrow still has the hard copies. We keep kickstarting the space program until we\u0027ve built enough up here to survive without Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And if Kerbin doesn\u0027t play along?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then we take over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because that worked so well the last time someone tried it. Go ask Harler. Or Buring. Or your new Worker friend. Revolutions never achieve the ideals of the visions that birth them.\u0022 The long silence made Rosuki wonder if she hadn\u0027t drifted out of line-of-sight. Not yet. Then Jonbald\u0027s voice scratched back as loud as she\u0027d ever heard it. \u0022You should\u0027ve gone to Jool.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s at Jool that I couldn\u0027t do here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ghosts. Whispers in the dark. Friends that never were. Safety, perhaps. If the teams we\u0027ve sent are successful, then we may finally have an answer. And a way out. But that\u0027ll take years. Go home to your sheep. Go commune with Kelgee and his ghosts. I\u0027ll call once I\u0027ve reigned in Sieta.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Plan. Jool. Too much. Too little. She spent the flight back to Kelgee deep in thought. Her new plan would work. She would make it work. The more kerbals they had in orbit and away from Kerbin the less time it\u0027d take to rebuild. Shipyards in orbit. Refineries on The M\u00FCn. Anchors from which to refuel their fleets. Yes, fleets. Science stations. Everywhere. Constantly diging, exploring every option. Greenhouses to grow crops and raise food. Nurseries to raise their young. Life in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotes upon notes of this grand design were sketched out in her books on the descent. Notebooks were a curious thing to find in space, surrounded by all this advanced technology. All of them were empty, of course, their lab notes having been sent back to Kerbin generations ago by their optimistic authors. Better to start this new plan on a blank page than on the backs of so many failed attempts. Three hundred? They couldn\u0027t all be dead, could they?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe wrote for hours on long hours after the shuttle\u0027s computer finished the first alignment burn, and hardly noticed the final one. So she was more than a bit startled when she caught a vision of the wrong ship anchored to the wrong rock at the wrong station. Memories. A cross. Ghosts of Kelgee. Panic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160626_ksp0031_112.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160626_ksp0031_112.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA small tin can detached from the mass and docked to her shuttle a few moments later, its pilot somehow overriding the locks on the forward docking port.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160626_ksp0035_112.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160626_ksp0035_112.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCaptain Hallock drifted in, helmeted yet sporting a Navy-blue uniform like only an image-conscious space pirate could. He had a shiny new short-handled trench shovel in hand but was otherwise unarmed. She had to admit he didn\u0027t seem particularly insane or murderous in person, easy to let your guard down. The uniform lent an air of authority and he carried himself like the veteran spacekerb he was. Who was he, before Pioneer Base, she wondered. What family did he leave behind to the Madness of Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe strapped into the chair across from The Boss after confirming they were indeed alone. Helmet off now that he apparently felt safe. (And why shouldn\u0027t he feel safe? What could she do, blow the airlock?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Terribly sorry about leading your ship astray like this. These pilotless flight computers are so easy to reprogram remotely, as we\u0027ve come to find.

Just a small lander can from the looks of it, old. Very old. Perhaps one of the first. She thought to ask where he found it, but decided small talk was pointless. \u0022Well? What\u0027s this about?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Apologies ma\u0027am, I should\u0027ve started with the invitation. Her Majesty of The Starside Chair, Whisperer of Ghosts, Fair Lady of the Cosmic Waves, Queen of Outer Space and the Colonies of Kerbin, Sieta Kerman, First of Her Name and Last of Her Kind would like to have a word with you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not a fan of brevity, is she?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No miss, it would seem not.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe docking ports closed automatically as the lander can detached, drifting off to dock at some more appropriate mooring. Their shuttle continued directly to Baile Speir, docking at the mains. Hard-seal confirmed, Captain Hallock opened the hatch and motioned for her to enter first.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Best not keep our Queen waiting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160626_ksp0039_112.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160626_ksp0039_112.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160626_ksp0042_112.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160626_ksp0042_112.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe throne room had once been a cupola module, the throne a command chair anchored in place. It now faced inwards towards the main habitat of Baile Speir instead of outwards. Meant to look directly on Kerbin from its low orbit, it now presented its occupant with a view of her court. Small as it was. Its occupant watched as Rosuki and Hallock drifted towards her, the bulkheads from the entire length of the station having been removed to create one long, open chamber.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs was only right and proper for the throne of a Queen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey floated in her court silently, awaiting some recognition from she who would rule. A radio headset rested loosely atop he head, its arms serving as a crude crown, its speakers hissing silently. Connected directly to the background noise, it would seem.

The world in pain. And then again the screams. In an instant, silence.\u0022 This time she looked directly at Rosuki, appearing to have just noticed her. \u0022Welcome to Sky Home, Lady Boss, she who sent me here to be forgotten. I would ask you to kneel, but space hosts no kneelers. No kings. No queens. Only peers.\u0022 A smile. \u0022The whispers said you would come, and so you have.

You have something we need. As Queen I could take it, but would prefer not to use such force. It takes time to rebuild my network after the screams shatter it, so many of my children in so much pain. The animal needs must be met. Food, water, air. Fuel. The usual. If you want to whisper to my ghosts a toll must be levied.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMadness.

Shapes danced on the surface. Sieta said something she didn\u0027t hear. Kept talking, but word\u0027s didn\u0027t register. Rosuki was consumed by the sight of Kerbin. Dark shapes.
