The new KIS system is a little more realistic than the old KAS system. You need an engineer first off. Secondly you need to have either an electric screwdriver or a wrench from the IVA list of parts equipped by that engineer. So you put the screwdriver or wrench in your kerbals inventory seat 1 in a single occupant pod, or just place it in a container and retrieve it later. Only with a tool in hand with an engineer can you attach anything. There is more info within the game by using the KIS manual under the IVA parts list in the VAB SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, Is there a way to have an assembled structure attached to the end of the winch and still be able to extend and retract it?

I\u0027ve lookd everywhere and it\u0027s nowhere to be found in the .zip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are parts called KAS_portf_cs and KAS_portf_n but no Winch Male Port. I guess the f in port\u003Cstrong\u003Ef\u003C/strong\u003E stands for female which is the Connector Port F on this image (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WzGFK0I.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/WzGFK0I.png\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the .zip there is the female port, the anchor, the grappling hook, the harpoon, the magnet, the pylon, the strut and the vertical and horizontal winches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am the only one with this problem (Male Port Connector missing) ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in adavance and keep up the good work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyrog","CreatedById":68838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T21:26:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KospY\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KospY\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKAS 0.5.2 released !\u003Cp\u003EChangelog:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E[Enhancement] Converted parts textures to DDS\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E[Enhancement] AVC is now used for version check\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E[Enhancement] Added a KIS version dependancy check\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E[Fix] Added stacking to connector port\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E[Fix] Fixed a compatibility issue with Kerbal Joint Reinforcement\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E[Fix] Updated OnKISAction to use BaseEventData (prevent KAS crash if KIS is missing)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMale port connector is integrated in the winch.
