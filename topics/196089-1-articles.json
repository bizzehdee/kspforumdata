I made it before the breaking ground dlc came out and i wanted to play it because I did my \u0022Decorate Dres December\u0022 challenge in it. I press load and nothing happens except the words behind the window (i.e. \u0022new save\u0022 and \u0022load save\u0022 ) stop being grayed-out. I tried making a copy and renaming the file but still no luck. Can someone please help? I currently have 9 savefiles in my game not including the ones i didnt create like \u0022scenarios\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkuss","CreatedById":202625,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-04T08:12:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Maybe you should try and use backup file.
