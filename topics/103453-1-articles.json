If all you want is \u0022a base\u0022 and you don\u0027t know what all is needed, then Minmus makes for very fast turnarounds so you can fix problems, restart missions, send up other missions, or whatever is needed. Think of it as KSP Bases with training wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, if your base is to be a Karbonite and/or Extraplanetary Launchpads base, Minmus goes from a great choice to a FANTASTIC one.
