Interesting, cool theories like these that people may not have heard of. This topic will include hypothesis, theory, and law, so long as these things are backed by evidence, be it mathematical, quantum, observed, etcetera. In short, no conjecture. Just pure science theory/hypothesis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I mentioned above, despite my adoration for all things space, several theories have blown past me somehow. The sister earth is one I had never even heard of prior to a clip I watched last night, and confirmed earlier today. The cosmic bow shock I remembered hearing about but not enough was mentioned to stick. These examples are interesting and cool, so I\u0027m looking for related stuff here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T15:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy sister earth, you mean a planet orbiting the sun at Earth\u0027s L3 point?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to recall hearing that they couldn\u0027t really have any condtions in a planetary formation model that would result in such a scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnstable during planetary formation, or very divergent mass distribution -\u0026gt; much as Earth was ~10x bigger than Theia.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the mere existence of Theia makes such an idea seem somewhat plausible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would also be fun would be something like Rocheworld...
