This happened to me too on all my early transfers, and I bet its fairly common. What you probably did was setup the encounter with a flatter, more direct profile. In contrast, an optimal Hohmann transfer to Duna is a rounder half-ellipse where you Kerbol apoapsis just barely intercepts the planet at the precise moment it is there to greet you with open arms. The planner you linked includes an ejection angle, and that angle, in addition to the window timing, is the key to getting this optimal rounder transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Jim","CreatedById":142312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T01:05:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eric S\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eric S\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EScreenshots would help.

If I put my node at 150 Kerbin prograde and then keep pulling the prograde symbol I get an intersect on the opposite side (roughly 180 degrees) of the solar system. It says it will take me 295 days to get there and ~1,000 DV. I thought I read it was a 70 day journey. This is day 230 in year 1.

If you perform those maneuvers, you should end up with an insertion dV much closer to what it predicts, which is 641 m/s. Also, as someone else pointed out, since Duna has an atmosphere, you could try to use it to aerobrake into your Duna orbit. That would save you a lot or even almost all of the insertion costs, but it can be a little more tricky. Definitely save/load before the first few times you try it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T02:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHohmann transfers meet the target 180 degrees away from where you start.
