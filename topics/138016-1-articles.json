For a project at university we have to build planes from steel-foil that can glide well. Now im looking at wing profiles but everything i find is about wings with a volume, thus they need at least 2 layers of steel foil to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe want to use a single layer of foil since thats lighter and way easier to build. To read about that i would need words i could google, sites about paper-planes dont help me much since those usualy have low aspect-ratio (while our plane will look more like a glider-plane).

The problem however is that for most aircraft because of the moment of inertia of air traveling around a wing, the joint between the wiing and the pressure hull of the craft (Or that which centers the pressure hull) needs to be the strongest part of the craft. So you need some structure tapering from the joint to the wind tip. To give an example, a high speed jet traveling at high altitude can be struck by a blind sheer, you have seen instances were passengers have been injured and luggage tossed from the overhead compartments, but the wings did not break off, this is because the wings are designed to withstand several g-forces during flight.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn addition, most commercial aircraft take advantage of the strength needed to store fuel in the volume of the wing. When you talk about high speed travel, the sears haack volume of the wing will be critical, since you want air to travel slightly faster over than under, but the wing itself volume should gradually increase and decrease and you do not want the boundary layer to detach (particularly from the top of the wing as this causes high-speed stall).
