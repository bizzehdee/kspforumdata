This one is altitude.\n\nIn/Out tangent I\u0027m not really sure about, but from what I understand, it is a gradient specification for either side of any point. Unity will get confused without them.\n\nFor the velCurve, it is:\n\nkey= [atmDensity] [thrustMultiplyer] [inTangent] [outTangent]\n\nThe atmosphere density is by a scale of Paskals, to make a term up. 1 is Kerbin sea level. 5.5 is unnecessary. \n\nThe thrust multiplyer in this case will decrease with thinning atmosphere, and with atmospheres of super high density. Both of the multiplyers are used the thrust calculator.\n\nThe tangents are the same here, and they are important."}]}
