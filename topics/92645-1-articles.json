Id like to be able to pick where i land on laythe/kerbin as well, but it doesnt need to be on some odd orbit, just near equator is fine (so ill need a little bit more dV then what is the bare minimum to get to laythe and return).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EId like to know the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much LF/O i should have total?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much lift coefficient i should have in total?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much intake area i should have total (or how many and what intakes)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow many and what engines i should have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow heavy should the total thing be about (including 1 ton of payload to laythe max)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much dV do i need for such a craft?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile designs that people have made already that are capable of what id like to do are appreciated, i enjoy building my own craft, so while i may borrow someone else\u0027s concept, i rarely actually use full craft made by someone else. That means, generic specs like how much fuel, what engines, how to best ascent profile, ect are what id prefer to use. Anyways, one hurdle ive come up with myself, is that for a true SSTO (no ditching anything), it is extremely difficult to get into orbit without bringing enough engine mass to just kill the vaccum dV down to below 5-6K (too low for a laythe and return without ditching parts or . While nukes are the best for interplanetary, they are heavy, and then having 1-3 extra jets is just killing the dV in space (and i actually need these engines once at laythe so even if i was willing to ditch parts, theyd have to stay). The vehicle (modified GAZ-49P) can fit inside a standard mk2 docking bay (the long version), so that also needs to be dragged into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, i run STOCK game parts and stock aerodynamics, so ill obviously be using jets to achieve orbit, then nuke for the entire rest of the trip (im rather patient so a single nuke should be ok provided the whole thing isnt above 30 tons), unless this isnt actually the best method to get to laythe and back.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-13T04:20:48Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2014 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bitslizer","CreatedById":127646,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T20:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) I think that\u0027s not the right question, should be how much DV, you need enough DV for LKO to Laythe transfer, aerocapture and chute landing for free, enough DV to carry the LF for the Laythe ascend and DV for the Laythe to Kerbin transfer (again aero capture at Kerbin for free).

For example, LKO to the altitude of Mun is 850 up, then 375 to circularize up there -- and the return is 375 up there, and 850 to circularize at LKO. The return, however, you can use the atmosphere for aerobraking. That means it\u0027s 1200 m/s to get to Mun\u0027s altitude and circularize there, and less than 400 m/s to return! For the Kerbin-Jool trip (or Kerbin-Laythe, same thing), you can aerobrake at both ends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E The Oberth effect makes a big difference. To leave Jool\u0027s orbit you\u0027d need 1500 m/s. But since you\u0027re leaving from an orbit around Jool at 27000km, you already have some speed, which you can use. And in fact, since you\u0027re in an orbit about Laythe at 55km, you\u0027ve got that much more: at the appointed time you\u0027re going around the sun at a few km/s faster than Jool is. You are also deep in their gravity wells, which you have to fight your way out of, but overall, instead of 1500 m/s you have under 1100 m/s to burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity assists can save you about 1km/s on the way up. The path is Mun, Eve, Kerbin, Kerbin again, and that last one bounces you out to Jool. It\u0027s about 1km/s to get to Eve, the rest is small corrections. It\u0027s pretty much exactly the same as how the Galileo probe got to Jupiter IRL. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80455-How-To-Go-From-Low-Kerbin-Orbit-to-Jool-Orbit-for-1051-m-s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPLAD has pulled it off for just 1011 m/s\u003C/a\u003E from LKO to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could save a few hundred on the way back from Laythe, too, by bouncing around the Joolian satellites. I think the lower bound on that is a 650 m/s return -- that\u0027s how much it costs just to get to Tylo -- but maybe you could do even better somehow with an assist off Laythe itself? Still, we\u0027re really splitting hairs at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith jets boosting you 100 m/s beyond orbital speed at Kerbin, PLAD\u0027s trajectory, aerobrake directly into Laythe, and jets providing an extra 300 m/s beyond orbital speed at Laythe for the return, you could, theoretically, make the return trip with just over 1700 m/s.

I\u0027ll probably just run a test tonight though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess how much you can get on jets depends on which mods you\u0027re using -- I always play with FAR, so you can\u0027t get as fast on Turbojets / Rapiers as you can in stock aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, it does mean that 4500 m/s is plenty to get back, and I think that you\u0027d gain very little from using any sort of gravity assists (versus the amount of work you have to put in).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPanzer, the reason why it takes less delta-V to get back is because of the Oberth effect. Laythe is moving very fast around Jool (3220 m/s), in addition you\u0027re moving very fast around Laythe (1800 m/s, though you had to pay that cost using your jet and rocket engines to get into orbit around Laythe). Combined, it means that even though you have to pay to first escape Laythe, the cost is much lower overall due to the savings from the Oberth effect.
