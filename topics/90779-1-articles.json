The centermost section is static, but mounts the bridge centrifuge and counterweight. It also holds zero-gee science labs and extra cargo space. The engineering section is replaced by the warp drive, and the warp nacelles are now propellant tanks with fusion motors attached to the end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same is true of the TOS Enterprise, except only one spinny-deck on the saucer section and a zero-gee bridge\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T02:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually I recently discussed this with a Trekkie I know and according to him the nacelles don\u0027t actually propel the ship.
