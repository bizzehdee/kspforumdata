When I return to the SPH my ship is missing parts. Sometimes I wouldn\u0027t be able to select and move parts and the part toolbar on the left would be greyed out. I\u0027ve tried a new install with all the mods added again and the same thing happened. \n\nMaybe it\u0027s the version of 0.90 I got from a link? (I updated only to realise some mods were not supported yet in 1.0.2.)\n\nLog file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ybue8oc0qaedhut/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ybue8oc0qaedhut/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nThanks for the help and advice, I appreciate your guys help!\n\n(Mods added below)\n\n![Mods.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9u9igep4ssb0jrf/Mods.jpg?dl=0)"}]}
