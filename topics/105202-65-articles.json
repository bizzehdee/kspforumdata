I only had this issue come up with the latest update to USI-LS/MKS.\n\nI did have a game in progress, and this isn\u0027t a complaint, just a curiousity.  I have a Mun mission that started prior to the HAB changes, so the craft was not setup very well for a long term mission.\n\nThe hab time was 30days and I was currently 8 days into the mission.  It properly showed that I had 22 days left on the hab.  Then I updated the mods.  When I reloaded my game and went to the ship, the crew became tourists and the hab timer showed -50d.  They haven\u0027t even been on the Mun that long.\n\nI\u0027m just curious to figure out what would have caused this?  I checked the ship in the VAB and it still shows it should be good for 30 days hab time.\n\n![0jwOWnn.png](http://i.imgur.com/0jwOWnn.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T18:57:05Z","Content":"A bug I need to sort ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T19:06:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 minutes ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A bug I need to sort ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nOk,  I\u0027m guessing it is a bug primarily for ships that were pre-existing?  Or is it something that will just rear its head randomly?\n\nI started thinking about 2 things that I realized I don\u0027t know the answer to.\n\nIf grouchiness is enabled, hence we get tourists, what is the way, if any, to counteract this for a Hab timer.  I know if they run out of food, I can slap a food container onto the ship via KIS and they will revert. Do I need to slap on some habitation?\n\nAlso, similar question for EVA timers.  If a Kerbal becomes a tourist while on EVA are you kinda screwed?  Or can they still be controlled until they re-enter a ship?  The only timer I\u0027ve run into for EVA so far is a rescue contract which I haven\u0027t gotten to the kerbals location yet so I\u0027m trying to figure out what sort of craft I need to send in this case."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T19:16:03Z","Content":"EVA they can be recontrolled till they get in.

If you want to get your kerbals home for free, just starve them out on purpose. I take supply containers and fill them up then undock them in a nearby orbit. When all the kerbals go home, i reconnect them to the station. I just sent an entire crew of 13 kerbals home for free. Seems to me if they\u0027re going to get fed up and go home, shouldn\u0027t it be based on the habitation and not the available supplies? I just had bob run back home from his ship around the moon (bob is an orange suit...) and he was -45 days on supplies but still had over 100 days on habitation.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-04T03:19:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2016 03:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by GokouZWAR**"},{"CreatedByName":"GokouZWAR","CreatedById":142307,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T03:31:17Z","Content":"I will add this just because, I think the whole \u0022wander back to the KSC\u0022 thing is really kinda dumb.
