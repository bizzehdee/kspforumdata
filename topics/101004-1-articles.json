Have yet to give it early takeoff. Slow to orbit but plenty of fuel once up there potentially.\n\nI will likely later redesign to move the weight more to the center of the engine area and make it more aerodynamic and hopefully give it early takeoff and an inline docking bay. Also, possibly, more monopropellant or xenon gas.\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=]()"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T14:32:23Z","Content":"Hi there, I thought I would pop in just to say that you have waaay too many intakes there for the number of engines. \n\n They are just adding weight. I think four per engine is more than enough. Also 700 parts? Da hell is in there?\n\nThose sleek intakes are not great for higher atmosphere. Try using the black scoop intakes. They are best. \n\n Keep refining it mate and you will have a cool looking SSTO there!"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T21:24:43Z","Content":"What is the difference between the cone intake and the Ram ones(I\u0027m assuming those are the black scoop ones) besides weight to intake ratio.

Turbojets can be ridden up to 69km before completely loosing thrust!! Takes 8-10 minutes or more though! Got a 163k apoapsis and 53k periapsis.\n\nHas more electricity, xenon, and air intakes(401max). Approx. 900 parts. A little less Oxidizer also. Weighs 76t approx. Need to get it to 66t so it\u0027s never over a 1:1 ratio with the ION engines and improve general performance for all fuel types. Have to find stuff to sacrifice. Probably the Mono propellant first.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T04:09:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 04:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela**"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T15:19:02Z","Content":"[http://www./download/w5y6uedbu4vs05n/AEIOU_NIRDm_SF_MK1(2).craft](http://www./download/w5y6uedbu4vs05n/AEIOU_NIRDm_SF_MK1%282%29.craft) Updated Version! Weighs aprox 66t without massless parts. Weighs approx 72t with massless parts.

At that point you can simply cruise up to 163 apoapsis with turbojets before circularizing with non jet based thrust. Turbojets should cruise full thrust up to atleast 60k and partial thrust up to around 69k.(NVM, just fly it like any other air hogger and it will make it to orbit.)\n\nPics: contain other stats\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=]()\n\nIs anyone good at finding ideal angles during flight for air hogs?\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egot it to an apoapsis of 193km with]()\n\n![\u003Ca  href=]()![%7Boption%7D](%7Boption%7D)http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-03-02%20132114\\_zpsgf7mopjy.png\u0027 alt=\u0027Screenshot%20from%202015-03-02%20132114\\_zpsgf7mopjy.png\u0027\u003E\n\nfuel after circularizing.
