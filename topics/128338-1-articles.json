Our turboramjets produce 87% the thrust at\u00A067% the weight, 41% the fuel consumption,\u00A074% the frontal area and 160% the top speed of their real-life competitors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr the F-35\u0027s F135 afterburning turbofan engine. While it is similar in diameter to our Panther, it develops 125 kN (dry) and 190 kN (wet), is 5.6 meters long, and weighs considerably more at 1.7 tonnes.\u00A0However, unlike our engines, it also has an ISP of 4000 seconds... dry. Probably more like 1600 wet. This all means that our afterburning engine is easily twice as efficient as it\u0027s real-life analog, even if it develops considerably lower thrust for the same diameter. Another comparison would be the F-100-PW-229 on the F-15 and F-16, which develops 79 kN dry and 130 wet, and achieves more like 4600 s ISP dry and 1600 wet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven the high-bypass jets are optimistic. Our J-90 has about the same specific impulse as the real life GE90. The primary difference is that the GE90 loses nearly half that efficiency under cruise\u00A0conditions, whereas our J-90 retains its full static sea-level efficiency at all speeds and altitudes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to sum up:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur jets have about the same TWR, similar size, and twice the fuel efficiency of their real counterparts. They are considerably OP, with our afterburners and turboramjets being comparably efficient to dry turbofans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy comparison, our rockets are massively underpowered. The KS-25 has a TWR of 25.5. A real SSME has a TWR of 67 and weighs less while developing over double the thrust, and while comparing ISP between our kerosene rockets and real H2 rockets isn\u0027t fair, the real SSME is much closer to holding the record for vacuum\u00A0engine efficiency in its category than our engine is in its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has gotten better as KSP has developed, but overall, jets are\u00A0still optimistic bordering on totally impossible ever, and liquid fuel rockets and tanks are still pessimistic bordering on laughable. (and have in fact become moreso with 1.0 lowering their ISP to normal kerosene levels).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJets are not underpowered. They are just somewhat less overpowered than they once were. If our jets were based on the same meta as our rockets, they\u0027d develop 30% their current thrust at\u00A0half their current ISP, making them almost unuseable... Like our rockets are in real solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf our rockets followed the same meta as our jets, they\u0027d have in the 600s of ISP and produce triple their current thrust, or have the same thrust, but be 1/3rd the mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-21T16:16:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2015 04:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-21T16:22:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s funny, KSP jets are overpowered compared to real life ones while KSP rocket engines are underpowered compared to real ones. *shrug* Guess we need useful SSTOs to work somehow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost people complaining that KSP jets are underpowered are comparing them to the old, pre-1.0 turbojets, which were frankly foolishly overpowered, so much so that I felt like I was cheating* when using them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E*Cheating is in the eye of the player.

RL solid core nerva rockets would be just a bit better than the O-10 monopropellant engines are in this game. The TWR, depending on the design we talk about could be much better, similar too, or worse than the LV-N. The tankage and other stuff would at least be lighter, giving us lower dry weights and better mass ratios, and thus the ability to squeeze more dV out of a stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, the kerbal system is 1/10th the size of ours, if 1 kerbal meter = 1 human meter. If we instead assume 1 kerbal meter = 10 human meters... then all of a sudden the system size is about right... but now the atmospheres are too high, and more importantly, we then must assume that the surface gravity is 10x higher.... 98 m/s/s... the Isps are then 10x higher... the LV-N gets 8,000 Isp, and has an earth relative TWR of 20.4... but in this kerbal universe where 1 kerbal meter = 10 human meters... gravity is 10x stronger than it should be (and also, kerbals are giants).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo another way to think about it is that the KS-25 actually has a 254:1 TWR, and gets 3,150 Isp... but the kerbals are stuck on an an Earth size planet with a surace gravity of 10 Gs... although there is no helping the bad tank mass ratios.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is, for the space aspect of it... the differences are so great between the systems that you can\u0027t really compare these engines to real engines. I think the engines are far from underpowered for the Kerbal system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe jets though... when only considering atmospheric flight, we can pretty much ignore kerbin\u0027s small radius (though it does become quite relevant for high speed flight with afterburning panthers, turboramjets, and rapiers... where they get going a significant % of orbital velocity)... and thus the jets are much easier to compare to real life jets... and they are indeed OP. But this is a space game, and as soon as you leave kerbin, they are useless (except if going to laythe). I guess they wanted to make airbreathing SSTOs more attractive than they are in real life (note that none have been built in real life, though there are some proposal that maybe could work).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, their Isp stats aren\u0027t so out there if you assume they run on something other than kerosene.... a jet running on liquid hyrogen will get a significantly better Isp than one running on hydrocarbons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough, they are only borderline impossible if one consideres the theoretical maximum... but I suspect there are a few things missing in that theory that explain why IRL we only get to about half the theoretical maximum\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Specific-impulse-kk-20090105.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022695\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Specific-impulse-kk-20090105.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyea... they run on the same fuel as a LV-N... so why not say that it\u0027s lH2, and thus their Isps are completely reasonable...

If you suddenly think it\u0027s actually 10 metres you get all sorts of weird results - orbital speeds become several times too fast, accelerations become extreme, and more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t believe the stock aerodynamics was strongly influences by the small size of Kerbin either. When the soup was replaced by a vague semblance of reality, the reduced delta-V to orbit was compensated for by heavily nerfing the rocket Isp - in fact I\u0027d previously run a similar nerf myself in old FAR. If I had to blame the excessive drag on anything, I\u0027d say it\u0027s that having played FAR, realistic drag is a \u003Cem\u003Enuisance\u003C/em\u003E because aeroplanes take ages to slow down for landing unless you use airbrakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T19:46:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmen to the OP.
