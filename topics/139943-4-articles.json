Leaving Kerbin is a very high treshold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is something psychological about leaving the home SOI. Early-game, you become quite attached to your little green fellows, and sending them off into the great dark takes a bit of a build-up. If you strand them on the Mun or Minmus, you can slap together a rescue mission and save them in a week or two. Returning safely home from those bodies isn\u0027t hard either. You\u0027ll usually have fuel enough to make orbit, and from there the trip back home is just a trip down Kerbin\u0027s gravity well. Hit for the center of the system, aerobrake until suborbital, release parachutes, and call the rescue chopper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing to other planets, though, means that you\u0027ll have to aim into the boundless sky, and hope you hit your target. Then follows a great timewarp, a year or more of game time may pass while you\u0027re on the way, and then you have to brake down, make orbit around the target planet, and then land. Until you\u0027ve tried, in Stock you have no way of knowing whether you\u0027ve packed enough fuel. And Kod help you if you plan to return to Kerbin. On my Duna mission, I had barely enough fuel to make a circular orbit around Duna, and I had to attempt four landings before I managed a configuration that would leave me enough fuel to rendezvous with the mother ship afterwards. And then I had to assemble a rescue craft to get the trio of astronauts home again. That craft was basically just a Hitchhiker with a drive section, and after assembly and refuelling in orbit it had enough dV to get to Duna (after another great timewarp to optimize transfer windows), rendezvous with the stranded ship in Duna orbit, timewarp again, and then bring the astronauts back to Kerbin orbit. Then I had to send up another craft to land the Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, my great mission required orbital assembly of two craft, several failures, hours of game time, and while I had built the aforementioned elaborate Kerbin, Mun and Minmus stations within the first year and a half of game time, the Duna mission pushed the game clock to somewhere around mid-year-5. I had spent all of two minutes on Duna\u0027s surface, collecting a few hundred points of Science, planting a flag, then packing up and leaving. A tremendous effort compared to what I got out of it, and compared to how quickly I had proceeded in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, this felt like I had wasted four in-game years on a single mission. Like my Space Center had been sitting there useless, collecting dust while I was away. That\u0027s when I decided to install some mods, to at least make interplanetary travel easier. Or maybe to just get more stuff to do in Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it stands, I think we need more reasons to get to the outer planets, and/or skipping stones to go there. I feel colonization could be a step in both the right directions, as it\u0027d be a less daunting task to launch a Duna mission from, say, shipyards on Minmus. And with a base down on Duna, Dres isn\u0027t that far away. You\u0027d get a reason to bring Kerbals to other planets, you\u0027d get more transfer windows (Kerbin -\u0026gt; Jool, Duna -\u0026gt; Jool and Dres -\u0026gt; Jool would rarely overlap, and it\u0027d be a simple matter of picking what planet you wanted to launch from), and since ship construction on other planets would be vastly more expensive than on Kerbin (at least, at first?) you\u0027d find a good use for those Funds that keep heaping up. Is upgrading the Tracking Station to level 3 a matter of pocket money? Try levelling up the Vall shipyard, then reconsider the state of your wallet. Alas, this requires work so extensive that hasn\u0027t even been done with mods. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s even theoretically possible. Maybe Squad will address the issue one day? For the majority of the player base, I dare say it\u0027s way more important than adding new planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in the mean time,Kerbin\u0027s SOI acts as the lone safe island in a giant ocean. It\u0027s the only planet to ever be \u0022home\u0022, and if you want your Kerbals to ever return, you have to construct craft capable of both reaching the target and get back home, which is very difficult with the few tools and limited readouts Stock provides you with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T15:05:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took me about 100 hours and the installation of MechJeb to finally go interplanetary (I sent a Venera-style probe to Eve). It took me a bit longer to realize that MechJeb had a bunch of autopilot features other than the manoeuvre planner, and consequently to learn how to dock and how to do a proper gravity turn. But since then I\u0027ve had no difficulties at all going interplanetary, and I love to make increasingly large MMSEVs (Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicles) for going just about everywhere. It\u0027s incredibly challenging to learn how to go interplanetary in stock\u00A0(or at least it used to be, I imagine the in-game wiki now helps) but once you know what you\u0027re doing it becomes very easy.

I spend so much effort building these missions that I don\u0027t get to spend as much time in flight, where things really get interesting. Sure, I love designing, but at some point it starts to feel like a chore designing complicated missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027ve never been further out past Duna, and in the opposite direction, I\u0027ve only done Moho unmanned flybys, so I still have a intimidating amount of stuff to learn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy biggest thing is not wanting to have to cheat, or send rescue missions. This is my basis for a lot of things, and it causes me to spend as much time in the VAB as I do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222586977\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139943\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463503262\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002297503\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022luizopiloto\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, luizopiloto said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am pretty sure 100% of KSP player base never gone interplanetary...
