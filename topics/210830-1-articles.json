I would also like to discuss how challenges for KSP 1 will have changed in KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 1 challenge changes:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrand Tour - So, the first challenge I see changing is the Grand Tour challenge. It\u0027s going to be super easy now thanks to metallic hydrogen and fusion drive engines. The power of them will allow for some really cut down world record times. Combine that with Interstellar ships built via Orbital Construction, and you got a ship that can visit everywhere no problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorld Land Speed Record - Atmospheric MH engines are going to take the current record to new heights. It will also probably make it a lot harder since no doubt MH engines will allow you to reach solar system escape velocity and throw your craft off the ground in seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMun Run - I mean, MH engines, what else is there to say. MH is going to break everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 2 challenges:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nColony Grand Tour - Like the regular Grand Tour, but instead of planting a flag, you have to place down a colony as well as put an orbiting colony around every planet. (Yes, that means every terrestrial planet will have 2, 1 orbital, 1 landed.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGalactic Grand Tour - Visiting every body, every solar system, and planting a flag on every terrestrial body\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGalactic Colony Grand Tour - Like Colony Grand Tour, but with every body in every star system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeb Deb World Speed Record - This comes in two flavors: Flyby and Orbiting\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Flyby: Simple, you just have to flyby the system INSIDE the sphere of influence for Deb Deb, even if it\u0027s the outer most point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Flyby Hard mode: You have to flyby Ded Deb the star, not the system. You have to be within the inner most planet\u0027s orbit for it to count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---Flyby Super Hard Mode: You have to flyby Deb Deb the star so close that you see the steel on your craft starting to boil. (You have to have your temperature reading warning going off.) Deadalus engine should serve as a good heat shield. I mean, it practically deals with the temperatures of star anyway, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Orbital: You actually have to get into an orbit of Deb Deb, any orbital altitude will do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Orbital Hard Model: Your orbit has to be within the inner most planet\u0027s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Orbital Super Hard mode: You have to get into an orbit of a planet within the Deb Deb system, or you have to orbit so close to the star that your temperature warnings go off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLightspeed Colony - Build an orbital colony ship and get it up to light speed as quick as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLightspeed World Record Time - Get up to lightspeed as quick as possible. (Or at least 99% of it)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTallest Colony Challenge - Build the tallest colony you can without anything toppling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-27T13:14:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2022 01:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by GoldForest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-27T20:50:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome excellent ideas.
