The parachutes seem to be slowing your craft down, but not anywhere near as much as they should.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy best recommendation is to re-install KSP from scratch. I suspect this may have happened when you updated a previous installation. Keep your save files and your craft files, but get rid of everything else and put your saves and crafts into a new KSP install. That should fix the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-28T02:09:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2016 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T17:40:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, if you are using a shortcut to KSP your Physics.cfg and Partdatabase files may not be loaded, please try the KSP.exe directly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you unzipped KSP to Program Files it may be unable to write those files, please unzip KSP to C:\\Games instead and run it from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf these don\u0027t work you may have a corrupt Physics.cfg or PartDatabase.cfg, deleting these will cause KSP to make new ones, this should solve your issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Emirhan","CreatedById":165957,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T10:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you very much.
