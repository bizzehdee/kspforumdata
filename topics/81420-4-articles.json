How are you going to repair your vehicle if it breaks in the middle of nowhere?\u003Cp\u003ETake for example this passage from the Transglobe Expedition, a real life North/South circumnavigation of the earth, where they explain what took to cross the Sahara desert by land:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E - For crossing the Sahara still has its problems; however many people do it and however often, the heat does not get less, the sandstorms do not diminish in ferocity and frequency, and crossing national boundaries becomes more difficult, not easier. Moreover, Ran and his team were forced by the demands of their scientific programme to stray frequently from the beaten track, and even the Landrovers (for whose performance they are full of praise) occasionally bogged axle-deep in the sand. Unloading to lighten them, digging and towing them out and then re-loading them in temperatures often well over 100 degrees Farenheit (38\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C) could not have been amusing. - \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.transglobe-expedition.org/images/expedition/globe.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.transglobe-expedition.org/images/expedition/globe.gif\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink to the expedition website: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.transglobe-expedition.org/page/the-expedition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.transglobe-expedition.org/page/the-expedition\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took four months to cross the Sahara. It took a year and a half to cross the South Pole! Mind yourself without life support in that enviroment for that period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA journey like this in real life is dependant on stored food and water, medicines, instruments, tools to repair your vehicles, so I think using life support mods in KSP for a circumnavigation challenge is a good idea if you want to make it harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair points. In that case you could argue to install the random break downs mod as well. You would have to pack all the spare toolkits as well, and since the journey time is massive, you would have lots of break downs and repair stops....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoPanShabuShabu","CreatedById":91327,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T21:24:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wooks\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wooks\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow much time it took to do the actual circumnavigation?

The total game time between the landing and reaching the start again was 26 days (24 hr Earth days.) My time was about 23 days, I guess something like 4 hours a day. Most of the time I was trying to stick to relatively low lying and not so steep terrain, so it wasn\u0027t too buggy. By far the worst terrain to drive on was at the poles, that\u0027s a morass of buggy terrain. Total distance covered was over 7,000km, which was counting up flag-to-flag distances as the crow flies, so it was actually somewhat longer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CG_Kerbin","CreatedById":117777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T21:43:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wooks\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wooks\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u00C3\u00A0\u00C2\u00B2\u00C2\u00A0_\u00C3\u00A0\u00C2\u00B2\u00C2\u00A0 \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFFFFF;\u0022\u003Ehahaha, I\u0027m not really mad\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E?...?...?...?
