From those images, all I see them saying is \u0022like a kid\u0022 and \u0022Maybe he is only a child\u0022 and the rest of the time they\u0027re just trying to play the game. I mean if you\u0027re threatening to KILL yourself because you were called a kid I can\u0027t imagine how you\u0027d react to serious bullying, and yet it seems you have experienced serious bullying as well as you mentioned up the top. I\u0027d like to see what was said leading up to that, but as far as I can see, they say the tiniest thing and then you go on about stabbing yourself in the head in a VLOG. It all sounds like a severe overreaction and honestly childish, and it doesn\u0027t seem all that surprising to hear them say \u0022maybe he is only a child\u0022. They obviously didn\u0027t see it as a serious threat of killing yourself and we can see it wasn\u0027t. Seriously, I don\u0027t see a lot of malice coming from them, just irritation at your antics, it just seems like you\u0027re trying to get attention and sympathy for your condition in an innapropriate context, and while I can understand that it is hard going through depression (I have been through it but not to the point where I was seriously considering suicide), bringing it into a game with strangers is completely inappropriate. You need to get some therapy, that is a healthy way to deal with depression, and while it won\u0027t solve your problems right away or anything it will certainly help you cope a bit better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if their intentions were actually simply cruel and malicious without basis.

Sometimes people insult people and they don\u0027t mean anything particularly serious by it and even if they do, reacting to it in such an extreme way is not the way to deal with it. Ignore it and if they meant it they\u0027ll not get the reaction they want and if they didn\u0027t mean to hurt you then there\u0027s no harm done. If they keep it up, you can ask them to stop, but don\u0027t be crazy and reactionary about it, just explain why you have a problem with what they\u0027re doing. If they still refuse to treat with you with a basic level of respect, just don\u0027t talk to them.

Not in bullying others, but in laughing. After all, being able to laugh at yourself is an important life skill! So when someone calls you names and starts laughing, laugh with them. Eventually it starts actually being funny. It also helps to not come across as attention seeking. You didn\u0027t intend to sound that way, but that\u0027s how it sounded to them. Instead of \u0022im depressed thats not helping\u0022 try \u0022thats mean.\u0022 It accomplishes the same thing without making you sound like you\u0027re trying to emotionally blackmail them. You don\u0027t know those guys, right? This is the internet. They don\u0027t know or care about your problems, and the guy was right about one thing: everyone has problems.

I\u0027ve been fortunate enough that my brushes with depression have been relatively mild and eventually went away on their own, but they gave me enough of a glimpse to know that it isn\u0027t something to be messed around with. Intellectually, I knew I wasn\u0027t really depressed enough to stay that way for long. But emotionally I was terrified that I would get stuck that way and maybe eventually do something I wouldn\u0027t get a chance to regret. So I spoke to my GI CNP (Not even close to her field), and just the act of talking about it with a professional I trusted was very reassuring. I was still scared, but not as much, and it felt like I\u0027d had this tension in my chest that just suddenly got much better. Like when you\u0027re on the verge of tears, and then you have a good cry, and suddenly you realize you feel better. Except I didn\u0027t have to cry, which is always good for one\u0027s self image!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo go to someone you trust.

I KNEW my CNP would find something to help me. She already had dozens of times with other of my pesky problems. Find someone like that and talk.
