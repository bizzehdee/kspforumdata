Couldn\u0027t sleep. Did the only sensible thing - downloaded a new planet mod and launched a completely impromptu mission. I used an old saved craft that once served on a rescue mission to Duna. Made a couple minor changes by removing the service bay and adding RCS. Once in orbit, discovered the transfer window was in 34 days. Raised the orbit to 620 and warped. Escape trajectory grazed the SOI of Mun which made an expensive correction burn necessary. I had plenty of DV until things went horribly wrong. Entered Arkas SOI. Set the Pe to 24k (without researching) to aerobrake. Hit the atmosphere at over 3k with no heatshield. My fuel tank was glowing red - kind of cool. Fired the 6 Twitch engines trying to circularize. The atmosphere was thick enough that not only did I get a capture but I was going in for a landing straight from Kerbin before I realized. Eeeek! Panicked. Kicked MJ on and hit land anywhere. Realized I forgot to retract the single solar panel on the ship. It started to fold up but got destroyed. Parachutes didn\u0027t want to deploy once the speed was below 200 m/s. Manually right click deployed them. Not sure if it was the panic, MJ, or a glitch in the planet pack, but most of my remaining fuel was used in the last few thousand meters. The ship seemed to be hovering while the speed readout was all over the place. I finally killed MJ and let her coast in, burning at the last few meters to slow down. Good landing. Flag planted. Chutes repacked. Unfortunately power is exhausted due to not being able to surface fix the solar panel. Doesn\u0027t matter. There is insufficient fuel for a return voyage. The crew named the site Hell Hole. Sure it is kind of pretty but its hot, dry, and unless help comes, no one is getting out alive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hSTLnlK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hSTLnlK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I may \u0027fix\u0027 the solar panel in the sfs file, then use what fuel I have to see what it takes to get to orbit.

At first, I thought I didn\u0027t stand a chance - the B-17 was progressing faster away than I could, despite being much more nimble. One of the shots tore the entire tail section off and caused an infinite explosion, but it kept going on. I was chasing it for as long as i could, bearing with the lag caused by the infinite explosion. It lasted around 30 minutes (not kidding,) but the aircraft endured without a tail. From where I was in the cockpit, eventually, I caught up to it, and yet it wouldn\u0027t succumb. Even with edges of wings bending and cockpit collapsing on itself, it kept on. Eventually, the aircraft seemed to be spewing out destruction effects, and it yawed so hard left that I had to slow down and yaw myself.. into a dive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft was already stricken, seeming to explode repeatedly, and my firing continued until I watched it come down into the sea.
