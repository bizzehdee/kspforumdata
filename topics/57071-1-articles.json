The biggest thing to remember is where the toggle for SAS is (T). Turn it on during launch to stabilize your flight. You can still make adjustments with it turned on with the key controls. Now letting go of the key will let the ship stay where you put it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo avoid losing orientation pay more attention to the nav-ball on the bottom rather than your camera view.
