I guess I took it out of the list when ores were added by squad.  \n\nSo i just tried it for an hour, very very cool mod but I didn\u0027t see a way to list experiments and science to gather. Just a lot of options to make cool maps, mostly to locate ressources.\n\nSo assuming that I didn\u0027t miss anything, I though it could make sense to use your mod to have the list of things to do and places to visit and actually still need to deploy satellites and scan celestial bodies via ScanSat to know where the biomes are, instead of trying to find them blindly.\n\nWould all of this make sense ?"},{"CreatedByName":"strudo76","CreatedById":175831,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-09T02:09:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/7/2017 at 6:57 AM, Z-Key Aerospace said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you don\u0027t have either window open no checks should take place.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I generally run without any science mods, just the stock experiments, and I don\u0027t really get any slow down on an Intel i3.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - How many experiments have you unlocked?\n\u003E - How would you describe your total launched part count?\n\u003E - What sort of box are you running on?\n\u003E - How many bodies have you visited?\n\u003E - Do you have any science mods (DMagic) or non stock bodies (Kopernicus) or just a massive number of parts?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Try turning off the debris check and the \u0022All\u0022 filter button.

For example, during transmission of science or changing biomes.\n\nHave thermometer, presure, mystery goo and command pod (crew report and EVA) on board. Part count is 20, as I have multiple goo and batteries on board.\n\nCurrently running i7-7700, 16G ram, HD 7870.\n\nThis is on first first ever, as I only set this game up to determine which mods are causing my stutter, so not visited any bodies other than Kerbin\n\nCheck debris is not enabled.\n\nOriginally I had a game with quite a few mods and the stutter was quite bad, so my aim is to determine which mods are contributing, and to help reduce the problem. Let me know if there is anything I can provide to help. Here\u0027s a [log file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2sHqPR8HJsYYll3SzhqQTZ6Ync) from my 1.3 game with only this and KSP\\_AVC installed. Basically started a new career game, unlocked a few of techs, built a ship and launched to, doing science along the way. It seems the stutter is mostly when transmitting as the status text is scrolling on the screen, though that could just be coincidence.\n\nHope this is useful to someone"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-09T03:52:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/4/2017 at 8:24 AM, Z-Key Aerospace said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The sounding rockets were restricted to Kerbin after discussions on this thread.\n\u003E \n\nKerbin, or HomePlanet?"}]}
