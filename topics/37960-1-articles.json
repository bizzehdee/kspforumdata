I have tried stock crafts on an install of KSP with no mods, and so far I have gotten the Aeris 4A into orbit (once, with not enough fuel to return back). I have been trying to get my own SSTO into orbit and it seems I am having troubles. I seem to feel like I don\u0027t know when to throttle down to avoid flame outs. I always thought it was around .10 but sometimes its a bit higher like at .13 - .15. If I don\u0027t flame out and flip all over the place my nose seems to start to point down as I get higher and I have no control over it even when I throttle down or use RCS. I have also tried some of the SSTOs from the B9 Aerospace Pack on my install with mods, I am very stable but run out of fuel too fast.

Have you adjusted your CoM and CoL? Looking at your design, I\u0027d guess that your CoM is probably just behind your CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T21:59:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI spent most of today trying to make an SSTO and only just now succeeded.

In this, he does a great job of telling you the performance you need to have and the ascent profile. Without those 2 things (plus of course a reasonably stable design), you\u0027ll never get there.

You need to switch from jets to rocket when your intake air gets down to 0.10 (keep the Resources tab open so you\u0027ll know when that happens). and for that to happen at 20km or higher, you need beaucoup air scoops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of repetitive trial and error getting all these ducks in a row.

Then a short spurt of the rocket circularizes; that part is about 30 m/s. If you build your jet to go fast, you can go 2500 m/s orbital speed. Just 1km/s at just 20km is pretty minimal -- 1 km/s is where turbojets are the most efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERough guidelines: when you\u0027ve built your plane, you should have about\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 intake per tonne\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 engine per 15 tonnes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Mk2 fuselage per engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 small control surface per tonne, or 1 wing connector for every 2 tonnes, or 1 swept wing for every 3 tonnes (mix and match)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith more wingspan and fuel you can ease up on engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
