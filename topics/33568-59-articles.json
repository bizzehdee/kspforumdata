This would take the selected ground station and compute its angle from the horizon. Positive is above the horizon, negative below.

Indeed they act as if slaved to a target (single craft or planetary body), staying oriented with it at all times. The original author of RT (JDP) let me know there was code in the original version to implement the orientation of the craft too, so it had to be actually rotated towards the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arrowstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arrowstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m still not sure I understand exactly what\u0027s going on with the antenna in RT.

Unless you can think of how the existing MA infrastructure could be used to solve this problem?
