The devs need money. Few people ever complains about star citizen with all their ship selling, yet their devs burn through the money too quick. There is no ship DLC, skins do not matter. The expansions are good, as usually devs would not make big updates to games that have been released a year or more ago because it would be too expensive. This is nothing like EA DLC. The first planned DLC is walking around stations and ships, which is quite a big addition to the game. Then, we will get planetary landings, with vehicles and aliens, which is a massive addition. None of that would be possible without selling the expansions for money. And I have never seen any threads against FD with constructive criticism blocked.
