In reality the S0 Truss isn\u0027t docked to anything, it was mounted to Destiny using four struts. I\u0027ve seen some people use a CBM on the bottom of the S0 Truss and dock it to the top of Unity but that won\u0027t work since that\u0027s where the Z1 Truss, which will be added, needs to go. Since the mod, and KSP, has limitations I found the best thing to do was slap a stock radial attachment port (whatever it\u0027s called, the \u0027dead\u0027 docking port) and put some kind of docking port (I used the ISS Truss ones) to dock the S0 to the top of Destiny, close to where Unity is so that S0 hovers kind of over where they dock together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yogui87","CreatedById":23865,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T14:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere a IVA for the cupola:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjlStq9Kcz4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arubian","CreatedById":71114,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T15:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBro that looks awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arubian","CreatedById":71114,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T16:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Good_Apollo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecan you get me a screen shot of this setup?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-29T16:45:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2013 04:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Arubian\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WCOLE360","CreatedById":57227,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T16:44:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks amazing yogui, what\u0027s your next part?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anthony Frushour","CreatedById":68365,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T17:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking great yogui!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T18:14:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry for not posting in here sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a bunch of high-detail reference shots of the Dream Chaser a while back, and after a couple of days trying to rework in the rough model I had in progress I decided that it wasn\u0027t going to work (the shape of those squared parts on the sides that flow back into the winglet edge are tricky) so I started over on a new model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I have also been supremely busy in real life (which you might have noticed by how long an NP update took, as well as the lack of Shuttle Mod updates) so I haven\u0027t gotten very far, and I am still struggling at doing a reproduction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a screencap of the old model I scrapped (before I tried to rework it against the source material) and the new one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9sym1kE.png\u0022 alt=\u00229sym1kE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ll get an acceptable model done that could be textured.
