The pipes leading down to the nozzle carry cryogenic temperature fuel. This flows though the nozzle cooling it and heating the fuel. This Heating expands the fuel creating pressure and reducing the load on the fuel pumps to pressurise the fuel for injection into the combustion chamber. Oxidiser is usually too volatile to heat this way and can eat away pipes when heated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see a helium cooling system or something for other parts though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T09:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo put physicless parts on an SRB is a stock, efficient way to prevent overheating.

I don\u0027t understand why this idea doesn\u0027t get a better response from the community as its a great way to add a bit more functionality to our game. Creating tanks that would require Ammonia or Nitrogen to maintain temps, would be another good way to make base maintenance a must. if you had storage tanks that required a compressed coolant, then as soon as they ran out, temps would rise and eventually destroy the tanks. It would also add some complexity to specialized engines or generators. Like the current system with some Nuclear power plants, as soon as they reach meltdown temps, due to inadequate cooling, they shut down. Would be much much better if they exploded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake it or leave it, its a mandatory issue for the more \u0022sim\u0022 side of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T19:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ArkaelDren\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ArkaelDren\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Like the current system with some Nuclear power plants, as soon as they reach meltdown temps, due to inadequate cooling, they shut down.

We can try to jack up heat generation and then use a deadly-reentry style resources and parts that will use it up for cooling heat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I wonder how to get that to work along with Deadly reentry itself.

I am clueless to any type of Modeling or plugin work. As far as that goes, I\u0027m completely useless with Mod creation. This concept needs a couple people that know what they are doing, to pick this up and get it going. Sure would add an aspect to the game we don\u0027t currently have yet. Far as I know, it has not been discussed or worked on since Interstellar was in active development. But I don\u0027t think it ever came to fruition, due to the scale of ideas and complexity of the project. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could start out relatively small, with a few tanks, engines and reactors using current resources. Coolant systems would require a certain amount of pressure to maintain circulation. So the system would require fuel powered compressor\u0027s(not electric), that used resources to maintain that pressure. If the compressor ran out of fuel, it would stop circulating coolant, then the temps would go critical loosing the entire containment tank, maybe taking the attached part with it. We could have a class of reactor that could not be maintained with heat ex-changer type radiators, but would require the same compressor part/module with the same results as the containment tanks, resulting in reactor meltdown. Same concept with a propulsion, requiring specialized cooling systems. The gas used to maintain the temps could have a shelf life. This would require maintenance even if you kept a watchful eye on compressor fuel levels. Maybe include a lubricant, manufactured by one of the refinery\u0027s/fabrication modules from MKS/OKS, that would be consumed over time. Shelf life is a bad term for this, but you get the point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of good ideas that could add some more complexity to the game. I wish I had the skills to develop this idea, but I don\u0027t. But you guys do.... sorry if this reads badly, I\u0027m tired and hitting the sack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
