Satellites are a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Requiem762","CreatedById":82185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T17:06:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes a lot of fuel and a working version of mapsat, good luck on that one. But seriously if someone knows of a up to date version could you point me in that direction\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brapness","CreatedById":73986,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T19:06:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn principle yes, but I recall mapsat causing ferocious lag at low altitudes, so it may not be practical. It would also be much slower than launching a satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T21:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
