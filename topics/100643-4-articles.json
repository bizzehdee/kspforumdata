And I will provide because this mod can be great as it is ingenious!\n\nOne simple; Add Ckan Capability \n\nFirst of all. Improve the info page. It\u2019s hard to read and even harder to figure out what this mod actually does. (example good info page ,Dtobi, [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/58338-104-smart-parts-v166-dds-textures-and-bug-fixes-july-5/](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/58338-104-smart-parts-v166-dds-textures-and-bug-fixes-july-5/) ).  \n\nMake a base Parts list, and use Reviewers video for even more exposure ([KottabosGames](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5o-k3dsAL9o3K1pK6KShPw):[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF9PHQBV-L8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF9PHQBV-L8).)\n\nSecond:\n\nI had your mod installed. but don\u2019t have it anymore because of the incoherent parts it add. \n\nwhat I mean with this is. This mod are actually 3 standalone mod. but you can\u2019t download it that why and each cluster is undervalued that way.\n\nI would love to see this mod been split  up in 3 major and 1or 2 minor\n\n1. Interior and Exterior parts.\n    - I would say this is one of the most innovative mods I have seen. To actual use a INT \u0026 EXT. genius, just a mod that add this and only this would get much more love solo than in this cluster.\n    - Solo, this can be expanded not to depend on Tweakscale for other sizes than the mk1. Best is of course to have each basic part be able to scale up/down (like producenal fairing bases). And add part for different length (with a max lenght)\n    - There still doesn\u2019t have to be a 1000 part. By utilizing  the Interstellar switch instead. Since Tweascale change gameplay a lot while Switch uses the same textures/parts for different \u201Cfuels\u201D. (moste have switch already because of dependency\u2019s)\n    - Interior/Exterior, kerbal tubes/cargo bay  \n\nI\u2019m still looking for a fueltank/ crago bay that can fit around my tubes for when constructing bases. (using connected living spaces, so a normal tank blocks access)\n    - MOSTE INPORTANT!:  \n\nIF it\u2019s possible let the Exteriors (with working decouples) be connected with normal parts. This would greatly decrease the part count. While retaining its use (sliding an exterior around a regular \u201Cfuel tank/etc\u201D)\n2. Cargo Bays\n    - Beautiful. Again the ingenious way of sliding. Release it Solo like it is and the love will come. (for int/ext cargo bays, incude that in Above mod).\n    - Better don\u2019t rely on Tweakscale. add even more size, better jet add a sizing option like in producenal fairing bases.\n3. Nuclear engines:  \n\nSimple stand alone, just a other engine mod. For those who want the engines.\n4. Minor part addition  \n\nFor the part that don\u2019t fit in the other clusters and are still very usefull and great.\n    - Service module\n    - Mk1/Mk3 inline command pod\n    - Mk1/Mk3 Modular adaptor (since stock dont have/very bad)  \n\n-volt  \n\n-Decoupler  \n\n-Service module\n    - Inline misetry Goo\n    - Inline landing legs!\n    - Separator\n    - LK???\n\nI hope that some of these will help you and i would love to be abel to utlize the ingiunus INT/EXT \u0026 cargo bays some day and the Minor parts (im not a fan of all the engine mods \u0026 realy dont like tweakscale)\n\nYours Sincerely\n\nHeineken.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-15T09:46:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2015 09:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Heineken**"},{"CreatedByName":"blacsky33","CreatedById":129435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T14:02:56Z","Content":"@tater, thx for picture, it\u0027s exactly the same thing that i do. nice.\n\n@Heineken , thx for feedback, it\u0027s hard to keep straight ,maybe i should refocus myself on the core idea of the mod and see what i can do to simplify all this."},{"CreatedByName":"blacsky33","CreatedById":129435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-16T01:06:37Z","Content":"![aAiCx9j.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/aAiCx9j.jpg)\n\nI have done some work today on octo-can style, with some modularity. here u can see 3 differents ring-module = top:servicebay-cargo mid:halfsizefueltank bot:sturctureframe.\n\nI made a internal fueltank for 2\u00263 modules."},{"CreatedByName":"blacsky33","CreatedById":129435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T01:44:03Z","Content":"![z4PGTo5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/z4PGTo5.jpg)\n\nhere 2 modules (2attach point each) : first is my original design for fuel tank , second cargo to fit legs."},{"CreatedByName":"blacsky33","CreatedById":129435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T19:44:57Z","Content":"![AFAdYEJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AFAdYEJ.jpg)\n\nMBI inex octo lander:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/0jxjvnk5a5pc8vl/MBI-inex-octo lander.rar?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0jxjvnk5a5pc8vl/MBI-inex-octo%20lander.rar?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T01:54:20Z","Content":"Aww...

cleanly (probably because 1.05 enforces concave colliders, i believe), but instead trigger a collision explosion and often a visit from the Kraken. even setting decouple force to 0 still results in the External Tank shooting off at a crazy angle, knocking the part attached to the internal tank into a spin. if a 1.25m  (or smaller) engine is attached to the Internal Tank, it is usually destroyed in the process.\n\nEDIT: just tested the OctoLander and RingLander Internal and External tanks, all of which separate perfectly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-17T19:27:02Z\u0022
