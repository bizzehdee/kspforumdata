If a giant mirror was placed one light year away from us and with a giant telescope we looked at that mirror. What would you see?

Light intensity falls off with the square of the distance. There\u0027s really not a lot of light left of us after traveling for two light years. And if we have a magical amplifier that can beef up that light that came back to us (more about that later), it would likely be drowned out by light from stars (\u003Cem\u003Edirect\u003C/em\u003E light) in the vicinity that is many magnitudes stronger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s the problem of \u003Cem\u003Eaiming\u003C/em\u003E the mirror. It\u0027s late and I\u0027m not in the mood to do the math, but given the distance I assume the alignment of the mirror only needs to be off by 0.0001\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (and probably far less) and your reflected image will miss you by a couple of thousand miles, if not more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen of course there\u0027s also the implicit assumption, following the above, that the mirror is perfectly \u003Cem\u003Eflat\u003C/em\u003E (everything, in reality, is \u0022bumpy\u0022--we just don\u0027t notice it). Of course we can aim for \u0022perfectly flat\u0022 but if, given the distance, we\u0027re talking about being flat on an atomic scale it\u0027s going to be a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, even as a theoretical exercise there are many roadblocks to be navigated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T22:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea the parameters needed to achieve such a thing are purely fantasy, but I\u0027d be lying if I said it didn\u0027t get my head turning.
