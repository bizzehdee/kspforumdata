Fuel Panel allows you to easily transfer resources from tank to tank, allowing movement from multiple tanks and to multiple tanks. The transfers are persistent, and run constantly. The fuel panel also separates tanks out by vessel, even while docked, and resources can be transferred out of or into all the tanks for a specific resource at one time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, if you have KAS, the standard KAS winch hooks can be used for fuel transfer purposes, even without switching them to docked mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload Link: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/v-f-m-fuel-panel/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/v-f-m-fuel-panel/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pina_coladas","CreatedById":9346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T02:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you seen the TAC fuel balancer mod?
