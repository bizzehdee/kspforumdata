After doing my first mission to Gilly in a while, I realized how much time it takes to warp around to the daylight side of Gilly. So, I would like to see the maximum warp rate near Gilly increased to compensate for low orbital speeds. (I know that the WNTS list says not to suggest higher warp rates, but I think that\u0027s for the overall maximums, not specific instances.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T11:01:04Z","Content":"Right, I think that this thread kind of got lost in the mania about aerodynamics, so now that the debates have died down a bit I\u0027m going to bump it and see if anyone notices it this time."},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T11:28:47Z","Content":"The same thing for all waiting long times in an orbit:\n\nGo back to space center, open tracking station, warp until you are where you need"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:40:54Z","Content":"Waiting for your ship to be tugged around a body by gravity is extremely important when orbiting a very massive body, as you\u0027d need tremendous amounts of fuel to defy gravity the whole way everywhere. But when you\u0027re near a lightweight body, you just need to stop thinking with your orbital brain and start using your space docking brain. You want to get somewhere? Point your ship that way and run the engines for a few seconds. Then turn around and thrust the other way when you arrive.\n\nThere\u0027s no reason to wait for Gilly\u0027s pathetic gravity to tug you around. I often use extra fuel for faster transits around Minmus, and I pretty much only use Gilly\u0027s gravity to tug my ship the last few meters on landing, just so that I don\u0027t bounce off again. Gilly is one of the few bodies in which I\u0027ll use RCS to make my ship come down faster so I can hurry up and land!\n\n==========\n\nI do feel that max warp speeds need a look. I feel LKO right outside of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere should allow 100x. Many bodies force you down to a very low time warp when you\u0027re pretty high above the surface. Those mid-level time warp values aren\u0027t really the issue, it\u0027s when you come screaming in at 10,000x time warp that you can miss the surface entirely.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T20:44:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness**"}]}
