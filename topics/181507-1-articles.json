Their ratings would now include info not found in publicly available financial statements, hopefully increasing the accuracy of the assessment. Of course, the relationship began to look somewhat incestuous - around 2007, Moody\u2019s rating staff\u00A0were rating complex derivative securities specifically designed by Moody\u2019s advisory staff to get a high Moody\u2019s rating.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBut ultimately, the biggest generator of demand for ratings under that model are financial regulators outsourcing their regulatory function. Under Glass-Steagall the Fed began turning the ratings agencies into gatekeepers: you need a non-junk rating from one of a very short list\u00A0of NSRSOs in order for your securities to be at all\u00A0allowed in portfolios of pension funds, and other orgs that marshall a lot of investment from individuals. ESMA does the same, back here CBR does the same, even though between roughly March and December of 2016 there was only one accredited agency...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAMA, I\u2019ve written my\u00A0postgrad thesis on that industry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, out of likes today, but:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your analysis.
