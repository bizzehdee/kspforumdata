The latest one has me flying quite far past the south pole. I\u0027m using mechjeb and when I pass the south pole my 180 degree heading in mechjeb needs to change to 360. Other than watch and wait for it, how else is that handled... maybe not flying over the pole?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, in regards to the south pole, I tried landing right on the pole. When I pass the engines cut out temporarily. I was flying at about 40m (land was 30m) and when I hit the pole the jet exploded. I wasn\u0027t flying quickly or anything and if the engines just cut out I should have been able to glide to a landing...

I travel 180 degrees (south) and once I hit the pole 180 degrees changes to 000 (north). Problem is MechJeb doesn\u0027t realize it changed so it trys turning around to 180.
