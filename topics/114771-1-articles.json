Sometimes it only takes a minute or three to get to orbit, and sometimes it takes waay longer. I\u0027ve noticed that sometimes the thrust on the RAPIER engines I\u0027m using is way low. Some ascents I get 200 thrust right out of the gate, and I push the speed of sound the entire way up. Other ascents, the thrust never goes over 100, and gradually dwindles as the flight goes on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else experienced this inconsistent performance, and is there any way to make it not happen?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T15:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour flight profile matters a lot. Are you getting this difference in performance while flying the same profile?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAPIER engines have more thrust at super-sonic speeds, so if you try to climb too early or too hard, they\u0027ll never cross that threshold and really start pushing. This was a huge part of why I couldn\u0027t get an SSTO working at first, I was pushing it into too steep of a climb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Dwarf","CreatedById":67709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T15:50:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027ve noticed that the ascent counts for a lot, but it seems more random than not. Some of my best ascents pushed 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and I was getting mach affects.

Doing that made all the difference for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T19:14:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERed Dwarf,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The thrust of the RAPIER is dependant on airspeed and air density. If you\u0027re not maintaining the same speed, you\u0027re not going to generate the same thrust, so you\u0027re going to fall behind more. This is aggravated by climbing, where the air is thinner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you\u0027re not going as fast as you should be, you have to fix it by arresting your climb until you\u0027re back on track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I don\u0027t use fixed angles for my climb, I instead shoot for airspeed/altitude benchmarks.
