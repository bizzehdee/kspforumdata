Sometimes it only takes a minute or three to get to orbit, and sometimes it takes waay longer. I\u0027ve noticed that sometimes the thrust on the RAPIER engines I\u0027m using is way low. Some ascents I get 200 thrust right out of the gate, and I push the speed of sound the entire way up. Other ascents, the thrust never goes over 100, and gradually dwindles as the flight goes on. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this inconsistent performance, and is there any way to make it not happen?"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T15:47:29Z","Content":"Your flight profile matters a lot. Are you getting this difference in performance while flying the same profile?\n\nRAPIER engines have more thrust at super-sonic speeds, so if you try to climb too early or too hard, they\u0027ll never cross that threshold and really start pushing. This was a huge part of why I couldn\u0027t get an SSTO working at first, I was pushing it into too steep of a climb."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Dwarf","CreatedById":67709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T15:50:52Z","Content":"Yeah, I\u0027ve noticed that the ascent counts for a lot, but it seems more random than not. Some of my best ascents pushed 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and I was getting mach affects. Other times I would do that same ascent and drop out of the sky."},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T18:36:01Z","Content":"It of course all depends on how many tons per engine you\u0027re trying to push, but if you\u0027re towards the high end, you definitely need to speed up to ~300m/s right off the runway at a very low climb angle, and then pitch up but never so much you go below maybe 280m/s. Doing that made all the difference for me."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T19:14:21Z","Content":"Red Dwarf,\n\n The thrust of the RAPIER is dependant on airspeed and air density. If you\u0027re not maintaining the same speed, you\u0027re not going to generate the same thrust, so you\u0027re going to fall behind more. This is aggravated by climbing, where the air is thinner.\n\n If you\u0027re not going as fast as you should be, you have to fix it by arresting your climb until you\u0027re back on track.\n\n I don\u0027t use fixed angles for my climb, I instead shoot for airspeed/altitude benchmarks. This keeps everything consistent.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T19:22:15Z","Content":"I use turbojets and nukes for sstos. It is just so much more practical. No oxidizer packing and turbojets have more thrust than rapiers."},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T19:41:06Z","Content":"Aside from the airspeed, note that air breathing engines have a certain altitude at which they magically stop working."},{"CreatedByName":"Yakuzi","CreatedById":85181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T20:39:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Has anyone else experienced this inconsistent performance, and is there any way to make it not happen?\n\nI\u0027ve been having similar issues with craft with Mk2/Mk3 cargobays and Nao has provided an [indepth description of this issue](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116729-Stock-Payload-Fraction-Challenge-1-0-4-Edition?p=2042104\u0026viewfull=1#post2042104) in the Stock Payload Fraction Challenge:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sigh... **\u003EBUG WARNING\u003C** guys, when using cargo bays, make sure drag values are correct for it and nearby parts.\n\nCheck Nao\u0027s post for more details.
