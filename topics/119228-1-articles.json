You shouldn\u0027t have to do anything special to get landing legs to go up or down. Hit G, they go down. Hit G again, they go up. You don\u0027t even need to set up the action group. Are you hitting G or are you right clicking them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing: you have to hit G twice. One of the oldest unaddressed bugs in the game makes the legs \u0022think\u0022 they\u0027re down so when you hit G the first time, it \u0022raises\u0022 them into their already up position. Just hit G a second time and they\u0027ll go down.

You can edit all custom groups plus the default groups like gears and lights if you want to change how those work, or you can use abort as a \u0022free\u0022 group as well even on career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Click the part you want to add to the group, and a list of actions it can take will show up. Pick whichever you want. For most parts like landing gear/struts, lights, retractable solar panels, etc, you can choose to \u0022Toggle\u0022 rather than adding on/off, which will let you use one key to flip the switch rather than use two keys to turn on and off. There are a few parts with no toggle, and in general people hate that, so hopefully it\u0027s fixed in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You can add multiple actions or parts to the same group, no problem. Parts added using symmetry mode will normally be grouped and whatever one is assigned, all will do. To make them work individually in the field you can still right click and choose the action manually, they will allow desynching this way if you want that for any reason. Note that typically when you place a part, assign it to an action group, then pick it back up in the VAB and move it (or even place it right back where it was), the action groups will almost always be messed up and need to be reassigned even if they still show up in the action group menu. This is why you should assign your action groups last, after the vehicle is finished, so further design modifications don\u0027t bork your whole keyset over and over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The default groups of lights, gear, and brakes will always have all parts on the vehicle that fit into those groups added to them, even if you pick them up and move them around, they are actually hard to bug out, so that\u0027s reliable and nice. However, you can also remove some parts from this list if you like - say you want your lander legs to operate with the gears key, but don\u0027t want a probe you attached to it deploying its own legs at the same time since that could be a nuisance. Remove the probe\u0027s gear from the group, and add them to another group of your choosing if you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Note that action groups are merged and inherited. If you build a rover, give it action groups, save it as a subassembly, then build a lander and attach the rover to it via docking port, the rover and lander\u0027s action groups will merge. The rover\u0027s lights and lander\u0027s lights will all come on with the lights key, for example. You can avoid this by using non-conflicting keys for each component (ex. 1-5 are lander, 6-0 rover), but if you say, deduct the rover lights from the \u0022lights\u0022 group so they don\u0027t come on at the same time as the lander\u0027s, when you undock the rover and drive it separately its lights action group will be empty. Either assign them to an empty group, or maybe use Action Group Manager mod to let you reassign things in the field so all your vehicles can set their keys as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The above applies in reverse too, if you dock a shuttle to a station, the action groups of the two will be merged for as long as they are docked, so make sure the \u0022deploy panels\u0022 key on your refueling station doesn\u0027t activate \u0022eject cockpit\u0022 on your shuttle! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope all of this makes sense, I ramble and it\u0027s a lot to take in but it\u0027s worth knowing it all I think!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T12:02:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 12:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hagen von Tronje\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_stilgar_","CreatedById":147818,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T11:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need to add landing gear to an action group, they are added by default to its own group - just press G.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crestofawave","CreatedById":150015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T18:23:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks a lot guys, hagen, thanks for the write up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
