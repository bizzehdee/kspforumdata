In most situations this is fine and exactly what it\u0027s supposed to do.\n\nBut in some situations it\u0027s also annoying, if you forget to switch back to \u0022keep direction\u0022 (Stability) mode. For example when approaching a planet/moon and you want to change orbit direction by burning anti-radial. In this case the ship should align to the anti-radial mark and then switch back to just keeping the direction, because as soon as the ship accelerates the mark will start to move (anti-radial becomes radial).\n\nSo my suggestion would be to add a different behavior when these buttons are clicked with the right mouse button. In this case the ship aligns with the corresponding marker and then *switches automatically back* to stability mode instead of staying in the \u0022follow the marker\u0022 mode. Clicking them with the left button on the other hand will trigger the same behavior as it does before/now."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T15:52:41Z","Content":"It sounds like you\u0027re asking for a way to have the SAS system switch to \u0022keep direction\u0022 as soon as it aligns with the direction. There\u0027s no automatic way to do that, but you can tap F to momentarily disable SAS and switch back to \u0022keep direction.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T02:19:28Z","Content":"I\u0027m afraid this suggestion would mess up the Normal buttons. When doing a plane change, the direction of Normal/Antinormal keeps moving as your inclination changes during the maneuver."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T04:13:47Z","Content":"Heh, I see what you are saying. Although I\u0027m not sure it adds too much, since there are so many ways to accomplish what you\u0027re asking for already. I do like that they added the auto-revert to HOLD feature when you land though.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
