I\u0027ve been using KSPI since I first got KSP back in 0.21 or something, full aware that trying to get a mod to work on a game in alpha is purely a buyer-beware matter. But through the various versions, mod releases, and changes to how tech trees are implemented, I\u0027ve had to restarted my save game about four times due to irreconciable problems between the tech tree, mods, parts, etc. CTT was the best option, but until recently, it still did wonky things like make fusion reactors, etc. available way too early. Without CTT, other mods like Karbonite were avaiable at the equivalent of the Gemini program, which was too early for my tastes. Balance, today, seems perfect with my unique mod environment, and I\u0027m looking forward to getting back into it after a long hiatus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, with all this practice, my missions are getting way more cost-efficient.
