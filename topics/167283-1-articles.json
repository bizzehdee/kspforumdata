The video says, however, that it narrowed our perspective by focusing on having many low orbit travels. During this time, the NASA didn\u0027t focus on returning to the Moon or going to Mars. This less ambitious turn is also explainable by a cut in the fundings, since the main objective (landing on the Moon) was already achieved. So it can be argued that NASA did the best with what it had.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, how do you answer to the video claims that :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The concept of the external fuel tank was a mistake;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The fact that the space shuttle wasn\u0027t at the top of the rocket exposed it to dangers previous models didn\u0027t have?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
