When something is purchased that is still under development then it is more than reasonable to expect that the product will stay in development until it is done.

I would also be upset if they just stopped development tomorrow, though we both don\u0027t think that will happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe it was you that used the contracting company repairing a leaky roof as an analogy. I like that analogy, particularly since I work at a roofing company and have repaired leaky roofs for them. For the analogy lets make the contractor squad, the customer us, and the leak your desire to play a fun game. A full roof is a full release game, a patch is a game like KSP. A fixed leak is when your desire is satisfied and you have a fun game to play. A leak that was not fixed means your desire remains, you are not fully satisfied with a game yet. IRL if you have a leaky roof most contractors will suggest you get a new roof and not a patch since they can make sure the roof won\u0027t leak when the job is completely done. The company I work for fully guarantees full roofs. There is more accountability there, just like with full games. However, we cannot guarantee patches, leaks are often caused by improper installation and that is very hard to detect with shingles on the roof. So if a customer asks for a patch as it is the cheaper option and still has a good chance of fixing the leak, we tell them outright that we cannot guarantee it. If a leak sprouts up after the first repair then we go back. This could take multiple returns as we could not guarantee that the first patch would completely fix the leak. However, we go back until the leak is fixed. This is kind of what squad did; they said here try this. we think you will have fun however its not a full job yet so no guarantees and it may take awhile to find that sweet sauce to make it awesome. So it may be slower than you\u0027d want but as long as you call us back we will come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now asking squad to redefine the game as a 1.0 to have the extra accountability would be like asking the roofing company to redefine their patch as a full roof after they did the work for the patch. It doesn\u0027t make sense. And I don\u0027t think that was what you meant. I think your point was that squad should let us know what to expect. And on that note, I agree. It would be like you calling the contractor to come redo the leak and he does it without telling you when he would do it, what he did or what to expect. Is it required by law? No, but you start to lose customers when communication breaks down. Or what if they just can\u0027t find the leak and walk away? They have the right, but it still would make you rightly upset. While I do think more communication would be a good thing, I am more or less content with the current state of affairs. You want a little extra, and as you paid for the patch/alpha game I believe you are allowed to ask for better customer relations irregardless of whether they were assured to you in a contract. And so, while I don\u0027t agree on the need for more communication I wholeheartedly agree with your right to request such. All I disagree with is asking for a full release for accountability after agreeing to the terms and before the game is ready. To do so would, IMO, be illogical and counterproductive to what I consider to be a worth while goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for this discussion. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Made me think about my stance and I think it has been productive. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-06T22:30:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2014 10:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by moeggz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling error. today is not my day\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vahal","CreatedById":93285,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T22:43:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Whackjob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Whackjob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the primary issue here is some folks don\u0027t have reasonable expectations.
