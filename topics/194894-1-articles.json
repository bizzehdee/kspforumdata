I\u0027ve checked on my sandbox save and I\u0027m able to transfer with the Klaw there, so it\u0027s probably not a bug. Do I need to further upgrade my buildings in order for this to happen, or is there something else wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T02:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay Questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T05:21:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make resource transfer work with klaws you need to unclick the button in the Difficulty options that says \u0022resource transfer obeys crossfeed rules\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T06:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo expand a bit on \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s explanation: the Klaw and some other parts (e.g. all the heatshields) do not allow crossfeed or resource transfer through them, they also have a note in the parts description that tells you that. One way to go around it is to change the corresponding difficulty option. Another way - which is more useful for heatshields, but not so much for the Klaw - is to place two fuel ducts that bypass the \u0022offending\u0022 part, one duct for each direction. That will then also allow resource transfers. And finally: freshly created fuel from an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E unit will be deposited in any applicable fuel tank, regardless of any non-crossfeed parts in between.
