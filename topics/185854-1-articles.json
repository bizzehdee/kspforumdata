I started playing when sandbox was all there was, so I have a habit of setting a goal for what I want an install to be, and trying to mod around to get the ruleset I want to play in, so I tend to be pretty heavily modded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a mod I used to use that provided an alternate docking port model that I much preferred.\u00A0 It was significantly lower-profile than stock, and most important it wasn\u0027t nearly as wobbly.\u00A0 I honestly don\u0027t know if the wobble problem is still around as I haven\u0027t put a docking port on anything in my fiddling just yet, but I know that the model is still the same.\u00A0 I can\u0027t for the life of me figure out what mod pack included this docking port.\u00A0 I thought it was KW, but it\u0027s not.\u00A0 I\u00A0remember it was white with some grey and red details on it.\u00A0 It was low profile, about the same thickness as the KW stack separators (part of why I thought it was part of the KW set) and if I recall correctly when docked the mating portion of each port clipped into each other.\u00A0 I think early versions even had a male/female version which was eventually canned for the universal format like the stock adapters.\u00A0 The face of the port model showed a square hatch with rounded corners when nothing was docked to it. and I think it may have been lit.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone knows what I\u0027m talking about and can point me towards my long lost mod, or something like it, I would be very grateful.
