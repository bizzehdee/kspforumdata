As with everything that we disclose, folks, please do remember that things do change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.25, the Win64 build is actually more unstable than in 0.24.x. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhereas in 0.24.x we\u0027d see it being pretty reliable with stock but crashing with add-ons/plugins, in 0.25 it crashes for nearly everyone and almost at the exact same point. We\u0027ve spent a significant amount of time in Experimentals, both on a tester and developer side, looking into it, chasing leads, narrowing down reproduction cases and generally digging deeper and deeper into probable causes. However, despite the efforts of a handful of the testers who have tirelessly (and I mean \u003Cem\u003Etirelessly\u003C/em\u003E) worked on it since the beginning of Experimentals, we have yet to hammer this one out, find the cause and fix it. The dastardly issue that causes it to crash still eludes us. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelieve me, this frustrates no-one more than myself, the testers who\u0027ve worked so hard on the issue and, without a doubt, the developers. However, sometimes we have to bite the bullet, call it a day and concentrate on the issues that effect all platforms. Until such a point where this issue is at least narrowed down to a specific cause, if not fixed, 0.25 Win64 will continue to be extremely unstable for many.

We\u0027d then have people complaining about it being an incomplete feature because the destructions aren\u0027t up to par with that the users would like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hannu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hannu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can imagine. But with current game it is time acceleration and one minute waiting. If you miss a launch window then you wait couple of minutes to next one.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s on us to not \u0022cheat\u0022 and warp to the future when it\u0027s completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hannu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hannu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt is just what I try to say. My opinion is that functionality should be first. Time should have real effect to game before it is possible to use time penalty against bad playing. I agree, that time should have more value in game, but it would need living supply resources, finite lifetime of components, long planning and building times of spacecrafts, tightly deadlined contracts etc. So that kerbals die and vessels age in space or you get contract breaking fee if you miss a planned launch window because you damaged the assembly hall. After that it is time to think accurate damage models and nice crashing animations. But I do not have high expectations about time as functional resource because many of these things are on \u0022do not suggest\u0022 -list. I assume that they are things that Squad has thought and decided that they do not want to implement them in foreseeable future.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuite a bit of what you suggested is already here in the form of mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDestructible buildings is a chicken/egg kind of situation in terms of how we\u0027re discussing it -- Should they be destructible or should the game play mechanics for destroyed buildings be implemented first (includes contracts, funds, resources, etc)? Personally, I like they way they seem to be going with it, which is slow and steady. Squad\u0027ll be able to see what modders do to incorporate it in mods which can then be used to determine how Squad should proceed forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think some of the items on the \u0022do not suggest\u0022 list are there because they\u0027ll get to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hannu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hannu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can not say is it good idea to change to beta version of Unity. As far as I know there are some bugs and limitations caused by Unity 4, but probably there will be much more problems out of Squad\u0027s possibilities to fix with new beta version. But I hope that waiting the migration to new Unity is one reason why Squad concentrate building models now. Probably they are much more straightforward to move next version than code or visual effects on planets.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe I stated as much when I made that comment. Still, it seems that U5 will be the future for KSP, so why not start sooner versus later? I\u0027d like to think that in the back room over at Squad HQ, there\u0027s a guy on a PC compiling KSP for U5 to do some initial assessments and they\u0027re just not telling us because it might be somewhat close to working...dammit, I can hope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelp.
