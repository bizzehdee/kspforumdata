I just landed a tiny (for my standards) probe on the mun as a target for an eventual base, and man was it easy to fly. Turned when I wanted it to turn, never even thought about shaking itself apart (with 2 struts), more dV than I knew what to do with, I turned my head to sneeze and it was in orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may have to do this more often.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T07:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall vessels are great. I designed a minimalist orbital launcher the other day to test some ideas for a story I\u0027m working on.

If your CoM and CoT are off by even a hair then it\u0027ll want to spin at anything more than 10% thrust capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor that reason, I prefer mid-sized vessels.
