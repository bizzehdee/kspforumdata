It was about time.","CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:54:32Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:54:32Z","Content":"Hello guys! Yes, you read right, I am finally ready to start churning out SSTOs in 1.0. And how better to begin, than with my signature ship in a new incarnation? Feast your eyes on the 2015 model:\n\n![pChN4qq.png](http://i.imgur.com/pChN4qq.png)\n\nWhile it has considerably increased in weight with respect to the 0.90 version, it retains all of its capabilities, form the awesome handling at all speed and fuel levels (and without hidden canards this time), to the excessive performance (basically, point to space and go, this time with TWR\u003E1 at all times), without sacrificing the gorgeous looks and the minimal part count (with all the science doodads, 60 parts, just like before). And I even kept the mission module concept! This time I haven\u0027t built several mission modules, just one with science instruments and VTOL rocket engines, but this pic shows you clearly how to make the crew version, or a blank cargo one, in about 30 seconds and all on your own: just grab the rear, and the bird will split neatly in two, allowing you to replace the mission module and put it back together in, literally, six clicks. It is meant to handle about a couple tons, but the margins are so big that you can probably push that if you want to.\n\n![687BOqp.png](http://i.imgur.com/687BOqp.png)\n\nAnd best of all, this time I can confirm this is Duna-rated out of the box! SHiftER2O performed some invaluable test flying (kudos to him for that!) to prove that you have delta-v to spare to make it to the ground, and then back to orbit without refueling. The VTOL chemical engines are a must, but other than that, his (I\u0027d say considerable) piloting skills were enough to make it at the first try\\*, even though he flew it with fuel levels optimized for oxygen atmospheres. So yeah, these pics prove the White Dart can handle shuttle service in any rock on the kerbol system, except the usual suspects, Tylo and Eve.\n\n\u003E ![opykEh3.png](http://i.imgur.com/opykEh3.png)\n\u003E ![qg6eh8c.png](http://i.imgur.com/qg6eh8c.png)\n\n*\\*Ok, first he didn\u0027t find the short-of-hidden-under-the-airbrake fuel cell, but when I told him that he nailed the flight.*\n\nAnd now, for the flight instructions! Don\u0027t worry, they are dirt simple:\n\n-It follows a standard SSTO profile. I am going to write it up and put it on R-SUV for future reference for all my SSTOs, because I always get asked that question, so look there in a couple days to see what I consider to be the way to SSTO in 1.0. Might be useful for you perhaps, it isn\u0027t a trivial thing and in 1.0, where an efficient ascent is key to maximize what a given design can do. In the meantime, they can be summed up as \u0022break Mach ASAP, then go as shallow as you can without burning up\u0022... more or less.\n\n-Make sure to turn on the fuel cell if you don\u0027t have the solar panels on and are going to need electricity! It\u0027s hidden from sight under the airbrake, deploy it and it\u0027ll become obvious.\n\n-...and that\u0027s pretty much it. I told you it was simple, didn\u0027t I? The rest is figuring out what it can do for *your* space program. I hope it is something awesome! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**IMGUR ALBUM**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
