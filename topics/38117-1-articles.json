I\u0027m sick of scanning the internet for the .21 beta versions. I keep seeing people posting videos of .21 on YouTube, but I haven\u0027t seen anyone talking about a release of the .21 beta versions. Now it could be (and I have this belief) that I just haven\u0027t looked hard enough for said beta versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t care if it crashes my computer every 5 mins. I just want to get my hands on the new ASAS system so I can start flying planes in KSP (something I just can not do in the current versions) and hopefully make and fly one of these \u0022space planes\u0022 I keep hearing so much about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I know that putting it out as a general release on the main page would be a stupid idea. Because it will be filled with game-braking bugs that will piss off more people than is expected of a more refined model for release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut no where have I seen a developer posting something like a \u0022Here is the beta version. Don\u0027t bitch about bugs, because it\u0027s STILL IN GOD FORSAKEN BETA!!!!!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I really want to know is why are these YouTube people getting early releases that have bugs in them. Because then I see people making forum posts about how YouTube\u0027r X had to deal with bugs. And they just bitch and whine about it like the pea brain fan boys they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not asking for a faster release. O no quite the opposite. I would rather see it take a few more months so that when the final release comes out everyone gets what they really want. A new patch that adds a few new things and isn\u0027t full of bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I would like to be able to play an unfinished version of .21\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not going to whine. I\u0027m not going to bitch. I just want to play the beta content in peace and avoid going on these forums or any other forums as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T04:45:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause hopefully, they\u0027re still fixing things.

They are chosen by Squad to get early access to experimental versions so that they can make videos. The groups who get early releases are the QA team, who get nightly builds, then the experimental team, who get experimental builds, and lastly the media group, who get release candidates. Back before 0.13, experimental releases were public. However, they were changed to a closed experimental sometime during the 0.14.x development, because, as you said, \u0022it will be filled with game-braking bugs that will piss off more people than is expected of a more refined model for release\u0022. The only way to get access now is the join one of the groups mentioned above. The easiest to join is the experimental team, but application periods only come once every few releases and they only take applicants over 18 for legal reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Furiou5","CreatedById":61146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T05:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is a very strange request to ask developers to release a beta of an alpha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are getting the least bug filled version of a bug filled uncomplete game.

There is a lot of fanfare for every update, mostly fan driven but Devs do it as well, that at times will make it very difficult to play the game at the current version. If not difficult than with an undue measure of longing for features that seem just slightly out of reach. As of right now every time I see my control surfaces flutter like mad or I travel to the mun; I honestly get frustrated that I don\u0027t get C7 and Harvester\u0027s great work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am by no means saying that there should be no build up at all, there just comes a point when you can oversaturate with information.
