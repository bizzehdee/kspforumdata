The Havoc can fly around as if it were a fighter, has lots o\u0027 guns in its nose, as well as two rear gunners. It\u0027s bomb load is pretty good too, and if you research the modifications, you can equip it with rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you\u0027re going for the first B-25, you probably know all this stuff already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T23:13:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know if it is possible for Germany and Japan to be in a match together with Realistic difficulty?
