Thank you for explaining that, I was having trouble wording it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPsyper, I think building a vertical take off plane is a lot harder than one that simply uses the runway. Think about it, how many planes are built to take off vertically in the real world? You have to account for a shift in position so it can fly both vertically and horizontally and that can be very tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You might want to try correcting the problem with your take off and landing. My suggestion is practice practice practice, you will be surprised how easily it comes after enough of your fireballs. Spaceplanes are not for those who just want to throw something together and blast off, my opinion is they take far more piloting skill than rockets as well as much more careful planning. Build a small plane, take off, turn around and come back. Keep trying it. If landing is your biggest issue, F5 just out over the ocean while on approach and do it over and over again. I reccomend NEAR, because your planes will \u0022make more sense\u0022 when you do. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is a guide for plane building\u003C/a\u003E, and when I say small plane, I\u0027m not kidding either.

Your spiralling out of control is directly related to 3 facts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Your center of lift is too far forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fuel balancing. Because you have FIFTEEN fuel tanks on there and they are using fuel from front to back, by the time you hit 30km, all the fuel in your wing tanks is in the ass of the plane. This DRASTICALLY affects your center of mass, moving it rearward and thus, causing your lift to be forward of the mass and thus, causing your wild spins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Flaming out. I tested a \u0027modified\u0027 version of your craft file and it starts to flame out at around .14 air flow. The ONLY way I could get it stable was to transfer all of the fuel from the aft wing tanks to the front. If you want to keep gaining speed and altitude, learn where you flame out then learn to throttle back. On some of my suborbital hops I\u0027ve easily managed 100km by throttling back to where the engines are barely putting out thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Eagle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a modified craft file. \u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll note I removed your vertical fins and re positioned your outer wings to be a true X shape. I also moved some air intakes in order to move the wings back. I removed some control surfaces and moved them to the outer wing to give more control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have said... start simple. Design your plane horizontally and before launch rotate vertically and totally ignore the placement of mass, lift, etc. when you do. Only the horizontal positions matter. One engine, make the wings an X shape. The first thing you do with any new \u0027tailsitter\u0027 design is to find out where it\u0027s zero point is. Where on the throttle do you neither gain nor lose altitude when vertical. The other thing you need to learn to land one is spool up and down times. Stock engines are HORRIBLE about spool times. From the time you change the throttle position till the time the plane reacts is on the order of SECONDS. Learn how to anticipate what throttle you\u0027ll need. Those are the keys to learning how to land one. Tailsitters are finicky beasts. I know, I\u0027ve created a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and your skidding off the runway is most likely related to your lift and/or angle of attack. What\u0027s the angle of attack of your plane sitting stopped on the runway? Nose up or nose down? Is your lift forward or behind of the center of mass?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Eagle1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Eagle1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll note my throttle position. Even at 30km I\u0027m gaining speed and not spinning.

Once I got it over 1km/s I tried to do a sharp turn and managed to get it, under control, around 90 degrees from my current heading before (of course) flame out occurred - before I\u0027d go off 5 degrees from my current heading and it would spin out of control so this is a major improvement over my original design. And my SAS held it where I put it so I could point it at a target, kick in the SAS and wait for the craft to catch up to where I wanted it to go. I next cut the engines, rotated the craft to its retrograde heading and switched the engines back on - I managed to slow the crafts horizontal velocity so that it was descending vertically - full throttle stopped my decent and got me climbing again with no issues, no spinning or anything - it was bliss! Even threw the craft in to a spin on purpose kicked in the SAS and it eventually got the craft stable and I was able to point the craft at a 30 degree angle and punch it back in to a climb. It was amazing how a couple of simple changes made all the difference!!

Soon, you too shall master the lazy man\u0027s way of landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you have it balanced it should all work. Keep in mind that the way KSP works is the further you get away from direction or reverse direction of travel the more likely you\u0027ll lose complete control of the craft. That\u0027s also affected by how much total lift you have. The craft in my last two videos has a HUGE amount of lift and is very difficult to lose control of. That\u0027s how I was able to accomplish that \u0027nosedive\u0027 video in a very short space. The more \u0027control\u0027 surfaces the quicker it reacts and the more likely you\u0027ll go in an unintended direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how accurate and balanced it is... it\u0027s sitting on a clampotron.

The position relative the CoM is fine but it\u0027s pushing the craft in one direction. The arrow should be straight up but instead it\u0027s pointing below the bottom of the cockpit.

The vessel as pictured has the CoM sufficiently ahead of the CoL -- but look at the tanks. The tank immediately behind the intakes will be drained first, the one next to the engines will be drained last.

With FAR you want more mass at the front the faster your craft gets and more mass at the back for subsonic speeds. It\u0027s common to move fuel around as you transition between subsonic and supersonic. With NEAR it may improve stability slightly, but it has less of an impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
