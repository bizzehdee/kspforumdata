The biggest reason for the added expense is that the Department of Defense (which helped fund shuttle development and had considerable input on its final design) was expected to make regular use of the shuttle and, by doing so, partially subsidize its operations. When Challenger happened in \u002786, the shuttle fleet was grounded for over two years. This meant that several DoD payloads that only the shuttle could carry were also grounded, and that frustrated the DoD greatly. There were also other high-profile DoD launch failures around that same time (a Delta and 2 Titan failures, both carrying DoD payload), and combined with Challenger it really made the DoD worry about its ability to reliably deliver payloads to orbit, without long downtime caused by mishaps. So, the DoD bowed out and pursued their own launch vehicles. Without DoD money coming in the cost for all future launches went way up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Not to cast the DoD in a bad light here - they didn\u0027t just wait for the first mishap and bail on the shuttle program.

While it was technically overdesigned for civil and science work, that alone didn\u0027t really kill the Shuttle\u0027s efficiency, since those tradeoffs were expected to be paid for by carrying DoD payloads.

The ISS was supposed to be (and mostly is) a research platform that housed astronauts. However, the astronauts in question were primarily going to be the workers at a second station right next door (only several hundred meters away) which was to be an orbital dry dock for construction of ships. Dry dock in this case being somewhat the opposite, in that it was meant to fill with air so the crew could work on the ship without suits. The two stations were never supposed to be connected because they didn\u0027t want the vibrations of the industrial processes going on to interfere with the experiments on the primary ISS.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space station plans go as far as the proposals for the shuttle itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the apollo plan, NASA decided they had 4 options. A manned mission to mars, a followup moon program, an orbital infrastructure program, or discontinuing manned spaceflight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey went with the orbital infrastructure program, but it was decided that it\u0027d cost too much to develop the station and the shuttle at the same time. Their plan was to build the shuttle first and then use that to construct the station, however it soon became apparent the space station was never going to happen, so they had add lots of life support and science capabilities to the shuttle so it\u0027d be capable of more than just dropping people off at a station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
