Random Feature is at X heading from the map i still have to do a fandango in and around my spacecraft to try to get an idea of where that is relative to the canonical \u0022front\u0022 of my ship because kerbals somehow forget to pack their own instrumentation about their person (though i note that they still have the stock altimeter, barometer and vertical speed indicator). i don\u0027t know a lot about spacesuit design but it strikes me as ridiculous that a suit designed for extended EVA wouldn\u0027t at least have some kind of heading indicator sewn into the sleeve. so, is there a mod extant that adds this functionality, or failing that, is it a moddable feature?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T06:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a navball, but I use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81543-\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENavHud\u003C/a\u003E all the time on EVA.
