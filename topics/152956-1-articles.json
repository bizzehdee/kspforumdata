Decided to give that a go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRussled up a ship with two large drills and the Convert-o-tron 250 and plopped it onto Minmus. I have 4 medium cooling arrays and a level 2 engineer and I cannot seem to keep things cool enough. So the question is, what is the recommended amount of cooling per drill and per convert-o-tron? I have browsed through the various tutorials on mining but I was not able to glean an answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on the numbers in the tool tips, the convert-o-tron required 200kW of cooling, max of 500kW. The drills require 100kW of cooling each, max of 100kW. That puts my cooling needs at 400kW (for this ship) at a minimum and 700kW for max performance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe numbers in the tool tip for the radiators are a bit confusing. The mediums Core Heat Transfer - 250kW. Max Cooling 19494kW. Transfer rate of 10%. Cools up to 4x part temp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith 4 medium radiators I read that I should have 1000kW of cooling capability, which should be enough, but since it is not I am clearly not understanding something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease point me to the right tutorial or tell me how these numbers work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-04T01:28:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you are seeing a known bug\u00A0from your description. If you run a drill and a converter at the same time, and you use retractable radiators, then the converter will overheat and the drills will not. Your calculations are precisely correct -- the equipment is generating 400kW of core heat, and your radiators should be able to dissipate 1MW, and the equipment can accept 700kW of that 1MW of cooling. But it doesn\u0027t quite work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to break it down a little further: having the converter overheat is mostly just cosmetic. Anywhere except an asteroid, the converter can convert far faster than the drills can produce -- even when overheated. So just let it overheat -- it can\u0027t blow up or anything. If you really want to avoid the condition, then shut down the drills momentarily while you run the converter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Some Kerbal","CreatedById":171846,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-04T03:36:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried running the two drills without the converter, and then just a single drill.
