I\u0026#39;ve been playing for a while now, got about 118hrs of gameplay in. I\u0026#39;ve mostly been playing career and just started a science sandbox and I was wondering what your favorite mods are to add a little more flavor to the game. I\u0026#39;d like to certainly start some life supporting colonies and all that good stuff. I\u0026#39;m running stage recovery mod, and ubiowelding mod. Let me know what your favorite mods are and why they are your favorite ^_^\n"}]}
