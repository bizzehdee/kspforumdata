You have to play around with them. One thing, don\u0027t autostrut the motor, I\u0027ve found that autostruting the motor can make it not want to move. And even autostrusting the parts that the motors are moving can cause it to jam the motor up. You just have to play around with it, find out what works and what doesn\u0027t. Make your craft then launch it, after it\u0027s launched, test the motors, if they don\u0027t move, unstrut the motor or move it to a different struting position. Do the same for any parts the motors move.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027m a he lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-02T16:11:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn theory autostruts should be safe: when a robotic part is locked then autostruts can traverse that part (and help making your craft less \u0022floppy\u0022). And when a robotic part is not locked then the calculation where an autostrut goes is (supposed to be) done like the two sides of the robotic part are two different vessels. (E.g. the one half of the robotic part becomes the effective root of the \u0022downstream\u0022 parts.) This latter seems to go wrong at times, in particular if there are more robotic parts in line. In that case, don\u0027t set up any autostruts that traverse the robotic part(s). IIRC it also often goes wrong when you set an autostrut on a robotic part itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iNVERTEDpLAZMA","CreatedById":174440,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-03T05:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome, thanks guys.
