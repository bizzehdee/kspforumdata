I am, currently, attempting to drop a large rover onto Duna, but there are some issues with the skycrane solution I tried on the Mun. Mainly that it didn\u0027t get there with a prior attempt, and went crazy when I throttled the skycrane up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving ditched the skycrane idea, I went with boosters on each end of it. The rover is basically two hitchhiker containers, a 6-way connector in the middle, and wheels on girders attached to the sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe booster solution is an FLT-400 tank on each end with a couple of the big radial engines on each tank, and another FLT-400 on the top to act as a mast for the intricate web of struts to stop the thing wobbling like crazy, and feed fuel to the booster tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne drogue chute on the top, four radial chutes on each hitchhiker container, landing legs on the outer axles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy questions are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that enough boosters and chutes to land safely on Duna?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill four sepratrons fire the empty mast tank upwards and give enough time to get the rover out from underneath it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I make sure the drogue chute doesn\u0027t make it slam back into the rover?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I just dump that section on the way down and fire it off at an angle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I mount tanks and thrusters on the middle as well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it just going to fall apart despite the web of struts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T12:20:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skorpychan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Skorpychan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe rover is basically two hitchhiker containers, ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUhh, please post a picture.
