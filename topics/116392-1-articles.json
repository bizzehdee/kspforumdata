This big ugly contraption was unevenly mass centered, but even then, the rocket managed to put it to minmus obit quite easily. I landed it with a eyeballed mass centered lateral Terrier. Did well too. \n\nUntil then, I must say I was surprised everything went so well. Then I touch the ground, on a 6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 slope...\n\nAnd the station slided for 20 minutes at 0.3 m/s (can\u0027t save, warp, return to space center, just had to wait). No brakes, no moving helped to stop it. \n\nThen the slope was flatter and it stopped. But, it wasn\u0027t \u0022landed\u0022 (the mission didn\u0027t validate). And then, for no reason it was (minutes later)\n\nWhen I returned to space center, game crashed (all the time), until it didn\u0027t crash and the vessel totally vanished from save file.\n\nSo : beware of wheels it\u0027s kraken bait. I hope the new wheel code of 1.1 will be more stable.\n\nPS : Hopefully the kerbal engineer went for a pee outside/planting flag just before the station vanished. So I could target it\u0027s location with Hyperedit. I hyperedited a new version of the station with legs instead of wheels. No more crash and vanishing station."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T10:24:47Z","Content":"There\u0027s a bug with rover wheels stopping the brakes from working.

Take landing legs for a complete stop. Brake AND reverse for slowing down.\n\n- Go slow and physic warp. Stop and quicksave every couple of hundred meters. Watch out for the bug of stuff overheating when at 4x physics.\n\n- Add some vertical propulsion, either to launch up if something bad is about to happen or to stick to the ground and get more grip for the wheels."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T13:33:26Z","Content":"Wheels are a hot mess right now, they need to use Unity\u0027s wheel engine and only work semi-reliably on Kerbin, Tylo, or Duna.

Spent the last week or so just thinking about my first mission to Duna. \n\nStep 1 ended up being: Make a crane thats going to put the base together. After all, can\u0027t make a station without knowing how it will go together. \n\nA while later this bare prototype appears : \n\n![PXgsXMS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PXgsXMS.jpg)\n\nOh yea, screenshot key is overlay, forgot to change that. Anyway, Demonstration version shows moving a heavy load from A to B. \n\nAnd it can do this :\n\n![sn1lW7b.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sn1lW7b.jpg)\n\nNotice the brakes applied. \n\nWhen Testing with a full load this happens:\n\n![D8bbYiL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/D8bbYiL.jpg)\n\n![eUl27MZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/eUl27MZ.jpg)\n\nlool Tried adding struts, here and there but it seems if the wheels arn\u0027t in the correct position that it should be when they fully stop and lock then they will try to get in the right position without being able to rotate and it all goes wobbily from there. I have reduced the brake torque to 5. I tested it on 2, and that wouldn\u0027t stop it. \n\nI am aware of the weight of the tank and the leverage from the CoM, and the small weak links to the crane, and the extendy legs makes it all flimsy, but see that problem there i see the wheels falling off. This is my worst nightmare. \n\nMore worryingly previous tests were using the button on the screen, but when using the S key to slow the vehicle down and attempt to get the wheels in the \u0022right position\u0022 before applying the lock, when i nearly stopped I held the B key and I swear all the wheels went their own way full throttle. Ugh, maybe I need bigger wheels :/ I like these ones. Will keep messing around lol\n\nEdit 2: That last pic is just cracking me up it looks totally retarded. It must be the kerbal way. Adding more struts between the wheels help\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T01:12:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 01:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by keeper**"}]}
