You know those planes that won\u0027t take off until you run off the end of the runway? That may have been one. I find those takeoffs hilariously fun, especially in FAR. I guess that can be part of the sacrifice for planes without much wing area. There are two like that there I think, don\u0027t know which you mean but - Thanks for the compliment, really though all the important work is being done by FAR and these MK2 pieces from the B9 pack. At least I think they are working like a lifting body? I haven\u0027t actually compared mk1 or large cylindrical part Cd, Cl and L/D numbers, I just assumed and went on the feel of flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the general topic, you don\u0027t have to turn on SAS for gyro power to help and usually it\u0027s best not to do that until you\u0027re in orbit with a FAR SSTO, but it depends on how strong your SAS force is compared to mass of the plane and how strong your control surfaces are working at any time. This B9 cockpit is supposed to have less gyro strength than most manned stock pods though. They all used regular B9 landing gear with heat shield, nothing special on my part. Somehow I rarely use canards for high speed planes because they can cause more drag, but they do really help for maneuverability depending on where the center of mass is. LAtely I tried some other \u0022planes\u0022 and it\u0027s possible to \u0022fly\u0022 by using lots of gyro strength to drag around a reasonably shaped thing without wings. But in some sense it\u0027s not really flying, but weird techno-assisted fuselage-draggery IMO. It\u0027s nice to have the option though I think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaverio\u0027s Aerospace also has various sizes of AV-R8 winglets for large planes and rockets. Plus tapered wings, tailfins and control surfaces that work with FAR. There are much more expert people who post in this thread than me, I just hung around to try to learn some basics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : Also to mention again, the H2 as fuel from ModularFuels really helps because it is very lightweight. You\u0027ve got to use oxidizer though which in ModularFuels is called liquidoxygen. The B9 SABRE is neat also with that if you get the adjustment for it, it\u0027s better balanced and unique, it only burns H2 with liquidoxygen, is pretty heavy but very efficient at burning H2 in the atmosphere. I tried that also on a few planes. Trade-offs of H2 is that engines configured to use it will make around half thrust, and you\u0027ll need more tank space to hold much of it, it\u0027s a refreshingly unusual thing since I\u0027m so used to the density of liquidfuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETriple Edit : Another good reason to use ModularFuels with FAR :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can customize entirely, how much fuel and what type you have loaded in each fuel tank in the actiongroups menu. So use a lighter half-full tank of liquidfuel if you want, fill the rest of that same tank with xenon or other potential orbital delivery resources, or use RealFuels module and even customize the tech level (changes mass and efficiency) of your rocket engines. Also comes with several smaller rocket engines to use with FAR SSTO planes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-04T02:58:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2013 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by localSol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pasty2k2","CreatedById":61163,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T09:38:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew version of KSP Interstellar pack (0.8.2) with FAR installed and it seems that FAR is treating one of the deployable parts in KSPI (Foldable Microwave Transceiver) as always deployed, and calculating drag based off that figure.
