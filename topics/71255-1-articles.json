I\u0027m trying to take 220t to Laythe and to bring back to kerbin 100t (Huge rover that can cross oceans, 6 man lander with ssto capabilities from Laythe, plus tons of science). So I was wondering, has anyone built a Laythe Tranfer Vehicule that can handle that much weight? I\u0027ve built two that might be able to. One is powered by four nukes but is too heavy and I haven\u0027t yet succeeded to get it in orbit. I did another which I\u0027m still building which is powered \u002B/- 100 ion engines but it\u0027s still under construction and haven\u0027t tested. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease somebody help me.
