That can have a very drastic change in a plane\u0027s performance. Also, do note that as far as I\u0027m aware, for sweeping wings to have any effect on flight characteristics, you\u0027d need to be using FAR or NEAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the plane I showed in the screenshots, the center of lift was originally quite near the center of mass, and the plane was quite acrobatic, and quick to respond to pitch control input. When I sweep the wings back, it actually became stable and sluggish in response to pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also did a quick scan of the numbers in the FAR analysis, and sweeping the wings do modify the stability values. However, I have no idea of how accurate the changes match real world performance. Ferram would be a better person to ask. I suspect at that on the current version for FAR that it\u0027s not 100% accurate because part occlusion is not accounted for IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, one would sweep wings for supersonic flight, but my admittedly limited testing do not show any major differences in level flight aside for a drop in coefficient of lift.
