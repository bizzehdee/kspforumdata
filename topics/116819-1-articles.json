It is becoming quite irritating.\n\nThe crash does not freeze the game. Rather, the game simply \u0022closes\u0022 instantaneously as if I had force-quit.\n\nI\u0027m including the logs of several different crashes below:\n\n[ACCESS VIOLATION LOG FILES](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ay2yjld6vo2cllf/Access%20Violation%20Logs.zip?dl=0)\n\nInstalled Mods:\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux (v 1.0.17 as far as I can tell)\n\nHyperEdit (v 1.4.1)\n\nOther Installed Things:\n\nCubeships - Working on testing this mod for someone else.\n\nCustom miscellaneous new parts for testing.\n\nThis so far has always happened as I\u0027m driving a rover (The \u0022Silverfish\u0022, if you want to see it there\u0027s a link in my signature) on the surface of Kerbin. It has happened immediately after I stop the rover and quicksave, as well as in the middle of normal gameplay. It happens at intervals of around 30 minutes. The rover travels at around 60 m/s.\n\nRunning KSP v 1.0.4, Windows 32 bit.\n\nI will try uninstalling all mods. I suspect that the error is not in KER or HyperEdit, but in the miscellaneous files I have in GameData."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T17:29:29Z","Content":"Well, the last 5 are all out-of-memory crashes but the first one is different. There appears to be something corrupted in the save as there is lots of spam of \u0022Look rotation viewing vector is zero\u0022 and KER is failing to read transforms from some parts.\n\nAre you on 32bit windows or running 32bit KSP on 64bit windows? On 32bit windows the game can only use about 1.7gig of RAM (without special boot tweaks) so you will need to reduce texture resolution, run in OpenGL mode or do something else to reduce the memory usage (and the memory leaks in KSP will still likely cause it to crash after not very long).\n\nDo these mods you are testing use DDS textures? If not then getting these changed should save you some more memory."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T17:30:19Z","Content":"Stock crashes with this error as well, but this is the first time i have seen this.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: failed to create vertex buffer of size 963200 [out of memory]\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: failed to create vertex buffer of size 963200 [out of memory]\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: failed to create vertex buffer of size 963200 [out of memory]\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: VB or IB is null\n\u003E \n\u003E DynamicHeapAllocator out of memory - Could not get memory for large allocationCould not allocate memory: System out of memory!\n\u003E \n\u003E Trying to allocate: 4194304B with 4 alignment.
