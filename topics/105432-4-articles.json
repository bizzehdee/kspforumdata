First off, this is a really good game when played stock. What makes it a superduperliciously great game, is the modding community. All them mods is what makes this game shine. When the developers implement features that previously have been provided by mods, I have rather high expectations - because I think the game is so good. This especially happens when they implement stuff that previously has been provided by great mods, like FAR and DRE. Personally, I cannot fathom why you would want to play this game stock, when it is so much better with mods. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, I\u0027d like to point out that I really prefer when the developers implement stuff, even though it might have been implemented well in a mod.

What we are experiencing is the result of a constantly maturing and evolving community that through the entire early access process has developed a feeling of comradeship and joint ownership regarding the content and configuration of the final product of KSP. When the Devs appear to not listen, the volume of response rises, when a release continues to deliver persistent bugs identified multiple releases prior then the volume of dissent rises.
