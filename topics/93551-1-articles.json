As a rough sketch, for planets further from the sun than Kerbin, you can point from around 135\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA from Kerbin prograde in the dark side and from Moho/Eve around 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA from Kerbin prograde in the light side. Don\u0027t worry much with this, that will be refined later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Open the manouver node and push prograde until the transfer orbit outside Kerbin SoI reaches the target planet orbit.

You might have noticed a \u0022-\u0022 and a \u0022\u002B\u0022 buttons. Those add/subtract full orbits around the body you are for the node results. In other words , if you click in the \u0022\u002B\u0022 it will show the result of that node if was applied 1 orbit after the original node ( the \u0022time to node\u0022 will also change, btw ).
