Starting in LKO, it takes only about an extra 200 m/s dV to go there (compared with going to the Mun), which is more than made up by needing ~250 m/s *less* to land on Ike than on the Mun. Then you save another 250 m/s (compared with the Mun) ejecting from Ike, and then spend roughly ~600 m/s dV to head home.\n\nNet result: a round trip from LKO to Ike\u0027s surface and back to Kerbin costs just ~350 m/s more of dV than from LKO to the Mun and back. It\u0027s *trickier*, certainly (have to handle launch windows and Duna aerobraking just right), but doesn\u0027t need a much heftier rocket.\n\nTools like [http://ksp.olex.biz](http://ksp.olex.biz) are really handy for planning the launch window."}]}
