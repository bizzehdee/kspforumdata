Previously, the criteria for whether a surface would work as an aileron was simply whether or not it had any symmetrical counterparts. We assumed that counterparts would logically be on the other side of the ship, facing outwards, and for rockets, that was mostly the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with spaceplanes it\\\u0027s another story. You can have symmetrical winglets that really shouldn\\\u0027t be ailerons at all (think wingtip rudders, for instance), and to fix this issue I changed the aileron criteria to a much more correct system, where the amount of aileron action is proportional to how much the control surface pivot axis is aligned with the CoG\\\u0027s longitudinal axis. That means ailerons will work proportionally to how much the control surfaces are facing \\\u0027away\\\u0027 from the centerline of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took some screenshots of a few aircraft I created:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just love this one here, if you\\\u0027ve ever played a game called Total Annihilation, this may look familiar. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OWK6R.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OWK6R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt flies pretty well too.

The engine block I simply cut the engines from and filled in the faces. Then I UV mapped those to black, as shown. The OMS pods also had the RCS units removed from them, and the faces filled. I made the OMS engines from scratch (and existing textures!). I should go back and make them more accurate.
