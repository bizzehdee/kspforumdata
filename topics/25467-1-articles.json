And if there\u0027s any way to fix it? Turning off the music stops the noise, but it also happens with sound in certain circumstances. I know the game\u0027s alpha and all, just wanted to know if there was a way to stop it. (Also while alt-tabbed out of the game while typing this the popping noise isn\u0027t happening.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T21:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not just the sound. Watch your launch and you will see that when the pop happens the engine stops for a split second... and there is a corresponding gap in your vapour trail. It\u0027s the game code itself hiccuping and if you find out the cause and more important THE FIX I would be eternally grateful. This problem is annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FritzPixel","CreatedById":59955,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T21:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is something I\u0027ve dealt with before, it affects all sounds for me and it gets worse with larger ships. I also noticed that the engine exhaust sort of skips when the sound pops, almost always in sync with the mission timer flashing yellow or red.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t find the original thread discussing it, but it seems that it only affects a small number of people. I updated my sound card driver and it got a lot better, so you might want to try that first. Some other people mentioned that closing other heavy programs that use the sound card fixed it for them, things like chat or recording software. I\u0027ve done my best to track it down, but I\u0027m still not sure what causes it. If anyone has more insight to the problem, I\u0027d love to hear it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T21:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, FritzPixel...
