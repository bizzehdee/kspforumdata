I did this in order to make sure everyone could get a nice visual representation of what happens with each mode. I\\\u0027ve used a Mun free return as the maneuver to use to demonstrate each type. \n\n\u003E ![Cf13K.png](http://i.imgur.com/Cf13K.png)\n\nMode 0 (Relative to each body\\\u0027s current position). Here, the Mun\\\u0027s orbit looks all kinds of messed up. It\\\u0027s not, though. As the Mun moves through its orbit as time progresses, this projected orbit will become closer and closer to our Kerbin escape and re-encounter.\n\n\u003E ![WxVmh.png](http://i.imgur.com/WxVmh.png)\n\nMode 1, the default (Draws orbits relative to their position at SOI entry). Here, the exit point looks severed from the ship\\\u0027s path due to the entry point being the point of reference now. When we get into the orbit of the Mun, the exit point will obviously make its way over to the correct point. \n\n\u003E ![RkAdh.png](http://i.imgur.com/RkAdh.png)\n\nMode 2 (draws orbits relative to their position at SOI exit). This one is a bit weird to look at at first, but it gets clearer as you think about it. Here, the Mun orbit is where it will be when I leave the SOI to go back to Kerbin. This causes the entry point to seemingly be disconnected, but it\\\u0027s not.\n\n\u003E ![8THLs.png](http://i.imgur.com/8THLs.png)\n\nHere is mode 3 (draws relative to the body you are orbiting). As you can see, it looks like you would expect: No sudden breaks or turns in the lines. I find this to be a very useful tool for maneuvers such as the free-return.\n\n\u003E ![mJGlh.png](http://i.imgur.com/mJGlh.png)\n\nAnd finally, here is mode 4 (Lerped mode). It\\\u0027s... odd. I think that, as my ship closes in on the SOI switch, these orbits will move and match up more. But when you\\\u0027re first doing your burn, it\\\u0027s a bit confusing."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T01:18:00Z","Content":"I think in gonna stick to mode 1.

Go in there, and find these lines:\n\n    CONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = CONIC_PATCH_LIMIT = \n\nThe CONIC\\_PATCH\\_LIMIT will give you more conics (display more orbits).

This version brought a new change though. If you shift focus to an object you\u0027re set to enter the SOI of, it automatically switches to mode 0. Mode 0 is incredibly useful because it shows the orbit around the current position of the body, and you can focus and zoom in on said current position to get a close-up look at the encounter and make precise course corrections."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T21:52:29Z","Content":"Please refrain from posting in really old threads guys, link to them instead from a new thread or post.\n\nAlso, moving this to Tutorials as it didn\u0027t exist when this thread was made ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T15:51:37Z","Content":"I think I have figured out Mode 4!\n\nIf I am understanding it correctly Mode 4 draws Patched Conics relative to your ship."},{"CreatedByName":"linkxsc","CreatedById":67350,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T17:35:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Please refrain from posting in really old threads guys, link to them instead from a new thread or post.\n\u003E Also, moving this to Tutorials as it didn\u0027t exist when this thread was made ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnd what do we do in that case when we pull aggro from a mod who doesn\u0027t like duplicate topics even if one of the threads is long since dead?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T19:19:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And what do we do in that case when we pull aggro from a mod who doesn\u0027t like duplicate topics even if one of the threads is long since dead?\n\nSimple, you check the age of the thread first, then either post or newthread and link, it\u0027s not rocket science ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI better close this now, it\u0027s been necro\u0027ed enough."},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T19:21:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And what do we do in that case when we pull aggro from a mod .....\n\nYou turn on an active Aggro reducing ability or get your team mates to pick up there DPS slack!"}]}
