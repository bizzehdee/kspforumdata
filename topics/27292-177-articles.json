Not even slapping nose-cones on everything fixed the stability issues, so a new line of launchers is being drafted. This was assembled in orbit as seen below.

CM has around 3k dV once it has pulled juice from the lander radials.

Honestly I\u0027m scared to take it out for fear of what might happen... But I guess no gain without risk. I\u0027m deciding whether to go ahead and dock the lander and possibly a rover to it before the shakedown just so it\u0027s at its full working weight. This is it in its current state docked to my tanker station (in this pic it still has probe core \u002B MonoPropellant tanks attached to one side). I know it has a ton of docking ports but I thought why redesign the entire ship if it turns out to be a success and I want to add to it. I\u0027m really not that confident that it\u0027s going to work the way I intend though... It\u0027s meant for a Duna trip (with return this time) and it will tug a lander; I\u0027m still debating the rover. They usually cause me more trouble than they\u0027re worth and usually end in long hikes after I wreck them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-01-0400-21-22-07.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-01-0400-21-22-07.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also made a \u0022Docking Assist Drone\u0022 to help out at the station. I WAS making everything permanently maneuverable under its own power with probe cores and RCS \u002B propellant, but the probe cores especially aren\u0027t jiving with my build ideas right now. So this little guy is there to either capture things from nearby after separation from its rendezvous stage or re-dock them for a better position. It carries only a battery and 80 units of Mono Propellant but ideally whatever it docks to already has its own RCS thrusters since the center of gravity would be out of whack otherwise. Its first use was when I put the first set of nukes on the Storm the wrong way (I want to be able to fire off 2 at a time if the desire / need arises) so I did a quick rotate and reattach. I think I\u0027m actually gonna take it with me and use it as an adapter -- the Clampotron on the rear of the Storm can connect to the drone which has a Clampotron Jr on the opposite side which will keep my lander looking a little better, by not having to put a standard size docking port on the nose. There is a standard one on the rear of the lander, but that\u0027s really a relic from another design meant to be decoupled to reveal a \u0022last chance\u0022 engine when needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-01-0321-22-38-22.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-01-0321-22-38-22.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny story (well to me anyway), notice in the top picture how the right tank with the probe core assembly still attached has the cubic struts on it, well on the left side I made a slight oversight and had them pointed in the way of the docking ports and there was no way I was doing a relaunch when I was just meters away. So I got everything lined up pretty close to the Storm traveling about .1 m/s and decoupled the probe core to perform kind of a controlled crash. It actually worked perfectly and the probe core assembly bounced harmlessly off the central tanks, then Kurt got a bug up his butt about it blocking his view from the hitchhiker container and pushed it away from the station with his jetpack.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-04T06:20:33Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2014 06:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T08:33:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot all my guys circularized around Vall, used two Laythe intercepts to set up the orbit after aerocapture; pretty proud of myself.
