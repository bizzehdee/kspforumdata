Also how can I set trim? I see the flight assistance options, but they don\u0027t seem to do anything.. At high altitude the craft slowly pitches down due to a pair of drop tanks. But I can easily counter it... but how can I make it so that I don\u0027t have to? Is there a way to zero the controls at level?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what trim is. Hit ALT-S while flying to set up a downward trim. Keep hitting ALT-S if you need it to be stronger. Same goes for any of the other WASDQE controls.

I\u0027ve been messing with the best way to get my current set of planes into orbit and so far I\u0027m finding that usually the best I can do on jets alone is getting to 28-30km at 1600-1650m/s. After that point I generally have to switch to rockets for the rest of my ascent.\u003Cp\u003EFrankly that makes more sense than in stock where airhogging and other factors let you go on jets all the way into orbit, but I\u0027m curious if my results represent the usual limit of what a FAR spaceplane can be expected to achieve or if a better design would get more mileage out of jets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have built a lot of SSTO spaceplanes in FAR, and I can say that the best I have achieved is a craft that actually managed to get to mach 5.5 on air breathers alone, and then I pitched up to 25deg to climb to space from 28km. At that point I switched from jets to rockets and finished the burn. I followed the launch profile of the real Skylon, and it seems to be the most efficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current most efficient craft is one that was designed messing around with the new wings in the procedural wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CrGjlIc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CrGjlIc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even extended the original design slightly just to add a small 2m cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T08:04:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFerram, i swear that since the supersonic drag patch my spacecraft stall at AoA as low as 15 deg during reentry, and i\u0027m sure that before i could put them in any orientation and they would not stall until they get much slower \u0026amp; lower.

I tried to design a spaceplane that can reenter at high AoA (40 deg) like the space shuttle. At such AoA my crafts become unstable in yaw/roll due to stalling i guess. I tried different designs with various degree of an-or dihedral and delta and sweep wing configurations but they all have such instability in common.

All of the raised ground surfaces of KSC are on a perfectly parallel plane, while the rest of the ground is a sphere. Gravity pulls you toward the center of the sphere, not straight down through the plane of the runway. This is also why planes roll forward on the runway if you don\u0027t set the brakes... gravity is pulling them \u0022downhill\u0022 toward the middle of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the yaw, since the plane is technically on a slight gravitational slope, dropping off to the right because the center of KSC is south of the runway, the right-side wheel has a tiny bit more weight resting on it. So, the planes tend to to turn. This \u0022slope\u0022 also exacerbates any flexing in your craft due to its weight... parts will preferentially shift to the right, creating even more of an imbalance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-01T13:12:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2014 01:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirSock","CreatedById":110333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T13:40:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to tone down the mid-air unplanned rapid dis-assemblies?
