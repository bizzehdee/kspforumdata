It all depends on how you hold it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the limbs snap forwards as the string is released, they enact a force on the bow that pushes it backwards, into your hand. When the limbs stop moving in their neutral position, they enact a force that pulls the bow forwards, out of your hand.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf nothing held the bow at all, these forces would cancel each other out - it\u0026#39;s simply a case of two identical opposing forces of acceleration acting on identical masses. The bow will lurch a small distance backwards, but otherwise return to being at rest. (Unless an arrow is fired, but we will ignore that here.) But because your hand is holding the bow as you release the string, you absord the force that pushes the bow backwards. If you do not continue holding onto the bow to [I]also[/I] absorb the opposing force, that force will pull the bow forwards out of your hand, and in microgravity it will continue drifting forwards.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen an arrow is involved, the bow works like a rocket engine, and accelerates itself backwards by accelerating the arrow forwards. This effect is independent of the one described above, but the forces will of course combine to determine the final movement of the bow, if the bow is allowed to move (not held).\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-22T10:36:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2015 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1of6Billion","CreatedById":46191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T11:31:21Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;m just curious...
