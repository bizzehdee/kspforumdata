If you keep the current-world constants but apply scaling on some dimensions, or just forget to do it for some part of the constants, then you\u0027ll see funny things - we\u0027ve already seen such scenario, most notably reentry heating, where the constants are fine-tuned for Kerbin and then see how it breaks other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go with \u0022R\u0022, better stick to the \u0022R\u0022 data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T02:09:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERSS isn\u0027t stable?
