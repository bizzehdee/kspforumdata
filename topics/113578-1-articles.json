If you\u0027re going for SR71 style then you\u0027ve got two engine pods to work with.. so either rapiers (don\u0027t add the turbojets inline behind them.. it\u0027s weight you probably don\u0027t need and on the technicality - that\u0027s not an SSTO) or turbojets with perhaps aerospikes clipped in on top of them, which is kinda cheat-y but if you\u0027re going for visuals works pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the thing is, with those two engine pods, you look way too heavy. You\u0027re just not going to be able to push that much fuel up to the 900-1000m/sec you want to be hitting before you start burning oxidiser. Empty some of those tanks or switch them for cargo bays and have something you can use as a shuttle to deploy probes/etc from. The liquid fuel in your engine pods there (what\u0027s that, a precooler and mk1 LF?) should do you for your atmospheric flight, and you probably ought to be able to get your rocket thrust from a single one long Mk2 LF\u002BO tanks (with the mk2-mk1 adapter at the tail there as well).

From the looks of it they\u0027re right there at your CoM and CoL and are likely going to be of limited usefulness.. they should be trailing your CoM to add a little drag at the rear to keep your nose pointed straight ahead. Personally I\u0027d get rid of the \u0022pairing up\u0022 of them like you have and try to get them a little more to the rear. (That probably goes for your entire wing assembly, actually.) Also make sure you right-click them in the SPH to set the control surfaces to yaw only - particularly with them being off-vertical like that the system will likely try to use them for roll and pitch control as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso.. yup, bigger control surfaces will help with your pitch control (take a look at a diagram form of the SR-71 - those elevons really are huge).. vernor engines and RCS is not something you should be mucking with. If you want, you could also use the small rectangular wing sections and strakes to extend your wingform up the sides of the main body toward the nose, and tuck some little elevons up the front there to act like canards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, you could continue the SR-71 theme and use fuel control to shift your CoM around. Either disable fuel flow on your rearmost tanks from launch or alt-right click a pair of tanks to transfer fuel in-flight to make it a bit more tail-heavy and help get your nose up... be very careful there though.. too much will make you flip uncontrollably.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T03:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI concur with the earlier responses.
