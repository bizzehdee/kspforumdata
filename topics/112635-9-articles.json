A quick progress update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it looks like IVA\u0027s are on the bottom of the list (can\u0027t say you guys disappointed me with that one) I\u0027ve decided that before plowing off into a whole new collection of models for larger boats, I need to fix what I have, make it a \u0027final\u0027 product and then, stop fiddling with it. Then I can move on to bigger boats and more fun parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here\u0027s the current state of a retexture. These two parts, the clipper bow and hull, represent about 10 hours worth of work and it\u0027s still not right. One of the problems I\u0027m having, are the sculpers. It seems that shading and texturing programs, like Unity, don\u0027t appreciate it when you punch holes in your models. Since creating the sculpers, they\u0027ve had an odd shading around them. It\u0027s due to the way 3D moddeling works. Everything gets turned into triangles. A sculper is a circle inside a square. (In the model above you can open \u0027rendering options\u0027 and click on the wireframe color and it\u0027ll show the model\u0027s wire frame. Note the two forward holes in the bow deck have an extra circle.) It doesn\u0027t make for good triangles. So, when light hits it, reflections get cast in all sorts of strange directions. The process now is to break it all down into smaller and smaller bits by adding more polygons and thus, smaller surfaces for those strange shadows to get cast off of. Well, that\u0027s the theory I\u0027ve been told. I wished it worked that day. They\u0027re still not coming out right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll also note, this model is vertical. KSP expects everything to be built vertically. I guess there are no horizontal rockets. So, I\u0027ve had to build my boats vertically. The model above is a direct export from Wings 3D (the 3d modeller I use).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext problem is curvature and seams. Guys who mod rockets have life pretty easy. Their stuff is mostly tall, round and flat. In order to hide ugly seams between parts, they can put goofy things in there to distract you from the seam (which is why the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115747-Poster-Making-Challenge-%28Recruitment-Posters%29?p=1845087\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1845087\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eorange rockomax tank looks like a soda can\u003C/a\u003E). Boats are mostly seamless (except for maybe welds) Boats also curve in all sorts of odd angles. Making a waterline look even from stem to stern is... a bit of a challenge. And adding text to a surface that bends in all 3 directions is another fun bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, since the current prop is pretty crude, here\u0027s one I tinkered with. Not sure if it\u0027ll make production but it\u0027s looking better. This one has a lot of polygons though. I try to keep the count a lot lower than this. But, to look good, takes polygons. (btw, this is a horrid jpg, it looked better in my modeller). Why a new prop? The stern will get a minor workover when I get to it for textures. The current prop location was a quick fix.
