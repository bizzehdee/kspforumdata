The thing is, I don\u0027t really want to use chutes that will weigh more than I absolutely need... am I going to have to get the mass of each stage separately and set the chutes manually? I\u0027ve noticed that the auto setting is always bringing me down slower than I set, so I\u0027d like to know how this works. Thanks. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarwaster is right, it uses the full mass of the current vessel in the VAB, dry or wet depending on what option you select. Either You create the booster separately and adjust it, either you enter the mass manually. Then again, parachutes don\u0027t have that much mass, you shouldn\u0027t be saving more than 0.1-0.2t\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Haguruma","CreatedById":116763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T03:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewas this updated and if so how? what?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T05:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Haguruma\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Haguruma\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewas this updated and if so how? what?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast update was 27th of December, last month.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing new since then but he posted about some things he\u0027d like to do a few pages back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T18:15:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sumghai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sumghai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe question I pondered with my proposal was - what would this initial offset / velocity be?
