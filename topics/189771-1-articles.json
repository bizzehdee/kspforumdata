Now it no longer fades and I never knew how jarring it is until I lost that feature. During burns or even launches in their cruise phase Id pan out to get a break from the sound and watch the vehicle streak though the sky. And especially with flying aircraft for long periods of time. I have to mute the game now. It sucks. Is there any word from Squad on if this is even getting fixed and returning?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-13T17:44:58Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2019 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
