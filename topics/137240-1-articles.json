Squad did it with Dres: just get procedural asteroids to generate around it to form the rings. Totally crazy idea: could you make a mod that adds the planet J1407b and it\u0027s rings? It\u0027s rings in real life are 90 million kilometres (0.6AU) across, hence the \u0022crazy idea\u0022 part. They would be scaled down in KSP but still pretty massive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
