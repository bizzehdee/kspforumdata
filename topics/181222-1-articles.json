Unfortunately, it could not be done. The converter simulates the left joystick or right joystick by moving the mouse. When you press ESC \u002B Insert on the keyboard - the converter simulates the left one and when you press ESC \u002B Delete - simulates the right one. But in KSP EE you use two joysticks at the same time. You would have to constantly switch between what the mouse simulates. That would be impractical and time-consuming.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I do not advise you to buy such converters for use with KSP EE. They are optimized for use in FPP games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"naldin","CreatedById":195252,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-05T00:35:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought about this too, but using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://blog.gimx.fr/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egimx\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0project.
