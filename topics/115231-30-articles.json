Sampa, though barely surviving his encounter with Xannari, has been left mentally scarred (so Citadel psychologists say). With the final defeat of Xannari, Sampa was hailed as a hero.

This is only a temporary arrangement while he recovers. I suppose it was only natural that since the Citadel is his child that he should play an active role in its use as a government. Politically, the Citadel turned out to be the best thing for the galaxy, not the white elephant that many believed it would be. Since the events of last year, countless new factions have set up embassies in the Citadel and applied to be on the council.
