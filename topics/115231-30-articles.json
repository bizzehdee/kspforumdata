It was intended to skip the Petahelix factor by being capable of up to Helix Factor 9; 9 Giga parsecs per second. That\u0027s pretty silly fast]\n\n[Exahelix 1 was also intended to be a weapon of supermassive destruction, only to be used as a last resort, and in the name of the Great Attractor. If laced with Verterons, it has the power to create a black hole. Exact power output is projected to be 1400 Brontojoules, but it\u0027s way, way too high to safely measure from practically any distance]\n\n[And lastly, Sampa was tasked with guarding the Great Attractor. Information in Xannari\u0027s database is for his eyes only. Sampa, and only Sampa is to live in the base.

Sampa, though barely surviving his encounter with Xannari, has been left mentally scarred (so Citadel psychologists say). With the final defeat of Xannari, Sampa was hailed as a hero. Upon speaking with him myself, however, I do not see him as such. He is only a small man trying to atone for his mistakes. I suppose that, given the circumstances which he was faced with, anyone would crack under the pressure.\n\nOver the past year, while Sampa recovered, he acted as a liaison for the Cerberus government in the Citadel. This is only a temporary arrangement while he recovers. I suppose it was only natural that since the Citadel is his child that he should play an active role in its use as a government. Politically, the Citadel turned out to be the best thing for the galaxy, not the white elephant that many believed it would be. Since the events of last year, countless new factions have set up embassies in the Citadel and applied to be on the council. I believe that things are on the up and up for this galaxy.\n\nCerberus has not forgotten the court martial however, and at the beginning of this year, scheduled the first meeting. to see if he has recovered enough, mentally, to begin his trial. I do not want to think about what will occur if they find him guilty of the charges. Even now, Sampa prepares to go to the Cerberus Admiralty for the meeting.\n\nAdmiral Hackett\n\nC-Sec\n\n(hope you guys appreciate this small prologue I wrote to kick off Part II.
