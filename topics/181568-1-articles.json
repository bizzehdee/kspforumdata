Well after hundreds of hours of design testing(mostly failures, such as\u00A0not enough thrust/too much drag to reach \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, many Duna bellyflops, and a few unplanned dissasemblys ripping through Laythe\u2019s atmosphere) I\u2019ve finally managed to create something worth posting about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission I did consisted of flying an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E I named Intrepid(not original but it\u2019s the best I could think of at the time)to Laythe and back with a stop on Duna to refuel on the way, land on Laythe, refuel for the ride home, and get back in one piece. I have to say everything went smoothly except when I was close to touchdown on Duna I didn\u2019t notice I was as close to the ground as I was, pulled up last second, and had the most Kerbal style landing I\u2019ve ever had. The kraken were definitely taking the day off that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. \u00A0You can see for yourself in the video clips at the end. \u00A0This mission was done on KSP Enhanced Edition for Xbox one so completely stock, no debug menu \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/LeEKaqq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/gallery/LeEKaqq\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are links to the landing videos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna Landing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/2QqtUsJy8eg?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe Landing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ASSNbDuQ3I?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReturning to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/RWVALZHawjA?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbalstar","CreatedById":154159,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-21T15:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally cool!

The skill didn\u2019t come naturally though.. \u00A0just LOTS of practice and testing as I\u2019m sure most of you know. This flight was actually supposed to be just a test flight to see if the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E design would make it to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with adequate fuel left over and since that went so well I said hey let\u2019s see if this baby can fly to and land/take off from Duna. \u00A0Since that was successful I just kept going on to Laythe.
