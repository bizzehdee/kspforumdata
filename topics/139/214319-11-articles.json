Right now the game is rating mixed with only 50 percent positive ratings which is heartbreaking. Many of us are excited about the future of Kerbal but hearing more from the devs may restore trust in the project and dev team. I would be lying if I said there has been a loss of trust out there after the launch of the game.

Early on you want to iterate fast and refactor a lot. Integration tests are pretty cumbersome to make and they tend to be fragile. That means that when the product is undergoing rapid changes, the integration tests will be continuously breaking, and you\u0027ll have to spend a lot of effort maintaining them. This has two pernicious consequences:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s time not spent iterating on the product.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s a disincentive to refactor. \u0022Okay this bit is a bit hairy and I\u0027d like to clean it up, but if I do that, the integration tests will break and I\u0027ll have to spend a half an hour putting them back together so **** it, I\u0027ll just hard-code it.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe upshot is that if you do this too early, you\u0027ll end up with a codebase that\u0027s WORSE than you would otherwise have -- your integration tests will have locked in a suboptimal architecture that\u0027s then too expensive to change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, integration tests (and unit tests for that matter!) can only control regression. A test won\u0027t catch a bug that you don\u0027t know about. It\u0027ll just catch when old things break unexpectedly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think that KSP2 is especially handicapped for integration tests because most of the test tooling available for Unity makes a lot of assumptions that simply don\u0027t hold -- like, you\u0027re controlling a \u0022character\u0022 who\u0027s in a \u0022scene\u0022 doing stuff like \u0022interacting with entities.\u0022 To be able to even make proper integration tests for KSP2 you\u0027d need to do a lot of work completely from scratch!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntegration tests should go in when the product is stable, and even then you should think carefully about just how comprehensive you want them to be.
