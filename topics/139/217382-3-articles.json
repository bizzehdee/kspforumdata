First, is a release view with blocks for each quarter and a list of features marked for this release. They don\u0027t go more than a couple quarters out as these features are in the high assurance category. The other view is a progress tracker, which lists most features in a sort of time line along with the teams who are working on them and when. This is connected to their internal Jira system and delayed by a couple of weeks. There are of course some features they deem \u0022redacted\u0022 so as to give us something to thirst for, but much of it is open because millions of players are watching, testing, and submitting bug reports to the issue council or contributing to reports, voting them up and making them more visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeekly video showcasing some aspects of development, including white boxing, grey boxing, and in engine testing, even if it\u0027s not stable because they can always edit out the breaks and try another take. These videos are usually 10-20 minutes long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeekly behind the scenes video usually as a way of getting to know the employees and what they\u0027re working on. Sometimes it has nothing to do with actual production but more about their background and what they had done before. Other times they demonstrate the tools they are using (artists love this) or do Q\u0026amp;A sessions about their area of responsibility in coding and development. There may be anywhere from 1 to 4 developers or other staff used in addition to the host in these videos and being on Twitch Live, they give players a chance to react and respond or ask questions on the spot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatch notes and testing releases. These are first sent to a smaller group of players who sign an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E to test game patches and report on bugs that make it too unstable for a wider release. The patch notes and bug reports on these patches are not public. Then a quarterly release candidate moves into the first public wave, where players having a concierge status can perform the same tests and report on bugs. At this point, the patch notes are released publicly and not behind an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E but only a relatively small number of players can play and report. They will likely release their own YouTube content on these patches, making the state of development more known to the public. More weeks later, the next public wave introduces more players into testing. Now this is a game that has both a Live (long term) major version and a Player Test version. It is the test version that is going through these waves of tests by players. When it is deemed stable enough, the Live version is updated to the new major quarterly patch, which is similar to what you are doing now with KSP2. This sort of commits any changes and updates to the game and prevents players from using older versions. Those of us doing test patches have to have extra drive space for a separate and isolated copy but the same launcher is used to select which version we are playing or testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last is something you are already doing. Hosting a forum for discussion of problems, ideas, and events or challenges. That keeps us engaged but having developers engaged with us is what keeps us with you. This other game has two types of posts we can make. One is the traditional chat where content becomes lost over time, and the other is categorized discussion groups, where we create a discussion about a specific topic or idea and comments are shown either in their parent/child node view (replies indented and collapsible), or in order of posting date (user decides which view and what sort order). This view provides the user name of any user who replied to it in a linier list below the post as well as the user name of who the post replies to above it. Those names are links to the other replies or posts. This sort of category discussion view lasts longer in time and for the most part, remains within the context of the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

They owe those of us who paid for the EA a game that meets the goals they set out in the EA\u0027s initial roadmap, however long that takes. You can pout and stamp your foot all you want but it won\u0027t change anything. Nate sprinkling ashes on his head won\u0027t fix any bugs, improve performance, or implement any features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re really angry about the state of KSP2 now, I humbly suggest that you log off the forums and go build some rockets and rovers and aircraft in Tears of the Kingdom instead (the physics are \u003Ci\u003Eincredibly\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0robust and the game overall is so, so, so well executed it brings a tear to my eye). Then come back in six months or a year and see where the game is at. Raging about it here does nobody any good -- not you, not the forum community, not the developers, and not the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dakitess","CreatedById":89253,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-27T08:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy guys are you so upset and defending when someone says his opinion about the game, about a post, a communication ? Why always this need to invite someone to log off, to take rest, to go back after some months / patchs ? Like we are not capable enough thinking about it ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Mea Culpa is only an official post to say \u0022Okay, KSP2 is not what it is supposed to be right now, even for an EA, we aknowledge that, we know lot of things could have gone better, we heard you, and we will provide some information regarding the new honest dev plan we are looking to, as follow : blabla\u0022. This is not what we have here, do we agree ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not asking for Nate head or whatever the hyperbolic sentence you could say, it\u0027s ridicule.

A date from which things are going to be different, including transparency, honesty, and maybe a required reorganization. That\u0027s all, it does not need to be a new development, a new team, nope. But it\u0027s a personnal take, it\u0027s something I feel necessary. Nowhere did I said they owe us to do so, you\u0027re not saying much about it, they don\u0027t owe us much at all, good, let\u0027s move forward ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would not have insisted if comments were a bit more nuanced instead of 95% buying what is said : it\u0027s cool to be positive and optimistic, enjoying the new transparency and the news we are given. It is. But it\u0027s honestly quite lacking insights and contents, we were aware of most of this bugs being worked on, we knew there were various progress percentage about them. Now we can officially read it, good, but that\u0027s not anything particularly... meaningful, and theses states are not very reassuring either, don\u0027t you think ? Soooo, now that there is so many compliments, that you\u0027re free to consider deserved, can I nuance it with my own comment, the only one so far being quite negative ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027ll keep \u0022complaining\u0022 as long as I feel it\u0027s serving a purpose, as an humble no-one here, to discuss about the game, to keep it alive showing that we are a lot a bit depressed about it, but still hoping for the best rather than deserting the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd please, learn to nuance and moderate your words.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-27T09:18:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2023 09:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Dakitess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wyleg","CreatedById":157764,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-27T09:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDevs are paid primarily to deliver a game, everything else, including public relations, is secondary.
