Now I must do my penance by explaining what it looks like from the other side!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure one of our producers could give you a more precise answer, but here\u0027s the general idea: every time we release an update, we essentially take a snapshot build of the game and then test it like crazy. That uses up a huge amount of QA bandwidth, and for a game like KSP2 it really is a non-trivial amount of work to test it in a way that approximates the range of activities that the entire community might get up to in the game. As they test that snapshot build, they sometimes discover bugs. Many of them (hopefully most of them) will be known bugs that are already tracked and that we\u0027re already working on. But some of these bugs might actually be new bugs that have emerged since the last update. Those point to unintended outcomes related to recent checkins -- i.e. by fixing one problem, we have created a new problem. We are trying very hard to hold ourselves to the standard of \u0022the game should get better with every update,\u0022 and that means that we take this sort of bug very seriously. This means that when such a bug arises, production and engineering go over these issues with a fine-tooth comb and figure out what broke, and then additional fixes are applied to the build until it\u0027s in a good state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as you may have noticed, getting a candidate build to a level of quality that it\u0027s safe to release involves a lot of coordinated activity among a lot of people who also need to be advancing other areas of the game (for example bringing about perf improvements or working on roadmap features). Our update cadence is therefore carefully balanced against our need to keep pushing the entire game forward toward 1.0.\u00A0 Of course I would love to drop an update every day like the update Easter Bunny, but the reality is that each update comes with a cost, and we want to have the bandwidth to work on cool stuff like Colonies and Interstellar too. With that in mind, and because we want each update to contain lots of meaningful improvements, we can\u0027t release rapid-fire updates. HarvesteR was amazing and deserves his godlike status in this community, and I remember hanging on to his every post back when he was updating KSP. But I suspect that he was also constrained by similar production realities.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, I think it\u0027s safe to say that our key focus today is to correct issues that affect the quality of gameplay, which means performance bugs, bugs that stop some players from being able to play the game at all, bugs that result in loss of vehicle, bugs that result in mission failure, bugs that result in the game crashing, and bugs that ruin campaign saves. When such fixes are complete, we do not intend to sit on them for a long time. One of life\u0027s great frustrations is to read a complaint about a bug online and know that it\u0027s been fixed internally. As long as the wait between updates may feel on the outside, let me assure you that it feels even longer on the inside!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163018-nestor/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022163018\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163018-nestor/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@nestor\u003C/a\u003Eis going to yell at me for speaking about this topic in a sloppy fashion, and I encourage him to join me in this thread if he\u0027d like to add more to my explanation.

I could be wrong but I don\u0027t think these thoughts could be completely nonsense:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt is everyone\u0027s goal to eliminate the unexpected behaviors before publishing something, but in large systems this can be unrealistic. KSP 1 has been released for about 8 years from now and there was still a patch/bugfix last November. Presumably if you want to make KSP 2 perfect it would be another 8 years - no one can wait a single patch for such a long time. A more practical way might be updating in a more frequent manner and optimize iteratively.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn KSP 2 we have much more features on the way, and thus we can expect more bugs ahead. By sending out patches every several weeks it can be hard to imagine this game leaving the EA stage within several years.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are different levels of bugs. The most serious ones at present are significantly degrading the gameplay experience: orbit is unstable upon time warp / EVA, velocities are predicted incorrectly upon exiting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of some celestial bodies ... for bugfixes against these issues every minute counts. No one can expect a complete journey to \u0026amp; from Minmus without S/L after a week of the release, and this is even just a satellite around Kerbin. It\u0027s okay if we don\u0027t have every single string translated correctly in the first week, but it can be lethal for a simulator if it does not have its physics working in a proper manner for a week or more - which is happening.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe community is way larger than a QA team. It certainly cannot do whatever a QA team could do, but on certain aspects it\u0027s way more efficient - that\u0027s why we have EA. But to fully utilize this property you would be in need of active responses to it. No player would stay 24/7 in the forum waiting for a solution or update for a single bug uncovered. Nor will a player report similar things to you twice - until a new release is available and the issue still unresolved. If the input from the community is of importance, then please consider more communications and updates.

KSP 1 has been released for about 8 years from now and there was still a patch/bugfix last November. Presumably if you want to make KSP 2 perfect it would be another 8 years - no one can wait a single patch for such a long time. A more practical way might be updating in a more frequent manner and optimize iteratively.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn KSP 2 we have much more features on the way, and thus we can expect more bugs ahead.

And yes, I keep bringing it up because they supposedly can ask for more resources if needed, pretty sure Take2 isn\u0027t just making IG crunch and receive a lot of profit from their hardwork while IG doesn\u0027t get to enjoy the benefits of having a triple-A publisher backing them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther triple-A games that were launched into EA had patches just a few days after release, it didn\u0027t take long, and if they were game breaking bugs they would have the top priority. What I mentioned about a day-0 patch is simple, if the game was locked for release, you can work on a patch, release the game, if everything went well, release the patch you\u0027ve been working on for the past weeks. But it doesn\u0027t seem like IG was working on anything after the launch and it looks like they just found out about the bugs after the EA release. Which brings to another point, how come their QA team didn\u0027t pick up the issues most players are having now? Do they even have a QA team?
