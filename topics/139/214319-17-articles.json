I think the game is rather far behind most EA games on launch in terms of a fully operable game. It\u0027s not that most people that have an idea about how betas and EA work are upset that it\u0027s not \u0022fully functional\u0022 but rather that for many, its barely functional at all. Wobbly rockets, performance, camera drifting from craft mid flight, decoupler bugs, etc etc. You and a lot of others may be having fun because you managed your own expectations in a more reserved way, or just aren\u0027t having the same bugs, but in my opinion, unless you were really wary or maybe had some inside knowledge before release, you couldn\u0027t have known it was going to be so difficult for so many to even test some of the major bugs, because other bugs are blocking them from even progressing beyond building a model rocket.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4inbrain","CreatedById":108770,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-10T10:48:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBit torn on this one, i\u0027ll be honest.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn one hand, of course any information is appreciated, the launch as we know didn\u0027t go very well - so as much as anyone else, i want to soak up information as to when and how the game becomes what it\u0027s supposed to be. So in that regard, yay Nate, cheers for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there\u0027s a second side to that medal: very clearly it has been stated that the patch takes so long due to vigorous testing. Something i actually very much doubt after the statements that KSP2 was delayed for over a year for \u0022polish\u0022 to then release as something that can reasonably called \u0022quite a mess\u0022. More importantly though, if this patch finally arrives and it breaks things in a quite obvious way or for systems that are fundamental to the\u00A0 game, i\u0027m not quite sure where \u0022we\u0022 go from there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, orbits. As we know, orbits are a bit in an odd place right now - and there really isn\u0027t an excuse to miss that. It\u0027s fundamental to the gameplay - if you play KSP2, you \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eto do orbital stuff eventually. So missing the decaying orbits (or as another example, docking ports creating drag behind a nose cone etc) in a game that was delayed for polish, or QA tested, i don\u0027t know Jim.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, if the game breaks after some obscure krakenhunting, as in trying to intentionally break the physics etc - eh. It\u0027s what it is, i don\u0027t expect Devs to spend as much time on trying to break the game as Stratzenblitz does - but if it\u0027s fundamental stuff, .. yeah, i can see how this can become a \u0022make or break\u0022 moment for the game, and Nates post basically puts a gun on his chest.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally i\u0027m fine with where the game\u0027s at - i played for a whopping hour, and then continued Hogwarts/Roguetech for the last week or two. Yeah it sucks that it got released this way, but i\u0027m not going to lose sleep over it. What \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eimportant to me though is how they move from here, and how they present themselves. Nates post does raise hope - but actions are louder than words. If the next patch is a good addition, great, worth waiting for - if it\u0027s yet another mess, it\u0027s going to be pretty hard to explain/justify that away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-10T10:51:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2023 10:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by m4inbrain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BmB","CreatedById":42188,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-10T14:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarly Access is, once again, NO EXCUSE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarly Access games must still be working games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this was a closed alpha I\u0027d say whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this is a finished product that costs 50\u20AC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStop using that excrementsty excuse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224255621\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214319\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678381656\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227608\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rits\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Rits said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCP2077 was not recalled, no platform besides play station stopped selling the game due to its un-playability.
