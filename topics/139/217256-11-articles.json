Fair is criticism and fair is disappointment. Surely those who expect more are more disappointed. The most patient, or conformist, do not feel so disappointed and for this reason, perhaps, they are less negative. But he is also very right in saying that the forum becomes toxic at times. I think we should continue to express ourselves, but let\u0027s try to be constructive. And this is my contribution: I think that no one in that company is qualified to hire the half dozen programmers that they lack. As much as we complain, that is a reality.

The degree to which I personally wish a bug would get fixed actually has very little impact on the speed with which it is remedied. We have a priority list, and we take on those\u00A0bugs in priority order. We have excellent people working on those issues. I can see with my own eyes that they\u0027re as eager to see those bugs go down as I am, so there\u0027s not much more that I or anybody else can do but to let them do their work in peace.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWe - meaning, our team and the game\u0027s fans - are going to be living together with this game for many years.

Our artists and part designers have their own schedules and milestones, and that work continues to take place while other performance or stability-facing work goes on elsewhere. I like to be able to show off what those people are working on during my Friday posts - it\u0027s visual, it\u0027s fun, and I\u0027m actually quite excited about grid fins! They\u0027re cool, and the people who are building them are excited about them, too. So I\u0027m going to share that work even if there is other ongoing work that\u0027s\u00A0taking\u00A0longer to complete.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA few people are worried that because I haven\u0027t yet posted an itemized list of bugs to be knocked out in the next update, that the update will not contain many bug fixes. As with earlier pre-update posts, I will provide more detail about what\u0027s being fixed when we have confirmation from QA that the upgrades hold up to rigorous testing. As much as I love being the bearer of good news, I am trying also to avoid the frustration that\u0027s caused when we\u00A0declare\u00A0something fixed and it turns out not to be. I will err on the side of conservatism and withhold the goodies until they are confirmed good.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe June update timing does not mean \u0022June 30.\u0022 It means that I cannot yet give you a precise estimate about which day in June will see the update. When I do know that precise date, I will share it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWe continue to keep close track of the bugs that are most frequently reported within\u00A0the community, and that guidance shapes our internal scheduling. As a regular player of the game myself, my personal top ten maps very closely to what I\u0027ve seen in bug reports, here on the forums, on reddit, and on Steam. The degree to which I personally wish a bug would get fixed actually has very little impact on the speed with which it is remedied. We have a priority list, and we take on those\u00A0bugs in priority order. We have excellent people working on those issues. I can see with my own eyes that they\u0027re as eager to see those bugs go down as I am, so there\u0027s not much more that I or anybody else can do but to let them do their work in peace.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWe - meaning, our team and the game\u0027s fans - are going to be living together with this game for many years. As aggravating as the current situation may be, and as much as I wish we could compress time so that the waiting was less, all I can do for now is to keep playing the game and reporting on what I experience. The game will continue to get better, and in the meantime I will choose to interpret the passionate posts here on the forums as an expression of the same passion that I feel for the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks as always for your patience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, it\u0027s really good to see you coming back to one of these threads when the main discourse is critical instead of praising, hope this becomes a habit, and thank you for your time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just find it necessary to repeat that, track record aside, speaking of this or that bug being near done, acknowledged and so on is almost useless without a public bugtracker. Darrin mentioned the topic was in the talking stage back in one of the replies to his blog, May 4, so have the talks advanced since then? As for the update timing, saying it\u0027s not \u0022June 30\u0022 can be as counterproductive as saying it is June 1, and whilst I\u0027m completely in favor of firm compromise with dates (shows professionalism and what not), if it comes out June 29, being \u0022technically\u0022 correct won\u0027t do any good in this case. After all, June starts literally next week, so it\u0027s safe to assume it\u0027s not gonna be that early in the month either\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-22T18:20:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224286177\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217256\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221684769065\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212979\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gussi111\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, gussi111 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou think that people are saying these things just to make KSP 2 sound as negative as possible or are they doing it because they are wishing for the game to succeed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the fact they go back and forth on whether bug trackers are good or not is anything to go off of, the former.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Davidian1024","CreatedById":210190,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-22T18:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224286233\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217256\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221684779626\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258026\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, PDCWolf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...it\u0027s really good to see you coming back to one of these threads when the main discourse is critical instead of praising...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to echo this sentiment.\u00A0 I\u0027ve been really taken aback by alot of the negativity on this forum in general.\u00A0 I know I couldn\u0027t handle Nate\u0027s job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say I tend to be quiet and not engage.\u00A0 As someone who, overall has been quite pleased with the game so far, I\u0027m regretting having been quiet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-22T19:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224286230\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217256\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221684778838\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210190\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Davidian1024\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n57 minutes ago, Davidian1024 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough, I think my idea of what the basic foundations are is different.\u00A0 I would include science.\u00A0 And colonies and interstellar.\u00A0 I actually want colonies and interstellar really badly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, me, too!
