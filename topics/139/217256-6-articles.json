Long before I was a moderator, I, too was a regular forum player back when KSP (the original) was in 0.22. And believe me, there were tons of bugs, a lot like we are experiencing now in KSP2. Some of the bugs were downright funny and others were infuriating, often crashing the game to the desktop and corrupting the saved game file. Ah, yeah, those were the days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 is no different. We all knew there would be bugs with KSP2 being in EA. And while you are free to disagree with one another, personally attacking one another is never the right thing to do. Also, being rude is also never a good thing. And while we are on the topic of those \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/guidelines/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eforum guidelines\u003C/a\u003E, those are still applicable on ANY and all parts of the forum. So, when any member of the moderation team does make a decision to merge threads or hide posts, the decision was not made in haste or without great thought.
