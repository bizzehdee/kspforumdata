IG is a studio created by Take2 after they cancelled the contract with Star Theory (which was contracted to develop KSP2 and Take2 attempted to purchase them, only for the CEOs to refuse and Take2 poach half of its employees).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, IG was created by T2, but T2 still sets the deadlines, sets the prices, and does the marketing. The studio only produces the game and works with what they get from the publisher. Their owners/founders have no bearing on the working relationship between publisher and studio, perhaps only other than budget and talent from other publisher owned studios getting poached.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow well this worked out in the end?

Developing a stable release build for an early access title is a massive task. Combine that with the hype the publisher has built around the game, and you run in to what we have got.\u003Cbr\u003E\nInterviews with Nate show he clearly knows of the current dev build state that they have in-house, and is genuinely proud of it. That speaks volumes about what the studio has done, versus the hand the publisher has dealt them.

The patches are up to the developers to release, aren\u0027t they?

They\u0027re not delayed at all. They\u0027ve said pretty much on day 1 to keep an eye out for upcoming patches.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNate has even said they\u0027re keeping them to every few weeks to ensure the patches are thorough, and have sufficient time to QA test the patches.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe devs are also human beings coming out of a release crunch.

My point is, they know exactly what\u0027s going on and the way they handled it just tells me and other fans that they shouldn\u0027t be trusted at all. It feels like they\u0027re dropping an F-bomb to fans while trying to not make it look obvious by releasing occasional updates to pretend they\u0027re working on something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis just reads disingenuous. Rushed release date = Crunch to put together something to launch. Watch Shadow zones interview, with Nate the week before launch. They obviously knew about the bugs, and obviously already had their minds set on patches. Why wouldn\u0027t they? They\u0027ve engaged very frequently and publicly with the community, and have channels with content creators to feedback prevalent bugs as well.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t understand why you think IG have done anything other than their very best.
