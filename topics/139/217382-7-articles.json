My last post here received a lot of comments, many of which expressed doubt, frustration, and in some cases even anger about either the seeming lack of progress on KSP2 or the perception that I am concealing some dark reality about the state of the game. Our team has been reading your comments and asking one another if there\u2019s some way we can do better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past, every item in these forum posts has had to cross a threshold of certainty - I don\u2019t want to announce some new feature or target date, only to experience a trust-eroding failure to follow through. I feel this burden especially keenly because in the past I have personally announced dates that turned out to be incorrect. For that reason, I have avoided talking about features in progress, bugs under investigation, or internal delivery deadlines. With a game this complex, nothing is ever assured until it has been thoroughly tested by QA. When you combine this \u0022stay quiet until you\u2019re absolutely sure\u0022 ethos with a more dispersed update cadence, what you get is long periods of silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, of course I haven\u2019t gone literally silent. I still post here every week. Before each post goes out, I meet with the production and community teams to review the past week\u2019s progress, and a great many exciting developments are discussed. They often take the form of \u0022we\u2019ve made great progress on x category of super annoying bug\u0022 or \u0022this feature looks good but we haven\u2019t had time to fully validate it yet.\u0022 By my standard of \u0022don\u2019t talk about it until it\u2019s truly done,\u0022 neither of those scenarios yields anything that\u2019s safe to post about. What is safe, then? Well, for the most part, content updates (new art, new parts, new graphics improvements) come along in nice, neat little parcels that are not only visually pleasing, but also unlikely to generate an unmet expectation. They\u2019re fun and they\u2019re safe, and artists are always creating new content. So you see lots of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the other thing you see lots of is some variation on \u0022improved stability and performance.\u0022 That\u2019s my catch-all term for that very meaningful category of progress that, because of my reluctance to write bad checks, can\u2019t yet be talked about in detail. When I hold back on such items, I comfort myself that the less I reveal now, the more surprising the patch notes will be when we finally release them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, I\u2019m questioning my choice to withhold information about systems in progress. Yes, there\u2019s always the chance that when we talk about a feature in development, that we\u2019re also creating an expectation that the feature will be present in the next update. Similarly daunting is the possibility that we\u2019ll announce that we\u2019re working on something that the community perceives as \u0022easy\u0022 (an especially common situation when we\u2019re working on a feature that is already functional in the original KSP), and then take such a long time delivering that feature that people may decide we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. In such cases, we then need to take the time to explain in technical detail why the implementation of such and such a feature is non-trivial in KSP2. Increased transparency carries costs, and those costs always have to be balanced against other feature-facing work we could be doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I\u2019m going to try to do right now is to extend some trust to you. I\u2019m going to talk about a few things that are not yet complete so that you can at least see some of the ropes we\u2019re hauling on every day - some of which may prove to be long. This list is not exhaustive (there are dozens of people working on dozens of items simultaneously, and there are some features that we really do want to be surprises), but it will hopefully give you some visibility into the breadth of issues we\u2019re tackling. Please do not assume that if a bug didn\u2019t get mentioned in this list that it is unknown to us or not being worked on \u2014 this is a top-ten list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur bug prioritization is broadly guided by the following logic:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCategory A: any bug that causes loss of a vehicle in flight (physics issues, trajectory instability, decoupling instability, loss of camera focus, unexpected part breakage/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCategory B: any bug that affects the fidelity or continuity of a saved game (rigidbody degradation, save file inflation, loss of vehicle or Kerbal during instantiation or focus switching)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCategory C: any bug that negatively affects the expected performance of a vehicle (drag occlusion, staging issues, thrust asymmetry, joint wobbliness, landing leg bounciness)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCategory D: any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E bug that prevents the player from creating the vehicle they want to make (symmetry bugs, fairing/wing editor bugs, strut instability, inconsistent root part behavior)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile there are many bugs that live outside these four categories (and in some cases, such bugs end up getting sorted out during normal feature development), the four categories above are the biggest fun killers.

Obviously, now that we are layering in progression mechanics (Science gathering and transmission, missions, and R\u0026amp;D tech tree) in preparation for downstream Roadmap updates, the importance of addressing these issues only increases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, here are a few of the biggest issues we\u2019re wrangling with right now:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVehicles in stable coasting orbits sometimes experience orbit instability/decay - \u003Ci\u003EStatus: possible fix in progress\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTrajectories change when vehicles cross \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E boundaries - \u003Ci\u003EStatus: fix in progress (see below)\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCertain inline parts cause aerodynamic drag numbers to spike - \u003Ci\u003EStatus: under investigation\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nReturning to craft from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E causes craft to go underground (possibly related to Kerbals and landed vehicles dropping through terrain while being approached) - \u003Ci\u003EStatus: possible fix being tested\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDecoupling events result in various issues including loss of control, incorrect controllability of decoupled subassemblies, loss of camera focus, and other issues - \u003Ci\u003EStatus: may have many causes, but some fixes in progress (see below)\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSave files get bigger over time (TravelLog experiencing \u0022landed\u0022 status spam) - \u003Ci\u003EStatus: fix being tested\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOpening part manager causes major frame lag - \u003Ci\u003EStatus: experiments ongoing\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMajor post-liftoff frame rate lag immediately above launchpad (associated with engine exhaust lighting) - \u003Ci\u003EStatus: fix being tested\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRoot parts placed below decouplers cause issues with stage separation - \u003Ci\u003EStatus: under investigation\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVehicle joints unusually wobbly, some part connections unusually weak - \u003Ci\u003EStatus: under investigation\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u2019re tracking down some strange vehicle behaviors associated with spurious autostrut errors. As we\u2019ve discussed here before, some radially-attached parts are reinforced by additional invisible autostruts to improve their stability. It turns out that these autostruts don\u2019t always break cleanly during decoupling events, and may be the cause of some of our more frustrating decoupling issues (including those where detached vehicle elements appear to still affect one another\u2019s behavior). We\u2019re still investigating this one, but we have high hopes that its correction will result in a reduction of mission-killing errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, we have zeroed in on the cause of some of the trajectory errors we\u2019ve been seeing - especially the situation in which a trajectory changes spontaneously when crossing an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E boundary. This one is deep in the code and its correction may end up fixing a few other downstream issues. This is a complicated problem, however, and we may not solve it in time for the June update.

That\u0027s especially the case when we have a successor where one of the main draw is adding new gameplay mechanics. Compare any MMO or one of my favorite games: Civ 4. Or even board games like Spirit Island. They were happy to communicate the basic design for new features like great people and religions would work. It\u0027s a slightly pessimistic take but with Intercept I often have the impression they are just adding systems as they go along, sometimes even creating the parts first. Speaking for myself, I was definitely not happy that the science post from a few weeks ago just showed off a part, instead of even talking a little bit about how the gameplay systems would work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve mentioned elsewhere that with one of the new gameplay features we have - burning while in time warp - I was disappointed that the implementation was very minimal and is currently not sufficient to support the kind of gameplay I would have liked to get out of that feature.
