If you divide those evenly across your point of ideal instantaneous ejection, i.e. where you\u0027d place the node in KSP1, your cosine losses up to that point are pretty trivial. If you\u0027re going to Duna or Eve, you can set up a Munar assist from there that will get you an intercept for less than another 100m/s.\u00A0 If you\u0027re not going to bother with that, you can do the rest for a little over 200 with just another final kick, still losing very little from boosting off prograde.\u00A0 If\u00A0 the destination is further out however, requiring more than ~400m/s above a minimal Kerbin escape trajectory, there are other things you can to reduce wasted \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E on the long final\u00A0 burn that\u0027s required. One of these is to raise your PE to 500-1000km from your distant\u00A0 AP,\u00A0 which\u00A0 costs you a little in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E terms due to Oberth losses, but more than pays for itself with the reduced cosine losses you\u0027ll suffer doing that long burn out of a slightly slower and significantly higher-radius orbit. If you\u0027re doing a Munar assist, you can also divide your final burn\u00A0 into two shorter ones at your Kerbin and Munar PEs, taking maximum advantage of the Oberth effect in both places. As I said before, I have done a whole lot of this sort of thing in KSP1, and planning such maneuvers under that system is something I can do in my sleep. In KSP2, I have still not figured out how to do it anywhere near this precisely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, for Tylo or any other vacuum body, the most efficient possible (theoretical) landing plan is to set your PE to zero and do an instantaneous retrograde burn of exactly your surface velocity at exactly that point.\u00A0 As this is of course impossible, the best physically plausible approximation of that is to plot a purely retrograde, continuously full thrust \u0022suicide\u0022 burn, starting at whatever point prior to that tangent PE that will bring your velocity to exactly zero when you reach the ground. This is not an easy thing to do, especially for Tylo, and definitely not something you want to attempt with a marginal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, but to the extent you can approximate that descent profile, you will make it more efficient.\u00A0 TBH, I never really use a maneuver node to try to set this up, because neither system will have you boosting in the most efficient, continuously retrograde manner. So I usually just seat-of-the-pants it, giving my F9 key some exercise if I come in hot or stop too short. On that score, I\u0027d say that stopping at 2km up\u00A0 on Tylo would probably be a do-over for me, as even a near-instantaneous braking burn near the ground from there will cost you over 210m/s, and in practice you\u0027ll probably spend closer to 400-500 to put yourself down safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-01T00:47:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224369357\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223815\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221709170197\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022112590\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022herbal space program\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, herbal space program said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, but exactly how much inward?
