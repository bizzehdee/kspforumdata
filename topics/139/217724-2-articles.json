If it\u0027s possible, we could have that core stage welded into one physics entity, unaffected by wobble, but the decouplers still utilize joint physics, and thus the boosters can wobble. So an actual Node connection should be as solid as steel (or aerospace grade aluminum) but lateral decouplers could be subject to wobble.

I mean it\u0027s not like United Launch Alliance, for their Vulcan rocket get six individual tanks and just \u0027stack them\u0027. It\u0027s a single, monolithic part. As such it would surely be treated by the Unity physics engine as just a single physics entity removing the issue with attachments and such.

Broadly, we see this as part of the Kerbal DNA, and want to preserve it in some form.

We of course are following community conversations with keen interest, and this is an area where Early Access participants can have a significant impact on the 1.0 version of KSP2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be quite frank: wobbly rockets should not be a thing, under virtually\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eany\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0circumstance. This sentiment of wobbly rockets being a core part of the KSP experience is in essence a glorification of a bug that got accepted by the community over time, born out of nostalgia. I want to remind the team that KSP2 can,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand should,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be its own distinct work. There\u0027s nothing wrong with wanting to keep features that made the original so beloved, but you really shouldn\u0027t be afraid to do away with features that just dont fit into the vision for KSP2.

Autostrut isnt the answer either, and i agree that it should only be applied as a last-ditch effort.

Biomes in and of itself are not a bad thing, but if you allow players to do each science experiment in every biome to gain science, it quickly becomes a chore rather than a joy. Having to biome hop from one bland, boring terrain to the next that looks virtually identical just to do the same experiments, both makes the process extremely boring and too easy. You are probably well aware of the fact that the tech tree in KSP1 was easily completable without ever leaving the Kerbin system in KSP1, which was a direct consequence of this issue. For starters, each biome should be unique and provide the player with a distinct feature of the celestial body. Good examples of this are Oceans, Beaches, Mountains,\u00A0 Craters and points of interest like the Mohole and Dres canyon. Bad examples of biomes are Lowlands, Midland, Highlands and patches of regular non-outstanding terrain/ocean that were just given a different name. A much better system for biomes would be a mix of microbiomes and larger visually/scientifically interresting biomes. For example: Ice Geysers, Volcanoes, Rock/Ice formations, Icebergs, Fissures, meteorite remains and similar small-scale surface features would make for great micro biomes. Examples of good \u0027mayor\u0027 biomes include (as mentioned before) Beaches, Oceans, Rivers, Craters/Crater rims, Regolith Patches, Mountains, Plateaus, Poles/Ice caps, Ancient River Deltas,\u00A0 Basaltic Plains/Mares, (Salt) Flats, Canyons/Cliffs, and all the one-of-a-kind point of interests. There is one big caveat with these though:\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eall of them should only be able to provide science\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eonce.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Naming different craters and having each be a different biome does not make a lot of sense in the context of science gain and quickly inflates the possible science gain from any given body. Entering a new location with the promise of a new biome, just to have it be one you\u0027ve previsouly visited but with a different name, was one of the biggest dissapointsments and sources of tediousness with the KSP1 biome system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother change from KSP1 that would tremendously increase the fun to be had in science mode is assigning each biome/situation with its own specific set of experiments instead of just allowing all of them. An example of this would be to have for example a Regolith Patch biome have experiments like \u0027regolith composition analysis\u0027, \u0027surface sampling\u0027 and \u0027test kinetic deformation\u0027, while a biome like the Crater could have \u0027Analyse Ice composition\u0027, \u0027measure light level\u0027 and \u0027Collect Meteorite Sample\u0027 as experiments. Some of these experiments could be made to randomly fail, forcing the player to move to a different closeby location where they have more luck (eg Ice might not be present in every crater). Some experiments could also be mutually exclusive; if already collected a meteorite sample from a \u0027Meteor Remains\u0027 microbiome, the experiment wouldn\u0027t be available in the Crater biome anymore. I understand that this would make for a very complex and intricate science system, but it would greatly improve the diversity of collecting science, balance science gains on any particular body, and break with the monoty of just performing the same experiments in the same situations over and over again. And implementing science in this manner also opens up what i think is a huge possibility:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbandoning science points entirely, and instead directly connecting branches of the tech tree doing experiments in specific situation. To illustrate this, lets look at a theorethical \u0027ground parts\u0027 tech branch in the tech tree; to unlock the first basic landing legs, you could simply have to recover a vessel after a flight on Kerbin. To unlock the next, you might have to either collect a surface sample or perform a rock analysis on a regolith patch, basaltic planes or salt flats biome biome on the Mun, Minmus. To unlock the next legs and/or wheels, you could either have to do the same thing but on a more difficult body to reach (like Ike or Gilly), perform a more advance experimenton the previous bodies, or collect Data from more biomes, and so on for the next level of tech in the branch. Having the tech tree work in this way adds a fun challenge while still alowing the player some freedom to choose how they go about aquiring a new part. It would also greatly compliment the new Mission system!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscovering different biomes was another one of KSP1s more lackluster aspects of science mode. This could very easily be remedied by having a family of parts that tell you which biomes ,are near, in what direction they are, and display the current biome on the HUD. these could be either different parts that each provide their own function, or one part for different tech levels that progressively adds more feauters. Another really handy feature to have would be a notification when the players enters a biome/situation where new science is available for the experiments that are present on the craft (could also be done with a dedicated part, or just be an option in the settings)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, a quick word on this sentence:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224293390\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217724\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221686938400\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205123\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nate Simpson\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Nate Simpson said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn all-new Science collection and transmission system\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way KSP1 required you to bring back most experients, sometimes even multiple times, for full science gain was not only annoying but also not very realistic. For the sake of gameplay,\u00A0 most science experiments in KSP2 should be a \u0027do it once and you\u0027re done\u0027 kinda thing, where transmitting the experiment gives you all science immediately. The exception to this would be surface samples and/or colected rock fragments, which would have to be returned to either Kerbin or a Colony/Space Station with processing facilities. This would greatly encourage the usage of science probes, and add some much needed functionality to space stations (and not in the \u0027put your science here and we\u0027ll double it\u0027 way). If you really want to add science experiments that cant be completed instantly, having some experiments that require time to complete would be a much better hands-off way to do it. Collecting data on a planets upper atmosphere for low orbit for example could be an experiment that requires ~a month of in-game time or so to complete, and would require you to do nothing more than place the science experiment in low orbit, start it, and come back later once you get the notification that it\u0027s finished.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the ted talk, this got a bit out of hand!

If the game detects that the joint wobble force is below (insert number here), the part doesnt wobble. This prevents the quantum wobbles that tears apart large space stations, while still allowing said space station to wobble when you strap 20 mammoth engines to the back of it. This could scale with part size of course.
