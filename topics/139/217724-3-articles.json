It would require more materials to make it less wobbly or more rigid and you can just click a \u0022scaler\u0022 that makes the entire rocket cost more or less, fewer materials.. Things can be categorized like \u0022fuel tanks\u0022 \u0022structural\u0022 \u0022Pods\u0022 \u0022Colonies\u0022 \u0022XYZ ABC\u0022 etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to not having \u0022time\u0022 and watching your rockets build slowly (i wish) just making it cost more materials and some additional research points doesn\u0027t seem like such a bad idea/plan, keeping the \u0022kerbal\u0022 way while also adding the want/need to push further for more stable and \u0022larger builds\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo starting off rockets can still be quite wobbly, but the people that dare go larger CAN but have a higher chance of wobbliness without upgrading anything. It makes sense from a logical stand point that while you progress further in the tech tree, the stronger your rockets are.. It creates a fine balance of \u0022expensive but will never fall apart\u0022 and \u0022should i cheap out on this build\u0022 etc. For me it creates a lot of ideas of what you can \u0022do\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand then it can just be simply turned off with a setting to ONLY have the strongest stability when it\u0027s disabled..

This sentiment of wobbly rockets being a core part of the KSP experience is in essence a glorification of a bug that got accepted by the community over time, born out of nostalgia. I want to remind the team that KSP2 can,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand should,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be its own distinct work. There\u0027s nothing wrong with wanting to keep features that made the original so beloved, but you really shouldn\u0027t be afraid to do away with features that just dont fit into the vision for KSP2. If you keep wobbly rockets now, you risk having to have to\u00A0 come back on that decission once builds start to exponentially increase in size, which\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 eventually happen as big features like colonies and interstellar get added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI came here to type up something from the same point of view, thank you for doing the typing for me! o7\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP 1 was lightning-in-a-bottle and trying to force recreate this for nostalgia isn\u0027t the way to go IMO.

Thank you for that! The 2 day extension is a lot better than I expected tbh and I am very excited to check out these changes! I also wouldn\u0027t mind if rockets got wobbly at a certain height or a certain amount of the same size pieces in a row. I know that could be tricky to implement but thought I\u0027d put in my two cents \u0026lt;3\u00A0 Other than that I very much like the goals put in place for the expected gameplay experience and the new science parts sound really awesome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kdaviper","CreatedById":229094,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-17T05:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224293853\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217724\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221686971547\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201924\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LittleBitMore\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, LittleBitMore said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nafter returning and reading the replies more closely, I noticed the update was being delayed by 2 days, and some people seem to have a bit of an issue with that. honestly I see no problem with the delay? here\u0027s what likely happened (based off of previous experience with game development teams), in rough order:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthey created a set list of things they wanted to accomplish for the update\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\neither they added some big things close to the release date, or one of the things on the list was proving difficult to resolve, and didn\u0027t seem like the list would complete in time\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ninstead of shipping out an update without one of the things they planned for, they decided to slightly (it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E2 days\u003C/em\u003E, guys) delay the update\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthey didn\u0027t maliciously and intentionally deceive us, they probably just encountered a hurdle while trying to make the update high quality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027d like to reiterate that i have no inside knowledge and this is likely only what i can assume happened based off my own experiences and history with dev teams.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd iirc June 20 was the target date, not anything set in stone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
