When you count up the amount of bug fixed in raw numbers (note Im not doing this, just eyeballing it), its likely a roughly pretty similar number with it leaning in sons of forest\u0027s direction. So this settles this then? The sons of forest team is objectively better at bug fixing, well not quite. In short, sons of the forest and KSP2 are not the same game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSons of the forest is a first person game where you just control a guy with a physics engine which is mostly just focused on making sure things fall down at the right speed, which is the case for roughly 80% of the other games. This means that 1. chances are all the tools and knowledge you need is very likely already there. You can use a lot more of unity for things like visual rendering then you can in a game like ksp2. People found unity tools in KSP2 code, and this lead to speculation that these were used for parts of the code, this is before we found out thanks to mortoc that they couldnt get any of these tools to work so now they sit like vestigial limbs. A game like sons of the forest has much more you can use for outside help then a game like KSP. And also 2. KSP2 is just a lot more complex of a game then Sons of the Forest. If youre in a FPS game and you clip through the floor, 99% of the time itll just be due to bad terrain, if your rocket suddenly disintegrates in midair, it could be a bug with joints, the atmosphere, a specific part, etc. etc. This added complexity makes KSP2 both more prone to bugs, and harder to debug.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatch 1 was a big step forward in terms of bugs, though patch 2 was a bit of a mixed bag when it came to stability. Patch 1 inherently had a lot of things in favor for fixing lots of bugs, people worked more then they otherwise would\u0027ve because they knew that a month long push would be what was needed. Not to mention that patch 1 likely fixed a lot of low hanging fruit, and that patch 1 was nearly solely bug focused, whereas patch 2 focused a lot more on performance.\u00A0 Patch 2 shouldve had more QA time, but hey look what theyre about to do for new updates. The priority right now should be getting the game playable but the tricky thing is the definition of playable varies a lot for different people. For some players they care a lot about bugs, for some they can overlook bugs if there\u0027s content available. We will see how patch 3 performs with its longer development time but I have hope.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketRockington","CreatedById":223189,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-06T01:38:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/222150-strawberry/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022222150\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/222150-strawberry/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Strawberry\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0looking at bug counts fixed is not an interesting metric, I\u0027m sure you\u0027d agree.\u00A0 How severe the bugs are, how many bugs there are to fix, how much low hanging fruit/easy fixes were available, team size, etc, are all factors that can\u0027t easily be rectified against other games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat Sons of the Forest is managing though is to keep its community happy and interested, which is reflected in its reviews.

I seriously doubt that between release and patch 2 they worked on science because they had much better things to be working on. Pure raw speculation but if I were to guess what needs to be done in between science at release and science update, I think most of it boils down to the experiments themselves. Generally speaking from what we\u0027ve seen the art team tends to outpace the technical team, so I dont think the hurdle will be on the art asset side of things, and from what we know the tech tree is probably done. I know about as much as you here when it comes to science, but how I take \u0022weird bulbous thing\u0022 and Nates idea of \u0022part that requires you to fly through rings\u0022 is that each experiment will introduce its own mission constraints. Since at least most of the science experiments will only work in specific situations, this means you need more science parts compared to KSP1, and since each part has its own constraints that means that each constraint needs to be tested. This means that science is especially QA hungry with a game that is already using up a lot of its QA resources. I know as much as you do when science comes out, I think it\u0027ll be update 4 or 5 but generally my speculation in regards to timelines has been off so take that with a grain of salt.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PDCWolf","CreatedById":58026,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-06T02:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224279531\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217019\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221683312900\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205123\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nate Simpson\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Nate Simpson said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOur team is fully funded, properly staffed, and completely focused on executing the full vision of KSP2.
