And there are too long and thin designs that should fail. This being said, I agree it is too much wobbliness at the moment, but I think one item that is forgotten here is that it\u0027s the interaction with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E straining to keep the point of control in line that really tends to amplify the wobble.

Sure, there\u0027s a new \u0022collection and transmission system\u0022 but zero details - for all we know, it is only talking about the technical implications. The distinctive science part sounds cosmetic to me, when what we would need is some gameplay variety.

Broadly, we see this as part of the Kerbal DNA, and want to preserve it in some form. Whether that means limiting wobbliness to certain types or sizes of parts, or relegating certain behaviors to player settings, is the subject of ongoing internal discussion.

I agree with these views, in particular with keeping autostrut out of KSP2. Most of my KSP1 experience was from before the days of autostrut, and even after it was added I didn\u0027t particularly like messing with this somewhat hidden setting to magically make connections between parts (root part, or heaviest part in particular) that felt a bit like cheating. I would prefer that stability results from simply using structurally sound parts for the task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there is one area I want to touch on and it has to do with the branching, tree-like nature of KSP vessels. It\u0027s not possible to truly connect two parts on the end of different branches in a rigid stack-attached way, because loops are not allowed. For example, when attempting to make rings, or rectangles out of fuel tanks or truss sections there will always be a point where the branches of the tree meet, but won\u0027t actually connect up properly. You could say, well just strut them together, but struts only really handle forces well in one direction. And as these two parts are physically next to each other, it should be possible to tell the game to connect them together with a proper stack-like connection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example is with docking ports, when merging two very large and massive vessels together consisting of multiple rocket stacks and habitation modules. No matter how rigid docking ports are made, it would be silly to expect a single docking port in the central axis to be able to resist the immense bending forces that could be caused by either vessel. The most natural way to deal with these immense forces would be to connect 3 or more docking ports between the two vessels spaced out widely around the central axis to increase the lever arm. But that\u0027s not possible, as KSP2 would only truly connect one of the docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAllowing multi-docking port connections between vessels, and to connect together parts on different branches of the vessel tree with proper stack-like connections, will give players important tools to create the stability they need for more ambitious projects without diminishing the challenge and still allowing for some measure of wobble for designs that are not particularly well made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: One more huge benefit to allowing multi-docking port connections is that it allows players to guarantee the angle of the connection and ensure the two vessels line up perfectly for whatever they have in mind next!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-17T08:31:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2023 08:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Lyneira\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-17T08:29:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSingle connections means also that I won\u0027t be able to build colonies with overpasses because the other end won\u0027t connect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-17T08:52:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems a great solution to expect rigid rockets with side booster being flexi.\u00A0 My KSP1 games have never used actual struts since autostrut\u00A0 was added.\u00A0 Also, getting rid of the need for multiple docking connections to create stability is awesome too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the update...\u00A0 no worries about a couple of days delay.\u00A0 The weekend for playthrough works better anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lowi_Sace","CreatedById":224820,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-17T08:58:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224293756\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217724\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221686949661\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022224498\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Space Peacock\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, The Space Peacock said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way KSP1 required you to bring back most experients, sometimes even multiple times, for full science gain was not only annoying but also not very realistic. For the sake of gameplay,\u00A0 most science experiments in KSP2 should be a \u0027do it once and you\u0027re done\u0027 kinda thing, where transmitting the experiment gives you all science immediately. The exception to this would be surface samples and/or colected rock fragments, which would have to be returned to either Kerbin or a Colony/Space Station with processing facilities. This would greatly encourage the usage of science probes, and add some much needed functionality to space stations (and not in the \u0027put your science here and we\u0027ll double it\u0027 way). If you really want to add science experiments that cant be completed instantly, having some experiments that require time to complete would be a much better hands-off way to do it. Collecting data on a planets upper atmosphere for low orbit for example could be an experiment that requires ~a month of in-game time or so to complete, and would require you to do nothing more than place the science experiment in low orbit, start it, and come back later once you get the notification that it\u0027s finished.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nagree with you. The transmission stuff should indeed be chanhed like you said to a more realistic setup. I think having landers constantly over a timespan transmitting science would also be nice. Like small sprobes that are landed and keep experiments going. An other cool thing would be that the planets in the tracking station are not detailed and by sending orbital satalites the surface could be mapped precisely and the planets will get sharper in tracking station.

The reasons the contract system was garbage were numerous but just off the top of my head: completely random missions that pretended to pay attention to what you wanted to do but still had to offer other stuff from time to time in order to allow you to switch gears, no way to change the weighting without grinding a bunch of crap out, no way to cycle out bad missions except to roll them in a very inefficient way, hidden achievements because of course we don\u0027t want to give you any hints on how to do things on your own... The system wasn\u0027t bad because they didn\u0027t want to \u0022guide players too much\u0022, the system was bad because it basically amounted to random, tedious gameplay which didn\u0027t match player-set goals due to lack of choice and horrible controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP, at its heart, is a sandbox where the player should be able to set their own goals. Giving players guiding missions is fine, rewarding them for doing guiding missions is fine, but those guiding missions should be skippable (so if I\u0027m ready to go to Moho now I can see if there\u0027s anything interesting the game might suggest I do there, and ignore everything else) and optional (so if I want to run an entirely player-goal-driven game I can). The sandbox gameplay is a huge reason KSP had such replayability; if it amounted to simply running the same missions in order on a new game it wouldn\u0027t have nearly the staying power. To that end any mission system should ultimately hand the player the controls, let them set goals, see the rewards, and make choices accordingly. E: And stay well out of the way if the player has a better idea on how to do things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-17T17:23:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2023 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-17T17:34:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224293976\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217724\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221687011602\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022104543\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Meecrob\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Meecrob said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, but there are probably more serious players than players who want wackyness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat makes you think so?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gotmachine","CreatedById":163039,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-17T18:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224293390\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217724\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221686938400\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205123\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nate Simpson\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/16/2023 at 8:00 PM, Nate Simpson said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a person who has dive-bombed more than one physics meeting with an exasperated \u0022can\u2019t we just make the joints stiffer\u0022 comment, let me assure you that in true KSP fashion, this is not a problem with a simple remedy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen there is no solution, you\u0027re working on the wrong problem.
