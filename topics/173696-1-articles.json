I\u00A0watched the mod review on KottabasGames and decided this was the one. Although he had a brief guide to download it wasn\u0027t complete. He went as far as saying that if you go into the mod folder you find an exe file which you use to create a custom galaxy config. Im wondering what i need to do to get this mod working.
