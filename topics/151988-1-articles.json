I had a very bad new that has ocurred a few minutes ago... It ocurred an enourmus aurora that was in the Sun. Well is amazing! But just when it was visible the Aurora has appear two earthquakes at the same time... One in Argentina of (I think 5.7) And other in New zeland of 7.9!! And it generated an Tsunami. And what is this abaut? We play space things right? Well is this: 1: It apppeard an Aurora (in Chile, I live there) and also tomorrow will succes an Super Moon that will appear again in 70 years.. And this is why we are in a Apocalypsis. Because this is a coincidence with the astros to 2 earthquakes. Apocalypsis? Illuminatis? KSP?
