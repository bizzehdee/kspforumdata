I\u0027ve decided to finally buy a camera for this!\n\nKennedy is planning to launch a GPS [Global Positioning Satellite] in roughly 2 days on an Atlas V rocket. Is anyone else going for the occasion? If so, I hope I get to see you!\n\nEDIT: Well, next week there will be a Delta IV launch, so I\u0027ll be able to go to that.\n\nHey! You there! Yeah, you. You better expect some videos!\n\nIn the meantime, why not have some discussions above?\n\nEDIT: Let\u0027s take a few moments to recount the history of the IIF.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/VWPqwpBiruo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nEDIT: Well, I may not be able to go for another day or two. Brenden called me and needed a ride to the hospital earlier, so I need to stay and make sure he\u0027s okay.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T19:18:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 07:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T14:09:48Z","Content":"I live 20 hours away by car, so sadly, I will not see the launch."},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T14:35:25Z","Content":"Do \\_not\\_[go swimming](http://www.space.com/22772-frog-photobombs-nasa-moon-launch.html)there!\n\nDo \\_not\\_ [hug](http://www.space.com/6442-bat-hung-ride-space.html) anything that\u0027s orange and huge!\n\nHave fun and return with pictures! :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T01:55:44Z","Content":"I\u0027ll have to delay this a few days.
