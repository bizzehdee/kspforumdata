I decoupled the two, and turned the service module around and docked with the lander. All this worked as usual, but when I loaded the save the game reconnected the struts, which now clipped through the craft because of the change in orientation. This caused the craft to remain stuck together after undocking, remain as one craft for control purposes, and have issues with the camera drifting away\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
