It\u0027s true that they were nerfed, but they only work in a different way. Previously, the more intakes you had, the better performance you had. Making SSTO-s was mostly a construction challange. Now, it\u0027s rather a piloting challange. Now, the faster you go, the more thrust you will have. To make effective spaceplanes, you have to learn to reach a high speed, and keep it. And now the horizontal acceleration phase is much longer. (Tip: I found out that accelerating a lot on the runway before taking off is vital) Also, you have to rebuild your old planes, in addition to learning to fly them properly with the new system.
