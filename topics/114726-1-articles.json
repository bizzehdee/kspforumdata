Specifically you reduced their thrust, but at the same time halved their fuel efficiency.\n\nTotal overkill! The reduced drag is no where even close to compensating for the massive hit you guys did to jets. (The thrust change would have been enough, but the efficiency change was completely unnecessary. 1.02 had already nerfed SSTO\u0027s now they are almost impossible.\n\nMy best SSTO/space plane from version 1.02 was able to take off (with no payload, and if flown perfectly) get to kerbin orbit, and then thrust out to about 2/3rds the distance between Duna and Dres\u0027 orbits. (which sounds like alot, but really no, as it only had enough DV to land on the Mun but not get back to kerbin.)\n\nThat same SSTO is now barely able to achieve kerbin orbit, and thats without a payload at all.\n\nPlease, please, please re-balance this. Every major update seems to be aimed at screwing over people who build SSTO\u0027s and space planes. Those are where the fun is at and the challenge; but now its beyond challenging to just frustrating and stupid. \n\nOn a related side note: the RAPIER engine really needs to be more powerful and fuel efficient; especially since its in the final level of the tech tree. This thing is supposed to be made to get SSTO\u0027s to orbit!!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Falkenherz","CreatedById":141969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T09:40:34Z","Content":"There is already a thread about the jets. I was sceptical, too, but since I added a bit more thrust and adapted my ascend profile to a much flatter one, my spaceplanes now bring almost double their previous payload into LKO. Just give it a try. Ofc it is annoying having to readapt designs every other patch, but I hope these kinds of tweaks remain rare."},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T10:29:00Z","Content":"My spaceplanes have no trouble, granted they usually were overengineered (in terms of fuel anyway) to start with.\n\nAs to the thrust, I have to disagree. The same planes in 1.0.2 that would cap out around mach 3 are now hitting mach 4 with the new drag profile, carrying the same payload. The fuel efficiency is a hit I admit, they can no longer circumnavigate Kerbin unless I give them a drop tank or two but that isn\u0027t the worst thing in the world. In other words, less thrust and more speed, yeah it gets a little trickier getting off the ground (no more breaking the speed barrier before even reaching the end of the runway) but it somewhat balances out.\n\nWhile I admit that spaceplanes are fun, it is not the only fun thing in game, and still needs to be balanced. \n\nAlso Rapier is fine the way it is."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T11:05:52Z","Content":"You can get almost half your weight into orbit, what is difficult about that [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116729-Stock-Payload-Fraction-Challenge-1-0-4-Edition](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116729-Stock-Payload-Fraction-Challenge-1-0-4-Edition)"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T11:20:19Z","Content":"Yeah, I hear you.

After 1.0 came out with the first nerfing of the BJE, 6 BJE\u0027s were barely able to lift it. Now, not even close. And it\u0027s not just the BJE-powered VTOL\u0027s that got axed, other designs had to be thrown out too.\n\nFurther, since the fuel quantity was increased to 400units of LF in the Mk1 Fuel Tank, I have to redesign all of my SPH aircraft and spaceplanes to account for the drastic changes in both the dry and wet Center-of-Mass changes. I understand why the fuel quantity was increased, but rebuilding SPH craft files to get them to fly right is already tedious; redesigning them to fly stably and adequately is long and frustrating."},{"CreatedByName":"Juicy","CreatedById":142505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T11:39:34Z","Content":"The advantage of the drag increase (since 1.0.1) is an increase to lift. It\u0027s not just a matter of going faster, it\u0027s also a matter of going up. Planes can climb at a slightly lower throttle, provided they have the wings to take advantage of that. Yes, building SSTOs became a little harder again. You don\u0027t want to add an infinite amount (or size) of wings to get infinite lift (since it\u0027d add too much drag), but you don\u0027t want to keep them too small to minimize drag either.

I have been working with the jet engines for a while now. I never post on these forums, but I had to come here specifically to post about them. \n\nThe new specs are crap. Not just the high altitude engines, but the low alt engines too. I like in atmospheric aircraft for Kerbinside science. Now the simplest things require a large investment of time and complexity. I\u0027m fairly experienced with KSP, so I have no problem going in and editing the part stats to where I think they should be. However, I do think that the way they are now may be discouraging to new users. I\u0027m sure Squad has a lot of excel spreadsheets and stats for calculating how powerful they think the parts should be. \n\nHere on my thoughts on at least the J-33 though. I feel like a stationary J-33 ought to be able to lift a 10 ton object up to 10k meters vertically. Whatever power it needs to be to do that, it should have it. It is close, it just needs to be tweaked a bit. \n\nI feel like it should be able to lift this small VTOL at least a few hundred meters and it cant. \n\n[![screenshot103-L.png](http://snarky.smugmug.com/Kspjetengines/i-fZvsvnf/0/L/screenshot103-L.png)](http://snarky.smugmug.com/Kspjetengines/i-fZvsvnf/A)\n\nOne J-33 should give you good performance with every 10 tons of load with the appropriate aircraft layout. \n\n[![screenshot104-L.png](http://snarky.smugmug.com/Kspjetengines/i-xHwgVj8/0/L/screenshot104-L.png)](http://snarky.smugmug.com/Kspjetengines/i-xHwgVj8/A)\n\nCurrently it takes me about 1.3 engines per 10 tons which is a bit cumbersome to say the least. It\u0027s not like I\u0027m loading these aircraft with fuel, they are largely empty space with maybe 1200 units. I wouldn\u0027t mind it so much if we got some 2.5 meter jet engines for heavier aircraft. Right now I\u0027ll just make the mods as I need to until there is a fix. \n\n It don\u0027t think this is too overpowered to ask for, J-33s are only effective on as explorers in two planetary bodies in the solar system. \n\nAs for the high-alt engines. I don\u0027t have too big of an issue with SSTO, but the payloads are meager. Yeah, you can shoot a probe into the sky that\u0027ll go all over the Kerbin system, but I don\u0027t know. It would be could to at least make the 100t launches somewhat more obtainable."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T11:16:53Z","Content":"In my opinion, spaceplanes aren\u0027t dead, you just have to approach things from a different side. It\u0027s true that they were nerfed, but they only work in a different way. Previously, the more intakes you had, the better performance you had. Making SSTO-s was mostly a construction challange. Now, it\u0027s rather a piloting challange. Now, the faster you go, the more thrust you will have. To make effective spaceplanes, you have to learn to reach a high speed, and keep it. And now the horizontal acceleration phase is much longer. (Tip: I found out that accelerating a lot on the runway before taking off is vital) Also, you have to rebuild your old planes, in addition to learning to fly them properly with the new system. It was the same with me: all my old planes were ruined, and my new ones weren\u0027t working, despite spaceplanes are my main interest, and I had great skill of them. I had to go back right to the very basics, and I started studying the Aeris 4A again. I went through the painful and hard process of learning to make and fly SSTOs again, as I did for the first time. After numberless failures, now the spaceplanes I make work perfectly. I also applied for the challange mentioned before, with a plane that couldn\u0027t reach orbit in the previous versions.
