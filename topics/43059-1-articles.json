Lots of trial and error, only parts mods are KW rocketry, mechjeb and kerbal eng.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsist of 3 lifter stages with enough juice to get to a 150km orbit, and some left over to de-orbit the last stage (i hate space junk). first stage is an SC-4 tank and a SC-0 tank under it (to stop overheat) with a Griffon XX engine. Second Stage is a smaller 3.75M tank with another Griffon XX. Third stage is a 2.5M medium sized tank with a Griffon G8-D engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove this is a small 2 stage lander lander contained within a 2.5m Interstage separator, with the command module with a vesta VR-1 engine and a large 1.25m tank above that. Also a small escape tower on top to make it look like the real deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal Launch Weight: 306,449.8kg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal Delta V 6685m/s atmo, 7750m/s vac (excluding the lander\u0027s 2 stages... kerbil eng is weird sometimes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR: 1.26 @ launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManaged to get to 150k orbit, intercept Mun, land, take-off, redock and intercept kerbin with a sliver of fuel to spare (not the best yet at efficient transfers). Couple of small issues that will require some tweaking. The separator between the lander and command module would not get out of the way! Had to do some fancy flying to knock it away before I could cleanly dock with the lander. Ran out of fuel just before touching down on the Mun, luckily was close enough to bounce to a rough landing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. Forgot the batteries where on the bottom part of the lander (which stayed behind) so ran out of electricity, luckily managed to get into a roughly circular orbit before this and use the command module to pick the lander up. And for the piece de resistance.......I forgot to EVA my kerbil back into the command module for re-entry, tried to do it at the last minute but well u can see the results in the pics.... oops, poor Loming Kerman \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you enjoy the pics.

Should note i used mechjeb for the launch (after so many test flights the launch got old fast \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E), but other than that all manual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow didn\u0027t realise they used the 3rd stage for TLI. I will have a look later, but based on previous passes, my guess is that the 3rd stage should have enough delta v left over to do the insertion. Will be a close thing though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the engine clusters, good point, will have to see if i can manually do the clusters to match. Was going to change the third stage engine anyway as it sticks out from the fairing a small amount, and i wanted to keep it looking as authentic as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i just have to work out how to do it with a 3 man command pod and a 2 man lander. The lift stages just don\u0027t scale so good though :S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
