So, I figured I\u0026#39;d climb the ladder a bit and learn to fly the A-10C.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nStarted 2 days ago, and have more or less been following the basic training missions. Read the manual back to front and once I went through the startup mission I set up my own checklist on a little notepad that I have at my desk. 40 steps to get the thing going is just bonkers, and totally awesome. And thats with a clean aircraft. I haven\u0026#39;t gotten to weapons yet, as I\u0026#39;m still practicing general flying and then landing. Landing isn\u0026#39;t so bad, but I\u0026#39;m also not used to how quick the aircraft slows down even without breaks or flaps going. Last time I flew something this slow was when I still had MSX and was doing cargo flights in a 747. And I can\u0026#39;t even remember when that was.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have tried following the training mission for it but it skips some steps, so I\u0026#39;ve just been running short flights between a couple of airfields to practice. Once I have that down, its time to move on to weapons ^_^\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEventually though I want to learn the P-51, just because it looks so cool and because it\u0026#39;d be a nice change of pace from modern military aircraft.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gmpd2000","CreatedById":37101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T01:46:52Z","Content":"\n\u0026lt;-- Another DCS\u0026#39;er here.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have almost all the modules, (only left are the 3 prop planes and FC3).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe A-10 is a study sim, you\u0026#39;ve got to read and do tutorials, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI only bought A-10 a few months ago, still can\u0026#39;t use it properly weapons-wise, but you\u0026#39;ll do it eventually, it\u0026#39;s only a matter of practice and time, remember that we\u0026#39;re dealing with an almost perfect copy of the aircraft here, it won\u0026#39;t be easy.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T02:57:32Z","Content":"\n^ Flying it isn\u0026#39;t really so bad, and now I\u0026#39;ve actually got landing down now that I realized the missions I was running was having me come in way too close to the runway at the final waypoint before landing. Pushing back and getting a headstart on the checklist a minute or two out from approach has helped a lot with that. No more having to descend from 2000 feet from less than a mile out and hoping I can slow down at just the right rate. Can come in nice and smooth just like on a fighter.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWeapons, I\u0026#39;m not sure how its gonna go for me. I know that the A-10 has more complex weaponry compared to the F-15 I\u0026#39;m used to, but at the same time I\u0026#39;m also highly impressed with how easy it is to use all the systems with my Warthog HOTAS*. I have a feeling it\u0026#39;ll fit me like a slipper. Bout to start training for it here in a moment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n*I know it sounds funny to have bought the Warthog HOTAS and only just now starting to fly the actual aircraft, but I wanted the HOTAS originally because it was the best quality stick and throttle I could see for the money at the time. And I wasn\u0026#39;t wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSomething else I\u0026#39;ve noticed after watching some videos of the A-10C in-game is that I really, REALLY want a Track IR. While I\u0026#39;ve found a decent enough setup using basic KB/mouse view controls, boy oh boy would TIR be a dream.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-22T03:02:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2015 03:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by G\u0026#39;th\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T08:35:16Z","Content":"\nHi, i suggest you watch some videos by Ralfidude on YouTube, he has a small play list of handy A-10C tips.

Though the Maverick ended up being a hella lot harder to use than I originally expected. Definitely going to have to run a lot of practice missions with the weapons. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGuns and rockets are pretty easy. Tricks I learned in fighters work pretty well for getting sights on a target with them as well as the peel away, and what luck, most targets are stationary. A2A was also fairly straightforward.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnguided ordnance was, strange to say the least. Mostly because it seemed like there was a step missing somewhere during training. Had problems releasing the bombs and even when I thought I had it all lined up and good, i still end up missing.
