Take something like a massive, lengthy first stage, and it uses a 1k or 2k texture. Then take something small, like an RCS block. Using a 1k or 2k on that would be overkill, because you don\u0027t need that much detail on such a small piece. And, the detail levels would be much different. The RCS block would still be crystal clear when you zoomed in really close, while the giant first stage would be blurry at close range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razorcane","CreatedById":66919,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T01:33:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CluelessModeler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CluelessModeler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI had never heard the 10k rule...

A lot of amateur modelers leave the end caps on cylinders that connect multiple pieces, when that detail is never seen, and doesn\u0027t need to be there. I once cut a model\u0027s poly count by a few 100,000(It was well over a million) by using this method. My advice would be to dial it down a bit on the engines. The detail under the shroud is very hard to see, and is really a waste of polygons. The shroud itself looks turbosmoothed, and that really drives up a polycount. I think that if you roughened up a lot of the curved edges on it, that would also lower the polygon count. A third option would be to lower the polycount on your cylinder-based objects. A lot of them are tiny, and you could get away with 4-8 sides(which would make it more square, but semantics).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CluelessModeler","CreatedById":58172,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T02:53:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll good suggestions.

However, high-resolution textures are bad news; if you have the choice between making detail with geometry or making it with a normal map, choose the geometry and use a smaller normal map. A 2048 diffuse and a 512 normal for the CBC should be totally fine, but if you\u0027re talking about about many, many 2048s then that\u0027s a different story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding formats: the format on disk has *nothing* do with the format in memory. That\u0027s like saying because I sent you a model in 3ds it\u0027ll have different geometry than if I exported it as .blend. Nope, just as all geometry must be read in and converted to actual vertices and tris, all textures have to be read in, converted to bitmap, and then compressed. Where it gets complicated is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Textures with 4 channels (i.e. with an alpha channel) take up twice (not just 4/3) as much memory as textures with 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The png and tga loaders have some issues, both of which rbray89 has corrected; but mbm is still the safest format. That said, remember to name your normal maps whatever_NRM.ext (include the NRM) so that they get dealt with properly (i.e. not compressed to DXT, which is bad for normal maps).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chimer4","CreatedById":58864,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T08:20:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BlazingAngel665\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BlazingAngel665\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlright guys, first off, optimizations!\u003Cp\u003EAll Delta IV parts made by Clueless now have custom physics meshes.
