I have a bunch of manned rovers docked with a manned ship. I want to transfer engineers from the crew compartment to the rover\u0027s command modules. But I don\u0027t have only engineers inside the crew compartment. Is there a way I can be sure I\u0027m sending engineers over to the rovers?\n\nBecause otherwise, should I break a wheel, I\u0027d be stuck if the rover happens to carry scientists or pilots only"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T17:47:08Z","Content":"Switch to the vessel in question... go to map mode... on the right-hand side of the screen, click on the little Crew icon. It will list the crewmembers and their status."}]}
