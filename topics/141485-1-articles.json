Which was scarier to you: the piano in Super Mario 64, or the manta ray in Super Mario Sunshine? I can hardly choose one or the other.

You can totally see the mantra ray coming , I mean the tree-man literally says that. The piano is a great jump scare. Nobody was ready for that; it certainly scared me!
