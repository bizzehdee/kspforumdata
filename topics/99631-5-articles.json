A nerf is needed because I can hold landers at a 45 degree angle, which is very strange, even to the newbies playing this game. There should also be a saturation system in place for 2 reasons:\u003Cp\u003E1) Their fuel (electricity) is easily replenishable. This means that you can use reaction wheels for a long time, wait a bit, and then use them for a long time again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) They get rid of the need for RCS. If all of your orientation controls are through reaction wheels, there is no need to have RCS, except for docking. Heck, with good engine control you can DOCK without RCS, which effectively gets rid of one important aspect of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe saturation system doesn\u0027t need to be complex; it can be a simple timer that slowly ticks down until you regain power.

It\u0027s realistic, but it also requires a playstyle, where you plan all maneuvers in advance, and execute them carefully. I\u0027ve enjoyed the casual KSP playstyle, where you fly manually, overshoot frequently, and then compensate, and reaction wheel saturation would change that.\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, reaction wheels are currently so powerful that there are no meaningful choices involving them. Nerf them to around 10 kNm/tonne (which is still around 5x higher than the CMGs on ISS), and you\u0027ll have to make real choices between using reaction wheels, RCS, and thrust vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the gameplay would be better, not worse \u0026lt;shrug\u0026gt;.

The front craft (with the reaction wheel in the centre) - I get that. It\u0027s symmetrical so the rotation axis passes through the com.

To make a lever effective you must have a pivot, something other than the object applying force or the object force is being applied to. On a surface and subject to gravity, the force applied to the pivot is redirected to the surface it sits on and to the opposite side of the lever from where force is applied. The net result is that the lever moves around the pivot affecting the target object and \u0026gt;\u0026gt;apparently\u0026lt;\u0026lt; leaving the pivot unaffected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, when we remove the pivot a lever pushes on itself making a point along the lever the pivot. If the lever is in contact with a surface under the affect of gravity at one end, then that end will become the pivot. Again we see that the pivot \u0026gt;\u0026gt;appears\u0026lt;\u0026lt; unaffected by the forces applied to the lever. However, if that lever is unable to transfer any of the force applied to it to another object, then the point at which force is applied becomes a pivot and a second pivot is created at the lever\u0027s center of mass and a third pivot is created equidistant and opposite the the first pivot (where force is applied) from the second pivot (the center of mass). This causes three rotational movements, one around each of the pivots. If all pivots are co-located, then the lever will \u0026gt;\u0026gt;appear\u0026lt;\u0026lt; to rotate around but a single pivot. If the the pivots are not co-located, then the lever will rotate around three points. However, because two of the pivots are in dirrect opposition to each other, they will cause the lever to \u0026gt;\u0026gt;appear\u0026lt;\u0026lt; to rotate slower than the same lever with force applied at its center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T05:13:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should be some small, command-pod sized, low thrust RCS units pretty much right away in the tech tree.
