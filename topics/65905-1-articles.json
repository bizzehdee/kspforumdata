The problem aerodynamics is all based off of indicated airspeed and it really hampers realism for aircraft and spaceplanes in atmosphere. So, I propose that ksp use equivalent airspeed in aerodynamics and engine performance. Here\u0027s how:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets start with assumptions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. There is no wind in the Kerbal universe. This makes ground speed = true air speed, or the number they tell you for how fast an aircraft actually goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Every planet in the Kerbal universe has a standard atmosphere and never changes. This makes calibrated airspeed = equivalent airspeed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Every instrument for measuring airpseed has zero error. This makes indicated airspeed = calibrated airspeed = equivalent airspeed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Sea level density on Kerbin is used as a reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, for some math. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eequivalent airspeed = ground speed * sqrt(local density/reference density)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor how this will behave, in a vacuum, your airspeed will be zero because there\u0027s no air. As you climb, if your surface speed stays constant, your airspeed will decrease. If you take a spaceplane to Eve, your airspeed will be significantly higher than on Kerbin, causing more drag. Likewise, on Duna you will have a low airspeed and less drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a large number of aerydynamic issues missing from ksp that can be solved with airspeed. If your aircraft stalls at 100m/s, it will always stall at 100m/s. If your aircraft overspeeds and falls apart at 500m/s, it will always fall apart at 500m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
