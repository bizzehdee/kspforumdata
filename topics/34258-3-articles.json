Where as an engine change (to a new engine) pretty much invalidates all previous work. Entropia is a good example of that, some systems they had when they changed (nearly 4 years ago) still aren\u0027t back up and running and many of the ones that have been reintroduced took quite some time.\u003Cp\u003EThe second is lifespan. A pay to play (or entropia\u0027s pay to win model) can handle long drawn out development cycles. The money made over it\u0027s life span exceeds the single purchase games margin, and after 6 years of active game play they can AFFORD to change engines to some degree.
