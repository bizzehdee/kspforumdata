I\u0027m now at the point when my \u0022pre-release\u0022 is at pretty stable state (not final, though). I\u0027ll be appreciated if you install and try it. Below are the changes from the last official release (1.2.3).\n\nFeatures:\n\n1. [[FR#96](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/issues/96)]: Groups of parts are allowed to be moved/attached. As long as mass and distance limitations are met you can move any number of parts. That said, you can move a whole vessel in scope of a single station, or between different stations.\n2. New mode \u0022Re-dock\u0022 (shortcut: \u0022y\u0022). Allows moving vessels docked to a station. No need to snipe the right part to detach, the right docking port is found automatically. In this mode attaching is only possible to a compatible port of the same station. All compatible free ports are highlighted with a green color. A vessel can only be re-docked if it was docked via normal means (attaching parts to a docking port is not a \u0022vessel docking\u0022).\n3. When attaching a part only consider attach nodes that don\u0027t allow collisions. Now you won\u0027t be able to attach a part looking inside a vessel.\n4. Add a semi-black background when showing cursor status and hint texts. Helps reading text in the light scenes.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n1. Handle wrong assemblies that could have created due to a bug in the KSP editor. In edge cases the editor could create a setup that would result in an immediate explosion when detaching a part on orbit.\n2. Correctly handle struts. When moving a part connected with struts with the rest of the station an explosion was a likely event. Now, such struts are removed before the movement.\n3. Don\u0027t equip items when loading non-eva kerbal. When vessel had a mix of engineers/non-engineers, and there was someone with an equipped screwdriver an error \u0022cannot equip\u0022 could be shown on load.\n4. [[Fix#97](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/issues/97)]: Accept names with dots when overriding part settings in the config. E.g. \u0022mumech\\_MJ2\\_AR202\u0022 correctly matches \u0022mumech.MJ2.AR202\u0022 (MechJeb2).\n5. [[Fix#87](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/issues/87)]: Correctly handle \u0022revert flight\u0022 action, and stop adding multiple callbacks that slow down editor UI. Now, if you do several launch/revert actions the UI in the editor will NOT become slow.\n\nIn order to get the new version you need to download a DLL from [alpha5 release](https://github.com/ihsoft/KIS/releases/tag/v1.2.3-alpha5) (here is a [direct link to the DLL](https://github.com/ihsoft/KIS/releases/download/v1.2.3-alpha5/KIS.dll)). Just place it into the folder \u0022/GameData/KIS/Plugins/\u0022 where  is an installation folder of the game. It\u0027s a good idea to make a backup of the old DLL just in case you decide to revert back. Though, I hope you report a bug and make me fixing it instead.\n\nBelow are some helpful hints on adjusting KIS behavior. They are all done in the file \u0022*\u003Cksp\u003E/GameData/KIS/settings.cfg\u003C/ksp\u003E*\u0022.\n\n- If you don\u0027t like *2m* distance limitation change *maxDistance* to whatever value you like. It\u0027s in meters.\n- If you don\u0027t like mass limitation edit value *grabMaxMass* (tons). Default is 1t per kerbal.\n- Many parts from addons are not stackable in KIS, and you waste one slot per item. If you believe your part needs to be stackable add its name into *StackableItemOverride* section. E.g.:\n\n        StackableItemOverride\n        {partName = strutConnector\n        }\n\nAs for now I still haven\u0027t received any feedback from the original author ([KospY](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/33868-kospy/)). And given the fact his last login into the forum was *14 Nov 2015* I\u0027m not very optimistic (but there is still a hope)."},{"CreatedByName":"IgorZ","CreatedById":155445,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T07:58:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 43 minutes ago, Mods\\_o\\_joy said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hello, I have a slight Issue, When i attach parts they sink into the part i attached them to and then they explode\n\u003E \n\n1.
