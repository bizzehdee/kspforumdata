I cant place a maneuver node sometimes until I click past my Apo/perapsis, and then drag my node where I want it to be, and sometimes I just cant place it at all. It happens when im going in a really straight line, and when im just in standard orbit..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else have problems like this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T19:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running a few mods, but I\u0027ve had this happen in pure stock installs as well.
