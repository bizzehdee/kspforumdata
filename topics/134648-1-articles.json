My laptop remains very hot and the fan keeps running at max speed even though the physics are paused, the scene is not changing and the window is not even visible.\u00A0I think the graphics engine continues to run and composite the same scene over and over again even though it\u0027s invisible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf at all possible, could you stop the graphics engine while\u00A0the game is invisible in the background?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running on a 17 inch Apple MacBook Pro, and you could\u00A0literally use it to bake eggs if I leave KSP paused in the background.

I play on Linux and I have the process monitor in my taskbar, and when I have KSP running, even just idle or in a non-physics situation there is a steady line of CPU use. With a quad core there are always at least 2 cores that add up to 100% usage with the other 2 at 10-20%.
