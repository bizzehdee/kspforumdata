Note that this computer is five years old. I found a sticker across the panel opening which leads me to believe this computer hasn\u0027t been opened up before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why I haven\u0027t cleaned it yet is because it previously was my dad\u0027s computer for the last four years and he is a hands-off type of person. It didn\u0027t surprise me much that this computer was never opened up before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlready, I am noticing that the fan is extremely quiet (I had to make sure it was still running!). Can I expect a noticeable increase in performance? Note that when I opened up the console, the heat sink was virtually buried in dust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T02:52:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt certainly won\u0027t hurt it at all. Less dust means better cooling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe performance increase may be subtle, but it will be there. If nothing else, you kept your computer from damaging itself due to overheating (yep, that can happen).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T16:46:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdeally use a can of compressed air to blow the dust out of the PC. Failing that, something like a clean paintbrush. A lot of people use hoovers to suck the dust out, but you run the risk of inducing static. It\u0027s a theoretical risk, I\u0027ve never actually seen a computer damaged by it in my experience, but worth being aware of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to speeding the PC up, depends exactly on the chip you have, but a bit unlikely. Most modern processors will stop dead once they hit a thermal threshold to prevent physical damage to the chip. Some of the newest ones will drop the clock speed as temperature increases. However cleaning out the PC is most likely going to extend the usable life of the thing either way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fastaviationdata","CreatedById":79600,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T02:20:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMe, I\u0027m just using paint brush when cleaning my system unit. So the computer is 5 years old?
