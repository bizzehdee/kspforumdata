Decades, centuries, even. I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m just so happy. We\u0027ve finally done it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I seem to have gotten ahead of myself here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay. So, I am one of millions of specimens of Kerbals. We live on a planet in the Kerbol system called Kerbin. As far as we know, it\u0027s the only world that can support life. But I (and quite a few other) believe otherwise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur history is very, very faded. We know pretty much nothing about it. There are several theories accepted by the Kerbin Science Academy, the main two are: being created by a supreme being known as Kod or evolving from some proto-Kerbal. The other somewhat accepted theory is that our origins lie above us. It seems absurd, but hear me out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that out of all the planets in the Universe, there must be more than one that can support life. Think about it; it seems logical, right? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this ridiculous theory has only ever been accepted by a few, possibly because of the lack of evidence. But its popularity has increased recently, due to some not-so good reasons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody wants to admit it, but life on this planet is hard. And I mean hard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur recent technological advancements have lead to predictions, and none of them look good. We are losing land every year due to its composure. We no longer breathe air due to its lethalness, and have instead developed a substance that keeps us alive, called polyjuice. It has replaced most of our old systems, and is passed on to our descendants. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, due to a never-precedented phenomenon, our soil decrease rate is growing, and it\u0027s not showing any sign of stopping. We cannot pinpoint when exactly we will run out of land, but it is coming. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUs kerbals are an optimistic race, though. We know that we will find a way to survive, but then there are those who worry and start thinking about continuing our existence. They\u0027ve tried all sorts of things; from building outposts in the desert to building a network of caves underneath the ground. These only showed minor success, unfortunately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently, the KSA has hired these people to team up with them and together find a way of solving the problem. They already know the solution: the absurd theory I was talking about earlier. They just need a way of getting there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where I come in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy father used to own a parts company (I do now) and he used to sell them to architects and builders. My mother always had to take care of my sister, leaving me all alone in the house. You can imagine that I wasn\u0027t just going to leave my dad\u0027s things untouched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI began to build pointy contraptions (because pointy things go faster) powered by black water that could reach incredible heights. I began to build these things for cash, and they became popular around my area. Things like these can\u0027t go unnoticed for long, and a few years ago the KSA started questioning me about these things. I thought that I was going to go to prison, but they took a liking to me. They hired me as a mathematician for their company, wanting to be one step closer to finding the solution. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe worked I don\u0027t know how long on that chalkboard. Our schedule used to be wake up, koffee, equations, sandwich, equations, smaller sandwich, bed. I went out with my friends every once in a while to make sure that I was still sane. It sounds ludicrous, but I don\u0027t regret one moment. Not one. Because today we\u0027ve done it. The whole lab and I have came up with an answer that everyone can agree on. No one in particular discovered it, because we work as a team. It has been named \u0022the Tsiolkov equation\u0022, after Dad\u0027s old boss that started it all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is actually quite simple, but our minds were lured down a different path than the one needed, which is why it took us so damn long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/math/1/5/4/1542fde84b55f5387bc00f966f9359ac.png\u0022 alt=\u00221542fde84b55f5387bc00f966f9359ac.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve done it.

This could lead to be the best era of Kerbalkind! All the guys in the lab are very happy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a problem though. My company is gonna have to be looked after by someone, as my schedule\u0027s going to get busy from here on out. My dad\u0027s too old now, and my wife is a journalist, so I might shut it down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few months after I wrote the first entry, the KSA re-organized itself. First of all, it\u0027s now going to be called the KSP, which stands for \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022. I think it\u0027s a better name. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, the new black water-powered mechanisms (that we\u0027ve christened \u0022rockets\u0022) are going to be launched from a space harbour, or centre. We\u0027ve decided to place it near the equator of the planet, because we save BW and money that way. The government is going to provide our new homes, thankfully. It\u0027s going to be a long time before the first bricks are laid, but we\u0027ll gonna get there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome time after that, we decided what we were gonna do, exactly. We decided upon the fact that we were gonna have to send someone up in those rockets to control them, after all. They chose me as the prime candidate, due to my x-treme piloting skillz. There were gonna be another four guys in the group, but they haven\u0027t been chosen yet. We also started preparations for the KSC. It was going better than I\u0027d expected. But I spoke too soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust when the construction workers started building, the government said \u0022no\u0022 and cut our budget big time. It was supposed to look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E09m0zk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022E09m0zk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice, isn\u0027t it? Well, we\u0027re not gonna see it anytime soon. I was infuriated. My friends to just go with the flow, but... We had to redo the whole plan to fit with the new budget. At least we came up with the new plan relatively quickly. Three months, that\u0027s all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI visited the site with the fellow scientists bi-monthly, and every time we went our smiles got a little bigger. The building that was completed was the Astronaut Complex. Why it\u0027s called \u0022astronaut\u0022 complex, I don\u0027t know. I thought we had agreed upon \u0022kerbonaut\u0022! Anyway, that\u0027s the place where I\u0027m going to do my training and such. I started a week after its completion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tests were simple, seeing as I\u0027d done some of them when I was in flight school. A new one was one where I had to fly around on an experimental jetpack. Don\u0027 ask me why I had to do that. Here\u0027s a picture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/b/bf/Jeb_Selection-Process.png/800px-Jeb_Selection-Process.png\u0022 alt=\u0022800px-Jeb_Selection-Process.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the buildings were finished some time after that. It coincided with the new update, so everyone came.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.7.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday two of the remaining four kerbonauts were announced: Bill and Bob. Here\u0027s to a good career with them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that Bill is an engineer and that Bob is a scientist, so it\u0027s good to have people in different fields. Gene, a guy called \u0022flight director\u0022 held a speech about the future. I didn\u0027t get featured in it, but that\u0027s not so bad, because I\u0027d forgotten about it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Here\u0027s a transcript: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mhpphm, yes, yes. Is this on? Ye- Ok, then. So. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings, ladies and gentlekerbs. We are gathered here today to celebrate a very important step of our history: the opening of the Kerbal Space Center. This place will help us reach places previously thought unreachable. It will act as a major transport hub, and even a military base if the need arises. It will create motivation and jobs for those wanting to help us out, and it is the biggest and most important project ever carried out ever. It would not be possible if it wouldn\u0027t have been for the architects, builders and mathematicians that spent hours upon hours of their time working on the project. Please, let\u0027s applaud them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I have plenty of time for your questions. Fire away.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What was the total cost of the project?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Approximately 2,000,000 funds.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr. Gene! Is this part of a military cover-up to destroy the Maxinimalists?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Of course not. It will only be used as a military base in emergencies, and the current facilities do not support very big planes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Will a terminal building be built?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Eventually, if the passenger numbers rise to a certain point. Currently, the building substituted as the airport is a segregated section of the Space Plane Hangar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Will other centres be built similar to this around the planet?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That is inevitable, but they will of course be much smaller than the KSC. That\u0027ll be all, thank you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the beginning of 0.7.3, the other two kerbonauts were announced: Dindroock and Chuck, they\u0027re both pilots. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround that time, the launch crew were getting the first mission ready. We were all very excited, especially me, because I would be the one who\u0027d be commanding it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched a few months later after the announcement.
