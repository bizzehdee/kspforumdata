Took a MX-4 with 6 conformal radiators to space. One there, and the reactor offline, they would happily cool the reactor down all the way to 4 K, which is equal to ambient. The fact that I sandwiched it between double insulators made the radiator\u0027s job that much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/screenshot51.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/screenshot51.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then - you\u0027d think that at 4 K, the heat transfer would stop, right? Because the reactor is clearly not getting any heat input aside from the conductive backflow from the radiators, as you can see in the image. But no, the radiators keep heating up at full speed. They\u0027re at about 600 K now, even though they were barely over 400 K when the reactor reached 4 K! It seems like there\u0027s an infinite reservoir of heat to draw from a part that sits at minimum temperature. Inside the atmosphere, when the radiators keep the reactor at ambient, this does not happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI watched for a while and the radiators went all the way to 1048 K, at which point the rad flux \u002B cond flux outgoing was equal the internal flux incoming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the reactor running at 100%, the radiators went up to 1065 K, a mere 17 K more. The reactor itself rose from 4 K to 390.7 K - nowhere near a critical temperature. Note, again, that this was double-insulated from the rest of the ship, which worked exceedingly well.

Also it\u0027s kinda hard to use vertically along a stack. With fuel lines you could always stick a cubestrut or something in there to let it reach further, but with heat the part either insulates the engine/reactor from the pipe or explodes due to overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue enough maybe I\u0027ll leave that out. There is no \u0022core\u0022 per se. The Tau is for use in atmo, yes, eventually there will probably be stack radiators and stuff. Re stacking, you should be able to use a cubestrut, which has a highish temp tolerance. The pipe will draw from that, but a pipe (unlike a fuel line) has a fixed capacity per line, so you might need more than one. I plan on providing heatsink parts that have handy protrusions for pipe attachments, but they won\u0027t be in the release, no time for models.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T06:59:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nertea\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nertea\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMmm, I suspect what\u0027s going on is 100% transfer at 4.000001 K and then no transfer, then transfer at the next frame... etc. Will have to work around that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t believe that\u0027s what\u0027s going on.

The result is a very visible, high frequency flickering in the internal flux and part temperature readouts on both parent and target parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when doing that test in space, there was no flickering at all. Also, the only source of heat flowing into the reactor at the time was the conductive backflow from the hot radiators.

You\u0027d heat those radiators up so far that they\u0027d emit IR energy like crazy and be very efficient even at a small size. And yes, you\u0027d use heat pipes to get to them, then the coolant would go back into the radiator to heat up the coolant again, and repeat. This is how electricity is generated, it\u0027s an ideal engine cycle (Brayton Turbine in the case of the SAFE400).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting thing is when you heat a radiator up that far they don\u0027t need to be that big either, the hotter the radiator\u0027s temperature, the more kWt it loses to space. (the increase is to the 4th power)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason the ISS needs such big radiators is they aren\u0027t very hot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, even on the ground, most of your heat loss is through radiation not convection or conduction. Actually being on the ground means that you\u0027re radiating at a grey body, so it\u0027s not as efficient. In this case facing out into black space, yep... this is working as it should from what I can tell. Those two radiators facing the sun shouldn\u0027t be radiating as much, but those two perpendicular to it would be very effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the radiators for the NTRs: I haven\u0027t been watching this thread super close, but the NTRs should be losing all of their bulidup heat through the propellant while running. It\u0027s when they\u0027re not running that something must be done to cool the reactor (which could be done by turning down the fission reaction, which means you would have to spin it up again before you could use the engine again). Probably using it as a generator to turn those watts of thermal energy to electrical energy, then you\u0027d radiate your heat energy off into space. Basically using it like a giant RTG, large radiators should not be needed. I\u0027ve yet to fiddle with the stock NTR... but from prior use and other engines it sounds like it\u0027s backwards. It generates a lot of heat while running and is cool when it\u0027s idle.
