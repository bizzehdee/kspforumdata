So the retro burn AND having to reburn prograde to get back into orbit, I am not sure I am willing to to that. At least not at the time anyway. Now that the mission is complete I would have no problem redoing it to see if I could pull that off.

It is not uniform and has all sorts of odd fluctuations. The core of the moon is also a weird place.

It\u0027s the only part of Apollo 13\u0027s goals that was able to be carried out according to plan because all the work the spacecraft had to do for it had already occurred long before \u0022Houston, we\u0027ve got a problem\u0022 happened. With Apollo 12 having installed the corner reflectors and the ability to make seismology recordings from them, NASA realized that the best way to get an idea of what the inside of the moon might be like would be to give the reflectors a good \u0022ping\u0022 to measure by just smashing something into the moon. And when they looked at how to get something with good mass to smash into the moon they realized the Apollo mission profiles tend to be set up just right to send the Saturn V\u0027s stage 3 at the moon if they\u0027re just altered slightly. So on Apollo 13 they did that. Instead of ditching stage 3 and then trying to aim to miss the moon slightly, they instead kept stage 3 attached, used it to aim themselves on a lunar impact path, detached stage 3 while they were heading for impact, and then had the command module push itself slightly to the side to miss the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bunsen","CreatedById":10598,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T16:20:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat documentary was it?
