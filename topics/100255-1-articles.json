I built a ship with extra seats in it, and a grabber. I eventually managed to get him with the grabber and bring him back to Kerbin safely. What I had wanted to do was just get him in the cockpit with me. Is there any way to take control of a rogue Kerbal and make him get in my ship?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T04:33:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 04:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by theShiz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sonny_Jim","CreatedById":103060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T00:45:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the [ and ] keys to switch between vessels/kerbals when they are within 2.3km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theShiz","CreatedById":137822,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T00:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried that, but it wasn\u0027t working.

Perhaps not. Anyway, grabbing something with the claw is functionally the same as docking with it, which itself is the functional equivalent of making one ship out of two.
