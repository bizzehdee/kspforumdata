(All tests were conducted with no mods) any info would be handy. i really wanna try out the new stuff. (the wheels for sure) but am saddened by this apparent change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nascarlaser1","CreatedById":166190,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-31T23:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\natmosphere seems to work for me, perhaps a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-31T23:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrag and heat have\u00A0been tinkered with in the last version or two, making re-entry less hazardous than it was for a while.
