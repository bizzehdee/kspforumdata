But we have another competition this Thursday. So I\u0027ll find out soon enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re into robotics, I suggest you look into this. It\u0027s quite the program. And you don\u0027t have to be part of the program to watch the competitions. Find one near you and go to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, my team is 3410: LIFE\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T13:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggested to my Robotics team captain that instead of making a robot, we send a satellite to the Moon by having it hitch a ride on a SpaceX rocket then deploy a solar sail in space. The probe would then flyby the Moon (Taking pictures and measurements) and study the sun from an heliocentric orbit. It would be an intended 20-day mission lifetime, and the probe would measure cosmic rays and provide video feed of its flyby and solar orbit everyday from a video camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost would\u0027ve been around $15,000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, guess who just got kicked out of the robotics team? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy friends aren\u0027t exactly the biggest a space fan.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T23:05:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.

Did you even get to present a plan before you got the boot?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuess what I\u0027m curious about now is, do you still want to do it? Could you manage a team? Have you done all the research to a point that you could show it to someone and convince them that this can work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause if so... Kickstarter. If your presentation is good enough, you could probably get all the funding necessary from the KSP community alone. Heck, if you\u0027re cool with putting the KSP brand on the mission, you might even be able to get some support from Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn amateur lunar probe?
