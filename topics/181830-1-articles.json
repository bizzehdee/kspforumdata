day one and all.\u00A0 I am embarking upon an exploration of the gas giants (out planets mod) and my plan calls for a probe stage in three parts.\u00A0 A gas giant entry probe, to be detached after entering \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, an orbital insertion stage that when decoupled from the orbiter itself will serve as a potential relay, and then the orbiter itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy issue is, as I start to think about it, how to ensure that the entry probe stays in communication with the orbiter/insertion-stage as it enters the planet\u0027s atmosphere.\u00A0 Logically the probe would seem to need to slow down after separation, or else the entry probe might circle around the planet and depart line of sight and lose data transmission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have a \u0022method\u0022 to ensure this works out, or do I just have to play with varying angles and try to make it work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-30T19:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can think of two\u00A0ways:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nTiming.\u00A0 Follow the entry probe with the insertion-orbiter in a nearly identical track\u00A0(or it can be exactly identical if you\u0027re using aerobraking or aerocapture).\u00A0 This would probably be best done by use of a radial burn after the orbiter burns for a near-but-not-quite-atmospheric interface.\u00A0 There will be drift but you should be able to keep line of sight.\u00A0 However, you may find that you must release the entry probe at a point well after entry to the sphere of influence.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSequence of stage separation.\u00A0 You may have a better time if you decide to capture to a high elliptical orbit, release the entry probe, and then complete your orbit insertion.\u00A0 If you release the insertion stage and make any other manoeuvre, then your orbital tracks will give better-than-half radio coverage for when your entry probe returns.\u00A0 This will also depend on timing\u00A0and you\u0027ll lose some delta-V from keeping the probe attached, but if need be, you can take fuel from the probe--unless you mean to say that the probe is purely kinetic?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GarrisonChisholm","CreatedById":146403,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-30T19:17:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probe has some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E, yes, though only enough to change course.\u00A0 Maybe I\u0027ll sketch up a diagram and get some screen-shots when I\u0027m home later, but the Orbiter was going to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E insertion and so not touch the atmosphere, but the entry probe would be on a closer orbit to intersect of course, so it would be out-pacing the orbiter until the atmosphere started to slow it down.\u00A0 I can\u0027t put a big transmitter on the probe because entry would tear then off, so I need to stay within 1,5m M and LoS to make sure i get the data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-31T02:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis fits a sort of combination of the above, but you could perhaps try setting up a resonant orbit to ensure that both\u00A0vessels are on the same side of the planet at atmospheric entry.\u00A0 This would also allow you the flexibility to build a sort of delay-spacing into the flight plan so that the probe doesn\u0027t fall\u00A0behind the orbiter so much as it falls back to the orbiter.\u00A0 This would require keeping everything together for insertion and capture:\u00A0 you\u0027ll still want to have a low, almost atmosphere-grazing periapsis,\u00A0but also to keep\u00A0a high apoapsis for ease of setting up the atmospheric entry later.\u00A0 Release the probe (if you used decouplers or separators and didn\u0027t turn down the decoupler force, you\u0027ll have to\u00A0chase it to keep your velocities matched--consider releasing the probe in a retrograde direction)\u00A0and at the next periapsis, burn retrograde with the orbiter so that the orbital periods are some simple rational resonance.\u00A0 7:8 requires less delta-V, but 3:4 requires less time.\u00A0 It\u0027s up to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s assume that you decide to use 7:8.\u00A0 This means that the orbital period of the orbiter is\u00A0one-eighth less than the orbital period of the probe, which is left in the larger orbit.\u00A0 In other words, for every eight orbits of the (inner, thus faster) orbiter, you get seven orbits of the probe to put them both back in the same place (at periapsis).\u00A0 Control the probe and wait for six and one-half orbits:\u00A0 this will put you at the apoapsis, where your tiny amount of delta-V will get the most effect.\u00A0 Assuming that you kept your periapsis low, it won\u0027t take much to drop it into the atmosphere, and the total change to orbital period is so small that the orbiter will be literally right above the probe when it interfaces with the atmosphere.\u00A0 Depending on how quickly the probe decelerates, that may mean that your orbiter will move too quickly anyway, thus pulling ahead and leaving communication range too early.\u00A0 In that case you will need to perform the deceleration burn on the five and one-half mark,\u00A0which\u00A0will put the orbiter back by an eighth-orbit, which will give you more time to transmit when you get to that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, if you want finer control over the timing, then you need to span it to take more time so that you can more easily divide the orbit into finer fractions.\u00A0 That would imply resonances of 11:12 or 14:15 or whatever you like.\u00A0 You may need to become very familiar with quicksave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime
