The normally recommended speed is 0.1m/s for a grab attempt. Have you tried to come at the shield perpendicular to is surface?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreddyB","CreatedById":167896,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-21T10:04:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Vanamonde, thanks for your response.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried for longer than was healthy to pick it up from every conceivable angle I could try.
