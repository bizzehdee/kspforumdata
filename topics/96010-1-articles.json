This is acceptable, as they are all single nozzle designs, unlike our friend the S3-KS-25x4 Engine Cluster (which shall be called \u0022Henry\u0022 from now on, \u0022S3-KS-25x4 Engine Cluster\u0022 is a mouthful.). Although I am unsure whether or not this is possible within the engine, I am fairly certain creating a new gimbal animation for Henry is not going to be too difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T14:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrue, Henry (point taken) should be able to roll using gimbal. With the upcoming aerodynamics that might be pretty important. FAR taught me that gimbal is a nice thing to have, especially with heavy lifters. Control surfaces dont work that well at low speeds and a 500t rocket tends to be rather slow right after launch\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T15:10:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a problem with this.
