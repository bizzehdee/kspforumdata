These things although fun and the current platform has the ability and parts to build such things, in career mode there is very little if any use for them, especially since for most things you want to recover them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI posted a thread a while ago about an idea that transmissions require line of sight, thus requiring you to set up relay satellites. and I\u0027ve seen other posts on ideas to use contracts as reasons for lots of the above, as well as some other creative ideas for long term research stations. I however have an idea on how rovers could be used more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what we could have is a new tool. one that cannot be used by kerbals, so it has to be mounted, will act like a ladder and its simply a drill that does underground samples. much like a surface samples just you require this tool to do it. anyway the idea is like a surface sample you get science for one sample, if you get more from nearby locations you get the same amount of science or even perhaps more for subsequent samples up to a total say 4 or 5. this could also be implemented into the contract system simply by \u0022acquire 4 underground samples within 800 - 1200 meters of each other\u0022 im sure there are more creative ideas on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eof course this set up will allow for massive science from a single mission however thats the reward for building a return craft with a stable rover which of course will cost more and requires you to advance down the rover tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyes you could also simply take of and land a bit further away and have the tool mounted to the lander but that uses fuel and is not as fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apature rocket science","CreatedById":77886,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T04:18:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with your ideas but there needs to be more meaning and objective to building basic space inferstructure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
