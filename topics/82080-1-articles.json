It\u0027s got a two year gap between sending the Mars ascent vehicle and the crew vehicle to Mars (as it\u0027s got to start producing fuel for the return once it gets to the surface), so I might cave in and do an N1 mission in that time gap. I\u0027ve been working on making some N1 launcher parts compatible with realfuels and RO, but rescaling, booting up ksp and testing stuff is slow work. Took me about 5 hours today just to get the Orion capsule scaled and working correct in RSS. I would just procedural-parts the N1, but I\u0027m a stickler for getting these things to look just right in RSS, as well as performing to spec. Normally I\u0027d stay away from something like the N1 because a lot of people already know a lot about it, and I\u0027m more trying to showcase some missions that were lost to the history books.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat STS/Von Braun Mars mission is defiantly my crowning achievement thus far in KSP. The digging up research on the STS, construction, testing, watching the kraken shake things apart, reconstructing, and flying the mission with soul crushing parts lag was the sum total of about two weeks of work, putting in 3-5 hours each day. I wish I would\u0027ve found out sooner that I still had room for the Component Space Shuttle with my other 140 mods, because it would\u0027ve been nice to have it floating in the background of a few of the assembly shots. It was to be the crew transfer vehicle for the STS, and the fuel truck for the nerva shuttles (and ended up being the only surviving component of the Space Transportation System after it went through congressional approval).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-31T01:49:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2014 01:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Chris P.
