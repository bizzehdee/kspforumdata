All aircraft I tried to make turn out to be longitudinal unstable, a small change from the equilibrium means a quick looping or a full nose down stall. Ideally you wish to prevent static stability through aircraft design (so no delta wing as that\u0027s inherently unstable and thus requires a lot of fly-by-wire), and dynamic stability through means of active control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatic stability is actually quite easy, and a simple summation of forces should be enough.

For wings it treats each wing piece as making lift regardless of what\u0027s around it which means that aspect ratio doesn\u0027t matter, you can stack wings up like playing cards for more lift, and so on. For other parts it means that clipping is ignored for drag calculations, only node attachment matters, and two ships that look the same can behave very differently depending on how you put them together. Changes in aerodynamics with Mach number are largely ignored or fudged. Overall Squad\u0027s objective with stock aero seems to be to make something \u0022fun\u0022 and playable even if it means deliberately being unrealistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR takes a whole-vessel approach. For wings it considers how each part is placed and considers the aspect ratio of the whole wing and the proximity to other wings, tailplanes, etc. For other parts FAR goes by the shape of the whole vessel, and therefore half-hiding a part in another part will affect the drag as you would expect and a ship should act how it looks. Aerodynamics change with Mach number as you\u0027d expect.

And, just like real life, if you want an inherently stable bare aircraft, the composite CoL needs to be behind the CoM (or you need some good computers to help compensate).

Typically I see this referred to as \u0022Trailing Edge Up/Down,\u0022 so I\u0027m going to assume that\u0027s the nomenclature you are using. To pull the nose up, the elevators go trailing edge up to create LESS lift on the tail (or even a negative lift vector). You need less lift on the tail to rotate the nose of the aircraft up. Generically speaking, this causes the CoL to shift forward, which makes the plane rotate upward around the CoM. It\u0027s certainly more complicated than that, which you either already know or will be getting into soon. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022paul23\u0022 data-cite=\u0022paul23\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAnother thing: 9 out of 10 lift-offs fail due to me bumping around the runway and one of the wing tips then touching ground.

If it so happens that the root of the swept wing is attached forward of the CoM, but the control surface is aft of the CoM, the flight controls will reverse. So beware of that (if you haven\u0027t run into it already).

Try moving the wings forward some and putting a mirrored set of those fins on the tail too. You can also right-click and lock out specific axes for each flight control surface, which limits the amount of control coupling that can occur.

You could add some more control surfaces (such as the tail I mentioned), and you can also add some \u0022flaps.\u0022 Put some control surfaces on the wings near the root and right click. There\u0027s a \u0022deploy\u0022 option, and you can add those to the action groups for easier deployment in flight. They can take some fiddling, but can help you slow down. You can even overlap two surfaces and provide a sort of spoiler type device, which is often helpful because it doesn\u0027t much change the effective CoL vector. The other approach is to cut your engine much further out, and make sure you are on a 2 to 3 degree glidepath to help bleed off speed.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EIf you post more pictures, try to leave the CoM and CoL markers on.

The main difference between 1.0 stock Aero and pre-1.0 FAR is regarding wings, where FAR does try to ascertain total wing geometry and calculate AR and sweep effects, where stock does not. That\u0027s not to minimize how awesome old-FAR was, of course; I adopted FAR in my first month of playing (June 2013) and never looked back, but we also shouldn\u0027t minimize the advances that ferram brought with post-KSP-1.0 FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
