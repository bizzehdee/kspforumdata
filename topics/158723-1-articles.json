No joy on anything, when I exit and\u00A0boot up kerbal again and go back into settings my axis bindings are no longer saved. If I delete the \u0022= 0\u0022 line under input devices in settings.cfg, it saves the axis information properly on rebooting but then when I go into a vessel on the runway, my pitch and roll inputs are jittering all over the place and don\u0027t correspond to the correct input movements from the joystick. Thanks diomedea for helping me out, I have no idea whats going on... If anyone else reads this and uses a joystick or controller input, would you mind posting your INPUT DEVICES and AXIS _PITCH entries from settings.cgf so I can see what it looks like for someone who got it working?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-07T10:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately I have a different device, so can\u0027t guess what name you should use.
