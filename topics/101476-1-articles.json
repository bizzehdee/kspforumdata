(Right? ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif))\n\nHowever, engines and SAS is still all-or-nothing.\n\nShould this be fixed/changed?\n\nPersonally, I\u0027d like it more, as it would open up the land of large engine gimbals. If you have an engine with a 90 degree gimbal, and you hit \u0022w\u0022, suddenly you\u0027re thrusting 90 degrees to your previous vector. With the new system you could hit \u0022w\u0022 until your gimbal was at the right spot. (and then start tapping to keep it there.)\n\nEDIT:\n\nArgh, I meant to put up a poll, but \u0022enter\u0022 apparently made it submit a new thread. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T00:46:33Z","Content":"By SAS, I shall assume you actually mean Reaction wheels...\n\nA time constant for gimballing makes sense, Reaction wheels not so much but I can see it being a bit easier to use."},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T00:48:14Z","Content":"Wait, what are you talking about, smooth control... am I missing out on something?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T00:49:23Z","Content":"Just how quickly can a real rocket engine be gimballed anyway?

In mods with engines with high gimbal its kind of odd and hard to use when engines flip around instantly applying force quickly."}]}
