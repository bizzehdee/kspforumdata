The point of the game is to have the Kerbin orbit bodies pay out in order to make good use of the rest, but my own investigations do not pay out for going \u0022out of this world\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand by playing around that you get much better points by visiting other bodies but you get the bulk of those science points by probing them, and the math is just not that good yet. I can start off fast and furious by not using any living kerbals in order to maximize science points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T07:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease consider carefully where you place new threads, this one was in the wrong subforum. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Community-Rules-October-27th-2013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERule 2.4 is in effect\u003C/a\u003E, repeated offences may lead to infractions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread moved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T12:51:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are going to nerf the science you can get by transmitting science over and over, so you\u0027ll have to bring it back if you want everything\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
