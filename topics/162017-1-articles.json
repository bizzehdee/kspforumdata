They are delicious!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever I noticed that if I build a too tall fairing I end up with 5 nodes only and they are very tight to each other and there is a huge space left without any nodes between the front of the fairing and the 1st node. In other words, the nodes are clutered in the botton and they are not evenly distributed in the entire space of the fairing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1-Is that a way to edit the nodes positions? To make them evenly distributed or better yet to place each one of them exactly where I want? Lets say I have 4 objects with diferent sizes that I want to put in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2-The Truss Structure is just to display the structure?

No, at least not in the stock game.\u00A0You can place a second fairing base on the last node to put more payloads on, or stack the payloads onto each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.
