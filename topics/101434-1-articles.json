A lot has happened since the first one was invented two years ago. Nowadays they\u0027re able to absorb a lot of punishment. Prop development also goes quick.\n\nNext question: what should drive the propeller? Some people build electric motors using rover wheels or SAS wheels. They\u0027re quiet, don\u0027t smoke and have unlimited range if done properly. However, they\u0027re terribly weak compared with the turboshaft engine. The turboshaft (or turboprop) is essentially a minimum of two jet engines blowing against a number of steel blades. They use **a lot** of fuel but if done right, they\u0027re able to lift immense loads. And anyone should edit out the smoke of the jet engine, at low altitude it\u0027s incredibly unrealistic and like watching a Cheech \u0026 Chong movie all the time. \n\nLook in the topics in my signature for examples."},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T01:47:34Z","Content":"Thanks for the replies!

The biggets issue for me is that the props are way too large, and requite a ton of parts to work. Im waiting for someone to make a kerbal scaled plane with a stock bearing in it with a fairly low part count liek say below 50 for the entire assembly (i doubt its even possible but kudos to whoever does manage someday to make it).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T01:52:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b**"}]}
