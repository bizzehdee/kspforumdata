Prop development also goes quick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext question: what should drive the propeller? Some people build electric motors using rover wheels or SAS wheels. They\u0027re quiet, don\u0027t smoke and have unlimited range if done properly. However, they\u0027re terribly weak compared with the turboshaft engine. The turboshaft (or turboprop) is essentially a minimum of two jet engines blowing against a number of steel blades. They use \u003Cstrong\u003Ea lot\u003C/strong\u003E of fuel but if done right, they\u0027re able to lift immense loads. And anyone should edit out the smoke of the jet engine, at low altitude it\u0027s incredibly unrealistic and like watching a Cheech \u0026amp; Chong movie all the time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook in the topics in my signature for examples.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T01:47:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies!

The biggets issue for me is that the props are way too large, and requite a ton of parts to work. Im waiting for someone to make a kerbal scaled plane with a stock bearing in it with a fairly low part count liek say below 50 for the entire assembly (i doubt its even possible but kudos to whoever does manage someday to make it).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T01:52:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
