I\u0027d like to see all the \u0022Explore Body\u0022 contracts and the \u0022Fly by X\u0022, \u0022Orbit X\u0022, \u0022Land on X\u0022, and \u0022Return from X\u0022 contracts be automatic, like the \u0022Gain X altitude\u0022 or \u0022Gain X speed\u0022 contracts are now.\n\nI hate missing out on these because either they won\u0027t spawn, or because I decide to do something too early or out of the order KSP thinks I should do them in. This would also free up slots in both the offered and accepted contracts for other things.\n\nI think there are other things that could be done to improve contracts as well, but this strikes me as a relatively simple one. Though, being a programmer myself, I know what *seems* simple could be anything but. What do you guys think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T01:01:07Z","Content":"I am in absolute agreement."},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T21:06:56Z","Content":"When Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society started paying off during a mission, the career game play improved vastly.\n\nThis should be implemented as well.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe current system allows for a start up cost.

After completing the WFRKS contract the pool is multiplied by contract difficulty and added to the pool.
