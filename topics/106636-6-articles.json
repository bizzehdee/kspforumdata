I\u0027m currently working on yet one more velocity craft, (i know, but I love the challenge), and what I\u0027ve found is\n\n1 keep parts to a minimum, especially wings, it significantly reduces drag and you can go faster, my fastest planes have been less than twenty parts. In addition, use significantly less intakes than you think you need, 1 ram scoop at mach 4 provides enough air for two turbos.\n\n2 fly as low as you can without exploding, I cruise at about eighteen kilometers, you might burn a bit more fuel, but if it\u0027s speed you want, going lower is less distance to travel, and you travel much faster, of course this only is really feasible with speeds above mach 4 or else you\u0027ll run out of fuel\n\nAnyways, fly dangerously guys, and good luck to all future entries"},{"CreatedByName":"Triop","CreatedById":145841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T19:57:36Z","Content":"@imthebait\n\nGreat tips, right now I\u0027m screwing up big time with my over-aired design ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n[http://imgur.com/9Iq7dwr](http://imgur.com/9Iq7dwr)\n\n...And I feel the need for speed !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T23:28:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 11:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Triop**"},{"CreatedByName":"BurningLegion","CreatedById":142799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T20:12:42Z","Content":"I\u0027m consistently failing at everything that isn\u0027t a drone ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) But I downloaded Pilot Assistant, maybe if my crappy flying isn\u0027t an issue anymore my actual designs may prove sound."},{"CreatedByName":"ExaltedDuck","CreatedById":145930,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T23:40:44Z","Content":"Interesting tips.

Now the engines are fuselage mounted behind inline breathers (I think I used pre-coolers. not sure if their behavior is any different from the other intake). I also traded the vertical stabilizers for some fixed wing bits because I was having problems with every articulating winglet exploding after about 1500 km at speed. I took off facing hdg 270. I don\u0027t think it was much faster than facing down the runway and just pulling up past vertical. I guess it could save a few seconds. \n\nInitial ascent was at about 35-40 degrees leveling down to about 10 degrees by 10000 meter to be able to reach \u003E1100 by 20000. \n\nCruising speed was generally pretty close to 1200 and held between about 18500 and 21000 m and full 4x time accel was in effect from about t\u002B90 s to t\u002B55 min. I tried to bleed off speed as late as possible with a about -40 - -45 degree initial descent straight at the SPC from full altitude. Cut throttle at 17000m, applied brake from about 15000-10000, throttle up to hold mach speed down to about 3000 then level out. Came in a little too fast and late and rolled past end of the runway, but avoided any damage. \n\nI might be able to shave a little more time off, but not without way more effort than I currently have the willpower to commit to. I\u0027d rather get to work on a multilap circumnavigator. Anyway... final time 56 min 43 s. \n\nPudding: \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
