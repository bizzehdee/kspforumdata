If you want to actually copy \u0026amp; paste, then left clicking on the part while holding down the \u0022mod\u0022 key will copy that part, and all the daughter parts attached it. Your computers \u0022mod\u0022 key depends on what operating system you have. For example, if your operating system is Windows, then your mod key would be the \u0022Alt\u0022 key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Z\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T00:06:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, if you want to copy the wings for later use, you have to use the sub assambly system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen the sub assambly map (in the parts), and select the part of the wings that\u0027s attatched to the main plane.
