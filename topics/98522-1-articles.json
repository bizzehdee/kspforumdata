I know this is a closed thread, It wasn\u0027t created by me, and I know that it is from 0.14 also, but I thought it was an awesome Idea SQUAD needed to incorporate into stock KSP. So here is the link, for those interested in reviving:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/9808-Plugin-0-14-4-Part-gravity-v1-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/9808-Plugin-0-14-4-Part-gravity-v1-0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope to see this again soon, updated to 0.90.0 or a later version, so please, please, recreate this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you moderators for your time and More ambitious ideas for a new mod like this, or simply, a revival. You may have to ask the mod creator for permission, but I personally think this mod should not go to waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks once more,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAstrofox\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
