I have not yet tested it on a game without Module Fuel System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, here is some story background:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAfter the September, 2001 K.D. on Kerbin City, the Kerbal government took action. The KSA (Kerbal Security Agency) stores thousands of datas. Recently, however, it was leaked. The government decided that they should discover the leaker. The Leaker was said to be seen on Kerbal Space Center. The government decided to use a drone to attack the KSC, to scare the Leaker from the KSC. They thought this for some good reasons: 1 is that they do not have to waste a pilot on a suicidal mission; 2 is that small planes are more likely to be ignored. So there they are, cranking the plane up. The first attempt, however, due to what KSA called \u0022technical difficulties\u0022 the drone crashed; the second attempt ended with several crashing, creating an artificial earthquake; last attempt, the drone is almost at the mission control when stunts begin to settle. The drone crashed due to stall and what KSA called \u0022performing stunts\u0022.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the finished product of the drone I\u0027ve used to (or attempted to anyway) bomb KSC:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GqXqmCETMmw/UiAhYB1hFRI/AAAAAAAAAZE/i4evmIIty54/w1037-h583-no/screenshot98.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot98.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I have no idea why it can\u0027t contain its will to do stunts when I have Modular Fuel System installed... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4tG_PxGhuGIMnFlOTlSTTlvcms/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4tG_PxGhuGIMnFlOTlSTTlvcms/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETested to be able to perform stunts in KSP 0.21.1 with Modular Fuel System.
