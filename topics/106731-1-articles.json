So i took my Mk2 Shuttle, put one of the tourists in the Mk2 Cockpit (so Jeb and tourist 1 in the cockpit), the other 2 I put in the crew cabin with Bob in there (Crew cabin: tourist 2, 3 and Bob). In the orbit around Minmus I was woundering why the messages only showed the completion the the contract for tourist 1. After I returned to Kerbin only the guy in the Cockpit had his contract fullfilled. The other two in the crew cabin will need a second tour. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo although all of them had a crew member with them only the one in the controlling cockpit counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running KSP 1.0.1 as 64 bit on Debian 8 64-bit, using Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
