This effect occurs at the altitude range where most of the altitude entries will be places, thus confounding the results.\n\nYeah, I raised that issue earlier, and Slashy addressed it in one of his posts - but for some time after that he didn\u0027t add what he said about it to the rules list; you\u0027d have to go back and find it in the thread. Hold on - I\u0027ll paste it into this post in just a sec.\n\nAs for your \u0022manned\u0022 question, that is a good question, my assumption would be that yes, as long as there is a Kerbal on board you\u0027d be good to go but ultimately Slashy will dictate.\n\nEdit: Ok, here is Slashy\u0027s earlier post regarding what constitutes level flight for this challenge:\n\nAll,\n\nI\u0027m comfortable with you folks having a \u0022gentleman\u0027s agreement\u0022 on what constitutes level flight. I don\u0027t want to make the rules so stringent that they turn off entrants who maybe don\u0027t have the skills to maintain tight tolerances.\n\nI\u0027d say we can generally tell the difference between someone who\u0027s zoom- climbing/ diving and who\u0027s operating in good faith.\n\nIf I miss an entry that looks suspicious, just hit me up on PM and I\u0027ll have another look at it. It will be strictly confidential and nobody will ever know who requested a review of a particular flight or even if the review was requested or if I just decided to review it on my own.\n\n\u0022Level flight\u0022 to me means that it has achieved an equillibrium state where the altitude and speed will not degrade over time.\n\nThis is your competition and I\u0027m just housekeeping (and shamelessly stealing all of the tribal knowledge you\u0027re generating ![k_cheesy.gif](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/smilies/k_cheesy.gif)). It\u0027s in your own best interest to keep it fair.\n\nWith that said, time to update the leaderboard. Good job and excellent entries!\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E One issue with the altitude records: how to differentiate genuine level flight from a screenshot taken at the apoapsis of a zoom climb? Perhaps two screenshots, ten seconds apart or so?\n\nI\u0027ll give an idea of what I did, although it was of my own accord to support that my craft had \u0022equilibrium\u0022 for my submitted records. I used a method where I got into my state of relative equilibrium, and took a screen shot every few moments while holding a particular altitude, and showed how over time (not really a standard yet for time, just relying on the samples taken to give an indication) my speed didn\u0027t degrade. In my imgur album for my original submissions, I have three sets of three altitude/airspeed samples, mainly because of the varying performance due to different levels of fuel on board. But of course, I was being very strict on myself and trying to hold a high standard in the interest of being fair for the competition, or should I say challenge. I wouldn\u0027t say everyone has to do it to my standard just to make an entry. I guess it\u0027s just big boy rules. If someone comes along and squashes me down the list another notch with a highly questionable entry, I\u0027m not worried about it for my own ranking, I just hate to see a bunch of kids get discouraged with their design and feel as though it\u0027s not competitive because, for instance, someone managed to clip 52 air intakes completely inside of a Mk. 1 fuselage (reference earlier Microsoft Paint drawing).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T16:36:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 04:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:48:25Z","Content":"Interesting challenge.

It could probably do the Ironman challenge as well but waiting for a horizontal speed kills a lot of the fuel and I don\u0027t usually have enough to get back.\n\nI like it and it looks legit to me, doesn\u0027t appear to abuse clipping at all.\n\nI\u0027d agree \u002B/-10 m/s vertical speed for screen shots is reasonable. I was saying 5 m/s before but that can be a real pain in the tookus sometimes.\n\nThere hasn\u0027t been a specific rule set forth that I\u0027m aware of that says for how long you have to maintain stated record speed, the closest thing mentioned was that it has to be shown to be in equilibrium with altitude and won\u0027t decay over time. However, it is implied that the \u0022time\u0022 variable in this context is of course limited by fuel on board at the least. I know I could go a bit faster in my Sojourn for short sprints during which I could take a screen shot at a slightly lower altitude for better thrust and thus airspeed, but won\u0027t do it simply because of the notion that I would be accumulating heat at an unsustainable rate, and that would mostly violate my own personal standard.\n\nRegarding \u0022time\u0022, again in the context of this \u0022equilibrium\u0022 that\u0027s been stated as required, it is a variable that hasn\u0027t been defined. It could be anything from as short as one screen shot to as long as a matter of seconds or minutes documented via two or three screen shots. Perhaps this could be yet another difference to implement as a difference between open class and ironman, since Slashy did say ironman was supposed to be more strict.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T16:26:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 04:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"}]}
