Perhaps two screenshots, ten seconds apart or so?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give an idea of what I did, although it was of my own accord to support that my craft had \u0022equilibrium\u0022 for my submitted records. I used a method where I got into my state of relative equilibrium, and took a screen shot every few moments while holding a particular altitude, and showed how over time (not really a standard yet for time, just relying on the samples taken to give an indication) my speed didn\u0027t degrade. In my imgur album for my original submissions, I have three sets of three altitude/airspeed samples, mainly because of the varying performance due to different levels of fuel on board. But of course, I was being very strict on myself and trying to hold a high standard in the interest of being fair for the competition, or should I say challenge. I wouldn\u0027t say everyone has to do it to my standard just to make an entry. I guess it\u0027s just big boy rules. If someone comes along and squashes me down the list another notch with a highly questionable entry, I\u0027m not worried about it for my own ranking, I just hate to see a bunch of kids get discouraged with their design and feel as though it\u0027s not competitive because, for instance, someone managed to clip 52 air intakes completely inside of a Mk. 1 fuselage (reference earlier Microsoft Paint drawing).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T16:36:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 04:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:48:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting challenge.

I was saying 5 m/s before but that can be a real pain in the tookus sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere hasn\u0027t been a specific rule set forth that I\u0027m aware of that says for how long you have to maintain stated record speed, the closest thing mentioned was that it has to be shown to be in equilibrium with altitude and won\u0027t decay over time. However, it is implied that the \u0022time\u0022 variable in this context is of course limited by fuel on board at the least. I know I could go a bit faster in my Sojourn for short sprints during which I could take a screen shot at a slightly lower altitude for better thrust and thus airspeed, but won\u0027t do it simply because of the notion that I would be accumulating heat at an unsustainable rate, and that would mostly violate my own personal standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding \u0022time\u0022, again in the context of this \u0022equilibrium\u0022 that\u0027s been stated as required, it is a variable that hasn\u0027t been defined. It could be anything from as short as one screen shot to as long as a matter of seconds or minutes documented via two or three screen shots. Perhaps this could be yet another difference to implement as a difference between open class and ironman, since Slashy did say ironman was supposed to be more strict.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T16:26:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 04:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
