I eva\u0027d my pilot to the shipwreck, can\u0027t climb on the cockpit and there\u0027s nothing to click on, no \u0022open the hatch to get the rescue target out\u0022. Nothing. I can\u0027t switch. The mission doesn\u0027t say anything, it just says \u0022rescue Matilda\u0022\n\nMatilda is in a M1 Cockpit, my ship is parked next to it and my pilot is literally just outside. What is the next step? How do I perform rescue missions?\n\nEdit- my bad. Because I had reinstalled KSP the keybinding was reset, my Swedish keyboard does not have [ ] keys, I forgot I had to change them again.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T12:46:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 12:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mastikator**\n  \nMy bad"}]}
