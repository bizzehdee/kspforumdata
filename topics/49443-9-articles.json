Preferably they would come with a second, or attached part containing the actual hydrogen/helium that inflates it and is quite heavy to balance out the ease of having the envelope.

As for the ideas: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I am already planning some expandable inline parts. These will expand on both sides of the part and, once I learn C#, will even auto balance the ship to be level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I think it would be a good idea to make this mod resource dependent, at least partly. I may see about making the parts able to consume either a custom resource or Kethane to inflate the parts but again would need to learn C# to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. An airbag idea would be interesting but hard to do as the center of mass would have to be moved below the center of lift for the part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
