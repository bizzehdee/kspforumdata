VAB hardly functions at all. I\u0027m not a forum dweller, I prefer to play the game, but I\u0027m here tonight to try to find some explanation or work arounds for some of the bugs. I have almost 400 hours into this game and loved it up until 0.9 but unless I find some solutions I\u0027ve decided I\u0027m quitting the game until they fix all of this mess."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T03:00:16Z","Content":"I don\u0027t get it. When I press ctrl-z, it deletes the last part I put on the ship. It acts like ctrl-z does in many other 3-d applications, undo the last operation. When I alt-left click, it makes a ghost copy of whatever my mouse cursor is pointed to, and it works just fine. I wonder if I am playing on the same OS.

If you still have the part selected, or set it down to the side in the editor then you will have a clone of that part or group of parts.\n\nAlt-left click is indeed the better option for this."},{"CreatedByName":"Grimfilth","CreatedById":35000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T13:59:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I used to use this back in old days quickly cloning the parts of the ship, but in the new version this is game breaking bug that you have to restart and start you vessel from scratch.

Exactly like Ekudram said. This bug is horrible and game breaking."}]}
