The radial decouplers appear attached properly in assembly, but when I blow them during launch the tanks don\u0027t detach, I see the decouplers slide down between the tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis must mean I attached the solid fuel tanks directly to the liquid fuel fuselage. But I\u0027ve fussed with it for hours in the assembly and I just can\u0027t get them right (I have seen them blow correctly before, but usually I\u0027m doing it wrong). How can I ensure my radial decouplers are the attachpoint and not the main fuselage? Especially complex if you try to connect say 6 solid fuel boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T23:10:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA picture would really help here, but generally parts like that follow the mouse pointer. What you should do is place your radial decoupler about where the middle of your booster is going to be, then grab your booster and hover your mouse pointer of the decoupler. If done correctly you should see the booster jump just a tad and now have a much smaller rotational radius. (Angle snap helps with this part)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Othuyeg","CreatedById":105454,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T23:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich of the decouplers are you using? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it the TT-38K Radial Decoupler? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/TT-38K_Radial_Decoupler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/TT-38K_Radial_Decoupler\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could try using a structural part, such as a girder, between the decoupler and the booster.

First make sure that the decoupler is properly attached, and then ensure that you attach the booster to the decoupler directly. It will bump out onto the decoupler when you wiggle the booster from side to side across the decoupler. Once you have your assembly complete, change your symettry to 6x, and then select the assembly by clicking the decoupler, and you should be able to create a perfect set of decoupled boosters every time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I can take pictures if you like.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T23:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can rotate your view up (up arrow) to look down on the rocket, and see the difference when the booster is on the decoupler compared to just on the core\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T02:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are a couple pictures that will hopefully help.
