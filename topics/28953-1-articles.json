I can\u0027t figure out how to do that. I\u0027ve got a ship ready to go to Duna, but the planetary alignment is all wrong. Help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo date, my only inter-planetary mission was pure luck. I was just playing with a large booster design and I accidentally hit escape velocity while toying around in orbit. It just so happened that my trajectory took me reasonably close to Duna, and I managed to get it into orbit. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t have enough gas to get back. The ship I\u0027ve built should be able to refuel my stranded Kerbalnauts and get everyone back home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T02:15:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if this is what you\u0027re talking about (and it\u0027s probably not), but you can timewarp while sitting on the launchpad. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diggydug","CreatedById":65975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T02:40:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not first get into orbit around Kerbin and then speed up time until Duna is in the right spot?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as astropapi1 said, you can speed up time on the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fish in a Barrel","CreatedById":67130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T02:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome! That worked! I knew I had to be overlooking something obvious. I didn\u0027t expect it to let me to get up to 100,000x when it won\u0027t let you warp that high in low orbit.

From orbit, it could conceivably take a while (in real time) for Duna to come into the right angle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoDores","CreatedById":56567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T05:02:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt can be convenient to build a little rover including any mods like Protractor that you use to calculate launch trajectories and then drive it a few km away from the launchpad. You can switch to it and warp at high speed to your launch window, then launch your ship. This is really handy if you have a big or unstable design that likes to take itself apart on the launchpad under warp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T05:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, if you\u0027re willing to use mods, Kerbal Alarm Clock lets you set alarms that will kill time warp when you approach a certain launch window.
