It can be self-destructed or given a minimal battery so it runs out of power (and becomes dead to guard mode) before getting shot at.

This usually allows the jets to get about 3.5km between them before missiles are launched.\n\nAnother one of mine is a variation of the one in use now, but instead of taking off in the same direction, they take off in opposite directions (team A heads west, team B head east) so that, again, there\u0027s at least some (usually about 2)km (rather than \u003C1km) between them when the battle \u0022begins\u0022.\n\n*From Top Gun AI Tourney Thread*\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t like the no rcs rule. What is the point? It isn\u0027t op in atmosphere, and to stop wing spam you could also say no more than 2 true wings( largest surface area vs control surfaces, which have moving parts. If the wing can move individually it must be locked).\n\nSo would canards, for example, have to be locked? I use them frequently as tail fins and rear wings... is this bad form or \u0022cheaty\u0022 or something?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T17:46:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T17:36:15Z","Content":"No, the canards are control surfaces.

My most recent designs (which are proving to be a worthy foe to the XMF ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)) have included a \u0022body wing\u0022 that kinda wraps around the fuselage of the jet, to provide a little extra lift all around, and that definitely uses more than 2 wings.

Due to the latter\u0027s biplane configuration, it has high drag but massive lift, and it uses its low stall speed but high turn rate to get inside of other craft (as its turn radius is and can remain small); faster planes \u0022waste time\u0022 decelerating to optimal turning speeds, whereas the Double Down does not.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It was annoying but I always felt I was close to cracking it.
