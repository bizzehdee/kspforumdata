When I set up my command module I take an octagonal strut and place it on top. Next I put 2 radial chutes and attach them to the sides of the strut and add them to command group 2 to deploy. Next I take a drogue chute and slap it on top and add it to command group 1 to open and again to group 2 to cut the drogue chute lines. Afterwards I take the strut with the chutes attached and flip it upside down and clip in into the command pod so that the top attachment node uses the node on top of the pod. Then I surface attach a docking port on top of it all. If done right you should only see the capsule and the docking port. You might want to confirm on the pad that you didn\u0027t block the hatch with drogue chute. If you are then you might need to add a small strut between the octagonal strut and the drogue chute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to use: Do your normal re-entry but dont pop your drogue chute (group 1) until your speed has slowed to \u0026lt;200m/s.

A human lying on the ground can survive 1g no problem (funny that, we\u0027ve been doing so for at least a million years). However, put a car on top of that person, and 1g will mean a squished person. A tank that can handle being between a mainsail producing 1500kN of thrust and a 36t jumbo tank (plus a 0.1t probe module) certainly should be able to survive being between a mainsail producing 1500kN of thrust and a 0.1t probe module, despite the acceleration being radically different (3.28g vs .14.4g). Of course, a human on top of the latter would be having a very bad day (but would likely survive if lying down) while on top of the former would be not even uncomfortable (when lying).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, why is it that a tank that can handle 1306kN from below and 1162kN from above cannot handle 650.9kN from below and 14.15kN from above?

Note that accelerative force will not cause any damage as it is spread evenly across all particles in the tank (as a first approximation, anyway).
