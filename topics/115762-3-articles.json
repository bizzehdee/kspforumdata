Today, we get first glimpse of not one but two incredible sights! Just after dawn Technology Demonstrator 1 blast off into cloudless sky!\n\n![wLARXbl.png](http://i.imgur.com/wLARXbl.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E T-DEM1 is carrying several advanced new technologies for communication and planetary observation, and is boldly bound where no probe has gone before? Why does sound familiar...?\n\n![ylL1xuj.png](http://i.imgur.com/ylL1xuj.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Stolitsa places payload into initial 180x120km orbit at 42 degrees inclination. Immediately visible are new highly advanced sun-tracking solar arrays, to avoid embarrassing loss of power due to incorrect attitude. High-pressure balloon fuel tanks, orbital telescope, and long-range conical antenna also visible on new ultra-lightweight deep space chassis.\n\n![prmfyvo.png](http://i.imgur.com/prmfyvo.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hypergolic transfer stage places T-DEM1 on trajectory to Minmus!\n\n![5Si8pzV.png](http://i.imgur.com/5Si8pzV.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Long-term storage monopropellant engine provides minor course correction, and soon T-DEM-1 is approaching last unexplored body in local Kerbin area!\n\n![T5vUHdC.png](http://i.imgur.com/T5vUHdC.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E First stunning high-resolution image from near Minmus returned by advanced long-range dish antenna!\n\n![utdX3r0.png](http://i.imgur.com/utdX3r0.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E T-DEM1 passes within 22km of Minmusian surface, returning treasure trove of useful Science!, before swinging back past Kerbin. On-board engine then boosts speed to well beyond Kerbin escape velocity! Finally, after much work, T-DEM1 successfully leaves Kerbin SOI while maintaining contact with Kermangrad control! 96Gm-range antenna should maintain communication well into future. Science from interplanetary space has at long last been returned!\n\n![XfQyE9s.png](http://i.imgur.com/XfQyE9s.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We move from victory to victory, Comrades! With preparations for historic launch to orbit of brave Sergei Kermanski proceeding as planned, Imperious Academy of Sciences has announced Sergei will command first flight of new, next-generation space ship!\n\n![3zPAlfv.png](http://i.imgur.com/3zPAlfv.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Pioneering Orbiters of early crewed space program are, by necessity, greatly lacking in utility. New space craft will open door to not only exist but perform useful tasks in space! Shown here with Sergei is early mock-up of yet-unnamed craft, showcasing capacity for two crewmembers.\n\n![LghSkbu.png](http://i.imgur.com/LghSkbu.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Docking port, RCS with full translation authority, and reliable hypergolic engines capable of multiple restarts will open way to long-term presence in LKO and beyond!\n\n![N1q8CM4.png](http://i.imgur.com/N1q8CM4.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Shown here are high-capacity toroid fuel tanks in service module, along with multiple banks of batteries. Later revisions will feature fuel cells for long-duration flight, once technology has been researched. Crew tunnel and small living space runs down centerline of ship from return capsule to docking port.\n\n![GamsOF9.png](http://i.imgur.com/GamsOF9.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Despite exponential increase in capability, new ship is only modest increase in mass. Current Orbiter flight article masses hefty 4.5 tonnes, mostly due to heavy launch escape system and protective nosecone. Next generation ship weighs only 5.7 tonnes! Great weight savings have been realized by replacing heavy escape tower with radially-mounted solid abort motors. 5.7 tonnes being just out of reach of current-model Stolitsa launcher, new high-capacity launch vehicle will be required!\n\n![TPFEa9x.png](http://i.imgur.com/TPFEa9x.png)\n\n![6mIYmfW.png](http://i.imgur.com/6mIYmfW.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Stop that, Sergei.

The engineer spared a glance at the interloper, knew better than to ask where the pictures had come from, knew from experience that it wasn\u0027t *healthy*. He squinted, reached over to flick on a second light, took a closer look. \n\n\u0022Bigger than their IAS-3 pod. What\u0027s this probe on the back?\u0022\n\n\u0022You don\u0027t miss much do you?\u0022 The intruder\u0027s voice was casual, friendly even, but the engineer knew better, the compliment settling cold and hard in his gut. \u0022It\u0027s too big to be a pitot tube. Could you mount an antenna axially?\u0022\n\n\u0022Sure. Why would you want to?\u0022 The engineer leaned over the grainy photos, frowned. \u0022These structural supports are symmetrical. Right down the long axis of the pod. Almost looks like an gangway tunnel. . .\u0022\n\n\u0022How about a docking probe? Could that be an access hatch on the back?\u0022\n\n\u0022Nope. On the wrong side of the heat shield.\u0022 The frown deepened. \u0022Unless. . .\u0022\n\nHe sat back suddenly, tapped the photo. \u0022These boxes. . .this could be an inflatable heat shield.\u0022\n\n\u0022Excuse me?\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s. . .a bit like an emergency life raft I guess. You go up to orbit, run your mission, pass everything you need through the aft bulkhead on the capsule, and then, when you\u0027re done, you pop this shield open and it covers all the delicate bits on the way down. All the protection of a rigid ablative shield, none of the drawbacks.\u0022 The engineer ran a finger over one of the photos, couldn\u0027t help a bit of longing. \u0022We messed with this a couple of years ago. Couldn\u0027t make it work.\u0022 He shook his head. \n\n\u0022They really built this, this isn\u0027t a mock-up?\u0022\n\nThe intruder smiled. \u0022They shipped it to their integration facility this morning.\u0022\n\nThe engineer rubbed his eyes, his annoyance getting in the way of his better judgment. \u0022We have file cabinets full of mission profiles that we\u0027ve had to abandon because we couldn\u0027t figure a way to pass propellant or personnel through or around the heat shield on the capsule. If we\u0027d had this. . .\u0022 He caught the other\u0027s careful poker face, cut himself off, was aware now that he was being measured. \u0022Well, we work with what we have.\u0022\n\n\u0022That\u0027s right.\u0022 The other settled his hat back on his head. \u0022Make sure you remember that.\u0022\n\n===============================================\n\nHaving spent a significant amount of time beating my head against this particular problem, I\u0027m afraid I have to ask. . .how are you handling reentry with that docking port and access tunnel? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T03:57:45Z","Content":"\u00C3\u00C2\u00A6SS\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00C2\u00AFI \u00C3\u00C2\u00A6\u00C3\u00E2\u201E\u00A2I\u00C3\u00C2\u00A4\u00C3\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 \u00C3\u00C2\u00A4F IMP\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u201D\u00C3\u00C2\u00AFI\u00C3\u00C2\u00A4\u00C3\u00C2\u00A6S ST\u00C3\u00E2\u20ACT\u00C3\u00C2\u00ADS\n\n\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE\u00C3\u00C2\u00B1\u00C3\u2018\u00C5 \u00C3\u2018\u00C2\u00C3\u00C2\u00B2\u00C3\u00C2\u00BB\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00BD\u00C3\u00C2\u00B8\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5 : \u00C3\u2018\u00C2\u00C3\u00C2\u00B2\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u2018\u00C2\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00BA\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u00C2\u00BD\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE\u00C3\u00C2\u00B9\n\n\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE\u00C3\u00C2\u00BB\u00C3\u2018\u00C5\u2019\u00C3\u00C2\u00BA\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE \u00C3\u00C2\u00B3\u00C3\u00C2\u00BB\u00C3\u00C2\u00B0\u00C3\u00C2\u00B7\u00C3\u00C2\u00B0!\n\n\u00C3\u00E2\u201E\u00A2\u00C3\u00C5\u00A1\u00C3\u00C2\u00A4T\u00C3\u00C2\u00AC\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![uMOLhatch.JPG](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NrCQoXm_Ayk/UEVCpWgcBxI/AAAAAAAAAUk/buGnPMEuON0/s1600/uMOLhatch.JPG)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![dsc04303.jpg](http://heroicrelics.org/wpafb/800x600/dsc04303.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u00C3\u00C5\u00B8\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00B4\u00C3\u2018\u00C6\u2019\u00C3\u00C2\u00BF\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00B6\u00C3\u00C2\u00B4\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00BD\u00C3\u00C2\u00B8\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5: \u00C3\u00C2\u00AD\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161 \u00C3\u00C2\u00B4\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE\u00C3\u00C2\u00BA\u00C3\u2018\u00C6\u2019\u00C3\u00C2\u00BC\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00BD\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161 \u00C3\u2018\u00C2\u00C3\u00C2\u00B0\u00C3\u00C2\u00BC\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE\u00C3\u2018\u00C6\u2019\u00C3\u00C2\u00BD\u00C3\u00C2\u00B8\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00A1\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE\u00C3\u00C2\u00B6\u00C3\u00C2\u00B8\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u2018\u00C2\u00C3\u2018\u00C2 \u00C3\u00C2\u00B2 \u00C3\u00C2\u00BF\u00C3\u2018\u00C2\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u2018\u00C5\u2019 \u00C3\u2018\u00C2\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00BA\u00C3\u2018\u00C6\u2019\u00C3\u00C2\u00BD\u00C3\u00C2\u00B4"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T06:12:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Greetings, Comrades!

You can brute force your way into space in stock, but in 6.4 scales the tyranny of the rocket equation kicks in *hard*. It\u0027s challenging getting *anything* into space, let alone something that works *well*. So once you\u0027ve put in that effort and finally do, you\u0027re naturally encouraged to *keep* it and just make small refinements. So you end up with something very polished, and ProceduralParts just amplifies that cuz you can dial in \\*just enough\\* rocket. Shania\\_L\u0027s designs seem to reflect that too, even tho we seem to have completely different approaches to solving other problems. Much credit also goes to the mod crews like FAR \u0026 PP, etc, who keep making them better and better to where even the taper of a rocket affects stability.\n\nMy first forays into 6.4 scale suffered from alot of aesthetic inefficiency... \n\n![jasz0Q7.png](http://i.imgur.com/jasz0Q7.png)\n\n![ZuN3mak.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZuN3mak.png)\n\n... and also, explosions.\n\nETA:\n\nSpeaking of aesthetics, I actually got \n\n\u003E ![TNAoqx5.png](http://i.imgur.com/TNAoqx5.png)\n\n\u003E  to work including futzing around in GIMP and I\u0027m rather pleased with it [/tootingmyownhorn]\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-15T06:51:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2015 06:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"GarrisonChisholm","CreatedById":146403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T08:23:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thankee ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E Speaking of aesthetics, I actually got \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [http://i.imgur.com/TNAoqx5.png](http://i.imgur.com/TNAoqx5.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E  to work including futzing around in GIMP and I\u0027m rather pleased with it [/tootingmyownhorn]\n\nThat looks sweeeet..."},{"CreatedByName":"Shania_L","CreatedById":58975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T17:24:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Shania\\_L\u0027s designs seem to reflect that too, even tho we seem to have completely different approaches to solving other problems.\n\nThat would be your love affair with solid boosters and face melting G forces yes?\n\nI may be further ahead in terms of \u0022things done\u0022 (I have no idea how much actual in-game time you have burned though) but then you are tying your game in much closer to a cohesive storyline to a level I can only dream of.\n\nI will freely admit though, I am slightly less restricted than you by (still) using 0.90 I do not have to deal with RealFuels ullage simulation and limited ignitions. This can drastically simplify my orbital craft by having a single engine that can do circularisation, orbital adjustments and then retro burn.

The \u0022fuels\u0022 part works fine, but only a couple of engines have limited ignititions or ullage requirements. Kinda bummed about it but unwilling to risk borking anything *else* up trying to fix it anymore."}]}
