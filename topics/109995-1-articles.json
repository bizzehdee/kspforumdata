Then go to the main vessel and use translation (or if you know how, use main engine thrust) to move the docking port target marker on the navball in the opposite orientation . if docking port is facing due east, put the docking port target marker on the main vessel due west using translation. Once the docking port is in the correct orientation, it should be a simple task to dock.
