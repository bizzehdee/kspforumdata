I took a copy to Gilly which was interesting, I covered a few kilometres mostly with the wheels not touching the ground and could only reach a top speed of 7 m/s. On Eve it performed admirably, having no trouble with the gravity and reaching speeds of 25-30 m/s even up 25-degree slopes, taking a dip in the sea then backing out using RCS, and covering around 60 km in total. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Duna it did rather less admirably. My first landing attempt in stock aerodynamics resulted in disintegration on chute opening. My second in FAR\u002BDRE landed safely and covered around 20 km. I built it to cope with crashes and tested it extensively on Kerbin, and on Duna it survived a 70 mph rollover and used its SRIMEC engines to get back on its wheels, only to then be heavily damaged in an 85 mph tumble. The Kerbal survived but he wasn\u0027t going any further. Which all means I\u0027ve never actually seen if it can launch back into Duna orbit like it\u0027s designed to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, arguably, there was my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/poC3fm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELaythe Boat\u003C/a\u003E. It\u0027s capable of land travel but driving it is seriously hairy - the thing is unstable, wobbly, and thanks to using propellers lacks the power to climb steep slopes. Really it\u0027s unwise to do much more than beach it. On the ocean it\u0027s much better, capable of a steady 20 m/s and stable at 4x warp, just don\u0027t try and turn it too hard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T14:19:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used a E-Propeller-powered Rover to gather all the science from Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now it is waiting for a manned salvaging Mission which is on the way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Prop is from the Mod KAX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76668-0-90-Kerbal-Aircraft-Expansion-(KAX)-v2-3-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76668-0-90-Kerbal-Aircraft-Expansion-(KAX)-v2-3-3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f5YoO3q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f5YoO3q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dirty Bob","CreatedById":59885,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T16:47:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thread made me remember my ridiculous rover from the science career update.
