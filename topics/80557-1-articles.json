I couldn\u0027t find it mentioned already, so I\u0027d thought I\u0027d post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERag-doll physics is not terribly kind to large rockets. Some are subject to seemingly random structural failures, especially when the physics kicks in, when engines light, and when engines cut out. Others pick up resonance-like shaking, eventually tearing themselves apart. This latter effect is exacerbated, not countered, by SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the questions I could find on the subject, answers (other than well-it-works-for-me answers) tended to fall into three categories:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdd more struts and more launch clamps, often to excess. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUse a particular strutting pattern, usually cross bracing. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUse smaller parts. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are all good suggestions, but none of them is consistently helpful; sometimes you can try all three and still bounce apart before liftoff. So I want to add to category 2 something I\u0027ve found to be more reliable: Toroidal Strutting\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general idea is that you want your structural connections to lie along the surface of one or more imaginary \u0022donuts\u0022. For a typical rocket design, the donut\u0027s inner wall will comprise tanks, engines, and the inter-stage stack decouplers, while the lower surface will be the wider early stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the outer wall, I tend to build rigging towers atop my first-stage tanks, joining them with struts along the toroidal perpendicular. My torus\u0027s upper surface is formed by rigging struts from the towers to later stages. However, experimentation suggests that it\u0027s the donut shape, not towers and rigging specifically, that matters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs best I can tell, the reason is that open ends in the structure graph don\u0027t damp relative orientation differences (\u0022buckling\u0022). Toroidal strutting, on the other hand, keeps these perturbations propagating around cycles, damping them at each junction. Lateral motion can still accumulate (\u0022rocking\u0022), and will sometimes tear off a launch clamp, but it won\u0027t snap the rocket itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Obviously, toroidal strutting alone won\u0027t hold a rocket together; you\u0027ll still need some bracing. And I\u0027ve found that some designs require more than one torus.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example, my Quebec 0, with traditional strutting (835 parts):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi58.tinypic.com/2n1fcd5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222n1fcd5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 seconds after launch (full throttle, RCS enabled, SAS enabled, liftoff):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi62.tinypic.com/2n1cos5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222n1cos5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same rocket, with toroidal strutting (817 parts):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi59.tinypic.com/2h2lf2u.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222h2lf2u.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E102 after launch (same procedure):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi57.tinypic.com/xnf1g8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xnf1g8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Okay, you can\u0027t see much, but notice that the log shows no damage until the first stage separates and gets scorched by the second.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy KSP version: 23.0 (Yeah, I know; I\u0027ll update sometime.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy mods: BTSM (and its dependencies) and a few cosmetic mods\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T11:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice first post - welcome to the forums :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re talking about the way spokes are arranged on a classic lightweight wire bicycle wheel, and for much the same reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoke#mediaviewer/File:Bicycle_wheel.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoke#mediaviewer/File:Bicycle_wheel.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
