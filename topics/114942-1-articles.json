These are important in interplanetarys journey and can influence delta v budget significantly. \n\nSo there shoudl be option to add \u0022virtual stage\u0022 at some point on stage tree. It woudl just add some mass to ship at some point or do the opposite. \n\nIt woudl make planning much easier."}]}
