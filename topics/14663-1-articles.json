The only difference between them is mass, as the fl-t500 fuel tank has a mass of 2.5 whilst the mk1 has a mass of 1.2. note that the drag ratings for these parts are also identical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy method: (note that mech-jeb was used for accuracy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- set heading of 90.4 degrees (runway is aligned to 90.4 for some reason)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- set a pitch of 15 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- throttle up to 2 divisions below maximum thrust \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- fire engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- record speed at 10,000 meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- rinse and repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for a little theory, if lift is proportional to the wings attack angle relative to it\\\u0027s velocity vector (which i believe to be the case currently) and the vertical and horizontal components of force in the form of thrust from the engines are also the same (which they are, as pitch and thrust setting were kept constant), then one would expect to find that the two identical aircraft climb through the same altitude at the same velocity, regardless of differences in mass. however this does not appear to be the case as seen below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe single mk1 craft: (average 473m/s at 10,000 metres) 5 repeats\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m544/101m4n/singlemk1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022singlemk1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe single fl-t500 craft: (average 407m/s at 10,000 metres) 5 repeats\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m544/101m4n/singlefl-t500.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022singlefl-t500.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas you can see, there is a very noticeable difference between the two crafts speeds at 10,000 meters, the surface info panel was also included as there may be something that i missed there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeither way, this would seem to imply that the drag force on an aircraft is proportional to it\\\u0027s mass in some way, which is not terribly realistic to say the least :S, if i am missing something obvious, or there is something horribly wrong with my method (entirely possible), then please do point it out.
