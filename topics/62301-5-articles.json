Would it be helpful for CLS itself to impliment and \u0022open hatch / close hatch\u0022 functionality for docking ports? The idea is that you could dock two craft together, but the docking ports would remain impassable until you rightclicked and chose \u0022open hatch\u0022. Obviously you could repeart this and choose \u0022close hatch\u0022 at which point the Habitable living spaces would become joined.\u003Cp\u003EThe reason that this can up was that I am writing the crew random movement mod, as a way of testing is CLD provides what it needs to, and I realise that there is the chance of two kerbals randomly swapping seat just before you undock, which would be really annoying. This way you can \u0022close the hatch\u0022 and then you know who is on which side of the hatch before you undock. It could also be useful for other features that might use CLS, such as dealing with a hull breach in a pressuriation mod, or locking a kerbal \u0022in the brig\u0022 if his goes crazy in a sanity mod to stop him from driving everyone else nuts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelpful?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that would be a very useful extension, though it does also imply that it would be necessary to explicitly close the hatch before decoupling, or face a sudden shortness of breath for your crew.

Note that the docking port is highlighted in magenta to indicate that although it is docked (usually cyan) the hatch is closed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s8.postimg.org/b34aaa1id/screenshot150.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot150.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor completeness here is the other Living Space. As you would expect its docking port is also coloured magenta as we closed the hatch on it too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am hoping that this new feature does not break the API in anyway. The API will have a new property on it - to allow 3rd party mods to check to see if a hatch is open or not on a part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you undock while a hatch is open, the hatch is automatically closed. There is no suggestion that CLS is going to simulate depressurisations and blowing kerbals out into space (\u0022rapid unplanned EVA\u0022?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis feature should be useful for KerbalHotSeat to prevent Jeb changing seats just before you undock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will do some more testing and then make this available as a prerelease for a few days so interested parties can check it works before making a formal release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news - I see that progress is being made in providing CLS support for Ship Manifest which will give us CLS compatable crew transfers (very exciting). I am also aware of another modder who has started a project that will eventually use CLS, but has not announced anything yet, so I will keep quite about it for now (that is also really exciting too!!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dix2lespace","CreatedById":95338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T19:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Codepoet!
