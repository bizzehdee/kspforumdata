Delta I/II/7000 series, Titan III and Titan IV, etc. are all basically re-purposed and upgraded ICBMs, although they don\u0027t have much in common with their predecessor designs anymore, so this approach has a well know history of working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current ground-based ICBM that the US uses is entirely solid fueled except for the last stage, and they\u0027re in bunkers specifically designed to take a (nearly) direct hit from a nuke and still be able to launch, complete with support infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe liquid fueled rockets would be able to get better performance, but they\u0027ve been decommissioned so they\u0027re probably not available except as museum pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, the solid\u0027s are probably more likely to still be around in a recognizable or possibly even useful form after a long amount of time, anything less than a total nuclear exchange, or a limited amount of both. Then again, they\u0027re DELIBERATELY not connected to the internet, so figuring out if there\u0027s any available, or what condition they\u0027re in, would be problematic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding ressurecting \u0022museum rockets\u0022, I\u0027d suggest that they NOT be brought to flight ready status. Instead, use them as a pattern to copy off of, compensating for any defects that are encountered, and replacing the guidance systems with something more modern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf more modern guidance systems aren\u0027t an option, you could probably still get away with vacuum tubes, reed relays, and core memory if the situation is really desperate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, a better use for that \u0022primitive\u0022 level of electronics would be to build controls for a basic semiconductor fab. Even if there was a nuclear exchange that disabled all the solid-state electronics that you can get access to, you could still MAKE solid state electronics by recycling the \u0022fried\u0022 silicon into material suitable for use by the semiconductor fab. Also, any solar panels that could be scavenged would be useful with a little bit of refining. Solar panels are already diodes, at least from an electrical point of view, but the quality of silicon that they use is lower than chip-grade silicon. Recycling would certainly beat refining raw beach sand into chip-grade silicon, at least at first, simply because it\u0027s so much closer to the form you need it in anyways. The stuff from the dead chips literally IS in the form you need it in, just damaged and non-functional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecycling also saves energy, which is sure to be scarce in a post-global-conflict age.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of energy, that\u0027s another reason the Gulf coast of Texas is a great place for this rocket-centered industry \u0022re-boot\u0022. Easy access to large-scale petrochemical deposits, (rocket fuel) and a good location to launch rockets from. That\u0027s a winner if I ever saw one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T19:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI doubt any modern ICBM would be able to put a payload on Mars.

I was aiming for them to be used to put supplies and components into LEO for assembly into a ship or payload for said ship that would then be sent to mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer stage for the ship would be either launched separately or built on-site using components launched on the ICBMs or other available launch vehicles, with a preference for as large of a launch vehicle as available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe decision to go for one method over another would depend on what type of engine is used, among other factors. Cryogenic-fueled transfer stages would likely need to be launched separately as described above, unless you launched the transfer stage early, then launched a fuel tanker (or just the full main fuel tank) shortly before departure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething like a nuclear-electric ion propulsion system could be sent up with a much wider tolerance, because their reaction mass is a compressed inert gas, however some electric propulsion methods can use hydrogen as well for better specific impulse. Now that I think of it, I would probably go with the Nuclear-electric route, and leverage the advantages of both fuel types for higher overall performance, while only slightly complicating the plumbing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I would use something like an MPDT or VASIMR with the Trans-Martian-Injection fueled with hydrogen in drop tanks, swapping to an on-board noble gas supply for mid-course maneuvers, taking advantage of an aerocapture maneuver to enter Mars orbit, followed by using the engines to raise the orbit out of the atmosphere before cargo delivery starts. Cargo delivery would be done by a number of containers each capable of independent self-targeted re-entry, with a small hypergolic propulsion system used for the de-orbit burn, followed by a pretty standard heatshield - parachute - airbag EDL sequence. The heatshield would probably be inflatable with a rapid-setting foam that would produce an insulating char layer if the facing of the heatshield is breached. Additionally, the foam could provide the final few inches of padding that the airbags might not catch. The containers would likely be aluminum, carbon fiber, or some mix of the two, and probably end up with some rather familiar dimensions (standard cargo-ship container, heatshield on one end, chute pack and de-orbit motor on the other) The only things that the guidance system would have control over would be when the engine is fired, what direction, and when the recovery devices are deployed. It does not attempt to maneuver during re-entry, as an attempt to reduce overall system complexity and cost for what is, after all, largely a disposable system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s actually a fairly simple solution to moving the cargo over the surface of Mars once it gets there. A certain fraction of the containers would contain self-driving rough terrain electric cargo trucks, along with a number of wheel-sets similar to a trailer dolly, that can be attached to the exterior of the containers after they touch down via the same points that connected them to the spacecraft during the interplanetary transfer. The cargo trucks would have equipment for attaching and detaching the wheels to the containers, and would be equipped for drone control as well as being capable of automated driving as an augment and a backup to their programming. The self-driving programming would also act as an automated collision avoidance system while the drone control system is active, because the drone control system would likely be used for fine maneuvers that the autopilot couldn\u0027t otherwise handle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T20:42:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf Mars is sending out a mission to retrieve the stuff they need, dont they already have a transfer stage?
