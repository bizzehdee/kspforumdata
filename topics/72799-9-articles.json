My thought was that this may be related to the very small buffer allowed for molten and enriched rock. I tried editing those values in the configs. Editing the configs seemed to have no impact on already deployed parts, so I edited the save file to match the new .cfgs. I was able to double the buffer, (max. amounts of Molten Rock and Enriched Rock), but not beyond that point, no matter what the numbers were set to in the .cfgs or the save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, two issues. Please ensure that conversion rates per real time second properly scale with game time warp beyond 5x. Also, are some of the values in the .cfgs for jaw/converters etc... hard capped in the .dll? If so, could you loosen those caps for those that wish to tweak the numbers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E^TIA\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo worries, both of those should be taken care of since I\u0027m switching completely to the new converter used by Karbonite, MKS, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust need to wrap up my texturing for the night \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PsY4","CreatedById":118271,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T14:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi RoverDude, great addon you have here !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to try it, and it worked great at first but now i have a weird problem :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First i sent the Jaw, attached it to the surface like a claw, and started jawing the rock, all was good... nice dust effect, and rock flowing....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Now i\u0027m back with a second rocket.
