Although I was in town for unrelated business, I decided to to visit the Space Center, since I was too close to not stop by when I had the chance. This time, I remembered to take a few pictures, and thought I would share them here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E22fLQm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022E22fLQm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Space Shuttle\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPathfinder\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewas a mock up built out of steel and wood for ground testing, and was not meant for flight.

This rocket has been at the museum since it opened in 1969, and was delivered the same day as the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle, which now lies horizontal inside the museum. Also, they had one of those centifuge rides you can usually find at carnivals, but I decided not to ride it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lnj4NOh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lnj4NOh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not the Saturn V I mentioned in the last caption, but rather a replica built for the museum in the 1990s. It stands in such a way that you can walk under the first stage and peer up into the engine nozzles. Again, the size of these things in pictures can be very deceptive. I still can\u0027t fathom how big the rocket is. I believe I made a remark about how the F-1 engine was big enough for me to make a small house out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zHh625X.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zHh625X.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a mock-up of the entirety of Skylab (solar panels sold separately), as opposed to just the workshop as shown in an earlier photo. It looks like this thing has been there for some time, and I doubt it\u0027s going to be moved any time soon. If you look closely underneath the telescope you might see a person (he just happened to be there, I don\u0027t know him) which should give you an idea of how big the station is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are all the pictures I have, and they don\u0027t come close to encompassing how awesome this museum is. In addition to these exhibits, they had the Apollo 12 Mobile Quarantine Trailer, a Mercury simulator, several Gemini trainers, a V-2, the cabin for the Apollo Command Module simulator (which you could climb in), a replica of Wernher von Braun\u0027s office with his original desk, chair, and rocket models, and so much more. If you happen to be travelling through or near Huntsville, make sure to swing by (and allow at least five hours), it\u0027s definitely worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T19:01:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222830654\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151173\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477852838\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022131541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pTrevTrevs\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, pTrevTrevs said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\napparently he was an astronaut too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf the tourist kind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Raging Sandwich","CreatedById":164377,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T19:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been there dozens of times as I live near its general vicinity.
