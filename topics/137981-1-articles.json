I think it might be good to introduce myself.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have been playing KSP for a long time, since the release of 0.21 and sure I have been reading this forum (only to find answers to specific questions) and KSP Wiki, but I decided to join the community only now. The story is quite short: I experienced several problems with mods and their compatibility, decided to ask help\\submit a bug report to their creators, but after I created an account here I somehow managed to deal with this problems by myself. Then I looked around, read a lot of KSP-community threads just for fun and decided to stay here because this forum is... you know, nice, friendly, sometimes funny and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"unevoie","CreatedById":158709,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T16:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi! \u00A0It\u0027s great to see that you\u0027re adding your voice to the community. \u00A0I\u0027m a new KSP player (a button-masher, really...), but I too find the KSP community rather great. \u00A0Cheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T18:34:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello BoPET and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m always pleased to welcome a lurker into the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T05:15:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
