For this, I wanted to use the classical Synchronous (Duna-Stationary), three Sattellite set-up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, Ike, that **** rock is in the way. Right on my desired orbit. However, I thought I was being smart and set up a synchronous orbit way outside of the Ike SOI:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YhGZSV0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YhGZSV0.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(if I didn\u0027t make a calculation mistake, the Ike SOI should be to scale)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I spent quite an amount of time to position those satellites perfectly. They had minimal deviation in distance and they were synchronized to the tenth of a second.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen one got ejected. I thought I maybe made a mistake, and somehow it actually got into Ike\u0027s SOI. I fixed up the other two as exact as I could.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen another one got ejected. And this makes me quite mad actually, since this time I am 100% sure that they were positioned and synchronized perfectly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I have 2 questions:\u003Cbr\u003E\na) Is it just me, or does Ike grow when everyone is asleep and devours all poor little Duna-synchronous sattelites?\u003Cbr\u003E\nb) How do you RemoteTech around Duna?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-27T10:54:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2016 10:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kobymaru\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T16:58:15Z","Content":"\nWell, Ike is not only in a synchronous orbit around Duna, but also tidally locked.

Synchronous offers little advantage. Duna is the easiest place to cover because of Ike\u0026#39;s proximity. Unlike Mun and Minmus, you don\u0026#39;t need extra antennas to get to Ike.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy chosen method is lower than Ike at around 2000km. For this you only need Communotron 32\u0026#39;s for interlinks which also covers other vessels anywhere in LDO as well as Ike itself. However this also has the drawback of being blocked by Ike and Duna simultaneously, which means ALL of your 3 satellites must have long range dishes to Kerbin to prevent it (all 3 cannot be blocked, it\u0026#39;s impossible... except by the sun). You also still have to cover the back side of Ike for full coverage, but the good news there is you just need C32\u0026#39;s to do it since Ike is in range of your Duna satellites (C16\u0026#39;s might work, but I\u0026#39;m not confident that Ike wouldn\u0026#39;t occasionally fall out of range of the Duna satellites).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ve tried matching orbits with a moon, but as you found out they always seem to get ejected, no matter how close you try to match their orbital period.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T17:55:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 05:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T17:53:48Z","Content":"\nYes, RemoteTech really doesn\u0026#39;t need synchronous, for any planet.

In this case, the satellites at a 2000km orbit I mentioned earlier should have a stable range at 5400km with the C32\u0026#39;s, which is well clear of Ike (if you do this I would add a safety margin and do 5000km, still clear of Ike). \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[U][B]However[/B][/U] you still need at least two of these new satellites to avoid being blocked by either Duna or Ike (you can\u0026#39;t be blocked by both if they are in exact opposing positions, since Ike would be behind your second satellite while the first is behind Duna). By the time you factor in the cost of batteries and probes and fuel and engines, I think simply putting 3 long range on the lower satellites is still cheaper. Only 2 of those can possibly be blocked at a time.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kobymaru","CreatedById":107372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T10:18:12Z","Content":"\nThanks for your input guys! The basic idea with the Duna-Synchronous sattelites was that I could set directional antennas on Duna to one sattelite and never worry about it.
