Let\u0027s say you have a single stage launcher that is 90% propellant and 10% dry mass. If your initial thrust-to-weight ratio is 1.2, you\u0027re TWR will max out at 12 by the time the engine burns off the last of the propellant (assuming fixed thrust). That high a g-load will likely cause your crew to blackout. Staging allows you to not only drop unneeded dry mass, but to also switch to lower thrust engines to manage the acceleration loads. Since all engines in KSP are throttleable, you can avoid this problem by simply dialing back the thrust.
