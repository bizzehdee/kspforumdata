As others have said, these need to be the sort of thing we can do in an hour or two of real-time or people just won\u0027t have the opportunity to join in. Maybe, in this case, set one of those as the challenge target with a note that if someone is using RT (can\u0027t see any way it would \u003Cem\u003Ehelp\u003C/em\u003E, by the way!) they will also need networks around the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway ... here is my dummy network. \u0022Chatbox\u0022 is a variant of \u0022Cartographer Heavy\u0022 from my tutorial, pushing 5 dummy \u0022ChatSat\u0022s. 3 are spaced around a high(ish) equatorial orbit for each body, the transfer vehicle then changes to a polar orbit and places the other two in highly-eliptical orbits (the name for which I forget). In such orbits they\u0027ll be high above the poles most of the time, falling around the periapsis quickly because it\u0027s so low relatively. The satellites in polar orbits also ensure there is always communications between Kerbin-Mun-Minmus (and elsewhere when it becomes applicable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/S5y5o5T\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S5y5o5Tl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S5y5o5Tl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that this pic was taken in the Tracking Centre when the Minmus Chatbox was still en-route, because I thought it looked better.
