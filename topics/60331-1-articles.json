Each launch clamp supplies 100 of every resource per second it seems and theres no way to stop it. I need a very exact fuel amount for my mission so I can not have the launch clamps adding fuel back in. How can i stop this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gue__1","CreatedById":97916,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T16:50:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunch clamps only supply energy to keep your craft alive.
