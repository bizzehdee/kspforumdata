I noticed that the Navball is different. In Orbit mode, I see a light-blue, circular marker. Later, I was spinning my rocket around to do a landing and saw a pink triangle like the one that appears on the map when plotting a maneuver. Like I said, it\u0027s been months since I last played so everything new(er) is, well, still brand new to me. What is new in terms of the Navball? I noticed already that if the maneuver node is not shown, an arrow will point towards it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-18T01:00:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2014 01:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by deltalambdamu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T00:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the latest updated, they added navball markers for normal/anti-normal and radial in/out, as well as the original prograde/retrograde.
