The first is the standard model. At 75,022 funds, everything one can love about a wonderful vehicle that can enter a cartwheel of death at any moment comes by default. (And no, not because we don\u0027t have any extra options. And no, don\u0027t ask us about any extra options.) Detailed interior and underside. Mirrors you can pretend to look at. Taking up two parking spots at the office! Working headlights, working brakelights, an engine status light. Actually looking banged-up when you crash it.

We still don\u0027t know what that stuff is, so don\u0027t put your face in it, all we know is it makes you go way faster! (Yes, you can make the fuel last longer by not opening the valve all the way, but that\u0027s for losers. Also, you didn\u0027t hear that from us.)

No need to refuel this one! It can accelerate much faster than the standard model because it doesn\u0027t haul around a heavy fuel tank. Don\u0027t take this through populated areas. There\u0027s a high risk that you\u0027ll contaminate the residents. Also, don\u0027t look in the trunk. Customers haven\u0027t reported any ill effects from doing so, even though we told them not to, and testing is inconclusive, but we speculate that it could shorten your lifespan by approximately twenty years. 280,098 funds.
