From my small mod:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E -code snipped-\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EcrewNumber is a slider that\u0027s only visible in the VAB. When a part with my custom PartModule gets added, it checks how much Kerbals can have seat in there and updates the max. value of the slider. If the user messed up the config file the slider is turned off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t have dependencies except for the usual ones (assembly-csharp.dll and unityengine.dll). Any questions? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoly Jebediah! I\u0027ve been wondering about that for quite some time. (I swear, just this morning I was thinking about KSPAPIExtensions and wondering how I was going to convince lo-fi to accept the dependency.) I wanted to make the min/max suspension levels into variable fields so that we might reduce the number of ineffective suspension levels. Certain tracks do not effectively lower the suspension level beyond a certain point (typically at the 50% mark) and it would be awesome if that \u0022lowest possible level\u0022 for the individual part could be defined. We could then refactor the min-max levels to reference that lowest possible value as \u0022zero\u0022 and then, possibly, change the \u0022change amount\u0022 to reflect the new rate of change that would be needed to maintain the previous level of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, modifying the tracks themselves so that they could use all the levels of the suspension slider would be a better solution, but that\u0027s a lot of work compared to doing some testing and then setting a new config value to match. In theory, this could also be used to limit the suspension range if the model has the tendency to warp in an unpleasant way upon reaching the highest or lowest levels (referencing the way the tracks tend to have these little points on either end of the length areas when retracted fully. Overall, the goal would be to allow the slider to go from zero to full as far as the user is concerned, except that every level the slider goes to would have a visual impact instead of that 0-50 null-zone I\u0027ve witnessed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m excited now, can you tell?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMoving on...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did some refactoring in the KFRepulsor and KFModuleWheel modules to try and change the resource consumption from a hard-coded \u0022ElectricCharge\u0022 to a variable field. In theory, it should now be possible (once I find out if lo-fi has been messing with those files so I can make sure I\u0027m all merged up and don\u0027t conflict when committing) to set a \u0022resourceName\u0022 field in the config (defaults to \u0022ElectricCharge\u0022) to whatever valid resource you have in your game. I have not yet added any checks to make sure that the resource is valid because, quite frankly, I don\u0027t know how to start yet. I\u0027ll look into that next. For now, I can only assume that it would cause some sort of fatal error and police would find your lifeless body... or what\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eleft\u003C/em\u003E of it, smoking in front of your computer. \u003Cem\u003EThey don\u0027t call them \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Efatal\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E errors for nothing!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of all that, the variable names themselves have all changed to reflect that it is now a \u0022resource\u0022 request and not a hard-coded \u0022charge\u0022 request. Status text for the \u0022Low Energy\u0022 state has also been given a field, with a default equal to what it was before, so that an appropriate message can be created for that resource. I am unsure at this time if any of those changed variable names include any necessary config updates, but I\u0027ll be sure to check that out before committing anything to github. The goal is, of course, to make sure that, if not set in the config, that a default value is still used which is equal to what we currently use so that our fearless leader, lo-fi, does not have to change any of his WIP configs to match the new fields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, an option in the future to change all requests for resources from a wheel or repulsor, at a global level, would be awesome. I\u0027ve had this long-standing idea of KerbalFoundries having a DefaultSettings.cfg (or something similar) that could be used to define, if not overridden in the part config, a default value for several of the commonly modified, but modified uniformly, variables. In this way a global multiplier could be implemented for all charge consumption (allowing for an \u0022easy mode\u0022 setting which would allow the user to disable all resource usage on the KF parts) and a global string could be defined for what resource to consume. I would probably implement a boolean to define whether or not the part configs can override the global settings as well. It\u0027s an idea I\u0027m working on anyway, and in the far future could even include a GUI to modify global settings in the game. This would especially be useful to me in the Dust emitters. I could then set a global variable to disable all of the effects without having to add a toggle to every individual part (though, I intend to make that possible for more control in the editor as to how the particles are emitted) and, possibly, a particle limiter similar to the one available in the debug window for smokescreen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWheels within wheels I say...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo wrap up... lo-fi... have you been meddling with your modules recently?

I thought you\u0027d only just rewritten the repulsors recently. Seems a bit early to be rewriting them again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: So, I think I know why your repulsors were flinging you to insane heights. i was looking at the latest github updates and saw this in the KFRepulsor.cs file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Epublic float rideHeight = 25;\u003Cbr\u003Econst float maxRepulsorHeight = 100;\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m no expert, but if nothing else has changed in how the maximum and current ride height is calculated and applied, then you\u0027ve just set the default ride height to 25, and your default maximum to a staggering 100.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I noticed was your attempt to change the sound for the APU unit. I think you might be missing something in how you\u0027re trying to do that. The reason sound replacement doesn\u0027t use that simple sound definition is because that stopped working the way we expected to a long time ago. It used to be that you could simply put a sound file into the part directory, under a subdirectory named after the part config file, and then another subdirectory called \u0022sounds\u0022 under that, and then call it up with \u0022soundfilename = mode_that_calls_it\u0022 (for example \u0022engine_low = running\u0022). Squad made some changes to how that system works and now the best way to do sound replacement is either to replace the sound file at the source (for global replacement) or to use EFFECT nodes. Here\u0027s the way you set it up most recently in the APU config:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Esound_jet_low = KerbalFoundries/Sounds/APU\u003Cbr\u003Esound_jet_deep = KerbalFoundries/Sounds/APU\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this is basically saying that when a running state of the engine reaches what it will internally call \u0022KerbalFoundries/Sounds/APU\u0022 it will then play the sound named \u0022sound_jet_low\u0022 which I know is a bit weird, but that\u0027s how the old system worked. The name of the sound file came first, then the engine status it was used on after the equal sign. For you to properly use different sounds in the APU, you should use EFFECT nodes like most other engines that are not based n the old stock behavior would use. Either that or write your own plugin to handle the sound effects in your own way. Trying to adapt the old sound definition system is really overly complicated as to where they have to be in the directory structure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T02:08:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 02:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
