The bottom part of this is my \u0022traditional\u0022 transport. The top part is a booster I built (because 40 minutes burns were a problem).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe odd thing is, if I burn just the three bottom rockets (as below) it works fine. If I burn just the top three, it also works fine. But fire all six, and it pulls to one side quite strongly (even with three ASAS modules there). This contradicts my understanding of weight or thrust, or whatever is causing this. Any advice appreciated - I\u0027ve pulled three nukes on this mission I don\u0027t seem able to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lolware.net/kerbal/2013-11-23_00008.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-11-23_00008.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T12:18:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea on the pulling, but I can suggest you to add a 4th engine to your bottom stack, using this part \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/TVR-2160C_Mk2_Stack_Quad-Coupler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/TVR-2160C_Mk2_Stack_Quad-Coupler\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should help with the long burns a little bit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogface","CreatedById":75396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T12:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a similar problem in a completely different set of facts.

Specifically, I made the burn the \u0022long\u0022 way, then when all remaining fuel was in the top section, I went to undock the bottom one. Only, I got the \u0022can\u0027t undock\u0022 bug. After undocking the top section, then redocking it just to fix said bug, suddenly this problem went away...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDogface, answer your question, I have one ASAS between the two orange tanks, one right under the lander at the top, and one on top of that monopropellant tank you see. I realise these were probably overkill, but each section that went up and docked had its own SAS and I never planned a method of removing them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"breakthrough","CreatedById":75359,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T12:35:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESolar panels blocking the thrust of some of the upper engines causing it to be asymmetric.

And then you have the off-center thrust from that being further amplified by the reversed gimbals. Using just the upper nukes, I think it blows all three panels away before the bad gimbaling kicks in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T23:34:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter finding the top Eve ascent vehicle wasn\u0027t able to ascend from Eve, I\u0027m about to launch this whole thing again.
