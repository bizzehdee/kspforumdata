I did a little testing and came up with the following:\n\n(assuming a round trip Duna mission with a crew of 3 which should take around 6758 hours)\n\n(I am using USI LS 0.3.15 for KSP 1.05)\n\nI can run straight up supplies (23 2.5m cans)\n\nOr I can run greenhouses and attach 64 mini-packs of fertilizer (the only container that seems to be able to hold fertilizer)\n\nGiven the part count it would seem to take to just get to Duna, I can\u0027t begin to imagine what a trip to Jool would look like.  I sort of imagined I would get late game advanced parts that would allow me to build a ship that could be self-sustaining, but that appears not to be the case.\n\nAm I doing this right?  I\u0027m finding it difficult to imagine doing things like land on Tylo with the USI LS mechanics as I understand them.  The capacity of the containers doesn\u0027t seem to match the requirements of the system as I understand it.
