The hole idea of black hole radiation is the energy communicated to a black hole cannot be lost, eventually it has to be communicated back. The larger the hole the better able it is to hold onto that energy, but eventually it has to let go. Since time slows down in a black hole, the tiny amount of energy that it radiates would seem large from the point of view of the observer in the hole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheoretically a black hole could become so large that it could never communicate any radiation back, but that might be the state beyond which triggers a big bang. The concept of entropy is that the universe is always going from a state of order to disorder, our energies should eventually diffuse into space and become shifted to wavelengths longer than long wave radio signals. A black hole that does not radiate starts to violate this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should point out here that the discussion generally ignores the observer-observed relationship, time slows down from an observer looking at the observed falling into the black hole. The theory of relativity basically argues that there is no preferred tempero-spatial reference frame (alas since i am referring to relativity and not quantum mechanics its a premise to the argument). But a black hole is a special case of space time because the comoving spacetime at the event horizon is extremely dynamic.
