With the UI scaling option(s), things have gotten better. Setting those to 150% makes the game just painful for my 64-year-old eyes at native resolution instead of unplayable. Sure would be nice if the UI scaling could go to 200% instead of maxing out at 150. I\u0027ve been running KSP at 1280x800, which seems like a throwback to days of yore. The 1.2 prerelease prompted me to check out resolution issues again. It seems sort of ok at 1920x1200 and 150% scaling, but I ought to get a lot sharper display running at native resolution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe folk with 4k monitors probably have it worse, but not much advantage to me in getting one of those. 2560x1600 on a 30\u0022 monitor is already \u0022retina\u0022 quality for my retinas. :-(\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
