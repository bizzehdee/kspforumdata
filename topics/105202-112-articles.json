If you look at the proccedural parts script it uses units per kilo liter to determine the capacity of the tank. Now based on rover dudes answer ( 1 unit  of NOMS equals 1 liter) so a kerbal consumes 16.2 liters of noms. Again I just want to be faithful to rover dudes mod. This also means that a procedural tank carryingg supplies will have a slightly less volume than the corresponding tank in usi- ls. For example the equivalent tank in proccedural parts to the 15000l tank in usi ls is slightly over 13500 liters which is ok and can be attributed to different methods and materials in construction."},{"CreatedByName":"chukovskiy","CreatedById":166437,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T10:40:53Z","Content":"May I ask if Habitation mechanic can be disabled?

There is a problem with this however:\n\nImagine an orbital station with all kinds of recyclers. The station should be resupplied with supplies, and a new crew should be rotated in place. It would make sense to bring both crew and supplies on the same vessel. However, while the launch and all kinds of rendez-vous and phasing happens, the kerbs in the vessel without recyclers munch up all the supplies before arriving! And there is no chance for locking. This is gets worse when going to the mun or to minmus.\n\nI suggest two things:\n\n1. Allow locking of supplies\n2. Introduce a \u0022starvation\u0022 counter. Instead of just allowing Kerbals to go without supplies for 15 days, actually just RECORD the time that they go without supplies (max is still 15 days). The second they have access to supplies again, the Kerbals munch up this many days worth of supplies.\n3. The counter is only wound back by so much time that the kerbals could consume. So if you have only 5 days worth of supplies after being starved for 8 days, they end up with starvation counter of 3 days.\n\nExample: Kerbals are launched to Minmus in a vessel without supplies. The time they were hungry is recorded. When they arrive at a Minmus station with recyclers, they start nomming away at 15 days worth of supplies out of the stations storage, but with the recycling factor considered.\n\nI think this approach is less restrictive and more logical, but still prevents cheating: It doesn\u0027t matter if you lock your supplies for a certain period of time, because when you unlock the supplies, the kerbals eat just as much as they would have without locking.\n\nDoes that sound like a good idea?"},{"CreatedByName":"chukovskiy","CreatedById":166437,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T12:23:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, eberkain said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In-game at the space center view check the options window and see what it is set to.\n\u003E \n\nOh, thanks a lot.

Your proposal is to send Kerbals on that trip, carrying food, to starve themselves?\n\u003E \n\nMy proposal is that after starvation, Kerbals should eat a lot more to compensate for the starvation period. That\u0027s all.  \n\nMaybe you haven\u0027t seen my edit yet, so I\u0027ll reiterate: \n\nIf you need something for the Lore: when the Kerbals are starved for days and days and days, they lose body mass in the process, and they will be very, very hungry. They need to be fed back up until they are healthy again, and they will probably stuff all the noms they can find into themselves.\n\nThat\u0027s not a perfect simulation, but better than just happily going to work and eating the same amount as if they weren\u0027t starved for 14 days.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, blu3wolf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If its that fixed a requirement, that your ship not consume supplies\n\u003E \n\nMy requirement is conservation of mass, conservation of energy, an increase in entropy, and no free stuff for Kerbals."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T13:45:52Z","Content":"A kerbal that has been out of supplies does not grab any extras once they are available.\n\nAny vessel past the Mun has to account for supplies and/or recyclers as it is.  the buffer is just that... a buffer to allow for initial missions and a bit of \u0027oops!\u0027 leeway.  You should not be taking it for granted in your general life support calculations (i.e. it is not included in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E previews either).\n\nSo based on that, I don\u0027t see a need to encourage the use of this buffer as part of mission planning.  If stuff is there, Kerbals are going to use it.
