The gauge for the rear section will turn red very quickly and it will explode leaving the other section still intact.\n\nThis behaviour is not present with the following configuration.\n\n![OccPBBzl.png](http://i.imgur.com/OccPBBzl.png)\n\nI got a craft based on this up to 1555 m/s at 22 km and the only thing that overheated and exploded was a winglet.\n\nHappy landings!"}]}
