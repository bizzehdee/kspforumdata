These flame out around 20km or so, no matter how many intakes I add. Is this the best I can hope for am I doing something wrong?

From .9-2 control inputs are sluggish, as expected, but the aircraft is still steerable. Above Mach 2, especially up in the upper atmosphere around 15-20 km, the pitch controls are very mushy and it\u0027s easy to get into oscillations, while the roll control is too good and extremely sensitive. It is doable to fly very very fast at 20 km with the reentry effect going, but it\u0027s difficult to keep stable and you need to watch the engines very carefully for a flameout, and trying to change direction/descend is extremely difficult. In the stability derivatives screen in the CAS, when I plug in the above values everything is in the green, but when you get above Mach .9 \u0022Xw\u0022 in the longitudinal derivatives is in the red. What does this value represent, and how do I fix it? Adding more lift aft makes it go up to -0.015 or so but that\u0027s the best I can get by trial and error.

Try procedural wings, it\u0027s almost a requirement. Then you need more stability, if you lose control at high speed you want more wing sweep, for roll control you need some dihedral (or anhedral, which worked for me), you probably want yaw control too so more vertical surfaces. Then you can experiment with winglets, control surface distribution, wing camber (with elevons or leading edge slats)...

I tried the fix and it did make things more stable with no control input at all. That vehicle with no other control-help still flips eventually with the cfg fix, though I\u0027m not complaining, only noticing. Only one reaction wheel or either four rotatable fins made rockets like this very easy to control. I don\u0027t know anything to say about realism but that\u0027s what happened. Fun though, I noticed that a ncs adapter and nose cap that I rarely use was much more aerodynamic for this purpose than a regular nosecone. Somehow only a bacc with a okto2 on top doesn\u0027t flip at all, but also doesn\u0027t get nearly as far an apoapsis, IIRC I think ferram may have mentioned before something about that being a side effect of the simplified cylinder aerodynamic calculations compared to what\u0027s used for nosecones? The RT-5 SRB from TV PP is more stable than the bacc or rt-10 for this purpose..less drag, less thrust, less dry mass, less wet mass but similar effect because of the thick atmosphere.

Generally, you need the plane to be only barely stable at subsonic speeds to make it perform well in supersonic flight. Bring less ailerons though, since you don\u0027t really need them too much at higher speeds.

The added stability of the SRB without a nosecone was due to the fact that nosecones actually make things less stable; if a nosecone ends up at an angle to the flow it produces a lifting force on it, and if there is a long cylinder full of heavy stuff behind it that lifting force can tilt te cylinder off-course.
