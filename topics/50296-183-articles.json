These go into effect if Real Solar System is detected but Realism Overhaul is NOT. Shields will be configured to be roughly equivalent RO shields.

Recent discussions on the subject of shields shows that historically, shields didn\u0027t deplete to the extent that I have configured stock DRE shields to. In the interest of making things \u0027dangerous\u0027 and/or \u0027harder\u0027 I\u0027ll likely leave the shields like that for stock.

Since about KSP 1.0, this was no longer happening (probably my fault) and I think some recent complaints by some players could be attributed to version mismatching which really makes a difference between KSP 1.0.2 and 1.0.4 (where DRE was implementing skin heating in the former then discontinued it in the latter because it became stock)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the rest is QOL stuff.
