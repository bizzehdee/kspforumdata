With Seth McFarlene\u0027s funding Niel DeGrasse Tyson and Carl Segan\u0027s ( rest his soul ) wife ( I think its his wife atleast ) Ann Dryuan are rebooting the original PBS documentary done by Segan himself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is big. 181 countries, 220 channels. The air time this show is getting speaks to what there trying to achieve. I hope families around the world sit down to watch this. We need to inspire people and KIDS with GOOD role models and proper dreams. ( We have quite the opposite right now ) I hope this inspires the whole nation to shift its mood to space. And who knows... the interest COSMOS 2014 generates could lead to great things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s saying its good.. I don\u0027t think NDT would do a bad job...but the moment this acomplished physisct starts twirling a ball and string above his head to explain orbits is the moment I stop watching. Lame analogies better stay the hell away from this show. Up until now Wonders of the Solar System with Brian Cox ( whom I desperately hope to see in this show ) was my favorite documentary by far. Using only limited, good analogies and at the same time breaking down the math right there in front of you. I hope COSMOS can top that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.. who\u0027s gonna tune into what possibly could be a revolutionary moment in history? The moment the world starts dreaming again. The moment people start asking the big questions again.
