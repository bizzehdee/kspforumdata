It has caused several problems with my recent rocket designs, and I can easily use fuel lines to obtain the same effect. Besides, the decouplers, particularly the TT-70, do not appear to be crossfeed capable; no fuel lines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vostok","CreatedById":22467,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T23:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a whole ton of things that crossfeed fuel that shouldn\u0027t.

Problem solved! Set an action group for your ready to launch setup and turn off any cross feed parts you don\u0027t want to cross feed. The only other option is a complex network of fuel pipes to achieve the same thing.
