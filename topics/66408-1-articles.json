I was reading up on jet engines and experimenting with NASAs EngineSim and was thinking about if it were possible to do something similar in KSP. My idea is having one part that is a compressor, that you add as many as you like, that uses \u0022Torque\u0022-resource and \u0022Intake air\u0022 then after that you stack a burner that is feeded a \u0022Compressed air\u0022 resource from the compressor stage(s) that then feeds \u0022Pressurized/heated gas\u0022 (or something) to a turbine stack that feeds the \u0022Torque\u0022-resource back to the compressor stage and lastly you have an exhaust that converts the remaining \u0022Pressurized gas\u0022 into thrust. I guess this would need new parts that would store the fuel aswell (as for example wings?). I imagine it would be fun to design your own engine and balancing it for specific uses, like a added fan stage would use up some of the torque and intake air to convert directly to thrust, or balancing different parts and making sure the turbine(s) generate enough torque to drive the compressor(s), easy throttle managning etc...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-22T13:51:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2014 01:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RagnarDa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T16:55:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPossible yes, but I think you\u0027ll find that kind of implementation using stock systems is not going to give you the results you want because of it\u0027s various quirks.
