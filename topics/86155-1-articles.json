Recently, i started a little project of mine, to make a spaceplane carrier!!!

It keeps wanting to go to the right, both yaw and roll. I thought it was wheel barrowing first so i removed the 40 landing gears supporting the structure and took off with \u0027hack gravity\u0027 and then turned gravity on in flight, still the issue persisted. Dont know whats wrong. If someone could please check the craft for me that would be really nice of them. It\u0027s about 130 parts. Its constructed using the following mods in ksp 0.24.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakscale\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Aerospace (The one with the gigantic HX modules)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural wings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe KW Rocketry, although only the 5m nose cones from that is used i think\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFerrum Aerospace \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal joint reinforcement mod (or something like that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe Firespitter mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no clue whats wrong with the craft.

That works and the craft definitely doesnt \u0027flip-out\u0027 which is good, but its not terribly manoeuvrable or even accurate in its turns, it yaws or rolls or pitches while turning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone could help me out it would be really nice of them.

TWR is a measure of the amount of thrust you have vs the mass of your rocket. Also, if you have a TWR of more than about 4 for interplanetary travel it is way to high, while a higher TWR is good, generally speaking, in order to get such a high TWR you are using more powerful engines, which are typically less efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV explained simply: I have a rocket where half of the mass is fuel, and the engine has an efficiency of 1 which gives me a dV of 100.
