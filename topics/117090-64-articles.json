(magnify that times the 2/4/8 boosters that some of these rockets come with, and the parts add up quick).\u00A0 Also, this will ensure that A: the jettison motor thrust is appropriately scaled, and B: the jettison motor thrust is positioned properly.\u00A0 My goal is a part count of \u0026lt; 20 for all main lifter\u002Bsecond stage setups.\u00A0 The rest of the part count should be able to go towards the actual payload and/or other upper stages.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.) Yep, pretty much.\u00A0 Still unsure if I\u0027ll do the LRB concept, but I\u0027m attempting to develop the plugin in such a way that it will work\u003Cbr\u003E\n4.) Parachutes -- sadly, I do not think they would work with StageRecovery, as I believe it specifically checks for ModuleParachute (and possibly real-chutes).\u00A0 As I use neither, it would likely not work (without the author adding support for it somehow).\u00A0 This is mostly only a problem due to lack of proper module interfaces in KSP (e.g. there should be an IEngineModule interface, rather than everyone relying on hardcoding support for ModuleEngines; same with RCS.. there should be an IRCSModule interface rather than hardcoding support to only ModuleRCS; same for parachutes, etc, etc...).\u003Cbr\u003E\n5.) Not particularly, but if you have some detailed images/schematics in mind, feel free to share (needs to be orthographic projection from a proper viewing angle so that I can use it as a diagram when making the cross-section).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T21:12:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see any reason why such fine-grained adjustment would be necessary. \u00A0I\u0027ve always found adding SRBs to be a very approximate process anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152759-jimbodiah/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022152759\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152759-jimbodiah/\u0022\u003E@Jimbodiah\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I see why you would want smaller SRBs, but why is exact length adjustment necessary even there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
