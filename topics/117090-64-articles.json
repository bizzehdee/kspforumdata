Cleaned up some drag-cubes that were getting reset for root parts on vessel unpack (MFTs, NodeFairing enabled parts, ParchuteModule enabled parts, MUSs).  Got the first pass of texturing done to the SC-B-BPC (along with some geometry changes to make it a bit more interesting, and COM change to make it jettison better).  And... finished up the J-2X geometry:\n\n![KO7d8uN.png](http://i.imgur.com/KO7d8uN.png)\n\nHoping to have the SC-C-BPC finished up for this weekends\u0027 release, as well as the last touch-up pass on the SC-C-DM and OM textures.  Also aiming to have the J-2X textured and complete for this weekend, but no guarantees on that one.  Also hoping to have FAR support for this weekends\u0027 release, if I can figure a few things out (see below).\n\n-Might- be a release sometime mid-week that includes the fixes and updates done over the weekend, -if- I can get some of these (mostly FAR/RCSBA) bugs fixed up and back to a good stable state.\n\nAlso spent a bit of time (far too much time..) trying to sort out FAR interaction issues.  Apparently there are quite a few... the big ones include:.  1.) It hates my CM designs, and wants them to re-enter nose-first.  2.) It hates my parachute module because it relies on stock drag cubes.  Have posted some questions in the FAR thread to see if I can get some information on how best to fix these. \n\nThe parachute module I\u0027m pretty sure the only way to fix it will be to move away from the drag-cube system (no, I cannot use RealChutes as RC is still animation and distinct model based -- I need purely runtime defined parachute setups).  Not a huge deal, as I\u0027m pretty sure I can get it working properly in stock using a force-based system; this might as well clean up some problems of how the pods hang below the parachutes (e.g. SC-C-DM hangs perfectly level, while it should hang at an angle due to the attach point) -- pretty sure this can be solved using the force-based drag method (will actually solve itself if done properly, as the force would be applied as-per a real parachute attachment).\n\nThe command-pod issues though.... honestly, I have no idea where to begin on those.  It seemed completely non-logical, as even when I moved the COM -below- the pod geometry, the COL merely followed it further down (it seemed to statically stay ~1m below the COM).  Hopefully I\u0027ll get some answers/information/list of stuff to investigate from my posts in the FAR thread.\n\nHave not seen any issues regarding the NodeFairings or modular parts -- they seemed to update appropriately as I changed the part model setup, though my testing was mostly concentrated on trying to fix the command pod problems (chutes and COM/COL).\n\nAny other FAR-related issues that I need to look into while I\u0027m working on it? (Speak now... or fix it yourself...)\n\nAnd, for the next set of releases (0.3.28-xxx):\n\nWill be working on the Modular Booster setup.  Have already laid some initial draft-work for the plugin, and working through basic concept development and initial proof-of-concept.\n\nThe biggest questions I\u0027m running into so far --\n\n1.)  Should I try and make the module a bit more generic, so that it could potentially be re-used to make LRBs (with user-attached engine/cluster)?  The main difference between use of a MFT and the MRB (modular rocket booster) would be that the MRB includes jettison/retro-rocket capability (either stack or radial, depending on model setup).\n\n2.)  Should I use pre-compiled models for the booster lengths (e.g. ModularFuelTank setup), or dynamically reconstruct the model from a bunch of sub-models (e.g. CustomUpperStage setup)?  Pre-compiled models would certainly be the way to go if I wanted to allow for use as an LRB plugin as well, though it would mean that the SRBs would be limited to set segment lengths, your only \u0027length\u0027 choices would be the number of segments (although, could include some pre-build models with shorter segments as well...).  Really, this all depends on #1 -- if YES to #1, then there is really only one way I can do this.  If no to #1, then either way could still work, though dynamic re-construction from sub-models is certainly trickier from a programming perspective, it might offer more fine-grained adjustment to the finished product.\n\nI personally am leaning towards YES for #1, which means #2 would be \u0027precompiled models\u0027.  It just seems like the easier way to do things all around, while still offering an acceptable level of customization.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Integrated nose-cone swapping (with volume); use any existing nosecone from the ModularFuelTanks, plus a couple of new models (including at least two slanted varieties, and a flat cap for stack-attachment)\n- For SRB use, integrated motor-bell geometry, adjustable with varying stats (for an upper-stage vacuum SRB)\n- For LRB use, integrated motor mount (with volume) capability\n- Ability to scale diameter freely (as per other scalable parts; main increment \u002B fine adjustment slider)\n- Ability to either select between preset lengths (e.g. MFT\u0027s; likely will go with this method), or fine-grained scaling of segments as per the MUS parts (probably will go with the former pre-compiled method).\n- Integrated fuel-switch capability, as-per MFT\u0027s (only applicable for LRB styled tanks).\n- Integrated jettison capability (as per the BPC\u0027s, will auto-jettison when fuel is depleted; might even use the same auto-jettison decoupler module).  Jettison will switch from top-mounted retro-rockets to side-mounted jettison hardware automatically depending on the nose-type selected (nosecone = radial, flat nose/attach node = stack based retro-rockets).\n- Automatic Scaling of motor thrust (for SRB setups), and of fuel quantity / part mass (SRB/LRB).  Type of scaling used (and if scaling is enabled at all) can be configured through the part config.\n- -Possible- inclusion of a parachute module for recovery of booster parts.\n\nAnything I\u0027m missing on the feature-list?"},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T20:30:18Z","Content":"I concur.

Cannot really do fine-grained height adjustment for the segments without resorting to procedural mesh creation, which is so very limited as far as texture mapping/geometry setup/etc.  Scaling any other pre-built model vertically results in less-than optimal texture distortion... which makes me ill when I look at it.  They -will- be segment based, no way around it; however, there might be a few different choices for the height of each segment.  \n\n2.) Part count reduction, especially when used in symmetry.  Why have 1 booster \u002B one decoupler, when it can be just 1 booster? (magnify that times the 2/4/8 boosters that some of these rockets come with, and the parts add up quick).  Also, this will ensure that A: the jettison motor thrust is appropriately scaled, and B: the jettison motor thrust is positioned properly.  My goal is a part count of \u003C 20 for all main lifter\u002Bsecond stage setups.  The rest of the part count should be able to go towards the actual payload and/or other upper stages.  \n\n3.) Yep, pretty much.  Still unsure if I\u0027ll do the LRB concept, but I\u0027m attempting to develop the plugin in such a way that it will work  \n\n4.) Parachutes -- sadly, I do not think they would work with StageRecovery, as I believe it specifically checks for ModuleParachute (and possibly real-chutes).  As I use neither, it would likely not work (without the author adding support for it somehow).  This is mostly only a problem due to lack of proper module interfaces in KSP (e.g. there should be an IEngineModule interface, rather than everyone relying on hardcoding support for ModuleEngines; same with RCS.. there should be an IRCSModule interface rather than hardcoding support to only ModuleRCS; same for parachutes, etc, etc...).  \n\n5.) Not particularly, but if you have some detailed images/schematics in mind, feel free to share (needs to be orthographic projection from a proper viewing angle so that I can use it as a diagram when making the cross-section)."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T21:12:02Z","Content":"I don\u0027t see any reason why such fine-grained adjustment would be necessary.
