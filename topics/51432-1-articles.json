This arm could work with electricity and with it would had similar roles to the one on the ISS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I believe a good improvement on Career mode would be deployable \u0022science Stations\u0022 which generated science points while you are spending time in other projects. This science stations could be surface observatories, observation satellites or space telescopes (requiring/depending each one a set of science elements to work as their intended role). If not for science, then they could be used for money in case you need to pay for rocket parts \u0026amp; missions in future updates \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T15:56:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think Squad has plans for making space stations relevant to science without doing science over time, which they\u0027ve spoken out against because timewarp makes time a bit pointless for something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T17:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think robotics are on the list of things not to suggest.

My personal opinion is that science points as such should be removed and replaced just by achievement system where each research done by particular tool in particular place (including eventually manned/unmanned and transmitted/delivered) is a separate achievement. And parts and other rewards should be given for some particular achievements, not for doing research anywhere you please.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
