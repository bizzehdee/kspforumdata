He wasn\u0027t asking you to add those parts yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027d like to add - it\u0027s not a bad thing per se to give players a part they have trouble supplying with power with current technology. It only is a problem if there is no way for the player to see a way out. But if the player can say \u0022holy heck, how can I possibly fuel this\u0022 and then look at their tech tree and see that there\u0027s a node with much better solar panels than they already have, then that\u0027s fair game. They then know that if they want to use that part with more comfort, they should research that node then. It gives the player a choice to make, which is always good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I think the position in the tech tree should also be informed by the larger ecosystem. It makes no sense if you put the engine at a place in the tree where it is significantly overpowered (too early) or underpowered (too late) compared to the really popular part packs that most players who are into modded KSP will by almost guaranteed to have. Conveniently though, you don\u0027t really need to check each and every one of them; usually it\u0027s enough to use the same balance reference for your own engines that other mods use for theirs. The most common references for high Isp engines are (unsurprisingly) the stock LV-N and PB-ION engines. Nowadays that the PB-ION got buffed to such ridiculous levels it\u0027s less useful as a reference point - that very, very quickly leads to electric engines with TWRs approaching those of chemical rockets - but in a broad sense the relationship these two have will let you sort things into a good place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(I\u0027m responsible for the balance paradigm behind Near Future\u0027s electric engines nowadays.

Maybe these people have parts from other mods, like for example Near Future. He wasn\u0027t asking you to add those parts yourself.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027d like to add - it\u0027s not a bad thing per se to give players a part they have trouble supplying with power with current technology. It only is a problem if there is no way for the player to see a way out. But if the player can say \u0022holy heck, how can I possibly fuel this\u0022 and then look at their tech tree and see that there\u0027s a node with much better solar panels than they already have, then that\u0027s fair game. They then know that if they want to use that part with more comfort, they should research that node then. It gives the player a choice to make, which is always good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I think the position in the tech tree should also be informed by the larger ecosystem. It makes no sense if you put the engine at a place in the tree where it is significantly overpowered (too early) or underpowered (too late) compared to the really popular part packs that most players who are into modded KSP will by almost guaranteed to have. Conveniently though, you don\u0027t really need to check each and every one of them; usually it\u0027s enough to use the same balance reference for your own engines that other mods use for theirs. The most common references for high Isp engines are (unsurprisingly) the stock LV-N and PB-ION engines. Nowadays that the PB-ION got buffed to such ridiculous levels it\u0027s less useful as a reference point - that very, very quickly leads to electric engines with TWRs approaching those of chemical rockets - but in a broad sense the relationship these two have will let you sort things into a good place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022passinglurker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022passinglurker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou and I must be looking at different nodes.

Being a contender for the SSME wouldn\u0027t happen if real life aerospikes were like the Cutter (throttle-locked etc). \u003Cp\u003EI love the work you\u0027ve put into this pack but I don\u0027t think this particular decision is a good one. Please reconsider \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: In the meantime, how can I make this rocket engine act like a rocket engine? I get the \u0022throttleLocked\u0022 and \u0022allowShutdown\u0022 bit, but there seems to be a lot of dependencies in the FX as well. Honestly, I might as well just not bother with it - my existing crafts that had it are useless now (model changes aside).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nori\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nori\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell it does have gimbals and is quite a bit more efficient than a SRB.\u003Cp\u003EYou could just change throttle lock to false and put the min thrust to 110 or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah it\u0027s a little experimental. Right now it\u0027s basically only useful under roughly 10km altitude, since above that the T45/T30 come out with slightly higher ISP. Because of that low atmosphere niche, I decided to try giving it a weird downside in that it cannot be throttled or shut down. As Nori mentioned, it does have a gimbal and it\u0027s even described in the VAB tooltip, and seeing as it\u0027s an LFO engine you can use however much fuel you want with it. I\u0027m happy to alter it to be a more normal engine if that\u0027s what people want, I\u0027m pretty sure there\u0027s a bug with the FX and throttle limiting I need to look at anyway and I might reduce the aISP a tiny bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to make it a normal engine yourself just change throttleLocked and allowShutdown, and set the minimum thrust to whatever you like, all the FX are currently set up to allow 0-100% throttling and engine restarts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: In fact I\u0027ve gone ahead and done it anyway, v11.1 links in the OP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-27T20:35:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2014 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by hoojiwana\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
