You can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e_PWjiFQKfCADfj3BxQGc7X5s0CHS7yhmU56s4SKYGY/edit?usp=sharing). Looking at it, I think **Water** would be a good choice for one of the ingredients (the \u0022base\u0022) due to it\u0027s availability but it needs that extra kick. JPLREPO suggested XenonGas, which I like, as it can be mined from Asteroids at a low rate (and does have limited other availability, which I didn\u0027t include, since it\u0027s \u003C1%). I\u0027ll be honest though, none of the ingredients besides XenonGas and Ore (or an Ore/Mineralish analogue) jumped out at me and I was hoping for something more. ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif \u0022:mad:\u0022)\n\nWe could look at gases, but then we might need to configure an Intake to act as a harvester (not the hardest thing to do).

Those are really the only two relevant gases available in the wild (Argon \u0026 Xenon being really low).\n\n**Edit:**\n\nI found out you can actually make harvesters (e.g. ModuleResourceHarvester) for Atmospheric (or Interplanetary) resources, aside from just standard ModuleResourceIntake.

Perhaps the atmospheric harvester could gather the nitrogen from bodies with an atmosphere.

Another thing that could be done is to have the atmospheric harvester be used on Jool, since gas giants are mostly hydrogen and helium, perhaps that could be the way to get liquid hydrogen or liquid helium.  Or perhaps liquid hydrogen/liquid helium could be swapped out with liquid nitrogen if the hydrogen/helium isn\u0027t available, but would need a cost associated with using a warmer liquid, perhaps more electricity used for maintaining the frozen kerbal."},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T10:00:56Z","Content":"[@Deimos Rast](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/157420-deimos-rast/) - yes you can harvest atmospheres.  \n\nSo have we arrived at a concencus yet?  \n\nSupporting two modes in a converter is also possible.  \n\nSo you could have more than one recipe with different input/output ratios (Ie.efficiencies).

Basically, I think it needs to be found on an asteroid; bonus points if it\u0027s also planetary but not mandatory. I like **Water** a lot as the base, as you originally suggested, because of it\u0027s ready availability (planetary and asteroid mining) in game, is already supported by a lot of mods. LqdHelium and LqdNitrogen, while defined in CRP have *no* sources in the wild and thus cannot be currently mined without first *adding* them, which unleashes a headache...we want to keep this no fuss no muss. While they may exist in real world planetary atmospheres that is for all intents and purposes besides the point. Stock only adds Ore to planetary bodies which leaves us with CRP and planet packs (and I\u0027ve also made a spread sheet of some of the bigger ones of those....well, mainly just OPM![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)) and Custom Asteroids.\n\nFor the \u0022kicker\u0022 I vote **XenonGas** due to it\u0027s availability in asteroids (CRP adds it). It also the opposite of Water in terms of rarity and expense (and they\u0027re both blue I might add). You could say the Xenon gels/crystalizes the water or something. XenonGas can also be harvested somewhat atmospherically (I believe), adding another dimension.\n\nSince this is supposed to be a really slow process, I think we need an optional faster but expensive mod, with a third ingredient. I think **Ore** **/Karbonite/** **etc** would probably be best (so we have liquid gas and solid). Ore is even more readily available than Water, so to balance that we\u0027d need a lot of it.\n\nOf course all of this requires a lot of ElectricCharge.\n\nSorry if any of this comes across as brusque, but my head is on my desk and I need a nap.![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif \u0022:0.0:\u0022)\n\nIf you can, JPLREPO, can you answer the below?

Basically, I think it needs to be found on an asteroid; bonus points if it\u0027s also planetary but not mandatory. I like **Water** a lot as the base, as you originally suggested, because of it\u0027s ready availability (planetary and asteroid mining) in game, is already supported by a lot of mods. LqdHelium and LqdNitrogen, while defined in CRP have *no* sources in the wild and thus cannot be currently mined without first *adding* them, which unleashes a headache...we want to keep this no fuss no muss. While they may exist in real world planetary atmospheres that is for all intents and purposes besides the point. Stock only adds Ore to planetary bodies which leaves us with CRP and planet packs (and I\u0027ve also made a spread sheet of some of the bigger ones of those....well, mainly just OPM![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)) and Custom Asteroids.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For the \u0022kicker\u0022 I vote **XenonGas** due to it\u0027s availability in asteroids (CRP adds it).

Based on your results and basic tests, my guess is that converters still work at hyper warp speed. What is not clear, however, if whether the Core Heat mechanic does. I\u0027m pretty sure hyper warp strips out a lot of the extras and reduces processes to the bare essentials to better facilitate calculations at high time warp. I know Physics Warp respects Core Heat, because I ran my test using 80x physics warp (albeit with a somewhat reduced physics fidelity) and the part still warmed and cooled as expected. Switching to hyper warp seemed to cause the part to stop heating entirely. I\u0027m assuming background processing, if it affects ISRU converters, functions similar to hyper warp, but I have no idea.\n\nWhy is this important? If we\u0027re sticking as close to the stock ISRU part config as possible (which I think we should), we have to deal with Thermal Efficiency and Core Heat. Personally, I like the mechanics it adds, since otherwise it just feels inert. No idea how any of this works under the hood, so jump on me if something is off.
