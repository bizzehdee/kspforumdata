I have it where its in the kerbals hand and at a good scale, I also am able to see ammo as well as toggle the turret. But I can\u0027t seem to get BD and KIS to play nice. I have no control to aim it or fire it. I am currently using a modifiedKIS Item module as well as an ammo module and an RTG module for power (not sure I even need power) just curious if anyone else has played around with this and got it to work in 1.0x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need to give the gun a probe core, electric, ammo and weapon manager modules.
