Mirrors to melt the polar ice are options. One theory which is starting to/has gained some popularity is the existence of large bodies of water (either in ice or liquid form) not too deep into the martian soil. If those reserves could be tapped, then they could provide a lot of oxygen for a more breathable atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no astro-biologist and everything I type here should definitely be looked at with healthy scrutiny, but if I recall correctly there are terrestrial organisms on earth which can survive a simulated martian environment. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any multi-cellullar ones that can do it, but some lichens are pretty damn close. If we can get those to survive, they can start photosynthesis, which can in time allow for progressively complex plantlife.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course all this assumes that a whole slew of other problems can be solved, such as the radiation issue. There\u0027s also the possibility that mars already harbors microbiological life today. Maybe that can be used/altered in some way.

The main problem would be with atmospheric stripping. We don\u0027t know how fast a thick Martian atmosphere would be eroded by the solar wind. It could take of the order of millions of years, which is still completely acceptable, especially if we can periodically redirect icy bodies to replenish the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving worn radiation suits before, they are actually not particularly encumbering. Trying to stop gamma radiation is pretty futile anyway, you\u0027re mainly trying to stop contaminating yourself with beta and alpha emitters (which won\u0027t be a problem on Mars).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T01:20:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kahlzun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kahlzun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre there any earthian plants or algae that can survive the martian temperatures?
