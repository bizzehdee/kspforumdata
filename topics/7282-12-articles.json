I was going through a bad patch a year or so ago; I\u0027d split up with my long term girlfriend and was very much down and in a rut. Life didn\u0027t seem to have much point at all and I was in quite a bad way. I\u0027d always had an interest in space and astronomy when I was 8-9 years old, but had generally let my interest wane a bit. I was looking on steam for something to take my mind off things, when KSP took my eye. Not expecting much - the space genre never gets anything right, after all - I bought it and loaded it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first rocket exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one after that, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the sixth or seventh rocket had scattered itself over the KSC, I finally achieved sub orbital flight, and the feeling of achievement was palpable. Here was something special. For a whole afternoon, I forgot about my worries and proceeded to scatter pieces of flaming wreckage all over the place, giggling away as I did so. From that point on, whenever I felt down, I loaded KSP and forgot about it. A year later, and I have a wonderful fianc\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9, I\u0027m studying astrophysics and I spend most evenings in the garden with an 8 inch reflector telescope. And I can trace it all back to one cold, miserable April afternoon when I bought KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah. That\u0027s kind of it.

It\u0027s super-fun, and at the same time you find learning a bit about real space exploration concepts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven stock, the game is wonderful. Its many mods make it even better!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to share one of my early experiences that made me fall in love with the game. This happens to be with the ScanSat mod. Back when the Mun was the furthest I had explored, I sent a satellite there and was able to get a fairly complete map, including anomalies. So I tried to land near one of them - it took me a few tries, helped by the maneuver node indicators, to learn that it was a good idea to adjust my orbit a bit early.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I managed to land, I found nearby a magnificent arch! This was so much cooler than what I was expecting. So I knew what to do for my next few launches: try to get a small rocket to fly through the arch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a great kind of \u0022anomaly\u0022 because it was something that I could play with, making up my own rules. I have only seen one other anomaly so far (an ethereal monolith), and the arch remains my favorite. I hope other similar anomalies exist (or will be added), just places where the planet (or moon)\u0027s geography is a bit interesting. Perhaps somewhere we\u0027ll find a small perfectly-round pedestal, on which to try to precision-land? Perhaps some platforms we can send our kerbals walking on and try not to miss a step? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for making such an amazing game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke23","CreatedById":96591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T07:09:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have to say thanks to everyone as well. I just updated from .23 a few days ago... I had gotten a little burned out from spending all my free time on it and was taking a break, intending to come back when .24 was released. Instead, .23.5 showed up and I was a little skeptical at first. After giving it a spin I like the tweaks and added parts, and I seem to have gotten a slight FPS increase as well. I haven\u0027t captured or diverted an asteroid yet but I\u0027m close to sending out a mission for that. I gotta hand it to the devs here, some other companies that won\u0027t be named probably would have called it a day and slapped a $60 price tag on it a few versions back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been waiting for a game like this for years and just didn\u0027t know it. I used to design my own aircraft in X-Plane and keep wishing there was more to the space aspect of it... I like to say this is what Spore\u0027s space stage should have been; in general I\u0027ve been disappointed with pretty much every space-related game I\u0027ve played because of the lack of realism or depth or both. This game is maddeningly difficult, even stressful sometimes and the learning curve is steep at first but I just keep coming back for more. I\u0027ve learned more about orbital mechanics and physics than I probably would have from forcing myself to read any number of books or articles on the subject otherwise, and had loads of fun while doing it. I always try to turn my friends onto KSP and some of them love it (one even found it before I did and I\u0027m holding a grudge that he didn\u0027t tell me about it), some of them try the demo and ragequit, but a lot of people just don\u0027t seem to \u0022get it\u0022 so I guess it takes a certain type of gamer to really appreciate it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line is even as a game that\u0027s still relatively early in development I feel like I got more than my money\u0027s worth out of it before I even made it out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI in version .22, and I\u0027d go as far as to say I probably would have happily paid the $16 and some change (.23 gearup sale) just for the demo. There are still so many things I haven\u0027t found or done, the modding community makes the possibilities endless and I love seeing the crazy and elaborate things other players come up with. I\u0027ve actually only seen one anomaly so far since I haven\u0027t gone out hunting them yet and I\u0027m not even sure it wasn\u0027t a glitch -- In .23 (I think?) one of my Mun probes passed over a giant oval shaped hole that I swear I could see stars on the other side of, but I crashed several km away from it and haven\u0027t been able to find that area again. I think I have a screenshot of it buried somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll stop rambling but I\u0027ll say this much: I can\u0027t wait to see what the final version looks like.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T11:30:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis game is arguably one of the best I have ever played.

BARIS is an early/mid 90s game focused on the Space Race. It is a game about space program management mostly with little simulation elements. Orbiter on the other hand is a great spaceflight simulator taking realism to a new level (as far as realism can go on a PC) and it is quite a hard game to master properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I love spaceflight and everything related to it.
