The issue that\u0027s causing me to consider uninstalling it though is that it seems completely incompatible with both Strategia and Research Bodies because it causes anything those mods do that\u0027s associated with a binary system to fail. Basically they are looking for the next body to be something specific and run across the binary system instead and fail un-gracefully. This causes Strategia for example not to load any of the Planet programs from Duna onward that aren\u0027t gas giants and Research Bodies causes Duna\u0027s orbit to disappear and won\u0027t allow you to tab-select beyond Duna while SB is installed.\n\n[@Sigma88](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113260-sigma88/) I know you don\u0027t have much time, but I\u0027m curious if you think there is a way around this issue to make everyone play nicely while keeping SB installed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-30T23:02:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2019 11:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-02T07:42:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3/31/2019 at 12:00 AM, SpacedInvader said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Sigma88](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113260-sigma88/) I know you don\u0027t have much time, but I\u0027m curious if you think there is a way around this issue to make everyone play nicely while keeping SB installed.\n\u003E \n\nit is definitely possible to solve the issue, but it would require the mods you mentioned to ignore the barycenter bodies\n\nif those mods were to add some way to mark a body for being ignored I can add to SB some code to communicate with those mods and tell them to ignore all barycenters\n\nI don\u0027t think it would be possible for me to solve the issue only on SB side, feel free to open an issue on my github and ping the devs of the mods you mentioned"},{"CreatedByName":"bobjonesisthebest:D","CreatedById":194187,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T00:04:30Z","Content":"This dont work with 1.8"}]}
