The next update for KSP is named \u0022To Vee Or Not To Vee\u0022 and is the next update in a line of updates since 1.3 that have not only focused on replacing all the old art assets one update at a time, but also slowly assimilating mods into stock. Though this is great for those who always use those mods, but I\u0027m more concerned for the mod makers in KSP. So far I\u0027ve seen partial implementation of Texture Replacer (helmet removal), now part of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, Take Command, Parachute Mods, and more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough I\u0027m glad that they are becoming part of the game, I\u0027m wondering how the mod developers feel about their mods being assimilated into KSP.
