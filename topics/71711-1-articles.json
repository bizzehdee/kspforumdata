For a land/return, its better to use asparagus poodles/skippers for landing and launch. Tylo is probably the second toughest body to land and return from, and is not to be taken lightly. Secondly, if it flies alright on Kerbin (no wings), then it should be alright for Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loch.ness","CreatedById":101329,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T01:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks. I\u0027m currently planning my first trip to the Jool system. I\u0027ve got a boat for Laythe (and almost done with the plane) and am testing my landers for the other moons. I was originally planning to skip Tylo entirely. On testing I found my current MAL (Munar Adventure Lander) was over-engineered with almost 4.8k Delta V and thought, maybe I could adapt that for Tylo. The single manned TAL I worked up should have a high enough TWR with all 6 engines firing, but I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027ll test it a bit more later, but I won\u0027t be too upset if I have to skip Tylo on my first trip to Jool - I can save it for attempting the Jool 5 challenge sometime in the future. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T01:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022loch.ness\u0022 data-cite=\u0022loch.ness\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 1 - do I need to keep my TWR \u0026gt; 1 for Tyloo take off and flight or would dropping to ~0.5 be acceptable?

If mechjeb lets you switch the TWR readout to different celestial bodies, make sure you\u0027ve selected Tylo. Otherwise, you\u0027ll have to convert by hand by \u003Cstrong\u003Edividing \u003C/strong\u003Eby 0.8 (Tylo has 80% of the surface gravity compared to Kerbin). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an aside, I highly recommend an even higher TWR for your landing.
