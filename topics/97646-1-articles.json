I\u0027ve recently been having an issue with a modded KSP install, particularly with my most played save. Upon accessing Mission Control or the Launch Pad, and pressing a few buttons, the UI would become all jumbled up and none of the buttons would work. I began troubleshooting by removing the mods I had installed just prior to when these issues began cropping up, and then testing the same save. I found that the issue was not resolved. Eventually I started up a new career save as a test, and I could access the various buildings without a hitch. Do you think that my save had simply become corrupt and was the source of the problems I described?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
