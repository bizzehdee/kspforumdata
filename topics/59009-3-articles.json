It has a maximum detection range of 30km, which falls off with height above the anomaly. Indications are given for distance and direction to the anomaly (exact values are printed in the debug window). Within about 10km a separate camera module deploys, this will rotate about its z-axis to look at the anomaly (this works best mounted parallel to the surface of the planet, on a rover or plane), and an indicator light turns on when the anomaly is within scanning range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor full science value make repeated observations of the anomaly and return the scanner to Kerbin for detailed analysis. Reports cannot be transferred out of the scanner, it must be returned to Kerbin to study the anomalies\u0027 effects on it. Results can however be transmitted for 50% value, or 75% with lab analysis. The scanner can be reset at an operational science lab after transmission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made new science reports for all anomalies (only the real ones, with PQSCity transforms). I haven\u0027t tested every anomaly, but you should be able to get within scanning range for all of them, even if they are underground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are new textures for the magnetometer and laser, both now resemble the drill and anomaly scanner a little more closely. The RPWS and telescope will have to wait for another update to get new textures and new models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also made several bug fixes to existing parts. The magnetometer data can now be collected on EVA, and the non-functional right-click button has been removed. The laser description was fixed and the part was moved back to its proper tech node. This will require a repurchase in the R\u0026amp;D center (and may make the part unavailable if you haven\u0027t progressed far enough), but won\u0027t affect any existing crafts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll also be releasing, hopefully in a day or so, a prototype of my new ModuleScienceAnimate plugin. It\u0027s meant to replace most of my current modules and act as a generic science module with better animation controls (replacing the stock ModuleScienceExperiment and ModuleAnimateGeneric modules). Everything will be configurable through the part.cfg file only, so anyone will be able to use it. I\u0027ll add a link here when I release that (source is available on my GitHub repository now).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck the first post of this thread for a full preview gallery of the update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EChange Log:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Ev0.7:\u003Cbr\u003E- New anomalous signal scanner.

I added your telescope, magnetometer, and RPWS to a pre-existing probe design that had all the orbital scansat parts and launched it. I quickly discovered that the telescope had only the scansat functionality. Since that was utterly redundant, I removed that version of it and put in the non-scansat version, restarted KSP, and it promptly deleted the probe I\u0027d launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily I regularly make backups of my persistence file, so I just restored it. I then opened up the part.cfg files for the two versions of your telescope and discovered that for some bizarre reason you gave them different part names despite instructing us to install only one or the other, not both. So I had to edit my persistence file and replace \u0022dmSCAN\u0022 with \u0022dm\u0022 on the telescope part name for that probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you under the impression that using the version of the part.cfg file that has the scansat module listed would cause problems if scansat wasn\u0027t installed? In my experience, unknown modules are simply ignored and cause no issues (unless the part requires the missing module in order to function properly). So the only reason I can see to provide two versions of the part.cfg files is for people who have scansat installed but don\u0027t want its features to appear on your telescope and anomaly scanner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there\u0027s nothing wrong with providing that choice; however, the two versions of the parts should not be given different names. Doing so prevents you from swapping between the versions without losing craft in flight and becoming unable to load up saved craft that used the \u0022other version\u0022 of those parts. For example, if I had your dmSCAN telescope installed, but decided to remove the scansat mod (perhaps I wasn\u0027t really using it and wanted to trim down KSP\u0027s memory footprint), I couldn\u0027t switch to the non-scansat telescope without either losing any craft using it or editing persistence and/or part.cfg files to make the names match up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to offer that choice, without requiring two different part.cfg files, is to provide a module manager .cfg file to insert the appropriate scansat module into the part.cfg for the telescope and anomaly scanner. If the user wants the scansat features on those devices, they simply copy in that .cfg file as well as the parts - and they could easily add or remove it at will if they change their minds. Since the part names don\u0027t change in this situation either, no craft will be lost/inaccessible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all you would need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[dmAnomScanner]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tname = SCANsat\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tsensorType = 32\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tfov = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tmin_alt = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tmax_alt = 2000\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tbest_alt = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tpower = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tscanName = BTDT scan\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[dmscope]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tname = SCANsat\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tsensorType = 24\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tfov = 4\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tmin_alt = 5000\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tmax_alt = 500000\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tbest_alt = 250000\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tpower = 1.5\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tscanName = multispectral scan\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-13T02:44:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2014 02:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tallinu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EExample MM CFG\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sol_Rokks_Teddy","CreatedById":57145,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T11:58:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003Ehey dmagic, I am really liking this mod.

Anyone who wants to is free to use the plugin for their own science mods; it has much more versatile control over how animations work with science experiments.

I\u0027ve since tried to get rid of all those, but there might still be a few instructions hanging around about not using both parts.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to leave them with different names though. I want them to remain separate. There are also some issues with the R\u0026amp;D center tech-nodes when you have multiple parts with the same name (that\u0027s why I had to change some of my part names). If you end up researching multiple parts with the same name, even if you delete the first version of the part, you can run into problems that will prevent you from being able to actually use the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone\u0027s worried about persistent file loss though, you should check out my backup generator, it\u0027s in the bottom of my signature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that instruction is a file in the zip. The replacement folder\u0027s structure was also identical, which would cause the part.cfg file of one version to overwrite the other (as well as the model and textures). And I\u0027m not surprised that installing more than one part with the same name would lead to problems. Computers don\u0027t tend to like that very much (unless designed specifically to work around it). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Why would anyone intentionally do that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you intend for people to install both versions of these parts simultaneously (if they want the scansat-enabled part), I\u0027d just like to say that\u0027s pretty much the opposite of how many people are trying to trim their part count and assets loaded to save memory and keep KSP from crashing so often... At the very least you could have the models and textures only exist in one location and have both parts reference them in that location instead of each one containing a duplicate of them (the game loads both, even if they\u0027re identical). I still think it\u0027s rather silly to install both versions of a part like this though, and I\u0027m curious what your reasoning is on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong though, I love what you\u0027ve done with these parts - the models are great, and I\u0027ll happily use any and all means of getting extra science out of my missions (especially when they\u0027re real-world instruments that KSP lacks).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T02:40:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ghost13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ghost13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERadio and Plasma Wave Science Antenna dosn\u0027t work in space near the sun with Can\u0027t use the device in the atmoshere message. I have not yet checked if it is works in latest mod version.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did some checking. It seems the sun has some slightly wonky values for the atmosphere. As far as I can tell it doesn\u0027t have an atmosphere in the same way that other planets do (at least not at the altitudes I checked). It seems that CelestialBody.atmosphere returns false for the sun, while CelestialBody.maxAtmosphereAltitude returns 700,000 km, and CelestialBody.scienceValues.spaceAltitudeThreshold (the altitude where it switches between \u0022in space low\u0022 and \u0022in space high\u0022) is at 1,000,000 km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat all this means is that only the area between 700,000 km and 1,000,000 km counts as \u0022in space near\u0022, while below that counts as being in the atmosphere, despite the fact that there is no atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few things to note here. The stock science module will always return \u0022in space low/high\u0022 unless you are on a sub-orbital trajectory, even if you are deep in the atmosphere (of Kerbin for example), if your orbital projection doesn\u0027t intersect the surface you won\u0027t be able to do atmospheric experiments, the same goes for aerobraking or any other situation where your orbit is escaping the planet\u0027s SOI. I don\u0027t like this; my new science module fixes this so that any time you\u0027re in the atmosphere you can do atmospheric experiments. But because of the weird way the sun behaves it will always return in space low when you are below 1,000,000 km (ie the problem you noted won\u0027t be an issue anymore).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now though, the way the RPWS is setup will cause it to not work below 700,000 km above the sun, though it should give the \u0022in space near\u0022 results when you are between 700,000 and 1,000,000 km. The magnetometer doesn\u0027t seem to have this problem, and the telescope shouldn\u0027t either, though I didn\u0027t actually check that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for bringing that up though, I had never checked those values for the sun and it\u0027s interesting to figure out the weird way that it\u0027s setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tallinu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tallinu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you intend for people to install both versions of these parts simultaneously -----\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s already been taken care of in the 0.7.1 update.
