It\u0027s a solid historical piece, I\u0027ve done some research on it, and it\u0027s an interesting story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only problem is that I don\u0027t know if the script itself is interesting enough. To me, it seems a little\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0factual/documentary-ish for a quick history lesson. I had the idea of coming to the Forum itself to see if any writers out there would help critique my script to make sure that what I\u0027m producing is quality. If people are interested, great, I\u0027ll leave the script here to see suggestions.

The first airplane in history had only been flown 34 years prior in 1903, and the first nonstop flight over the Atlantic ocean took place in June 1919 by British aviators John Alcock and Arthur Brown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn those early days, flying was dangerous, and the planes of the time were flown only by people with great ambitions, and perhaps less common sense than the average person. Planes were unreliable and still a very new technology at the time, but that didn\u0027t stop early pilots from achieving milestone after milestone. One of these early aviators was a man called Douglas \u0022Wrong Way\u0022 Corrigan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrigan was an aircraft mechanic that actually helped build the Spirit of St. Louis, the plane flown by Charles Lindbergh during his famous solo crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in 1927. Inspired by the achievement, Corrigan bought a plane and began to modify it for a transatlantic flight in 1933. In 1935, he applied for the certification required to make the flight, but was denied because his plane was deemed unfit for the dangerous crossing. He continued to modify and reapply for certification, but in 1937 he became unable to renew his plane\u0027s aircraft license due to increased regulations regarding airplane construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, however, Corrigan was able to certify his plane for making transcontinental flights. In 1938, he was granted permission to fly from his home in California to New York, with the condition that he fly back home immediately. He landed in New York, and upon refueling and repairing his plane, he set off on a 28-hour flight back home... and ended up in Ireland.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen confronted by Irish officials as to why he had come across the Atlantic without prior permission, he responded by saying that he had misread his compass when the flight began, accidentally travelling East instead of West. Surprisingly, his story was believed, and \u00A0he was allowed to return to America without penalty. When he landed in New York, by boat this time, he was greeted by parades that were allegedly larger than those honoring Charles Lindbergh after his own flight. It was here that he received his worst punishment for the illegal flight- his pilot\u0027s license was suspended for exactly two weeks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom 1937 to his death in 1995, Douglas Corrigan never did admit to crossing the Atlantic intentionally, but whether his story is true or not, Corrigan cemented his place in history by being one of the first aviators to cross the Atlantic solo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin Kerman","CreatedById":172792,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-16T05:31:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat will the backround to this video be?

I think it\u0027s way funnier, and it\u0027s completely different and more conversational than the first one. Let me know what you guys think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI essentially pictured myself literally sitting down in front of a microphone and repeating what I knew about the story from memory, and offering my thoughts on what the story is like. It\u0027s basically like I sat for a few minutes talking to somebody about it and just wrote it down. So it\u0027s extremely conversational, but I think it would be a unique style of narration to use, particularly with some slightly-humorous but still historical background footage to use too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind that I wrote this in like fifteen minutes after two in the morning, so if there\u0027s typos, please forgive it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you\u0027ve ever been in a plane and flown somewhere, you know that it\u0027s really complicated and that planes are the safest way to travel, but that really only started in the 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s. In the 1930\u0027s, flying was still really new, and really, you had to be a little crazy if you wanted to fly. People have been wanting to fly like birds since pretty much the beginning of time, but when you look at the machines that people called \u0022airplanes\u0022 in the early 1900\u0027s, it\u0027s just completely insane. The Wright Brothers basically strapped a bunch of cloth onto a frame made out of wood to build gliders and then just stuck an engine onto it. That\u0027s really all an airplane was. Yeah, there was some science behind it, and the Wright Brothers really did do a lot of things right with their designs, but these machines were just scary and unreliable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in the early 1900\u0027s, it was really just a bunch of crazy people out there building planes and flying everywhere, and barnstorming, which is basically doing stunts in airplanes. One of these guys was a guy called Douglas Corrigan. He flew for the first time as a passenger when he was 18 and he loved it so much that he started learning to fly and was flying solo by 19. Kind of wish I could have flown solo at 19. So he gets a job as an airplane mechanic, and he would actually get flying experience by taking off and doing stunts in a plane during his lunch breaks. I mean, this guy was insane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, he actually helped build the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESpirit of St. Louis,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0which is the plane that Charles Lindbergh used to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo, and he was the first person to do that. Well, Douglas Corrigan looks at this flight, and he says, \u0022I can do that too.\u0022 So he buys a used plane, and again, this is one of those death machines basically made from wood, and he buys it used, and starts modifying it so he could fly across the Atlantic ocean by himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo he goes to get this plane certified to make this trip, and he was denied because his plane wasn\u0027t safe enough to make it. Really not that surprising, but he goes back, mods it more, and tries again and again but he keeps getting denied, and finally he\u0027s just told that he can\u0027t renew his plane\u0027s license anymore because the plane just isn\u0027t safe. So he seems to give up on it, but somehow manages to get his plane certified to fly nonstop across the United States- Because I guess flying for 30 hours over land is way safer than flying for 30 hours over water. Well, I guess there aren\u0027t really any hospitals in the middle of the ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo he gets permission to fly from California to New York as long as he flies right back, so of course he goes \u0022Okay\u0022 and flies to New York. And his plane makes it, he manages to fly his plane for like 28 hours straight across the United States, lands, fixes up his plane, and then takes off to fly another 28 or so hours back home. But one thing led to another, and.... he basically ended up in Ireland.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo he shows up in Ireland, his plane isn\u0027t certified to make a trip like that, and nobody in Ireland even knew he was coming over. So they interrogate him, and asked \u0022How did you end up in Ireland?\u0022 And all he said was.... \u0022I guess I just misread my compass.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to recap- this plot, that everybody knew wanted to fly across the Atlantic by himself, has been building this plane for about 5 or 6 years to do it, AND they knew his plane was able to fly for 30 hours straight without stopping, and he just says that he read his compass wrong. Well, everybody in Ireland believed him, so they sent him back home, no problem. When he gets back to the United States, he\u0027s being celebrated with parades and stuff, and this newspaper made fun of it by saying \u0022Hail to Wrong Way Corrigan\u0022 backwards, but when he gets to the American officials, they gibe him this super severe punishment- they take away his pilots license for two weeks. That;s it. This guy flies by himself for 30 hours in a wood plane, goes over the Atlantic Ocean by \u0022accident\u0022 (with big quotation marks there), and they\u0027re basically like \u0022Well, don\u0027t do that again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt just goes to show how crazy these pilots were in the 30\u0027s. You can\u0027t really just say, \u0022Oh, I\u0027m gonna build a plane and cross the Atlantic Ocean\u0022 anymore, but Douglas Corrigan did, and I think it\u0027s crazy that more people don\u0027t know about him. I just thought it was cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin Kerman","CreatedById":172792,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-16T15:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75164-tex/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002275164\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75164-tex/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Tex\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0thats great.
