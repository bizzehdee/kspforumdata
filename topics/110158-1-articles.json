And the margin is very tight! It has, therefore, quite the piloting requirements. Don\u0027t worry! There is a piloting guide in the description and everything. I guess that\u0027s what happens when you go tight on TWR on order to maximize payload ratio... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VRkrw3A.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VRkrw3A.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what a ratio. It might make orbit on fumes, but almost half the weight in orbit is LFO, inside a spacious cargo bay where there is room for pretty much whatever you want if you don\u0027t want the fuel. I also think it\u0027s pretty elegant the way that it uses Vernors to achieve RCS translation and rotation, and a pretty powerful system at that, using the leftover fuel. Aerodynamic handling is quite fine, both with the full payload and empty it will stay balanced at all fuel levels. That\u0027s right, you can glide it to the ground with a full bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut best of all? It is \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E friendly to take close to your stations! 108 parts means that you can afford quite the big spectacular station without serious lag, even with a couple of these docked to it.

Let\u0027s try to answer everything. First, yeah, I\u0027m very happy with how the engine assemblies turned out. Mind you, they are quite cheaty, I abused the translation and rotation gizmos to do some heavy clipping, and in the process I discovered that intakes behave in weird ways with respect of how much air they receive: if preecoolers are behind an intakes, they will get less air, but apparently they don\u0027t mind being attached to the back end of a RAPIER engine. Who knew?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the question about the K-34 (the big chemical SSTO). I\u0027m really sad, but apparently I\u0027ve hit some short of development wall. See all those aerodynamic fuselages on the front? They must be doing something weird to the aerodynamics, because for the life of me, I can\u0027t get her to behave stably when empty, and I\u0027ve used every trick in the book. Either that, or sideways Mk3 tanks are a really bad idea, I wouldn\u0027t know since in the SPH indicator everything looks fine with the CoL pretty far behind the CoM. After some very frustrating reentries (either too lawn-darty, or total loss of control on hitting dense atmo, with no room in between), I have relegated it to the back-burner for now. I might revisit, but in the meantime the Longsword will have to serve the reusable heavy lifting requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Which was another development surprise, but of the good kind: the longsword was built to be able to lift half the payload it ended up with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T08:23:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like the way you mounted the engines.

And no, I\u0027m not going anywhere. Just that at that point, it was 12:00pm, and I had been playing KSP while browsing the forums for six hours straight. There will be more stuff a I create them, after all R-SUV needs a lot of replacements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntakes, yup, you guessed right, it\u0027s the leftover air from when I closed them and switched to rocket power. I still do that, even though I\u0027m not so clear on whether intakes decrease in drag when closed in 1.02 or not. Old habits!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the double dock, I just fiddle in the editor until the second one is so close it looks docked, but isn\u0027t. When the vessel loads, they dock before anything has a chance to move, and you get your firm connection. A handy trick. Also note that it is better to attach the ports to the rear surface of the tank immediately before the bay, since fiddling with translation for stuff attached to a payload bay is pretty bugged and will make it jump all over the place.

But other than that, it\u0027s not that difficult once you relearn a few things: You need TWR\u0026gt;1 on the runway to break Mach, enough wing for AoA drag not to stop you doing so, \u0026gt;1.5km/s of rocket power on the tanks, and you will make orbit without issues.

Well, first of all, don\u0027t beat yourself, the test payload is also the maximum weight it\u0027ll lift to a ~75x75 orbit with any margin, so it\u0027s only reasonable you can\u0027t get her up unless you do things pretty much perfectly. I assume you are following the flight profile in the craft\u0027s description? If so, the only thing I can add is that maybe you want to switch the RAPIERs manually to closed cycle mode when they go under ~75kN thrust in order to keep a high vertical velocity that minimizes drag \u003Cem\u003Ewhile keeping a low-ish angle of attack to also minimizes drag\u003C/em\u003E. It is easy to chase a higher cutoff velocity at the expense of going flat right at the moment you are experiencing the highest drag losses, and that can consume your delta-v pushing against air when you try to build vertical velocity back up later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that still fails, just empty the test payload a bit, or better yet, draw fuel from it by un-forbidding the tank, you will still get tons of it into orbit and it serves as RCS so you can also \u0022waste\u0022 it there (I wouldn\u0027t call it waste if it gets the mission done!). When you get more comfortable with it, I\u0027m sure you will be able to push the payload fraction to its limit and bring the full load to the station. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
