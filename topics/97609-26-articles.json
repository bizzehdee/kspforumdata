Perhaps they feel that if they scream loud enough, there is a chance their mods might get implemented into stock and they can get a cash bonus prize? Many players do not care for FAR, BTSM, or many of the other \u0022realism\u0022 mods, and Squad knows that.\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, the only real complaint in all of this is the possibility of the release being terribly buggy. I\u0027m sure it could happen, as it has happened. Every so often a serious bug slips through, but Squad is usually on top of those within 24 hours. Every other argument is moot. No, the game does not \u0022need mod XYZ\u0022 to be complete. Some add cool stuff, but if it doesn\u0027t get added, that\u0027s fine. That is why the game is so moddable as it is. They want people to be able to tune the game to their own playstyle. With NASA, Elon Musk, and KerbalEDU, finances are certainly not a problem. Perhaps it might be an incentive to pick up the pace (4 years is a long time to develop a game, even for many blockbusters,) but I would imagine the recent realization that they have hit the four year mark made them re-evaluate where they are and they realized they were much closer to being done than thought (couldn\u0027t see the forest through the trees.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn these 60\u002B pages of comments I have seen plenty of posts from people who aren\u0027t modders sharing the same opinions as modders. I\u0027ve also seen lots of comments from players with different opinions from mine which raise valid points and good arguments. In the end I disagree with their points of view but do feel they have contributed to the discussion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same can\u0027t be said about your post, which I feel it\u0027s purely destructive criticism targeted at people who happen to think differently then you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople that are opposed to 1.0 seem to be sounding mostly three points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The game lacks content. These people suggest a lot of mods as starting points to fill that void.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The game lacks balance. These people would mostly like to have more testing in order to balance costs, rewards, etc. Maybe a bit more content could help balance everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The game lacks polish. These people would like more testing to weed out bugs. Some extra additions (like unity5) would also help fix this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think in (in my perception) that most people feel it\u0027s a combination of the three above. Some want much more polish and a bit more balance with little to no extra content. Some want more content and speak more about mod integration. Even if you are against adding more content there are plenty of reasons why it feels, for some, too soon to allow the game to go Gold. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo dismiss these views and categorize them as \u0022modders that want a shot in the spotlight\u0022 is an error in my opinion. An error that might impact the image of Squad as developer and of KSP as product. At least that is my concern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, if you think of it. If the game was finished and development continued the chance of a mod to be integrated gets higher as core content is already done and now they can start to work with the creative people who make these mods and expand the content of the base game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T21:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen you look at the poll question, don\u0027t judge KSP as fit for a \u00221.0\u0022 release as-is, with what you see today in .90 - but also consider their \u00221.0\u0022 goals, announced in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/326-Beyond-Beta\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBeyond Beta\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/325-Overhauled-Aerodynamics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOverhauled Aerodynamics\u003C/a\u003E articles.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an important point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI answered just what the question asks. \u0022Is KSP ready for 1.0\u0022 My answer: No.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that is not the same as, \u0022Will KSP be ready for release as 1.0 after the Developers implement their planned changes\u0022...
