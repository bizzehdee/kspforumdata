The real life ISS radiators are there for a reason (i.e., it will overheat without them!), and even the Apollo spacecraft had to keep slowly\u00A0rolling on its roll axis to try and dissipate some of the heat off during the coast to the moon (I think they called it \u0027barbecue rolling\u0027). As it turns out, space isn\u0027t \u0022cold\u0022, not in the sense that being next to it could \u0022cool\u0022 you. Actually, the absence of matter acts more like heat insulation of sorts since a spacecraft\u0027s heat can\u0027t \u0022conduct\u0022 heat with the matterlessness of space. So if the craft is picking up heat, say because it is exposed to the sun for too much time, radiators are the only effective way to lose that heat.

In innermost travels in the kerbol system, though, even KSP craft can be barbecued if close enough to Kerbol. Radiators mitigate that. But what I would like to see is craft slowly but surely picking up heat everywhere, except when actually very far from Kerbol (say, Jool?) or when constantly hiding from the sunrays (like a fast, low altitude orbit where the station or craft is shadow half of the time).\u00A0Certainly around Kerbin\u0027s solar altitude, if exposure is constant, heat buildups should be a thing.

At mach3\u002B in the 20-40km altitude band, skin temperature on the nose cone typically is 1800K and over. Slowly but surely, the heat seeps in and becomes part temperature. Most cockpits are only good for 1200-1500K part temp. If the skin stays hotter than that for too long, the cockpit will go poof. So if you put a cockpit in front, you have to climb decisively and get above 50km before the crew boils. Even then, it takes a while for skin temp to drop; as long as it\u0027s hotter than the inside, heat will seep in. I\u0027ve had cockpits blow up long after the worst was over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried radiators in the hope that they would at least help a little once I was out of the worst. I mean, when the cockpit skin starts to cool down, there ought to be leeway for the radiators to work, don\u0027t you think? But no such luck. I paid really close attention and the radiators had no noticeable effect for as long as I was in atmosphere. At 70km, they\u0027d suddenly spring into action, but not before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pre-cooler just behind the cockpit was more effective, at least in the sense that one could see an effect when looking at the numbers.

KSP can be\u00A0fun in many different ways. If something works, its worth trying, goofy or not. Thats one of KSP\u0027s merits, being fun for people looking for either suave or hardcore entertainment.
