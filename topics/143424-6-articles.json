I didn\u0027t know quite where to put it but its food for thought on all this stuff. I still tend to think we\u0027re more on the lack-of-rewards end of the spectrum, but its worth considering what it is about a particular planetary enhancement that makes it worth striving for.\u00A0Random failures aren\u0027t a great solution, neither really would be just making landings bumpier--I think we\u0027re fine there. The question for me has always been what reason do I have to get out and walk around or to\u00A0bring a buggie to see over the next hill?

In fact, all brown dwarfs and more massive gas giants will be as big or slightly smaller than Jupiter, because it just further compresses and compacts the gasses. In the case of a brown dwarf, it compresses it so much that the atoms begin to fuse deuterium in the core.

Upgrading facilities would set you back seven or eight figures. Even filling a fuel tank in your Vall shipyard is more expensive than a full-fledged Mun mission rocket built on Kerbin. Perhaps you could do contracts or build additional buildings to lower the costs, but operating out of even the Mun would require a lot more Funds than from Kerbin.

With a permanent base on Laythe, a visit to the Joolian moons is a trivial matter, at least compared to sending ships from Kerbin all the time. Launching from the tight orbit of Moho, you get transfer windows to all the planets all the time. A newbie player dreading to take the step to Duna would have an easier time designing his ship and launching it from Minmus. After becoming familiar with Duna, the planet could be used as a stepping stone on the way to Dres. Or he could skip base building on Duna entirely, and establish one on Dres and use that as a starting point for future Duna and Jool missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLate-game, you would get missions to move stuff and tourists from base to base, which would allow for very varied mission profiles.
