I did not make it to the landing area tho. (close, could see the landing area from about 1000 m up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI picked up the 12x4 experimental when I read about Mun?! I decided to see if I could at least orbit and return. First attempt I orbited, but ran out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond attempt, I orbited and performed a transmunar injection to Kerbin. Unfortunately I again ran out of fuel. Obviously, it is time to break out some astrophysics calculations to better time the injection burn. 800,000m PE just wasn\\\u0027t going to cut it. If I had waited on the burn a bit longer, I would have nailed it with fuel to spare for De-orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, looking forward sharing with everyone and seeing if I can land and return. I\\\u0027d love to see a docking capability so we could keep the orbiter (with fuel to return) above the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JupiterII","CreatedById":8029,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-13T22:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you don\\\u0027t fail as much as me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJupiterII\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-13T22:58:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"your mom","CreatedById":2028,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-14T02:01:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello welcome to the fourms.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
