I haven\u0027t been able to find one so far, and I would like one so that, as I am in the process of setting up a DMP server, I would like a space station that can be \u0022manned\u0022 by several players at once separated into orbital sections(kinda like the ISS but ignoring the fact that they are connected passageways). In my mind, this seems like the logical thing to do to allow my group of friends, who will be playing, to be able to use the space station at all times and, because they have each their own segment, can use it while others are. Any information anyone has is appreciated.
