Share some pictures and stories of the best and brightest creations you\u0027ve ever put together in Career mode. Is it cheap/expensive? What does it do? Does it come in black/veryveryveryvery-dark grey?**\n\nLet me start this off: \n\n\\*ahem\\*\n\nThis is my Shuttle. I\u0027ve developed it for many days now and it\u0027s my first ever functional shuttle in Career mode. It\u0027s also the first cheap alternative to full blown rockets for small payloads. For one payload, it costs 70K to launch it into LKO in the shuttle and 110K to launch it on a rocket. These are small(ish) payloads now. But I hope to get the MK3 parts soon in my campaign.\n\n**Pics:** \n\n **** \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Right now, I only have the first few modules down and Jeb was sent up by accident. I have dangit installed so when I went to check on him, a variety of systems had failed. No Life Support failures but batteries, solar panels and engines. He has served almost 200 Kerbal Days on the Mun so far.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\ndamn it I\u0027m jelly of your mining ops!

My experience startet with same tier 1 parts as you have.\n\nBig means also slower, crashprone and expensive when lost... my gamepace is slowing down the higher the tiers... and its getting complex with all the options, only when you know the parts exactly you can get something right later in the game. In my opinion is 99% complain about the game in this forum rooted in impatience. Anything works properly in Stock, i swear. Its game mechanics that let people wonder, they should better observe what is possible and what not.\n\nI swear, nearly anything can get working if its done right. Consider it like playing chess, i look at it like me against the game physiks, me wins, me looses.\n\nI give you a hint for the Minmus mining Vehicles: The Center of Mass is Full and depleted exactly in the Center of the Crafts, the center of vertical thrust a little bit above it... ... they are in any situation in perfect balance, except you fill or deplete the tanks not symmetrical.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T18:19:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 06:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mikki**\n  \nHint"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T18:34:19Z","Content":"Moved to Spacecraft Exchange: the place for showcase threads."}]}
