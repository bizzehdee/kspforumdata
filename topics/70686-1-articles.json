A potential workaround you can use for now, though, is to use ALT-F5 to periodically create a named backup of your current game (which can be restored with ALT-F9). Like I\u0027m about to start a mission to Jool in my game, so I have a \u0027master backup\u0027 right at the beginning of the mission, and I can continue to use normal quicksaves along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
