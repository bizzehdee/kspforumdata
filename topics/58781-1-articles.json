It was fun as the gravity let me travel far with little fuel used. Anyway I got to the top of the mountain and I decided to make Bill jump off the top and see how far he could float. As I was running I tried to time warp and I got a message saying I could not because the ship was under acceleration. This is odd as I didn\u0027t think Bill had a throttle, his pack was put away and he was just moving forward and jumping. Then I got the mission briefing up and it said Bill Kerman crashed into Minmus? I laughed because I have a quicksave just before the accident, but it still puzzled me and I wondered if it happens to anybody else at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roman_legion","CreatedById":59376,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T21:24:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds to me like Bill tripped and fell into the ground at four times acceleration.

The regular one you use in orbit in which case the physics does shut off... and then there is physics warp which is used in atmosphere, on the ground, or activated with alt while throttled up. It only goes up to 4x and weird things can happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nine_iron","CreatedById":37971,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T23:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI remember EVA sliding along the surface of Minmus at a very high speed and when I warped, Bill exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T00:07:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUhm.... 2 of my Kerbals puffed into Oblivion when they tried to set a foot on Eeloo a week ago.
