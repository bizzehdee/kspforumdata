But if we hover the mouse cursor over it the info window says it contains liquid fuel and oxidizer, so what on earth is this tank doing in such a node ?? ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) It should be located in the \u0022Propulsion systems\u0022 node with the Oscar-B tank and the two tiny engines, unless you wanted to make it a xenon tank too ?"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T13:33:27Z","Content":"To my memory, that tank *should* be a xenon tank, unless I missed something.
