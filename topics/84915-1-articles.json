The module is very process intensive as it has to reorient the IVA, swap shaders, and keep track of other pods in the vicinity and swap their shaders depending on when you are in or out of IVA. If you play with the pods a little bit, you\u0027ll see the lighting inside is all wrong when you see through the windows, because the IVA is in a whole different orientation than the rest of the world, in a different unity scene I believe. It\u0027s also why the windows are all black in the kerbal portraits. You can launch one pod without TransparentPod Module, and one with, and you\u0027ll see some very interesting things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T23:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah those are not actually see through windows. What this does is actually making the windows transparent and adding the models to the pod. If you made the stock windows transparenmt, there would be nothing inside, the Internals are not rendered from the flight view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
