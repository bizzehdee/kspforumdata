I really like it. It has a nice caricature feeling about it. The overall build quality is good. You have set it up well too, brakes are set up properly as are the surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The interior is really nice dude.

You started the strut on the wing. If you start the strut on the structural panel you can offset it inside hiding it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it is very hard to get kerbals into the seats without using mods. Given how nice the interior is I think you missed a trick by not allowing kerbals to get in from the outside and move around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And that\u0027s it! Its a lovely aircraft mate, bordering on too many parts for an aircraft but still enjoyable to fly. The bombs are fun but I would have liked action groups for them so I don\u0027t have to drop all of them, maybe just separate out the staging for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This deserves more attention as its great, good job man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T19:14:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Azimech\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Azimech\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI could always make a part reduced variant if people are interested.

Moving around inside the B-25 was a bit tricky though, you had to crawl your way over the bombbay, underneath the cockpit there\u0027s a tunnel leading to the bombardier/front gunner position. If only our kerbals could crawl ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pilots had a door in the greenhouse, the gunners/radio operator went through a hatch in the belly.
