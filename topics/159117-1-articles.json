She turned her radio\u00A0on to listen to the news. She smiled when she heard her name:\u00A0\u0022Kerbal Payments\u00A0founders including Skyla Kerman gain millions of funds after they sell off to kPort\u0022. She had received multiple calls from friends and relatives which wanted to congratulate her on her \u0027winnings\u0027. A lot\u00A0of them just wanted some of her money. She told them\u00A0that she had other ideas for the money.\u00A0She wasn\u0027t selfish, but she had plans. Big plans.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe was a very intelligent young lady who originally came from a small town in the South of Gednalna. Her family then moved to Ligartabia and on to Kelpogart where she went to university and co-founded Kerbal Payments. Kerbal Payments took the internet by storm, and it grew exponentially. Then she started to think of what she could do with the money. She imagined a world with no climate change, and one where space can be accessed by all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first company she started was Kerbol Energy, which made solar panels. She then made Keesla,\u00A0which made solar powered cars which could run forever. However, she quickly got bored of this and sold 50% of the shares to others, gaining a few more millions of funds, enough to make her own space company.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe contacted a few friends from the \u0027KPayments Mafia\u0027 and together they founded SkyTech Aerospace. They hired a team of engineers, with her friend Mike Kriffin as Lead Engineer. They started work on a fuel tank, engines and\u00A0attitude control thrusters. Little did they know it, but they had begun a new age of spaceflight and civilisation itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-07T17:38:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2017 05:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Skylon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skylon","CreatedById":175317,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-16T17:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EChapter 1\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust over a\u00A0month\u00A0after their work began\u00A0(a kerbals month here is 50 days, the orbital period of Minmus) their first stage engine had finished development on Day 54, Year 1. Skyla had not yet given it a name, as she wanted her fans to decide what it would be called. However, she quickly realised she had no fans (yet \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E), so she\u00A0named it the\u00A0Albus 1. The test would come\u00A014 days\u00A0later on Day 68. Meanwhile, the engineers realised that they would need a fairing, guidance and\u00A0power systems\u00A0for their rocket, so they started work on those too. On Day\u00A058 it was reported\u00A0that\u00A0the engineers had been having issues with the\u00A0attitude control thrusters, as they couldn\u0027t get the mass down to the expected level. However, they soon realised that it was because Jeb kept hiding Bob\u0027s clipboard inside the nozzle after they took notice of his profuse complaints. On Day 63 the tank, which used the latest lightweight technology,\u00A0was tested at the correct pressure successfully with no rapid unplanned disassembly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the days leading up to the test flashed by, and suddenly Skyla could hear the countdown to ignition start...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002210,9,8,7...Turbo pump start...6,5,4...fuel flowing as planned...3,2,1...Ignition!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA rumble could be heard\u00A0by the inhabitants\u00A0of a nearby village as the engine burned its fuel, producing the expected 205.5kN of thrust, at an Isp of 265.5.
