The MAS mod is fantastic with the LCD / CRT screens in receiving the images with extra info to access, so I don\u0027t think the game needs to look at reinventing the wheel so to speak in this regard but a general viewing screen won\u0027t hurt as a standard in-game cockpit addition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nI\u0027d like to see the cameras also work on a craft (fitted with the screens) if within range, or be accessed if within signal range of a nearby satellite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nWhere I could see this working are things like Telescopes (zoom ranges could be modified in a config file to suit for Telescopes), cameras fitted to rockets,\u00A0separation parts, colony buildings,\u00A0vehicles / mars like\u00A0rovers and Kerbal\u00A0helmets (although images of the latest\u00A0Kerbal Suits does look like a Camera might already be in place for this)\u00A0could all be accessed via mission control centre or other crafts provided a data signal is able to receive it. In multiplayer, a player could\u00A0be looking at exactly what you are, where you are in the Kerbal System or what you are building.
