As a result, the nose could not be pulled more than about 7 degrees (6.8 was the most I could get without loss of control) off the horizon below about 5000 meters- making landing effectively impossible in Duna\u0027s hilly terrain (at least for a pilot as bad at landing as I am).

View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you who don\u0027t understand (or didn\u0027t read my earlier posts on the Eagle Mk2), test flights of the Eagle on Kerbin revealed it faces *SERIOUS* stability problems (being far too tail-heavy) when equipped with a full load of reactor fuel and no cargo in any of its other fuselage modules. As such it was designed and launched (using either TAC fuel Balanced before liftoff, or tweakables- I can\u0027t remember if it was built before KSP-I reactor loadout became a tweakable...) with a PARTIAL load of uranium- only 10-15% of maximum. This served to reduce weight, raise altitude ceiling, and improve TWR of course- but its most important effect was to shift weight AWAY from the tail section of the ultra-lightweight fuselage design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps, if I hadn\u0027t quicksaved after finding a successful re-entry pattern and deploying the Eagle Mk2 on it the second time around (it took me about 3 tries to re-enter, the first two times crashing due to impatience and stupid mistakes trying to speed the process up), I could have saved the mission by adding some LFO as cargo to the front service module (or Monopropellant, if I had saved some from the transfer vehicle rather than wasting it all during Duna capture) to balance the magical new uranium load in the rear. Even so, I\u0027m not sure that would have weighed enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, I have no option to save the mission unless I want to try and intercept it to add front-loaded cargo during the extra-atmospheric portion of an unstable orbit, as it is designed with a high enough altitude ceiling (at least 24,000 meters, from my experiences on Duna) that its relatively weak Thermal Turbojet is capable of kicking it well out of the atmosphere on a ballistic trajectory...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, that might be worth a try- although the only vessel with the KAS winch to refuel it currently in the Duna system (the Duna Science Module) is touched down at the site of my future Duna base, and doesn\u0027t have the fuel aboard to make it back to orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich means, cheaty as it sounds (and is), I would have to leave the Eagle on rails in an unstable orbit for at least 9 or 10 game days (until the arrival of the next vessel of the Duna Armada- despite all leaving in the same transfer window, the different ships all utilized very different ejection angles and transfer velocities...) I can\u0027t keep it loaded all this time, because the nuclear reactor would overheat and go into emergency shutdown (requiring about a month of in-game cool-down time before reactivation) without the atmosphere to convect heat away from its radiator over the majority of its unstable orbit, preventing me from counteracting drag without a means of thrust... (I could also leave it gliding for 9-10 days before leaving the atmosphere, with occasional bursts of engine power to counteract drag- it has enough endurance for roughly a year of that with the unplanned extra reactor fuel- but who wants to run a mission for 4-5 real life days at 2x physics-warp, having to quickload the mission from an atmospheric quicksave every time they play KSP?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo what do you guys think? Should I give ballistic interception (to load cargo in the front sections to counteract the extra reactor weight) a try? Or would something else, like Hyper-Editing (although I\u0027ve never used HyperEdit, as a matter of principle) out the excess reactor fuel that was never supposed to be there (and is throwing way off the CoM) be acceptable?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: OK, reading back over previous posts- maybe it\u0027s possible to land even with only 7 degrees of Angle of Attack flexibility... The Eagle Mk2 can get down to gliding at about 58 m/s at 3200 meters before I lose control or smash into a hill... I see that some landings were done at as much as 120 m/s- so maybe I just need to find a better landing spot...

Some good ideas there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could improve the design a bit by reducing the part-count if you installed the Multipanels mod (which basically gives you upsized versions of the Ox-STAT solar panel, though they look a bit ugly, as they are literally just resized OX-STAT panels, and the base is too tall for the scale). This might even allow you to throw on a few more wings and ion engines and build an even bigger version...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, the NearFuture mod has nuclear reactors which, though not nearly as power-dense as real reactors (or the ones in KSP-Interstellar, which are modeled after real-life reactors), still produce more EC/ton than any of the solar panels except the OX-STAT panels facing directly towards the sun (and in a plane, most of the time they will be at a significant angle). This might reduce your weight for the same actual electricity production- as the reactors would produce more power than the solars except when flying around Dunar noon- and would allow you to have powered flight at night...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if you want to \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E optimize your design, install Procedural Dynamics (better known as \u0022Procedural Wings\u0022 though the mod was never actually called this). It will allow you to basically create wings of any size and shape you desire, and the lift coefficient properly scales for large-sized wings (as well as based on other more subtle wing parameters like root-to-tip width ratio: it\u0027s basically halfway to FAR in terms of realistic lift equations), so your larger planes will produce slightly more lift compared to their wing area, like in real life... (lift increases exponentially with wing area in real life- though the curve is somewhat balanced by increased drag)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play with all these mods myself (especially Procedural Dynamics, on Geschosskopf\u0027s suggestion- how else would I build giant flying wings like the Raven Mk2 without overwhelming my CPU with part-count and 50 separate lift equations for each wing section?) Procedural Dynamics will be especially helpful for you- since it most strongly benefits craft with large, thing wings like your ion-flyer/glider (like in real life, in Procedural Dynamics thicker wings produce more lift than thinner wings- but I believe their lift coefficient actually decreases, so it\u0027s less lift per ton of mass, making thin wings preferable on lightweight gliders...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-26T10:52:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2014 10:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
