It says that probe core has a basic antenna in it that should have a 5 km range, but does it not with relays? \u00A0Are those only for Kerbin-based transmitters?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a picture of the two right after separation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Cannot_Relay.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://s18.postimg.org/7mp83g3nd/Cannot_Relay.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-31T01:03:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I just checked.. and I have no relay issues with the probe built in antenna in a\u00A0 similar simulated scenario.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCan you supply a bit more info as the picture is impossible to tell what you actually have there.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can see the active vessel has a connection but which one is that?\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat kind of relay? does it have power?\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes the booster have power? is it in hibernation mode?
