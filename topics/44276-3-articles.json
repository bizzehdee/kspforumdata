There are a \u0022boundaries\u0022 to what can be observed either directly or indirectly and because science depends on observation that means there are boundaries to science, in fact there are MANY of them. It is true that what we can observe is useful to disqualify a broad range of explanations for those things that we cannot observe. It is also true that, as time progresses, the boundaries of what we can observe keep getting pushed further away from our proximity in time and space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the simple fact is, there may never come a time when we can say with full confidence: Okay, we can now observe EVERYTHING.
