Typically once the spacecraft is high enough the staging action will decouple the LES while firing it\u0027s engines, pulling it and the boost protection cover clear of the crew compartment. However, in a Soyuz style abort the return and equipment modules are pulled clear of the craft, and then only the return module is decoupled from the orbital module and LES to fall freely out the bottom of the Boost Protect cover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psychopoak","CreatedById":58162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T22:05:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehm, ok I will then have a look at my design. to be honest I have\u0027nd had time to deeply mess around with parts, and considering I play in career I could just not have all the needed parts yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for the hints though\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gobur","CreatedById":106365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eany chanses for 1.0 version?

If you\u0027re re-using the \u0022Spud\u0022 for this, it\u0027s also something I\u0027ve considered. That\u0027s the nice thing about having the command seats as props, it makes IVAs more modular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would ask that you don\u0027t change too much from the original however, especially since new parts you create may not be supported in the reboot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather that you mostly just keep the mod running in the current version of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E I can\u0027t get the old green Soyuz to show up, and I\u0027ll delete the Tiangong airlock.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022passinglurker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022passinglurker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eagain _agustus_? really? what happened to your promises to actually learn to mod, or are you gonna keep mooching off shadow for a little longer?\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I wouldn\u0027t talk about taking over mods until you have a finished product to show off. sorry if this sounds harsh but I\u0027m getting sick of watching this same routine from you again and again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E I have something called a life and school.

I feel it might be best if I just make time to handle getting this updated to 1.0 myself. And honestly I\u0027m just not ready to let go, I put so much work into these old parts, I should be taking better care of them. Even if I am working to reboot the mod, that will take some time to accomplish fully. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I should even just start working the reboot parts into the main release, since so many new tanks and adapters are ready to go in the Dev version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
