Also, during the career I\u0027ve introduced a few mods and such to get things done that in stock is rather difficult if not impossible. So this little series will cover the modernization program of my space flying or stationed thingy-mah-bobs-and-stuff. Not as a narrative as such, but more through a series of News Articles and Press Releases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used BTW: MechJeb, B9, KAS, Lazor DockingCam, AviationLights, Kethane, InfernalRobotics, KerbalAlarmclock\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKarch 14th, KSC\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmidst rumors of a near disaster during the docking of the MultiXplorer craft of Minmus fame after returning from a lengthy Duna mission, KSC revealed today that indeed current orbital infrastructure assets may not be entirely scaled to handle ongoing and future missions.

Wernher von Kerman informed us that eventhough KS is now obsolete, it was full of fuel that the new LKM needed to make the transfer to Mun orbit. He also revealed that the old KS will get a sort of a make-over. \u0022We\u0027ll keep the docking ports, plug in the new Fuel Tank Hub in a slightly modified configuration, de-orbit the habitat and solar arrays. Basically making it into an unmanned Fuel Depot for outgoing traffic. But that is all a bit in the future. Speaking of unmanned, Doden Kerman, the last crew of the Kerbin Station, closed it for business after the fuel-transfer to the Large Kethane Miner and entered the LKM as part of the crew with Bill and Bob who is also riding out to Mun to oversee the first running of this new apparatus and further operational needs of Mun Base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/KSP/13_LKMRefuel2_zps0f71ed7c.png\u0022 alt=\u002213_LKMRefuel2_zps0f71ed7c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the LKM to Mun Base is a complicated affair. Arriving at Mun orbit, the LKM needed to top off its center tank and RCS reserves. Von Kerman explained that the LKM do not use the most efficient engines, a low profile was more important than efficiency, so to make a landing on Mun some more fuel was needed. As for the RCS, he explained that the LKM is not entirely balanced, so the RCS tanks serve mainly as ballast to even the weight out during transport. \u0022It is a bit cumbersome to move around.\u0022 he said. \u0022But that is fine, it\u0027s not supposed to move a lot.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe also commented that \u0022Mun Station will also receive a bit of an upgrade. But it is a bit more complicated. For one thing, we got two crew on the Science Module, and they flat out refuse to get out. We suspect them of growing some very suspicious potent snacks in there. Either way, to pry them out, we need to dismantle the station around Mun, de-orbit what we don\u0027t need. Then tug the Science Module to Kerbin orbit, slap a ton of parachutes onto it and then de-orbit the thing in a safe manner. Finally when on the ground, applying an industrial size can-opener to it and find out what the crew have been up to. It\u0027s a bit of a project...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally we was presented two pictures of the LKM after safe arrival at Mun Base. The first together with the old installations there, and the last with Jebediah, Bill and Bob - the combined heads of AKME - posing with the new fully functional Large Kethane Miner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/KSP/14_LKMatMun1_zpse177bffb.png\u0022 alt=\u002214_LKMatMun1_zpse177bffb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/KSP/15_LKMatMun_zps5b63a0cf.png\u0022 alt=\u002215_LKMatMun_zps5b63a0cf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs what is to happen with the old installations, von Kerman said that \u0022The old mobile Kethane Rig is already prepped for transit to Minmus and explore the fields there to find a nice flat spot to set up shop. The old Fuel-Rover, that ungainly prone to tip over thingie, will be replaced pretty soon - probably on the same shipment that will send a shuttle to the Base in order to pick up Jeb, Bill and Bob. As for the Habitat, we\u0027re thinking of keeping that for the time-being. It\u0027s a bit overkill in crew capacity and a bit underwhelming in power-output.
