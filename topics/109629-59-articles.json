I haven\u0027t downloaded the pack from Mike yet because I prefer simple stations such as Mir and Salyut, but the files I sent to Mike had CBM fixed, PMA commented out in the docking module (but they used to work just fine), and, the only one which I have no idea if it is working or not (mostly because I never use it), is the truss docking port, which I did mess with but didn\u0027t test beyond VAB...\n\nas for the Mir ones, if Mike wants I can send him my copy of the Mir pack so he can merge in the release, I made for personal use (and somehow got rid of the Kvant experiment and only realized that a few days ago, but didn\u0027t bother to fix it as it is for personal use) but it\u0027s quite good to go, with nodes fixed, Mir core as a working Lab, Mechjeb support (don\u0027t recall which parts though as I use MJ for all parts with command modules) and CLS support... there might be other stuff that I don\u0027t recall now..."},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T02:34:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Exactly which docking ports from ISS?

Mike said earlier that he hadn\u0027t gotten to the modules yet to most likely its the atthment nodes on the modules. However one of the APAS attach and the other doesn\u0027t. There are two in the VAB. I am not sure which one goes with which pack however one of them attaches and the other doesn\u0027t. This leads me back to thinking that its possible that the attachment nodes need a once over look to make sure they are al working."},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T03:10:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E call me a noob. ive been on hiatus since .20. anyway theres no craft file(s) i see in the download. everythings changed so much i just put the space shuttle folder in ksp 1.0.4. game data folder. even ran a search and found no .craft files. am i missing something?\n\nWelcome back!!!
