The mod is primarily intended for part recycling on my Mun base, so this is optional.\n\nIt would also be nice if there was an option per-part to only allow deconstruction. That would help to remove clutter on the \u0022build a new part\u0022 screen, as some parts have no point being there (such as SRBs), but not prevent tearing those parts down if I happen to have them.\n\nPreferably, all declarations for what part gives what components should either be a module added to that part (via ModuleManager), or a declaration similar to a RESOURCE listing. I want to be able to easily add my own component listings, so that every part I have would be able to be dismantled.\n\nIf you\u0027ve played Space Engineers, imagine the mod gives capabilities similar to grinding down a ship or two to create a completely different ship. I would have the ability to grind down some wheels and docking ports to create an ION drive, some OX-STAT panels to make a folding-outwards panel (using the motors from the wheels), and some girders to make a Xenon tank and external command seat, and then just slap on a small reaction wheel I found lying around. Suddenly, I have a small ION exploration craft, despite never bringing those parts with me.\n\nThis is the list of components I would like to see parts made of (probably need more, and you do not need to follow this list anyway):\n\n\\* Metal - Every part will have some amount of this, reaction wheels will have quite a bit\n\n\\* Thruster - All engines, RCS ports\n\n\\* Motor - Reaction wheels, powered wheels, most parts with moving bits\n\n\\* Computer - Any reasonably \u0027intelligent\u0027 part, such as the large solar panel, cockpits, probe cores\n\n\\* Electromagnet - Wheels (braking system), ION drive, docking ports\n\n\\* Solar Panel - Self descriptive\n\nIf the mod is made to a sufficiently good standard (and functions how I want it to), I would be willing to pay you for your efforts since it would appear to be a fairly complex task overall. This will be negotiated after you demonstrate the mod is working, most likely via screen sharing (as giving me the mod before getting payment would be unfair to you)."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T17:23:05Z","Content":"Take a look at [OSE Workshop](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234) - it produces and recycles KIS items using the \u0022MaterialKits\u0022 resource.\n\nTurning parts into specific resources (Metal, Thruster, etc) is what [EPL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545-1-0-4-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-v5-2-2) is doing with \u0022[recipes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545-1-0-4-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-v5-2-2?p=2101955\u0026viewfull=1#post2101955)\u0022.

It\u0027s close to what I want, but having everything clumped into 1 item for production is against what I\u0027m after.\n\nI\u0027ve messaged the author of that mod to see if they\u0027re willing to use multiple resources for parts, if not my request is still open. I\u0027d modify OSE to use multiple parts, but the issue is that I want those parts to share a common storage capacity, whereas the resource system caps per resource, so that\u0027s out of the question.\n\n[edit] The author wanted to do what I was after in the past, but struggled to work out how to do recipes nicely. They seem to be open to discussion on the matter, so I\u0027m trying to help find a good solution for the time being.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T18:04:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 06:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hexicube**"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T12:56:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E the issue is that I want those parts to share a common storage capacity, whereas the resource system caps per resource, so that\u0027s out of the question.\n\nIt\u0027s possible to change resource capacities on the fly; both [ART](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91790) and [Station Science](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54774) do that.

Progress is decent so far, I have a working implementation that can dismantle any part that has a HEXI\\_RECYCLE node, which looks like this:\n\n    HEXI_RECYCLE{\tcanCreate = true (all parts with the node can be dismantled, this toggles if it can be created again)\ttimeToDismantle = 60 (time in seconds to dismantle)\tcostToDismantle = 600 (ElectricCharge cost to dismantle, doubled for construction currently)\tmetal = 100 (gives/costs 100 metal)}\n\nSo far, all the components are stored on the \u0022Part Reconstructinator\u0022 module, but I plan on making a KIS item for each item so that they can be stored inside KIS containers (with excess components blocking usage of the part until space is available in a container). One thing I need to account for is TweakScale, which would obviously multiply all the values in the node by a specific amount, but I need to also make integration with it work in a way that makes it optional."}]}
