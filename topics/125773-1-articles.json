Is it possible to make them all start out as noob-kerbals? Perhaps by changing a config file, or should I head over to the mod request area?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T04:35:46Z","Content":"\nIt might be better to start a career mode, then [I]hold down[/I] alt-f12 and it should bring up a box to add science, funds, and rep. Add yourself some funds whenever you run low and you\u0026#39;ve basically got science mode. You can also upgrade buildings if you want to start with tier 3.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T04:48:06Z","Content":"\nHmm. If you want straight science mode with non-upgraded kerbals, idk if that\u0026#39;s possible even editing the save file. Because the game runs through the kerbal\u0026#39;s individual log and calculates the experience. Since that\u0026#39;s empty in the start of a new game, I would assume it also means that the function that calculates checks if you\u0026#39;re not in career mode...then returns a five star rating.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo either the suggestion above, or yeah, probably over to the add-on request area. I\u0026#39;m not sure how modifiable that will be.\n"}]}
