It would occur after the probe had left Kerbin\u0027s SOI, pretty much whenever I would go to the space center and then go back out to focus on the probe. I un-installed KER, and have yet to encounter the problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem with my testing is that my probe had a KER chipset on the ship, so I couldn\u0027t \u0022perfectly\u0022 recreate the scenario with/without KER installed. I had to revert to a save from before launching the probe, modify the probe in the VAB by taking the chipset off, and then uninstall KER and relaunch the mission. So yeah... it\u0027s strong proof that KER is to blame, but not perfect \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird issue of my mega-post:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone else have the issue of Minmus having different biomes now?
