Kind of like wing control surfaces and their authority adjustment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: to add to this, the functionality is already there. Build a\u00A0long rover with 5 sets of\u00A0wheels evenly spaced. Axles 1 and 5 will steer to full lock. Axles 2 and 4 will steer about half lock. And axle 3, if inline with COG, won\u0027t steer. Now we just need to be able to manually adjust it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT 2: apparently adding an ailerons authority tweak able module to the rover wheel .cfg doesn\u0027t do it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-17T07:43:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2016 07:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DrunkenKerbalnaut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-14T12:26:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree.
