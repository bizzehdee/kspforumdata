You\u0027re shooting for 50% solar, 50% wind eventually (more or less depending on your climate). In Germany getting from 9 to 25 or 30 on solar would be huge because peak demand is usually during the day when the sun is out and doesn\u0027t require huge amounts of storage. When it\u0027s not it\u0027s usually because a front is blowing through, which means more wind. After that you need more storage to get you through the night. They\u0027re aiming for 80% combined renewables by 2030, which if they follow through is about right. As the cost of storage comes down they can improve even on that. To bring it back to fusion, okay, maybe there\u0027s a home for that in 15-20 years in the remaining 10-15% where you run into diminishing returns on storage, but probably only if you can also bring the cost down considerably below that of nuclear.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI love the idea of fusion. It will be amazing if it works and its cheap.

The LCOE for LiB grid scale batteries \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E higher than peaker gas 4 years ago, but now its in the $150/mwh range and NREL projects that to continue to fall over the foreseeable future. \u00A0Ive heard a lot of doom and gloom about Li supply, maybe thats fossil fuel companies scaremongering about the future or maybe its commodity speculators juicing the market, but NREL doesn\u2019t seem to believe its a real problem long term. Meanwhile nuclear is up at 175$/Mwh and rising. And remember we\u2019re not trying to cover the whole nut. We\u2019re talking about scaling up from 2% to 20% over the next 20-30 years as it replaces aging nuclear plants and whatever\u2019s left of NG. \u00A0But more importantly that smaller fraction taken up by storage is whats going to allow us to even out supply between wind and solar so that we can spend $30-50/Mwh the rest of the time. So in 10 years when storage is covering 10% of supply at $100/Mwh, plus the $30/Mwh from renewables it took to charge them, its still going to be cheaper than nuclear, all of which accelerates the rate at which we can hit that 60-70% mark replacing fossil fuels.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-15T15:38:49Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2022 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-15T16:43:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMolten Salt Battery\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rechargeable-molten-salt-battery-freezes-energy-in-place-for-long-term-storage/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rechargeable-molten-salt-battery-freezes-energy-in-place-for-long-term-storage/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-15T21:04:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224209183\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206826\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221671107537\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022163815\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Codraroll\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Codraroll said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNuclear power plants become so expensive because of the volumes of red tape that have to be involved.

And I highly suspect that many of these safety regulations were imposed after lengthy lobbying campaigns by \u0022nuclear safety interest groups\u0022 whose pockets were full of coal money. Combined, they make nuclear power way too expensive and time-consuming to be worth considering, while coal and gas stand out as the cheap and easily available options, without much consideration for the dangers of that industry. I can\u0027t recall the source off the top of my head, but a while back somebody found out that more deaths could be attributed to coal mining accidents since 1940 than the entire nuclear sector -\u00A0including not only the events at Chernobyl and Fukushima, but also\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the US, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC) is incentivized to have at least one, but as few as possible nuclear reactors running in the country as it can manage.\u00A0 That is the federal level organization responsible for nuclear safety regulations, and they only have 2 incentives: 1) they are not needed if there are zero nuclear plants, 2) they get blamed for every negative event associated with nuclear energy generation.\u00A0 Their budget is independent of how many plants they govern, and so whenever nuclear power starts to look attractive, they pile on more regulations to keep it unattractive to minimize the potential for mishaps.(fewer plants mean fewer mishaps, and higher regulatory requirements mean fewer plants, ergo, they are incentivized to have as many expensive regulations as possible without driving all of the existing plants out of business)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd any sort of attempt to scale back the costs they impose can be met with \u0027but we just want to keep everyone safe\u0027, which is very hard to contest politically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would not be surprised by similar regulatory bodies in other countries, or even just using the US nuclear regulations as the gold standard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile getting rid of a bureaucracy is all but impossible, if the budget of the NRC were somehow attached to the number of functioning nuclear power plants, they might become more cost-effective relatively quickly.(unless the fossil fuel companies already own the board members or something, which is entirely plausible)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-15T23:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224209255\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206826\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221671122596\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154477\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JoeSchmuckatelli\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, JoeSchmuckatelli said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMolten Salt Battery\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rechargeable-molten-salt-battery-freezes-energy-in-place-for-long-term-storage/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rechargeable-molten-salt-battery-freezes-energy-in-place-for-long-term-storage/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat 15% loss for thawing is very significant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still think the killer breakthrough for renewables would be cheap room temp superconductors and a world wide grid connected with lossless transmission lines.\u00A0 It\u0027s always sunny somewhere and local peak/off-peak times would cyclically offset mostly naturally as the planet rotates\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTerrestrial fusion still has many very significant hurdles, but more energy out than in is good for sure.\u00A0 Until then, there is an existing fusion plant in the sky with challenges of it\u0027s own\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-16T00:00:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224209129\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206826\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221671080995\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s exactly what the Soviet powerplants were doing since early times.
