If it is still not working correctly, this is something that will be addressed when i overhaul the parts. It is however true that the shutters do not act exactly as they should at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectricCharge usage when closed and inactive: My thoughts here are...Even at night or inactive, the module needs to use small amounts of electricCharge to maintain a healthy environment for the living organisms... even while they sleep! Atmosphere, climate control etc.. need power to run as they are automated life support systems. To shut it all down, would mean they would be too cold, ill fed and life could not exist on-board.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-16T20:30:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2013 08:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Roboto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roboto","CreatedById":79154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T20:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, have you considered using Kethane converter module?
