I\u0027ve got a couple ships heading to Eve now myself. Just probes to test the \u0022waters\u0022 of the levitating ocean--er, I mean atmosphere. They\u0027ve got fairings, heatshields, and hopefully enough dV not to need any sort of aerocapture. The one thing they don\u0027t have is airbrakes. I keep forgetting to put those on spaceships. Seriously, airbrakes on spaceships instead of airplanes?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This morning\u0027s fun was getting the Eve flotilla safely across the Kerbin SOI boundary. I was with the Hummlebee crew on Ike, noticed that the Gilly miner had crossed to solar orbit, went to it--and got the NaN Kraken! Quit game, looked at persistence file: Clauselle and Gregmore showed up in the roster as \u0027missing\u0027 and there was no sign of their ship.\n\nI don\u0027t know what the NaN Kraken is, but I do have a lot of ships go missing between Kerbin and Eve. Usually it\u0027s on the way back from Eve, about 1 week from Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Either they just aren\u0027t there the next time I load the game or, if I\u0027m flying them at the time, suddenly the Hell Kraken (which seems to have morphed into the Blackout Kraken these days) drags them into the void.\n\nI also have a lot of problems with the Mun Kraken. Interplanetary ships leaving Kerbin that pass close behind, but not through, Mun\u0027s SOI vanish with depressing regularity. Satellites in Kerbin orbit that pass near, but not through, Mun\u0027s SOI also frequently disappear.\n\nWhile this is highly aggravating and annoying, OTOH it does give some old-time sailingship cachet to KSP. It\u0027s like how various parts of Earth\u0027s oceans acquired evil reputations back then. So when ships are near Mun\u0027s SOI, I think to myself that they\u0027re trying to round Cape Horn.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also a question regarding air flow dynamics, with the Gilly ore miner; since the heat shield (aerobrake, right?) is a bulkhead size larger than the parts behind it, have you observed it occluding the radially-attached drills etc. behind/shielding them from air friction (despite them being mounted on a part behind the part the heat shield is mounted on)?\n\nI have conflicting results from trying this myself. Sometimes it seems like the wider heatshield occludes radial parts behind it, sometimes it doesn\u0027t. I\u0027ve seen others arguing about this, too. What I do know for sure is that the \u0022MOAR occlusion\u0022 stuff supposedly in 1.0.4 has a big impact on radially mounted solar arrays. If your ship is angled only slightly to the sun, so that just a trace of shadow from the central stack falls on the base of the solar array, the entire array is \u0022blocked\u0022 even though 99% of it is sticking out in sunshine."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T13:19:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also a question regarding air flow dynamics, with the Gilly ore miner; since the heat shield (aerobrake, right?) is a bulkhead size larger than the parts behind it, have you observed it occluding the radially-attached drills etc. behind/shielding them from air friction (despite them being mounted on a part behind the part the heat shield is mounted on)?\n\nWe\u0027re all going to find out together, I have not tested ANY of these ships in atmosphere ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) And given what folks have been saying about interplanetary aerocapture in 1.0.4... we might not use those shields at all. I think I have enough dV for all the ships to brake clean in some kind of Eve orbit, and then as long as the Gilly lander makes it to ground, I can refuel them. \n\nThe one ship that might be marginal on braking dV... well, Bob might be annoying, but he\u0027s usually right.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E While this is highly aggravating and annoying, OTOH it does give some old-time sailingship cachet to KSP.
