Three times the xenon, and replacing the Hecs probes with Okto2s, then adding landing legs made from cubic octagonal and octagonal struts: by my calculations that should be considerably more than enough. The first xenon tank is on the Eve-lander probe, providing much-needed bulk, and almost all of the fuel for the Eve transfer (using 90% of the monopropellant first makes it a touch more than enough, according to the delta-v map).
