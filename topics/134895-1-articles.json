My plan is to put this probe inside my space plane to put it in orbit around kerbin with the space left inside my space plane I put 13 seat. I tried to put my tourist direct in the command seat but ksp wouldn\u0027t let me do it from the hangar so I made a rover with 7 mk2 inline cockpit and put a docking port to dock with my space plane. even docked I can\u0027t transfer tourist to the seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is : There is a way to have my tourist on external command seat?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T23:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could try the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/108711-105-take-command-launch-kerbals-in-external-command-seats-v13-dec-6-2015/\u0022\u003ETake Command\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0mod, but I\u0027ve never tried it with tourists, so I\u0027m unsure if even that will work.
