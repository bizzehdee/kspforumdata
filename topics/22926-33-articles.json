That may explain why I\u0027ve noticed some pretty severe lag when I get two of the modded Eagle\u0027s close together. I use those connectors at the front and back of the pods that I created. Having just one Eagle with them in view and nothing else is okay. But as soon as I get two of them within draw distance of each other it lags badly. Also lags when I get near another construction of any significant part count, like say - a stock space station. Some of that undoubtedly is just the part count overall. But it\u0027s noticeably worse when the Eagles are around.
