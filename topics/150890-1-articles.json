There are tons of biomes on planets, and a few biome specific experiments in low orbit, but mostly we just have space low and space high. I find there\u0027s a bit of a science drought between getting to Kerbin orbit and landing on Mun, after which science comes in huge quantities. Given that satellite contracts are offered differentiating things like equatorial, retrograde, polar, tundra and Molnya orbits, it seems to me there might be an interesting way of making actual space flight worthwhile beyond being simply a method of getting from one celestial body to another if being in different categories of orbit could grant science as separate biomes. It would give an incentive to actually do something other than launch to and\u00A0equatorial orbit and just head straight for Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Choctofliatrio2.0","CreatedById":154657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T17:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty cool idea! You could even add things like VanAllen belts at certain heights that act as another biome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T18:08:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat idea!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T18:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis really calls for atmospheric layers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KayBee","CreatedById":169787,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T19:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr can even have anomalies in space from where we can get science.
