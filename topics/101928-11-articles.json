Anyway, the way KIS stores the contents is rather much like the way KAS does it, except it always stores parts in \u0022stateful\u0022 format (KAS \u0027stateless = false\u0027); but it will happily load an edited savegame with stateless entries (no \u0022PART\u0022 subsection in the KIS \u0022ITEM\u0022 section), both for saved ships as well as for active ships. It appears that all the converter has to do is copy the KAS container contents to the KIS container and enumerate them (slot number); \u002B/- checking that it does not exceed the maximum slot number. Not sure what happens if a KIS container ends up overloaded, but I guess KospY can ensure it does not crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one other observation I had is that my test craft (Mk1 Lander Can w/ Jeb; KAS mounting bay \u002B KAS container on one side, KIS mounting part \u002B KIS container on the other side; both containers loaded with one PB-NUK and one standard docking port each) sometimes used a lot more CPU than the same craft with just two KAS containers.

The craft with two symmetrical KAS container assemblies (5 parts total) behaves pretty much like just a lander can, about 10.9% cpu load. The craft with KAS\u002BKIS container assemblies (also 5 parts total) randomly used the same 10.9%, or 13-14%, or even as high as 19% cpu. I loaded each a couple times, but didn\u0027t find any reason for the KIS craft behaving odd. There was nothing in the alt-f2 debug log.

I was testing on the pad the idea of sending a ship up with a container that a kerbal could take to another ship while in orbit, move parts around and then take the container back. With KAS you had to bring an extra holder on the ship because you couldn\u0027t put them in containers and you needed one to mount a container on the other ship. The new containers can hold a mount, but with the new tool system, you don\u0027t need it. You can just bolt the container to the side of the ship to be worked on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblems are: You have to hold the mouse button down to avoid going into placement mode if you want to put a container in a mount. As soon as you let up the button, you go into place mode and have to drop the container before you can get it back in drag mode to plug it in. Would be much better to be able to let up the button and then right click the mount to attach like KAS did. The other problem is when in place mode, you can no longer move your kerbin. Didn\u0027t try while still holding the mouse because that creates other problems. Once in place mode you can\u0027t move. SOooo, how do you move a container from one ship to another while in orbit? And without risking sending it flying off into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso saw another problem which has been mentioned. I dropped a holder on the launch pad and while I could still see it and even get a label to pop up with much work, I could no longer interact with it.

When I try to add a docking port in space to my station with KIS, I get my game freeze. It doesn\u0027t crash, I manually kill the exe. I waited 5 minutes once, but it doesn\u0027t fix itself either. KIS works great over all while attaching stuff but just stock docking port creates problem. Regular one, not the one with fancy shield. The part I am trying to attach might be also responsible, it is a OKS module.
