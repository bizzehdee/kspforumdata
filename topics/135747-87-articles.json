It takes thousands of units produced to achieve gain enough statistical knowledge of failure modes to get those last percentages, especially when you work with such razor-thin margins. Guess how many phones failed before you had your first iPhone, if you want me to use that analogy instead. It\u0027s the sad fact that every rocket is a huge building-sized mass of fine aerospace-grade materials, and a phone is a few grams of not-so-complicated circuitry... so you can build thousands of phones for the same price as a single rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I will point out that I am neither optimist, nor blind. In fact, it is you the one that seems to expect unrealistic things out of space programs here. Launch failures happen, just like there is a percentage of airplanes that never finish their service lives, or a few hundred phones that get sent back to the factory for manufacturing defects out of every million (asspulling numbers there at the end, but I once had to buy the same memory stick \u003Cem\u003Ethree times\u003C/em\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
