I have been trying to build a structurally sound supersonic jet (aiming for 750 to 800 m/s) at 12000m but I tend to blow up every wing except for the Big-S wing types. That type of wing states that it can withstand reentry but it makes even medium size planes look like kites. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that I am asking a lot but what I am really asking is for some sort of clarification AND quantification (or even just a quantification) to what is going on in the background of the game (heat/drag per part of a craft like a heat map or hotspots). Mapping like how the lift and drag forces can be in real time through the debug menu could be a great way to let people trouble-shoot the part vaporization that happens in flight (speed and/or heat tolerances). Mods will fill the gap sooner or later but I was just hoping that the new addition of a better atmospheric model would not be left incomplete for people who do not like having to keep up with mods for features that are half implemented not just part add-ins.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T13:47:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice if there was just a temp gauge somewhere indicating overheating of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
