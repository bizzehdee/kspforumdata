We\u0027d have to probably jack up the heat tolerances to just plain silly levels... which I dont personally mind... but its also not exactly my call.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd adding ablator isnt that hard... but theres no way (as far as I am aware) to define a portion of the craft to get ablator (like making it only affect the bottom half of the craft) and ablator will even be consumed in any sort of engine heat comes into contact with the craft (like sep motors). It may even get consumed on the way up if you go fast enough... So while its easy to add... it not as simple as just adding it, and it\u0027ll be ok.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
