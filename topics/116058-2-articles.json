The center of the whole system is the barycenter, the stars orbit it. It\u0027s like placing a copy of Kerbin at the opposite end of the orbit and multiple small moons around both Kerbins. If at all, I see this conflicting more with reality than with KSP\u0027s nested SoIs. No criticism of your mod anyhow, it is an excellent and very creative solution especially for planetary binaries.\n\nI was talking about a binary system.\n\nIn this case you need to cover at least the barycenter body otherwise you will either:\n\n1- smash into it\n\n2- get your orbit kicked for going too close to it\\*\n\nIf you are talking about the way to simulate the Galaxy, the problem remains the same. but the solutions is much easier:\n\njust put the barycenter so far out that noone will ever go there, and if they do they probably want to have their ships messed up ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n* * *\n\\*Even if you avoid 1 and 2 there will always be the possibility to orbit the barycenter in between the two main bodies, and that definitely doesn\u0027t seem right\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E Edit 2: I just thought of close flybys and **gravity assists** which could be used to exploit such a barycenter.

![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nthat\u0027s one of the reasons I started this so I hope the final result is as good as I picture it in my mind ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What will you do with planets pact that contain only one planet like Asclepius [SSTO playground](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126515-1-0-4-Asclepius-A-Kopernicus-planet-SSTO-playground) mod?\n\nMy current mindset is to maintain the feel of the mod when I port it over to GalacticNeighborhood.\n\nFor example:\n\nOPM will be loaded on a brand new star, called *Helios*. there will be a copy of each Stock planet (Moho = Helios I, Eve = Helios II, Kerbin = Helios III, etc...)\n\nso when you travel to the OPM System you will find it exactly like it was intended to be.\n\nThis will work for OPM, for Asclepius it seems a bit of an overkill to recreate the whole KSP system. Since the aim of the mod is to just add a target in between kerbin and Duna. I will contact MrChumley and I will ask him what he thinks will be the best system for his planet.\n\nI could recreate a system which has just Kerbin, Asclepius and Duna for example. I could even load this system in orbit around a different star.\n\nthere are many possibilities.\n\nI\u0027m not really sure yet what to do with planet packs that make small additions to other planet packs. For example my OPM Recolor and OPM Tilt.\n\nI\u0027m not sure yet if I want to load them on a different system or not... I\u0027ll have to check if creating more systems increases RAM usage.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What distance will you use between stars, what will be the minimum delta V?\n\nThe current alpha download is pretty much the distance I had in mind.\n\nEach star system will have 2e14 meters SoI, and there will not be overlaps, so the minimum distance is 4e14.\n\nProkKseema is the closest system to the Stock one, and it is ~5e14 meters away iirc.\n\nI\u0027ve tried going to Algok once and I think I needed something like 15km/s to fly by the system. and probably another 15km/s to be captured.\n\nThe problem is that Time in KSP is not infinite, once you go past ~2.5e9 seconds things start to break, you see negative numbers in the time clock of the tracking station and weird stuff like that. And also at maximun warp speed (using better time warp) the ship was barely moving.... so basically some FTL travel will be needed."},{"CreatedByName":"Tankuwi","CreatedById":146636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T10:03:17Z","Content":"What about mixing of KerbalGalaxy mod with this mod?"}]}
