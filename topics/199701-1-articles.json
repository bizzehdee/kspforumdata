That is, you are going so slow, or the air is so thin, or your angle of attack (how far away you are from your prograde marker on the navball) is so high, that your wings lose lift. Then your plane will start falling out of the sky, tumbling and turning uncontrollably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolutions: 1.) Go faster; 2.) Fly lower down where the air is thicker; 3.) Bring more wing area and control surfaces; 4.) Steer less abruptly; 5.) Bring thrust vectoring engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as mentioned, there are other possible reasons as well.

As you roll/bank the aircraft, because some of your lift is \u0027redirected\u0027 and actually causes the craft to turn, the total lift opposing weight/gravity is reduced and the craft will start to descend. This cause and effect is more pronounced as you attempt to turn quicker with greater amounts of bank angle, thus the amount of elevator one must use to counter this phenomenon increases with bank angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR? Use Q and E to roll your plane in the direction you want to turn, use S to prevent descending when doing so as well as increasing the rate of turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-19T14:48:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2021 02:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Wobbly Av8r\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mythos","CreatedById":137308,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-19T16:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the issue doesn\u0027t appear on launch but only later mid-flight, you probably need to check that your center of lift is slightly behind the center of mass, ALWAYS.
