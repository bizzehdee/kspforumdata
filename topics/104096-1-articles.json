I wear the thing every day, and enjoy it. For everything that I use it for, it\u0027s quicker than the phone, primarily because my phone starts out in my pocket, and more often than not, is also locked. It\u0027s great for email and texting triage, and handling those notifications that you want to be alerted about, but don\u0027t really need to do anything about. And navigation. And weather. And silent alarms. And, of course, checking the time. Under normal use, it easily lasts longer than 24 hours on a charge, but I haven\u0027t used a phone that routinely lasts 24 hours on a single charge, so charging it every night is perfectly fine for me, and even if I forget to charge it one night, if I have 30 minutes between the time I wake up and I have to be somewhere, it\u0027ll charge to full in that time. And to be honest, I\u0027ve also worn watches for the vast majority of my life, the last four years have been mostly an aberration.\n\nPersonally, I\u0027m glad I bought one.\n\nWould I recommend that someone buy a Moto 360 /now/? No, probably not. Even though there\u0027s been a significant price drop in the 360\u0027s, at this point, you\u0027re still an Early Adopter, and the Moto 360 was a bit underpowered back when it came out nine months ago and there\u0027s a second generation of Android Wear watches in the pipeline.

It replaced a \u0022stagnant market that was suffering from poor sales and poor management of company ip.\u0022 Basically, whereas the treo and blackberry were designed and marketed at businessmen... and hence suffering from a small market (as well as internal problems), the iphone was designed for the typical brainless consumer. Apple said \u0022BUY\u0022 and people lined up for miles to \u0022BUY.\u0022 \n\nThe netbook was really the precursor to the ipad, not the Kindle. Netbooks were laughed off the market, in all their forms, because you could only \u0022surf the web and run \u0022apps\u0022 on them.\u0022 And netbooks were getting TINY! Easy to put in a purse or a bag... but no one wanted them. Apple comes on the market and says \u0022hey, we\u0027re making a netbook... but we\u0027re removing the keyboard and removing all the periphrials, removing SD cards, removing usb, giving you a tiny amount of drive space because we\u0027re running a smear campaign against HDDs, and not giving you access to all the free software available online because you\u0027re locked into our own system\u0022 and people say \u0022OMG YES!\u0022\n\nApple has NEVER found a niche in the market. Apple MAKES niches by convincing people to buy things they do not need, by designing products, not to be the best for the job, but the best to give people a \u0022cool\u0022 feeling that does all kinds of psychology I don\u0027t understand.\n\nIt\u0027s like, how I had turned off all kinds of styling with windows to the point that it looked like Windows 9\u00225.
