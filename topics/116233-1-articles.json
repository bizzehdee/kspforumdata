I\u0027d like to see some sample meshes in one of the standard formats that can be imported into a wide variety of 3D modelling programs. There are getting to be so many different fuselage styles, and having something to match to would help. Rather than a new fuselage profile, needing so many different bits, there would be things I could build...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T10:54:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok, I downloaded the zip, it\u0027s full of py files, what do I do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T15:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how accurate this is, since I haven\u0027t tried Mk2 parts yet, but I saved this comment from another thread a while back:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk2 profile is 2.5m wide, 1.5m high, the flat side bits are 0.3m wide, and the sloped sides come up at exactly 60 degrees so they match the rotation snap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T19:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T20:47:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NecroBones\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NecroBones\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know how accurate this is, since I haven\u0027t tried Mk2 parts yet, but I saved this comment from another thread a while back:\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk2 profile is 2.5m wide, 1.5m high, the flat side bits are 0.3m wide, and the sloped sides come up at exactly 60 degrees so they match the rotation snap. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t calculate the angle, but I was able to verify the other parts of this.
