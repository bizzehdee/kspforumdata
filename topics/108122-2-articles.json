The aircraft, N104RB, first flew in 1976. On 2 October 1976, trying to set a new low-altitude 3-km speed record, Greenamyer averaged 1,010 miles per hour (1,630 km/h) at Mud Lake near Tonopah, Nevada. A tracking camera malfunction eliminated the necessary proof for the official record. On 24 October 1977 Greenamyer flew a 3 km official FAI record flight of 988.26 miles per hour (1,590.45 km/h).[73]\n\nThe F104 is a very streamlined single-engine interceptor built in the 50s, it weights around 9 tons and it\u0027s engine has a maximum thrust of ONLY 79KN.\n\nA quick dirty replica in KSP weighting 8 tons and with throttle limiting the engine thrust to just under 100kn got the Following absolute max speeds:\n\n1.0.2 aero: 265m/s\n\n![yLJyewH.png](http://i.imgur.com/yLJyewH.png)\n\n1.0 aero: 316m/s\n\n![eDEcUK4.png](http://i.imgur.com/eDEcUK4.png)\n\n**Half the 1.0 aero (0.3, 0.030 1.000)**  **356m/s**\n\n![9L6I1Ov.png](http://i.imgur.com/9L6I1Ov.png)\n\n**1600km/h, which is the speed we were aiming here is 450m/s**\n\nHowever, at the half 1.0 aero, a pod reentry from a 200km orbit was stil at mach 2 from only 2km to the ground.\n\nWell, I hope they could balance this better."},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T06:11:14Z","Content":"Mach 3 sustained at sea level... serious fun! Ferram is right in that it is the gas turbines that are the limiting factor: mass flow would make the turbine inlet temperatures go far beyond what any current or even near future turbine technology would allow. A variable bypass cycle engine could do it, but I shudder to think of the amount of fuel it would gobble (15:1 stoic to start plus burning rich... ugh!).\n\nAs for landing speeds, it\u0027s mostly wing planform and wing loading (it\u0027s more complicated than that, but nobody is really interested in every single factor) that determines landing speeds, not the type of engine. Modern jet engined fighters have high landing speeds because of their swept/delta wings (and compensate for it with flaps and slats), not because they lack propellers.\n\nIMHO, increasing drag and reducing lift all across the board isn\u0027t the solution to kludging blunt body physics, nor is \u0022fiddling with it till it feels right\u0022 because that is simply using bias to solve an engineering issue that should have been solved mathematically from the beginning. Work the system until it works, as they say.\n\nThat said, I guess it\u0027s good that they\u0027re still mulling aero over.

Heat is the limiting factor, not drag. Jet thrust is broadly proportional to dynamic pressure, so outside of heat (and excess intake drag) there isn\u0027t much difference between low and high in terms of max speeds. You need to make sure your airframe doesn\u0027t melt and your compressor doesn\u0027t melt, which means sprints speeds far higher than sustained speeds, and tighter thermal limits below 50,000ft.\n\nI think the 1st stage turbine is actually the part that is most likely to be destroyed by the heat first.

Gases are actually little individual molecules. This is true. And when the molecules are spread out far enough, we think of gases in that way. Instead of density and pressure, we talk about mean free path.\n\nWhen a spacecraft is in the upper atmosphere, it\u0027s generally more appropriate to talk about mean free path. Essentially, you think of the atmosphere as a bunch of little particles bouncing off the ship.\n\nBut lower in the atmosphere, like where you fly planes, we don\u0027t really think of the atmosphere as being a bunch of little particles. We think of it as being a fluid.\n\nSo yeah, while what you say is true about denser air having more molecules that bounce off each other and also the airplane, aero engineers don\u0027t think of it that way. We think of it as a mathematical construct: a potential field with emergent properties like density, pressure, viscosity, vorticity, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T11:31:17Z","Content":"There was a Squadcast?
