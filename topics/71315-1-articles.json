In that three year period there has been a lot of change in the computer market place. Now I see all these cheapo AMD this and that and I have no idea what is powerful or what is just cheap and power efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo does anyone have any advice on what I should look for and what is minimum nowadays for a decent gaming experience? Are these new cheap cpus good enough or do I need to go second hand?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for the record I used to have an AMD 6400\u002B CPU and a 9600GT graphics card and that level of power is what I would call that minimum level only I want to get to (lets call that the design benchmark). So I am wondering if a second hand i5 and something around a 9800GT level would hold me until I can upgrade later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?

I also had to delay the process for personal reasons and came home in August 2013. I would recommend Newegg for online shopping (Amazon is good as well), or a local PC store. I am lucky to have a Micro Center nearby and I can say it\u0027s a good store. Also get Windows 8.1 when you can, don\u0027t go for 7. It\u0027s a LOT faster on boot-up and various other processes. AMD processors are very good and are not \u0022cheap\u0022 as in being poorly made; they\u0027re quite far from it. I have the FX-8350 and I will say it\u0027s quite a good bargain but for your needs a FX-6300 (FX-6350 is good too, but a bit more expensive for not much of an upgrade) would work quite well. Graphics cards, ask yourself this: would you like to record videos and get Advanced PhysX which is VERY uncommon on games currently, or spend a lot less for almost equal performance? If you\u0027d like the former, go for an Nvidia -- the GTX 760 is quite a good deal, and should run most games 1080p on Ultra settings. For AMD cards, they are a better value, and an R7 265 is a good value -- though the R9 270X is a very good value so go for that if you\u0027re able to. It competes directly with the GTX 760. Certain brands of GPUs for the two chip makers (AMD and Nvidia) are cheaper, but if price doens\u0027t matter EVGA is good for Nvidia and Sapphire is quite good for AMD. You can never go wrong with an ASUS card, either. Make sure your GPU has at least 2GB of \u003Cem\u003EGDDR5\u003C/em\u003E memory, that\u0027s important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor RAM, 8GB is good for gaming and is the minimum if you want a good experience. Most RAM works pretty similar, I have Crucial Ballistix Sport IIRC. Corsair is highly regarded but might be expensive. Motherboards, go for either an ASUS or Gigabyte or MSI. They\u0027re good, and MAKE SURE IT MATCHES THE CPU SOCKET! I\u0027m sure you know this already, though. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to conclude, PLEASE go for the AMD chip. They\u0027re much cheaper and give more than enough performance for gaming. For your needs I recommend the FX-6300. I\u0027ll find a good motherboard, too. model name below. If building the PC is hard for you, you can pay money to the local PC shops to build it for you (that\u0027s what I did).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotherboard model name: MSI 970A-G46 ATX AM3\u002B Motherboard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet it if you\u0027re going for the FX-6300! MSI makes real high-quality boards for the price. I have a Gigabyte 970A-UD3 if you\u0027re curious, it\u0027s quite good too but about $30 more expensive. They\u0027re the same chipset, too. So the MSI might be better for you. Also below if you\u0027re curious, my PC specs.
