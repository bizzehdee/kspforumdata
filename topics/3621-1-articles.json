In game it acts like the collision mesh is shifted over to the left of the actual model, so when you go to surface attach a part, it end up either floating in the air or inside the mesh. I\\\u0027ve never had this problem before. No matter where I tell the nodes to go they seem to be stuck in the middle and slightly forward of the model as well.

The part loader will find the collision mesh and move it to a different place in the hierarchy, so if it is parented to another object, it\\\u0027s possible it could be getting shifted at load time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are just some ideas off the top of my head.

Your program looks like it has the nasty habit of appending _PIVOT to the end of all models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond of all, I think Harv was on the right track. Your model is off-center. That, however, is only the beginning of the problem. I tried setting the models back to the scene origin... turns out, both your parts are off-origin by default, even when all the translation parameters are at 0. Even worse, they\\\u0027re not even aligned; as it turns out, your collider mesh is, by default... halfway left and almost fully behind your physical model. I\\\u0027m not quite sure how to fix this... But at least now you know the problem. Try to make your collision mesh meet your physical model. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"oniontrain","CreatedById":2465,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-14T16:17:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies, I\\\u0027m using 3dsmax 8.

Also setting the scale to 1 instead of .1 helped. It\\\u0027s still not perfectly on target though. It\\\u0027s close enough I guess, if anyone else wants to try to make any sense of it, it\\\u0027s the same download as linked in the OP. Thanks for the help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
