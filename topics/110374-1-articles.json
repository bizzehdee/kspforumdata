While this isn\u0027t exactly a space shuttle, at least they\u0027re working towards it. If the program goes as planned, they\u0027ll develop a low cost shuttle program, which does have some exciting potential."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:49:57Z","Content":"Coast Guard to the rescue.

Assuming it has enough room for humans to move about inside - not including a payload bay - I find it unlikely to have an average density over 1. Maybe they plan to blow their hatches after soft landing. Still seems like a really odd choice. How are they going to know how well their heat tiles work if they don\u0027t visually inspect them?"},{"CreatedByName":"Wesreidau","CreatedById":75430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:32:13Z","Content":"Somehow I doubt it will be airtight after smacking the ocean in a simulated landing glide path."},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T21:54:48Z","Content":"Well I assume \u0022soft landing\u0022 means in a potentially recoverable state.

I for one have no qualms about welcoming the new mini-shuttle prototype well, the Indians have had indigenous space launch capability up to GTO for quite some time, and this new prototype of a re-usable vehicle appears to be completely indigenous, this is an accomplishment for the Indian aerospace industry. \n\nI see no reason to mock the sub-orbital test - after all, we all do sub-orbital tests in KSP for aerodynamic proving before risking real payloads on the vehicle, right?\n\nRemember, this is a nation that has the chutzpah to buy Russian high tech military aircraft and develop their own aerospace industry to support them. They also fly some well known Western high end aircraft like the C-17 Globemaster III too."},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T23:16:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Why do you think that?
