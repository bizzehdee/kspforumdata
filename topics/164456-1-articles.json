I was wondering if you guys could develop a way to change the focus from just the main part of the ship to other parts of the ship. For example, I have a payload of a lander that is attached to my main ship until it is decoupled, and then reattached to the main ship via docking. I would like to be able to focus on the lander in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E without having to change the entire setup in order to find my COG on my lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderSmith","CreatedById":102438,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-16T09:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way to get around this is fairly simple. For something like what you\u0027re describing, simply change the root part (using the gizmos or the \u00224\u0022 button) to be a part of your lander. Next, detach all of the bits that aren\u0027t part of your lander and just put them aside for the moment. Sort out all of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, reattach the parts, and change the root part back to what it was originally.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the centre of thrust, do the same as before, and if there are any engines that won\u0027t be firing at any time (such as, say, the main engines of a realistic space shuttle once it\u0027s in orbit), simply set their thrust limiter to be 0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this helps.
