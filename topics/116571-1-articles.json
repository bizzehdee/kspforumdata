And quite a few Kerbin surveys.\n\nYup, the tourists ones are dull - but with that I just concentrated on building the most economical joy-ride vehicle I could, while I racked up the missions to pay for my science programme. It was a bit grindy, agreed.\n\nThe surface survey ones are too boring for words.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T17:08:28Z","Content":"Some of the surface survey ones are flat out dangerous...had one where I was supposed to do a spot above 17,000, a spot below 16,000 and a spot on the surface. No problem, right? The spot on the surface was in the middle of the damn ocean...no matter how many times I tried, I couldn\u0027t ditch intact. Wound up cancelling that mission...\n\nWhich I suppose brings up a point: those missions where you get some funding prior to finishing the contract? You shouldn\u0027t hesitate to cancel them when you get to the more challenging bits if and only if A) you don\u0027t feel like doing them and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) you\u0027ll still make a profit on the contract even if you cancel it. You might lose some rep, but rep\u0027s pretty easy to earn. Something to consider the first time one of your tourists decides they want to go sun-diving.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t knock tourist missions too much - they\u0027re good money, especially if you can start reducing costs by using reusable craft (read: build ferry craft, and start using spaceplanes to bring up fuel/more tourists). Tourism missions have largely funded the full KSP upgrades in my own space program.\n\nSurvey missions...yeah, those are dull as hell. Good way to pass a quiet Sunday afternoon, though."},{"CreatedByName":"HappyAngryCatfish","CreatedById":148600,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T17:37:31Z","Content":"Are the surface surveys basically made for planes?

Because plane flying seems to basically flat out suck for me.\n\nThe ones on Kerbin pretty much are; though in theory you could build a rocket to do the job, getting it to the point where you need it at the speed at which it needs to be going is much trickier in a rocket than in a plane. And hitting more than one waypoint at a time also adds to the difficulty.\n\nPlanes aren\u0027t atrociously difficult to get used to once you know what you\u0027re doing, and if you get to the point where you can use them well they can save you thousands and bump up your profit margins significantly. Had one in 0.90 that was able to take up a Mun lander and bring it back - that Mun mission cost a whopping \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13000, the price of fuel...looked like total crap but it did the job."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T22:20:31Z","Content":"I tend to combine the tourist missions with either station or mining contracts these days (or both).
