This plane is basically a cockpit, fuselage, a few wing parts, and 4 turbo ramjets clipped into each other. After testing its limits in the upper atmosphere, I decided to play around closer to sea level (note that I had the max temp, no crash damage, and unbreakable joints cheats enabled). Under a few km, I reached speeds around 1700m/s. At this point, I quickly used 4x physics warp. This sent my craft into an escape trajectory of the Kerbol\u00A0system at a speed of over \u003Cstrong\u003E500,000,000,000m/s\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003E(\u003Cem\u003Eover 1000x the speed of light!\u003C/em\u003E) and altitudes above the sun exceeding 1000 Petameters (1000 quintillion meters!!!) (over 1 exemeter = 1E\u002B18m)!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon exiting to the space center, I found that the Space Center screen was severely distorted, producing unusual building placement \u0026amp; zooms and terrain issues at various camera angles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWanting to do this again, I (randomly clicked around) to enter the Space Plane Hanger and repeat. Well, i did the same procedure and got essentially the same results, this time reaching speeds in excess of, well, I don\u0027t really know, because the Kraken had already been summoned! This time upon exiting to the Space Center, the title screen contained absolutely nothing but stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was able to reproduce these results a few times over, and will continue to play with this.
