In saves made in 1.1 the issue happens on long bases where \u0022length\u0022 is a distance between two most distant points of the base. A workaround is not attaching all the pylons to the ground. Attach only one pylon and build the base around it. It still can break but the probability will be significantly less.

Do you use DRE (Deadly reenter) mod? If not, please, try to figure out which mod makes the troubles. Most probable offender is a mod that affects stock parts behavior (e.g. DRE).\n\u003E \n\nOk I got it! The culprit is \u0022Stock bug Fix Modules \u0026 Stockplus\u0022\n\nProblem is present when all Stockplus options are disabled.\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/87737-ksp-v112-stock-bug-fix-modules-release-v112b1-9-may-16/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nFunnily enough I also have KSP Interstellar extended and can confirm @Rob2222 \u0027s point above, same issue with solar panels relating to KSP-IE, independent of the Stockbug fix parachute issue! Worth noting that KSP-IE comes bundled with tweakscale, I haven\u0027t dissected this out.\n\nHow is best to proceed, should I shift this over into the threads for the respective mods?"},{"CreatedByName":"IgorZ","CreatedById":155445,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T01:26:22Z","Content":"[@Rob2222](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/102318-rob2222/) [@Bishop149](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/82368-bishop149/)\n\nThanks, guys. It\u0027s clear now that \u0022Stock bug Fix Modules \u0026 Stockplus\u0022 is the problem. I\u0027ll check it. It\u0027s unlikely the problem can be fixed by the mod\u0027s author. Sometimes new modules added via ModuleManager are not in the right state for the KIS to use. I don\u0027t have enough evidences to blame anyone so, just trying to workaround it on KIS side (you\u0027ll be surprised to know how many workarounds and hack were implemented till now).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 38 minutes ago, cyberpunkdreams said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just another two pennies on recent bugs -- uninstalled stock bug fix and I couldn\u0027t put ordinary items into storage.

It should catch all the possible cases.\n- Logging is improved. The module that fails to cooperate with KIS will now be logged.\n- If bad module cannot be fixed it\u0027s removed from the part with an error message thrown into logs. Please, check the logs even if you think everything is working fine. There must be no errors from KIS. There **will** be warnings but if they start from word \u0022*WORKAROUND*\u0022 then you\u0027re OK.\n\nOn my test setup it works fine. At least in the editor and on the launch pad.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-08T06:08:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2016 06:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by IgorZ**"}]}
