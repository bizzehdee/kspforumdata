What\u0027s bugging me with this tech tree and has bugged with the stock one is that first 2.5m engines and tanks appear in two separate nodes in the same tier. That does not make sense - the tanks must be available by the moment one unlocks the engine size.

The earlier tiers rather follow the approach \u0022from generic to specialized\u0022, which, to my taste, is more logical. In that respect, I think there should be more distinction between booster / sustainer / upper stage tech, just as it is for Reliant -\u0026gt; Swivel -\u0026gt; Terrier progress. Following the same logic, I\u0027d suggest to unlock 2.5m tanks in the order 16 -\u0026gt; 32 -\u0026gt; 8 \u0026amp; 64 (really, by the time a player gets to 2.5m tech 30 parts per vessel are unlikely to be a limitation, and that seems to be the only reason to not give properly-sized tanks right from the start), and the engines in the order Skipper -\u0026gt; Mainsail \u0026amp; Twin Boar in one node \u002B Poodle in another one -\u0026gt; Wolfhound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpinkAkron","CreatedById":134807,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-09T23:53:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/71012-theonegalen/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002271012\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/71012-theonegalen/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@theonegalen\u003C/a\u003E, do you mind if I adapt and include some of your UBM extensions with\u00A0this mod?\u00A0 I have zero experience with the\u00A0aircraft mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpinkAkron","CreatedById":134807,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-10T00:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/172084-pand5461/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022172084\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/172084-pand5461/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pand5461\u003C/a\u003E, here\u0027s my rationale for placing parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, I assume if you have the technical ability to make\u00A0a part, it follows\u00A0that\u00A0you should also have the ability to make a larger or smaller version of that part, barring any evident technical limitations.

There is no reason why you should not be able to make a short tank of larger diameter if you are able to make a tall tank of a smaller diameter, assuming similar volumes.\u00A0 Whether you are able to build an engine of that size is not relevant.\u00A0 Conversely, just because you have the ability\u00A0to build a larger\u00A0engine, it does not necessarily follow that you have the know-how to build the larger diameter tank that goes with it.\u00A0\u00A0They are two separate technologies, which it why I split them into two different paths.\u00A0 \u00A0There should not be any tanks in two nodes on the same tier.\u00A0 If there is, that\u0027s a mistake on my part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy plan is that the two paths should generally line up, with short tanks often being available at a lower tech than the associated engine.\u00A0 I\u0027ve recently decided that I\u0027d like the starting parts to be .625m so that\u0027s going to shift everything up the tree a tier or two.\u00A0 \u00A0I haven\u0027t really thought too much about how engines\u00A0should be arranged other than bigger is higher up.\u00A0 I appreciate your input on that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-10T00:39:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2019 12:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by SpinkAkron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theonegalen","CreatedById":71012,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-10T05:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223519270\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181153\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221547078013\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022134807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpinkAkron\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, SpinkAkron said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/71012-theonegalen/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002271012\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/71012-theonegalen/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@theonegalen\u003C/a\u003E, do you mind if I adapt and include some of your UBM extensions with\u00A0this mod?\u00A0 I have zero experience with the\u00A0aircraft mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou certainly can, although I\u00A0was hoping to adapt them myself, if that\u0027s all right with you.

The rationale I had in mind is a bit different. From the gameplay prospective, a stack of small tanks is 100% equivalent to a large tank, which is not the case in real life. Therefore, giving only the FL-T100 in Stock Tier 2 has the sole reason of making a decent rocket take most of the 30 part limitation of Level 1 editors. Historically, there hardly was a case when an engine has been developed and the tanks of \u0022appropriate size\u0022 for it were technologically unavailable. Moreover, at later stages in the game, giving only the largest tank of a new size may be a bigger limitation to the gameplay, as only a few engines would be available to take off with it, fine-grained control of tank volume is impossible (one can change fuel levels, but that worsens wet/dry mass ratio).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe seem to agree on a bigger problem, however, that some stock nodes have no use on their own.
