I see some tech tree mods, but my thinking was more how it works in general. I\u0027m not thinking about a drastic overhaul, but just adding some logical steps between: Take look at magic goo -\u0026gt; unlock node - acquire new parts which have nothing to do with magic goo -\u0026gt; profit. It\u0027s like somehow using your sword alot makes you a better pickpocket, if you follow me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m suggesting adding specific science experiment milestones to unlock specific nodes. Like maybe temperature and pressure measurements before you can unlock a more advanced jet engine. But that\u0027s not all, you could only unlock a prototype of that engine until you put x amount of time in with said prototype. Those prototypes might be more inefficient and/or more prone to malfunctions that the final part. You wouldn\u0027t even have to create adding any additional parts models. Also, it could be completely, or almost so, agnostic of parts packs and so on. An engine has these particular prototype characteristics, an solar panel this other set. Add in the possibility of failures and malfunctions, this would also give the little green engineers more to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, ultimately, you\u0027d want to somehow incorporate something like \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57416-dmagic/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257416\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/57416-dmagic/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@DMagic\u003C/a\u003E fantastic science pack or the TST chem cam and telescopes from \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/114736-jplrepo/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022114736\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/114736-jplrepo/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@JPLRepo\u003C/a\u003E, or the available experiments to unlock nodes might get a little repetitive.

Don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve played stellaris, but they have 3 separate resarch trees, one is like high-tech stuff, one is engineering, and one is biological research. And I feel like KSP could have a couple areas like \u0022atmospheric research\u0022 which would lead to upgrades in wings, air breathing engines, fuselages, fairings, etc. \u0022space research\u0022 which leads to upgrades in fuels, engines, solar panels, electricity generation, etc. and then maybe \u0022Celestial body research\u0022 which leads to advances in landing gear, habitation modules, long range space exploration (nuclear engines), etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the way you would do research would be following applicable contracts in those types of situations. So maybe flying a plane and landing it to the island airport would advance that section, and sending a probe outside the atmosphere would advance the space research.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd many parts would require a certain level of multiple nodes, for example the RAPIER engine would require an advanced level of tech in atmospheric, and also an advanced amount of tech in space research as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dunno. I would much rather have parts unlocked contractually than through spending science points. Though I think ACTUAL science points could be used to upgrade parts. Like making parachutes and control wings for rockets cheaper, or lighter, or things like that. This is why I love Kerbal R\u0026amp;D mod, because it gives science points a value beyond just unlocking parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd unlocking parts could be done through test contracts with sub-normal test parts. Like maybe to unlock the swivel, you first have to use a crappy version of the swivel to get to space, and then that unlocks the regular part from then on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-02T17:22:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2016 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbonaut257\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DChurchill","CreatedById":60282,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T17:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy thinking is that it would take specific science to unlock a node, then the parts in that node would then become prototypes. The idea of levels of specific types of science being required to unlock a node would fit, too, I suppose, but it might leave out the idea that you have to go get some specific science related to what you want to unlock. Like I already have level 5 in x and y so that means I get to unlock the Rapier without doing anything specific for the rapier node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI \u003Cu\u003Ethink\u003C/u\u003E you could do this as an addon to the existing way the whole tech tree works, without the need to add a whole new mechanic of different science types. I don\u0027t know thee guts of how it actually works, other than paying to flip a locked bit on a node with generic science points, so my logic might be inherently flawed. But I\u0027m thinking you might be able to add a list of acceptable science experiments that could unlock that node. Like the temperature and pressure experiments to unlock the jet engine. You\u0027d need a file to keep track of that progress but whatever nodes that are still locked get a completed science experiment in their list of acceptable science, then the gauge gets that much closer to full. When it fills up, then it\u0027s considered unlocked, instead of just using generic science to unlock it. And until the required precursor nodes are unlocked, science will not accumulate for that node. So there\u0027s always a need for ongoing specific science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce it unlocks, then the engineers take over with the prototypes. Once that part gets enough in flight testing, the bugs are considered worked out and it changes from prototype to operational. At that point it\u0027s just like it normally would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that writing some sort of failure code might be the sticking point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-02T18:01:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2016 06:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DChurchill\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-03T00:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw a very similar suggestion a few months ago - don\u0027t have the link.
