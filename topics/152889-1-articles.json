This is because engines run on air and air thins, as you climb you are essentially loosing the ability to climb faster and eventually. A B777 can without retooling operate to about 48000 feet but without\u00A0 a load, the wings can be modified to fly at a lower IAS (boeing design the plane with a short runway takeoff capability which affords better relative lift a lower airspeeds at the cost of its glide ratio relative to the 747). So it is possible to get some commercial heavies at sub-mach speeds. IIRC at 45,000 feet the coffin corner IAS is something like 220 kts and at FL480 it would be like 190 kts, which puts you in the flap zone with non-fuel loadings. So these speeds (dynamic pressure along the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E) are not too bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheoretically, if we grant horizontal flight, you could push up to maybe 55,000 feet (17km ,at sub Mach speed, still have enough air flow on the air control surfaces) This is going to take away 90% of the atmospheric drag that kills the climb of smaller rockets. The problem is marginal utility of gain. At 30,000 feet 2/3rds of the atmosphere is out of your way. If you launch vertically on Mount Everest by the\u00A0 altitude in vertical flight were Mach is acheived, its not really worth worrying about because static air pressure is so low. If you then go to say 45,000 feet only 1/6th of the atmosphere remains above. Whats the point in going the additional 10,000 feet to gain a .05 ATM reduction when you have allready reduced the ATM by 0.8333. If you are traveling at .0833 Mach, the plane releases and separates the rocket slows down it also needs to turn so that by the time it reaches 55,000 it will probably just be crossing the sound barrier. The marginal utility of gain on altitude starts to drop at 10 kM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made this point a while back, for smaller rockets where drag really clobbers their ability to reach space. The perfect place to launch is between 3000 and 6000 meter elevation on an equitorial mountain (say in Ecuador). The idea here is that you would have less to slow down at maxQ because maxQ would be at a higher velocity at a higher elevation. Because you have less slow down your rocket operates at its optimal reducing the time and therefore gravities effect. While you gain a little advantage in altitude, the major advantage comes from the reduction of drag losses between 0.8 and 1.3 Mach and remedial measures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-17T03:46:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the things I like about KSP is that it gets a lot of like-minded people discussing these technical details. \u00A0Great input and reference, guys!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
