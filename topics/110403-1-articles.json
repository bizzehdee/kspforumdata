Because the two trucks were similar in design and needed matching heights, I had been loading the first truck via the new \u0022merge\u0022 button on the load craft menu in previous KSP sessions. This time when the truck appeared in the SPH it broke between parts, with one half attaching automatically to the current vehicle and the other half floating on the other end of the SPH but solid like it was the craft I was working on.\n\nLong story short, I eventually cleared the editor and finished work only to find out I couldn\u0027t launch it because \u0022craft size unknown\u0022 and something about reloading the craft in the SPH so the Kerbal engineers could calculate the size. Well obviously I tried that but it did not work. Reloaded the game, no-go; did it again, still no-go. Tried opening it in the VAB... still no luck.\n\nAngry (I\u0027ve spent a lot of time on this) I remade the vehicle using the one good truck I had left by saving it as a new craft and reworking it. But I still need to do all the testing over again because it\u0027s not quite as good as the previous version I had, a few tweaks here and there are needed for stability and handling.\n\nWhat bothers me is that I had just loaded KSP and had just started working on it again when this happened. It\u0027s not like I had the game running for hours. This issue... is it a bug of KSP or something to do with a hardware glitch (such as hd)? I\u0027ve not encountered this before and I have spent A LOT of hours in the VAB/SPH. Did I do something to trigger this?"}]}
