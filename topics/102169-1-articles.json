Up until now, the tech tree was hardcoded into the research and development UI prefab. This was changed now, and tech tree is now completely loaded from a cfg file. This means modifying the tech tree to add, rename, revise the hierarchy between nodes and all that stuff is now easily within reach of modders, not to mention making our own lives a whole lot easier as well. But not only that; the path to this cfg file is saved along with the game parameters inside the save file, which means each game can have its own tech tree definition. This is all theoretical of course; We plan to implement just one tech tree for stock games, but more mod support has never been a bad thing has it?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the subject of revising the tech tree\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s layout, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve done a fair amount of brain-bashing here in a vain attempt to figure out what nodes should unlock which parts and when\u2026 However, this is highly dependent on what the contracts system will ask of you, and because that is changing in this update as well, we simply can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t tell what parts are gonna be most needed throughout the game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s progression, not just now at least. So we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had an idea to make that task easier.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Instead of arbitrarily deciding on a new tech tree layout, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to do this in a more \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153scientific\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 way. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve created a new version of the tech tree which features absolutely no dependencies between nodes. This means all notes are researchable from the start. Also, all nodes have the exact same cost. This tech tree will be included on the QA builds, and during testing, we will ask the testers to note down the order in which they went on unlocking the nodes. From that data, we should be able to run some statistical analysis to help us determine which parts are needed first, and how we should better organize the tech tree. This process can also be repeated multiple times, to refine the tech tree layout more and more. We hope that at the very least, this method will give us more accurate insights than just relying on anecdotal feedback.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now, this week I sat down to get the female Kerbals working in the game. Their EVA models are working nicely now, with full animations, as are their internal meshes. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve set up new collections of names and syllables for the crew name generator, so we should have a couple thousand possible female names. Putting those together from syllable combinations worked just as well for female names as it did for male ones, which means you can probably also expect the same level of lunacy in some of the names it comes up with.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Alex (aLeXmOrA): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been doing more accounting work than dev work. There are some issues I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m helping with about payments, invoices and that kind of stuff. Of course, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still working on the license system, but for now I had to put that aside and focus in some managment.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Marco (Samssonart): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;That Duna tutorial is turning out more complicated than I thought, there are many things that can go wrong and screw up the whole trajectory, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m trying to find a way to make it not so error prone, but also not fall into hand-holding the player\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s every move, if it were so they might as well just watch a video tutorial, there has to be some action from the player to ensure they learn the concept and can extrapolate it and incorporate it to their playing.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Daniel (danRosas): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;Doing side quests while working the main plot, the release animation.

Side quests involve the usual, graphics, things for Maxmaps, and so forth. Fortunately I jus read that everything that I worked upon the female kerbals is working good. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see what happens on QA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Jim (Romfarer): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;The Engineer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Report App is finally through QA and ready to be merged into develop.

I want to thank everyone for their feedback as they have given us a lot to think about, and we will hopefully have something to share later this week.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On regular job stuff, organizing our launch plan so far has proven to be an exercise in plate spinning that would make a frisbee competition look tame by comparison. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Ted (Ted):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a grand week of QA. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure if I mentioned it previously, but we set up a second deployment channel for QA on Steam, so we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re now able to QA two branches at the same time. Understandably, this has really sped up things in the QA department and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re raring through the features. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had quite a number of features through QA this past week though. Firstly we had Jim\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Engineer App back for a second round to ensure all issues were fixed with it and thankfully they were expertly patched up! We then moved on to QAing the develop branch, which is our central QA branch that everything merges into - this was to ensure nothing is too broken by the feature merging. Meanwhile in the other QA channel, we began testing of Arsonide\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s additions for 1.0 - which are numerous and very exciting. Mainly, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re a rebalancing of the starter contracts that players receive as well as a very fine-toothed comb of the economics of KSP, with balancing applied where necessary.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Towards the latter end of the week, we began QA of Mike\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Aero-related changes which included some really excellent refactoring and extension of the systems he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s already done. QA is still proceeding on that and there are far too many changes in it to even begin talking about, but rest assured they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re all great! Additionally, that branch also contained a tentative implementation of DDS formatted textures for KSP, so far cutting the initial asset loading of KSP by 1/3rd if not more in some cases.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Lastly, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been going over our internal documentation for 1.0 and ensuring that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s both accurate and reliable for current and future use.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Kasper (KasperVld): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on getting a plan together on how we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to move forward with video makers and live streamers. Additionally I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working with KSPTV people to finish up an overhaul on that end. Finally I accidentally made Windows uninstall all programs on my computer so I had to spend a fair few hours getting that back up and running: oops! On the bright side everything runs nice and fast again.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T22:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf each save loads the tech tree from a single cfg file, then how does that affect mods which often rely on ModuleManager patches to modify stock behavior?
