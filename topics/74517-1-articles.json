Namely, that if you have an object at the same orbital orbit but in a different phase of the orbit that blow up, it\u0027s NOT magically going to start moving independent of its orbital resonance with other objects in the same phase, and strike them every 90 minutes (like in the film gravity), Instead, the shrapnel spread out is going to enter a number of slightly-different orbits that would take days, months, or even \u003Cstrong\u003Eyears\u003C/strong\u003E to phase into position with another object in the same orbit- such as the ISS- giving astronauts there plenty of time to escape before any debris would reach them...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest thought-example is to imagine two objects in KSP in circular 100 km x 100 km orbits, on *opposite* sides of Kerbin from each other at all times. What happens if you blow one up? It doesn\u0027t magically start moving around that orbital altitude at twice the speed- instead it would take a LONG time for any of the resulting elliptical or inclined debris orbits to phase into position with and hit the object on the other side of the orbit from the first...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T23:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIll just quote myself from the last time we had this discussion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI really don\u0027t understand why people constantly feel the need to constantly bash this movie on its physics accuracy.
