After I looked that up I decided to do it for the rest as well. I\u0027ve limited myself to probes that were active, so no derelicts (because that would make it continuous after the first orbiter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESun\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn December 16, 1965 the US launched Pioneer 6 into a heliocentric orbit. The long life of the Pioneer solar probe bridged the gap to more recent solar observatories. At the moment there are about half a dozen probes in an orbit around the Sun (and a few probes en route to planets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMercury\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince MESSENGER\u0027s orbital insertion around Mercury on March 18, 2011 we\u0027ve had something around Mercury continuously.
