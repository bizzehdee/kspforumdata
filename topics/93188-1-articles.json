The target is 6000 because Minmus is tiny, which gives you a window of 180 meters! (I said they were touchy, right?) Your periapsis is close, but it\u0027s about 500 meters off. You\u0027ll need to do a microburn at your apoapsis to get this matched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking in the future, instead of matching periapsis, I might match a percent of the semi major axis or something.
