I followed your advice and created a new folder in C:\\ as C:\\Games and then extracted KSP there. I first started the game without the Launcher, thinking that maybe the Patcher it downloads may have been problematic. Both the KSP.exe alone and using the Launcher work now. I always used my User folder; I wonder why it is not working now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this thread can now probably be marked as Solved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. The SAS jittering is still there. I know that Squad fixed SAS jitter awhile ago, but I think that they need to re-do it for the vector-based (prograde, antinormal, etc.) SAS options, at least for small ships. The Roll control really seems susceptible to this jitter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T17:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFantastic!
