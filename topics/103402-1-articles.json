I re-downloaded the 32-bit Windows version of KSP from Squad and tried to load without any mods at all. Each time I try to load the game, it seems to crash at the same point. I\u0027ve tried to use the lowest settings possible by using the launcher.\n\nHere is a link to output\\_log.txt:\n\n[http://pastebin.com/G3Bwmnrv](http://pastebin.com/G3Bwmnrv)\n\nHere is a link to error.log\n\n[http://pastebin.com/bV602Tnc](http://pastebin.com/bV602Tnc)\n\nHere is a link to my configuration file (settings.cfg)\n\n[http://pastebin.com/aekQLn02](http://pastebin.com/aekQLn02)\n\nHere is report.ini\n\n[http://pastebin.com/vgycgQea](http://pastebin.com/vgycgQea)\n\nI\u0027ve noticed that some other users have been reporting similar crashes recently. I used to be able to run KSP (version 0.90), even with several mods, with little difficulty. Perhaps there is something in a new update which is causing this problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T17:39:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 05:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**\n  \nadded that previous version I used was 0.90 as well"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T22:50:47Z","Content":"Try installing KSP to a location such as C:\\Games\\KSP, and avoid places like your user-specific directory. Also, avoid the desktop and \u0022Program Files.\u0022 For some people, installing to these locations causes loading problems. You\u0027ll need to either install fresh from the .zip, or copy \u0026 paste your KSP directory. *Do not move* the folder, because sometimes windows tries to help you out.\n\nAs you said, there seems to be several people suffering from this problem. I\u0027m hoping that installing it to a different location will fix the problem for you...\n\nv0.90 hasn\u0027t been updated since release. So there shouldn\u0027t be anything \u0022new\u0022 in it as compared to previously downloaded v0.90.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-04T23:03:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2015 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"bv1","CreatedById":127982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T05:51:31Z","Content":"Thanks, Claw. I followed your advice and created a new folder in C:\\ as C:\\Games and then extracted KSP there. I first started the game without the Launcher, thinking that maybe the Patcher it downloads may have been problematic. Both the KSP.exe alone and using the Launcher work now. I always used my User folder; I wonder why it is not working now.\n\nAnyway, this thread can now probably be marked as Solved.\n\nP.S. The SAS jittering is still there. I know that Squad fixed SAS jitter awhile ago, but I think that they need to re-do it for the vector-based (prograde, antinormal, etc.) SAS options, at least for small ships. The Roll control really seems susceptible to this jitter."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T17:36:57Z","Content":"Fantastic! I am glad to hear that you got it working. And I have no idea why it sometimes works fine, and other times doesn\u0027t load in those locations. It is very strange how finicky it can be there.\n\nYes, the Pilot SAS modes aren\u0027t tweaked very well. They have problems with craft that have too much control authority, which is pretty common with small craft.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
