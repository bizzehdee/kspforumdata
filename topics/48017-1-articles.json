It occurs when I install so many mods that I get bored with the game and remove all of the mods and start over again, however, it is not the same. I experience this both in KSP and Minecraft. I likened this to a singularity because the number of mods increases and increases and then collapses in on itself as the number of mods plummets. Does anyone else have this problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T13:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really.

At that point i had chose the bear option which was to delete mods until it would work which it did (except for the null spaced stock parts) until one messed up mod prevented me from playing KSP until the release of .21. since then i have started downloading mods responsibly and learned many solutions for mod stuff in the process. now i have around 35 mods installed onto a laptop that can barely play minecraft and is trying to learn how to make mods with blender although the UV mapping is very difficult for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T03:10:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my 2-bits...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience is the in thing right - I mean ya V22 ok so now we have players finding the fastest way to eat up a skill tree and basically not make it a \u0027fun\u0027 game but a \u0027challenge\u0027 game to see who can build the biggest; who can get to ooloo first on -1 parts; I agree these avenues for gaming are nice; for those who play that way; you wonder why you call this a singularity thing with MODS; you go back to Vanilla for the \u0027challenges\u0027...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont think it is about challenge as much as it is about fun; there are many aspects of fun in gaming; this game in particular seems to have many aspects as described above, but in my opinion, when one adds using time warp to speed things up; well to me the fun is lost; it is like flying over a hurricane instead of riding the waves; which I wouldnt think would be too boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a slooooow cat; slow player; seems to like to start over alot; luvs to stream and blow up computers in the process; has to play guitar an jam or goes crazy...I have developed a style that is slow but not so slow as to be too far behind altho it probly seem like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain thing is I roleplay my Kerbals and much more; ARGs etc check that out in my Fansites pages.

There have been some improvements in memory usage across various mods that let me run NovaPunch, KW Rocketry, B9, and a host of other mods while keeping my RAM usage during load around ~2.6GB. This has greatly improved stability. Previously I\u0027d be sitting at 2.9GB right after KSP loaded and that seemed very unstable during gameplay.

With the exception of RemoteTech most of what I use is just parts. If I want to build stock only it is pretty easy to do. I do find things like Editor Extensions, Design Assist, and Subassembly Manager essential to my enjoyment. Being able to toggle symmetry mode or pull up a strut, fuel line, or launch support without having to dig through the part tabs is a great help. I\u0027ve also welded a few common part configurations together to make my construction go faster (like a bare rover chassis).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
