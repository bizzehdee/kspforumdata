[@Nefrums](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145422-nefrums/), you have completed the Jool 5 Challenge on Level 1 with a low mass of 12.51 tons!  Great entry and improvement on your previous entry in 1.0.5.  You and the other low-mass contenders really have the design down to a science.  I\u0027m tempted to try it with a tiny LFO Vall lander instead of ions, which would save on batteries and maybe get away with just one ion engine.  That may need more fuel for the Rapier to circularize though.\n\u003E \n\nThanks!\n\nI have tried a tiny LF lander for val, but the problem with that is that it get heavier than using the same ion lander for all the small moons.

Have a tug to bring your tylo lander to low tylo orbit and leave your mothership in a high eliptic orbit.   As going from high to low tylo orbit is ~800dV.
