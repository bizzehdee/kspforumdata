The answer was less \u0022submarine\u0022 and more \u0022spinning cities in space\u0022. A few different designs were proposed, the chief ones being:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Stanford Torus:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA large, doughnut-shaped station about 1.6 km across, that would rotate at 1 RPM to produce 1G at the edges of the ring. Estimated populations ranged from anywhere between 10 thousand and 100 thousand (based on design housing density - densities ranged from those of an urban suburb to those of a city core). It would also have agricultural and manufacturing sectors, using materials imported from the Moon. In the most optimistic scenarios, it was capable of self-replicating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Stanford_torus_external_view_by_Don_Davis_AC76-0525.jpg/615px-Stanford_torus_external_view_by_Don_Davis_AC76-0525.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022615px-Stanford_torus_external_view_by_Don_Davis_AC76-0525.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Bernal Sphere:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA spherical station, about 16 km in diameter. It would also rotate to produce 1G along the equator of the sphere, with less as one got closer to the poles. Estimated population was anywhere between 20 and 30 thousand (with the entire population living near the equator, to benefit from the higher gravity there). A smaller version, about 500 meters in diameter, would house 10 thousand people, and rotate at 1.9 RPM to produce gravity. It would also possess agricultural and manufacturing facilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/External_view_of_a_Bernal_sphere.jpg/640px-External_view_of_a_Bernal_sphere.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022640px-External_view_of_a_Bernal_sphere.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe O\u0027Neill Cylinder:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA long, tubular station, optimized towards creating weather on the inside. The proposed design actually had two of them connected, rotating in opposite directions to produce gravity on their inner surfaces. Each one would be about 5 miles in diameter by 20 miles long (a sufficient volume of air to create [limited] weather effects).

It\u0027s not like we will be there to cry about it. We are just a tiny little spec of life in a remote corner of the universe that has only existed for a tiny fraction of a time. Nothing lasts forever, so why should our species? There is no reason to believe that we have some kind of mythological destiny or purpose or that we have more of a right to survive than the dinosaurs.
