I think the burn indicator bar, when executing a node, should be squared rather than rounded for the sake of precision. It\u0027s difficult to tell when EXACTLY you should stage on that bar, or when you should stop the burn because of the rounded corners on it. Does anyone else feel the same?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-21T19:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u2019s wildly inaccurate by itself and making it square is not going to improve it.

It definitely should be squared off AND count down and I love the idea of an anititarget for burns as well as encounters. I\u2019ll offer one more: its cool that the countdown dots go from yellow to green but make the green light bigger and turn the yellow lights off on zero/go so its really obvious that it 3-2-1-GO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
