I would very much like for there to be dialog to change that and get us in sync again in a way that does not trash a ton of saves. There was good, open dialog and compromise with myself, Nertea, and Wave, and I\u0027d like to see a repeat of that. Naturally this is your mod so it\u0027s completely your game - and if in the end you decide that interop is not worth changes to KSPI (like sharing ORS maps, agreeing on cost, consolidating resources like Argon v ArgonGas or Water v LqdWater), then that too is totally cool.

Thank you for your mod. Big fan. So in case if you want prices close to reality I do some personal research about KSPI pricing. If your want help PM me. So here is my initial points for calculation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How much is Kerbin Fund? We have a stock part for liquid fuel. If we count it as high quality Kerosene then we can count price by weight. It\u0027s easy to find a price for ton of kerosene (see how much money Russia spend on Soyuz launch).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Point where you can translate prices for your mod is LV-N engine. Players must have a reasonable choice between LV-N and KSPI atomic engine (1.25 basic reactor\u002Bfuel\u002B1.25nozzle\u002B3*1.25 inlineradiators) by price because it\u0027s historicly near the same things. Maybe for that reason you must override LV-N (because fuel costs a lot).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Your pricing for fuels is some how wrong. Here is logic. Why Antimatter do cost so much? Because it\u0027s hard to produce IRL. But in KSPI it\u0027s so much easy. So price is so much lower. Same for other resorces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Monsters of the price are Generators. KSPI power generators power ouput is like power plant generators.

Thank you for your mod. Big fan. So in case if you want prices close to reality I do some personal research about KSPI pricing. If your want help PM me. So here is my initial points for calculation. \u003Cp\u003E1. How much is Kerbin Fund? We have a stock part for liquid fuel. If we count it as high quality Kerosene then we can count price by weight. It\u0027s easy to find a price for ton of kerosene (see how much money Russia spend on Soyuz launch).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Point where you can translate prices for your mod is LV-N engine. Players must have a reasonable choice between LV-N and KSPI atomic engine (1.25 basic reactor\u002Bfuel\u002B1.25nozzle\u002B3*1.25 inlineradiators) by price because it\u0027s historicly near the same things. Maybe for that reason you must override LV-N (because fuel costs a lot).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Your pricing for fuels is some how wrong. Here is logic. Why Antimatter do cost so much? Because it\u0027s hard to produce IRL. But in KSPI it\u0027s so much easy. So price is so much lower. Same for other resorces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Monsters of the price are Generators.
