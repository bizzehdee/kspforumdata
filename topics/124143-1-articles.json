She could climb through more or less constant acceleration and hang on to atmospheric breathing to about 23k before switching over to the rockets. There wasn\u0027t much fuel left by the time I got her into orbit, but the ship could refuel once she was there, de-orbit on chutes afterwards with minimal retro burn in final decent, then relaunch again back to orbit. It was a pretty sweet system until, well, now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the very same ship and other similar models built from the ground up in 1.0.4 can barely make it to 3k and 200m/s before their speed starts to bleed away to the point where the ship can no longer maintain its ascent. The ship lifts off without issue and I\u0027ve got more than enough air intake, which makes my the stall so much more mysterious. I\u0027d consider it a drag issue, but again, I lift off just fine.

For starters, they no longer have an Isp curve and a thrust curve - instead, they have no Isp curve and two thurst curves. One is altitude-dependant, one is speed dependant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you are climbing in altitude and the air gets thinner, the engines gradually lose thrust along the way. The RAPIER engine, which I assume you meant when you said raptor, drops from full thrust at sea level to half thrust at 1/3rd atmosphere density. Now I don\u0027t know where 1/3rd is on Kerbin, but it\u0027s probably at or below 10 kilometers due to the exponential scaling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you need to understand that both the Whiplash and the Rapier are no longer bog standard turbojet engines. Much rather, they are turbo\u003Cem\u003Eramjets\u003C/em\u003E. That\u0027s what you get when you take a ramjet engine and build a full-bypass turbojet into it so that it forces air into the ram combustion chamber. Ordinarily a ramjet develops zero thrust at standstill, so it couldn\u0027t take off; but with the help of the turbine, you can force it to work a little bit and thereby let it get you up to takeoff speed. However, the turbine is an anemic crutch and cannot possibly realize the ramjet\u0027s full potential. For that, you need speed. Around mach 0.5, it begins slowly picking up performance, though usually you don\u0027t notice it then because you\u0027re losing performance to climbing altitude at the same time. At 300 m/s, transsonic wave drag begins to set in and further makes your craft feel sluggish and stuck behind the \u0022sound barrier\u0022. But if you can push through, and get to 400 m/s, then the atmosphere lets you go again... and at the same time, now that you\u0027re supersonic, the ram effect really kicks in. By the time you\u0027re going mach 1.4, your RAPIERS are already getting a 4x thrust multiplier, catapulting your craft forward like a bat out of hell. And it only keeps increasing for a good while. The RAPIERS peak at mach 3.75, where you are getting 8.5 times your base thrust worth of power output (still modified by altitude though). After that it begins to decline, but it\u0027s not until mach 5 and beyond that it really begins dropping off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince speed and altitude both apply multipliers to the base value, the maximum thrust is obviously achieved the faster you go at lower altitudes. When building planes, you want to climb to a point where the atmosphere is thin enough to have reduced drag but still thick enough for the engines to produce sufficient thrust; then level off to accelerate through the sound barrier and get the ramjets going (sometimes even by pointing the nose down and diving a litte); then climb again until just before the engines start seriously suffering from lack of atmospheric density; then level off again and accelerate to the point where the engines are past their peak speed and lost thrust to the point where you are almost not getting any acceleration anymore. Then you pull the nose up for the final time and switch to rockets in order to go for orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith your jet driven rocket vehicle, you are not getting good results because you are climbing vertically. Not only does a vertical climb minimize your acceleration (gravity steals 10 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2), but it also maximizes your climb rate into less dense atmospheric regions. So you are getting to a point where you are rapidly losing thrust from altitude before you ever had a chance to build enough speed for the ramjets to get going. Turboramjets unfortunately make extremely poor vertical climb engines - unless you give them SRB assistance to get through the sound barrier really early, they won\u0027t lift anything anywhere. And even then you might discover that you have to switch to closed cycle as early as 12-15 km already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EEDIT: geez, this thread had one reply when I started typing!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ozzallos","CreatedById":34057,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T09:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGuess that explains it.
