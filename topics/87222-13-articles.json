So again, I don\u0027t have any clue of how all this work, but is DDS loader pre-loading some stuff in the GPU that would normally stays in the RAM until needed ( I guess you use CPU over this then ) by the game or ... I don\u0027t know. I guess it depends on if DDS is saving ram by avoiding decompression (without it you have the original file and the converted-for-GPU loaded in the RAM at once ? or the original in the RAM and the converted end ups directly in the gpu ? and with ddsloader you just have one dds file loaded in the ram and/or in the gpu ?) or if it\u0027s saving ram by loading the GPU with stuff it wouldn\u0027t normally load at that precise moment ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main concern is to lighten the burden on the graphic card even though I don\u0027t understand much about how the computer is handling these information.

So the main benefits is that we can push it to the GPU without doing much more than reading it from the disk. It makes loading faster and that\u0027s why I wrote DDSLoader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the memory saving comes from the fact that the converter use a compressed DDS format. So the texture are loaded and stay compressed in memory. With KSP laoding the texture is loaded, uncompressed and then converted into a GPU usable format (and sometimes compressed too)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is the fact that DDSLoader is a bit more agressive with the ReadOnly flag that makes a texture unreadable by code and avoid keeping 2 copy (memory and GPU) of the texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I guess the main question is about DDLoader and the new ATM instlled together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERbay89 know his stuff and ATM makes the whole process a lot easier. You don\u0027t have to convert by hand, it resize if you ask it, it already do a lot of check to avoid converting stuff that should not be and handle the ReadOnly flag.

Run \u0022make\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. You should have an \u0027img2dds\u0027 binary file in the folder\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Setting up the tree\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7a. You need to create a temporary folder somewhere, I used my Desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7b. Inside this temporary folder, copy the \u0027dds.py\u0027 file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7c. Also inside this temp folder, create a folder named \u0027img2dds\u0027, and inside that create a folder named \u0027linux64\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7c (aside). For some reason linux64 is the default SYSTEM as found by the python script on OS X.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7d. Run dds.py and point it to your GameData folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot tell you what the end result is, because it is still converting my GameData folder as I write this post.

Could you upload the binaries you built, so I can include them in the download package? I don\u0027t posssed a Mac to compile them. Do they work if you put the libraries in the same directory as the binaries or you need to have them in /usr? I don\u0027t know how OS X works, but on Linux there\u0027s rpath property in ELF files where you can specify direcories where to search for shared libraries. Does OS X have anything similar?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one more thing: could you check what is the value of \u0022sys.platform\u0022 Python variable on OS X? I can\u0027t support OS X in the script unless I know that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Why? It\u0027s in a .cc, not in a header.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I\u0027ll fix that. It compiles with both GCC 4.9 and Clang 3.5 on Arch Linux (I think the latter is the same compiler as used on Mac).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. What\u0027s wrong?
