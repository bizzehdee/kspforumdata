What you did is the \u0022Fish Jump\u0022 approach: gain 1000-1100m/s on turbojets, then use a strong engine (something of moderately good thrust) to get closer to orbital speeds and altitudes, then switch to nukes to circularize and go elsewhere. It gives you a decent time to orbit and is the general strategy to use with any heavier SSTO that would be too draggy to climb on nuke power alone. The disadvantage is a worse payload fraction (even if the payload total will be better!) and lower delta-V once in orbit. The extra advantage is that you have some high-thrust engines for maneuvers you want to execute fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other approach (\u0022arduous climb\u0022) forgoes the intermediate engines, depending only on nukes and turbojets. Once nukes stop giving you acceleration you pitch only a tiny bit up, and fire the nukes. Fifteen minutes in constant flames is quite standard as you sloooowly gain the second 1100m/s and climb just enough so that earned speed lets lift catch up with reduced atmospheric density, and lowered gravity drag. The airplane can be significantly smaller, and arrive to the orbit with enough fuel for some quite distant travel (less fuel total, but much better TWR due to low mass). It\u0027s good for passenger flights and small payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe slow climb planes are a challenge to balance drag and thrust, as the nukes are so weak the air at lower altitudes can utterly thwart your attempts if you don\u0027t have enough power or too much drag. The \u0022fish jump\u0022 ones are a challenge of choosing the right intermediate engine - anything of reasonable ISp and thrust, from Reliant to Rhino, is a fair game depending on the plane size, desired thrust and flight profile. As ridiculous as it sounds, Poodle is a decent choice. Recently I tried an SSTO with BACC SRB for the main hull, and it performed very nicely too. Of course Aerospikes are the \u0022classic\u0022 choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERapiers are good in that they can serve both as turbojets and intermediate engines - you save up the mass of two separate engines. Also, they can buy you a little more speed and thrust in air-breathing mode, but are harder to push through transsonic barrier (lower thrust that Whiplashes at transsonic speeds). They have a rather poor ISp though, for their thrust, and so they aren\u0027t very good intermediate engines, especially for larger crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
