However, I\u0027ve found in 1.0.3 that the same parameters are no longer consistently safe. For the time being, I\u0027m setting semi-deployment for 0.45 to 0.5 atmospheres (works out to about 4.5-5.0 km above sea level)\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACI\u0027m still mostly using full deployment at 500 meters above ground level, but may up that to 1,000 meters. That\u0027s worked so far for early-career suborbital and low-orbit-return trajectories, but I don\u0027t know yet whether or not it will hold up to the higher speeds of things like returns from the Mun or Minmus (let alone more distant venues).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you come in very steep you should be going the same speed by the time you reach 3km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Grimm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Grimm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAbuse the heck out of air brakes, that\u0027s what I do. I\u0027ve reached a point where not a single ship I build, no matter how large it may be, gets off the launch pad without air brakes attached to them. They\u0027ll slow behemoths to such speeds they\u0027ll softly touch down. I went so far as to build a parachute ship. Granted, that was inspired after accidentally deploying my chutes while detaching depleted fuel tanks off a ship departing from Duna and my engineer, despite being ranked high enough, wouldn\u0027t repack them. So I had to construct this to ensure I can land back on Kerbin.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V0Ubafs.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/V0Ubafs.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis screenshot is from a later contract which called for a ship that orbited Eve to be returned.
