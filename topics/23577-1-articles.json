You don\u0027t need them as the command pod can adjust attitude without them (there\u0027s a big gyro inside, I guess). RCS is only needed for translation (changing position while holding attitude; used when docking). Also, if you\u0027re going with the small command pod, rather use the smaller tanks (FL-T200), and the smaller motor (LV-909). It has a much higher specific impulse (which is the measure of how effectively it turns fuel into thrust). Lastly,go with the smaller landing struts. Try that with the rest of your setup; you should get better range and have a more controllable lunar lander at the other end.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blurrr 2","CreatedById":11016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T21:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, get rid of those two massive RCS tanks.
