IR setup for the arm after it is assembled? Or just attaching the parts together? I\u0027m assuming you are having issues assembling an arm correct?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So to build an arm you need to pay attention to the \u0022anchor node\u0022 of each of the moving components of the arm. IR Rework has more visual queues to help you visualize how the parts go together but RKE has a more realistic appearance. But all that aside.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Start in the VAB for easier reference. Build an arm from the base to the hand, end whatever you want to call it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Every part needs to be pointing the proper direction or it will not function properly. So to start grab a standard rotor, and as soon as the part is spawned you will see two nodes on the part. One on the bottom of the rotor and the other on the side of the rotor.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The node facing down is your \u0022anchor node\u0022 Use this node to attach the rotor.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Now you can attach a \u0022Reverse Rotor\u0022 to the rotor already placed. This time the rotor will spawn in a different orientation. Again the node facing down is the anchor node. But the two nodes will be \u0022reversed\u0022 Orient the revers rotor to align the anchor node to attach to the standard rotor previously placed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E After that it is as simple as attaching structural tubes in either direction, orientation is not important with those.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E and repeating the same steps with all IR components.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The movement will not work properly in the VAB you will need to launch to have everything function normally. If you are still lost feel free to ask here or on one of the IR threads for more advanced setups.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also I have a preassembled arm on my forum thread linked bellow if you need more of a visual reference.\n\u003E \n\nI still have a problem after tried what you said.

As well as the base\u0027s attachment node will be facing either the rear of the SPH or in the VAB it will be pointing straight down, when the part is first spawned.\n\nThe base of an IR part can also be noted by surface attaching an IR part to another part. Think of all IR parts as a one way conductor. They only work when power flows from the base, to the top. If an IR part is installed backward it will disconnect and not work at all in flight when moved. You can see this also with the Rework parts. They will act exactly the same way.\n\nA side note: RKE parts will not work properly in the SPH / VAB.

Then other parts can attach to the top node. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-29T14:24:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2016 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by V8jester**"},{"CreatedByName":"lextacy","CreatedById":107955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T07:15:24Z","Content":"okay sounds cool!  cant wait for thy toootorial ! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jasseji","CreatedById":141335,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T07:27:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 4/5/2016 at 3:41 PM, V8jester said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just wanted to share the amazing things this mod is capable of! - We\u0027re starting to miss ya [@spudbean](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/66541-spudbean/)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![screenshot4_zpsap1m84wf.png~original](http://i1077.photobucket.com/albums/w475/v8jester1/KSP%20Space%20Station/screenshot4_zpsap1m84wf.png~original)](http://i1077.photobucket.com/albums/w475/v8jester1/KSP%20Space%20Station/screenshot4_zpsap1m84wf.png~original \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\n![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-19T06:47:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2016 06:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jasseji**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pigzippa47","CreatedById":169807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-04T20:43:16Z","Content":"V8Jester, or anyone else still active,\n\nCurious if there are reports of this working in a port 1.2 environment. I have looked far and wide without success.\n\nI was using with limited success and ran into compatibility issues with KJR (fixed by making a suggested edit in the KJR config files. That was an issue where the LEE on the end of the arm opposite the root-end was fixed in place and the IR motors would just twist the joints while both LEEs remained fixed in space. \n\nNow, the problem is latching/docking (for inchworm and other purposes). I have hit a similar issue to those above who cannot get the LEE and PDGF to mate. I spent hours on it yesterday and deduced the following:\n\n-Rarely, I can get the LEE to \u0022stick\u0022 to a PDGF, whether the PDGF is part of the same craft or not.\n\n-Sometimes the LEE \u0022magnetizes\u0022 toward the PDGF and \u0022sticks\u0022 but does not \u0022dock\u0022 so that there is no undock command on the mated PDGF or LEE.\n\n-Very rarely, I can get the LEE to dock with the PDGF, but 99% of the time, the command \u0022undock\u0022 appears on the PDGF. When that happens, decoupling the root LEE OR PDGF (regardless of what part the craft is controlled from), causes the whole arm to fall off the craft (undocked from everywhere).\n\n-1% of the time, the \u0022undock\u0022 command appears on the terminal LEE instead of the PDGF. In that single case, decoupling the root LEE caused the terminal LEE/PDGF connection to take over and become a hard dock (which also allowed inchworming).\n\nTL;DR - not completely borked, virtually no Kraken behavior, but practically useless. I tried updating all the various mods to current versions, so I\u0027m assuming it is incompatibility amongst mods or with latest 1.2 release. Also updated the acquireTorque and acquireForce values per page one of this topic, with limited effect. \n\nI\u0027m baffled that there appears to be no working canadarm2 mod given the preponderance of people building the ISS."},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-05T03:32:24Z","Content":"[@Pigzippa47](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/169807-pigzippa47/) I am still around ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nSo (cracks knuckles) RKE does still work in 1.2.1 using the latest (IR 2.0.7) It just will not work inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E as the parts are old enough they are not setup completely correct. As far as KJR issues. There are still some issues needing sorted out on either IR or KJR\u0027s end.\n\nFor inch worming an arm. The Lee and PDGF are both \u0022Docking Ports\u0022 which falls under the \u0022don\u0027t use them\u0022 category...... This is where I actually tell you how to use them ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nInch working with RKE parts only..... Not possible. Inch worming with a modified LEE using a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E magnet module alongside the docking port module.... Totally possible. If you build an arm like so.\n\nBase ship / PDGF / LEE / RKE Spacer / Probe core - suggest procedural probe core here / rest of arm.\n\nThen simply position the arm to magnetize the opposite end back to the base ship once it has been undocked from said ship at the starting \u0022base\u0022 of the arm.\n\nIn essence you are making the arm it\u0027s own \u0022Vessel\u0022 So when undocked it will function on it\u0027s own. (Don\u0027t forget batteries to power the magnet and move the arm once undocked from the base ship)\n\nThe issue here is IR works on a principle of \u0022power input\u0022 through the base node only. So imagine all power and commands come from a probe core. And will only work if said commands are flowing through the base of an IR component. Flow those commands backwards and everything goes pear shaped. This is why Inch worming is not possible with docking ports only. Dock the arm backwards and now all the commands are running backwards through the arm. So the end of the part with the yellow marking - in the case of IR Rework, is the \u0022Base Node\u0022. Or the node facing the rear of the Hanger when you first spawn an RKE part. So the bottom of a part is always the \u0022Base Node\u0022\n\nHere is a Tweaksclae / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch I wrote a while back wich adds the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E magnet to the RKE LEE. - If you need more help just flag me down with \u0022@v8jester\u0022\n\n     //RKE Kanadarm Tweakscale / KIS Patch - V8Jester\n\n     @PART[rkekarm075]\n     {\n         %MODULE[TweakScale]\n         {\n             type = free\n         }\n     }\n\n     @PART[rkekarm100]\n     {\n         %MODULE[TweakScale]\n         {\n             type = free\n         }\n     }\n\n     @PART[rkekarm200]\n     {\n         %MODULE[TweakScale]\n         {\n             type = free\n         }\n     }\n\n    @PART[rkekarm400]\n     {\n         %MODULE[TweakScale]\n         {\n             type = free\n         }\n     }\n\n    @PART[rkekarm600]\n     {\n         %MODULE[TweakScale]\n         {\n             type = free\n         }\n     }\n\n    @PART[rkekelbow]\n     {\n         %MODULE[TweakScale]\n         {\n             type = free\n         }\n     }\n\n    @PART[rkeklee]\n     {\n         %MODULE[TweakScale]\n         {\n             type = free\n         }\n     }\n    \n    @PART[rkeklee]\n     {MODULE{\tname = KASModuleMagnet\tbreakForce = 10\tattachToEva = False\tminFwdDot = 0.9961947\tpowerDrain = 4}\n     }\n\n    @PART[rkeklee]\n     {\n         @mass = .05\n     } \n\n    @PART[rkekpdgf]\n     {\n         %MODULE[TweakScale]\n         {\n             type = free\n         }\n     }\n\n    @PART[rkekpdgf]\n     {\n         @mass = .05\n     } \n\n    @PART[rkekrotor]\n     {\n         %MODULE[TweakScale]\n         {\n             type = free\n         }\n     }\n\n    @PART[rkekrotor2]\n     {\n         %MODULE[TweakScale]\n         {\n             type = free\n         }\n     }\n\n    @PART[rkekspacer]\n     {\n         %MODULE[TweakScale]\n         {\n             type = free\n         }\n     }"}]}
