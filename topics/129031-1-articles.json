Now S.A.V.E always marks the save file as CORRUPT, going back a long way. This is a very old save file, definitely from 1.0.4, maybe even 1.0 days!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027d like to keep the various ships i\u0027ve designed and used, in the new save (using all current mods so as not to break things).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, i\u0027m also thinking of somehow getting the new save into the same state as the current one, so i don\u0027t have to spend time re-doing everything manually, but lets leave that for another time! Also, it\u0027s dependant on the original question of corrupt save or craft files corrupting each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that makes sense!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T09:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222344543\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129031\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451646725\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156118\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022datamonkey\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, datamonkey said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwanted to know if a corrupt craft file can corrupt a good/fresh save file, or if a corrupt save file, can corrupt a craft file\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort answer: Yes and no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong answer:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe game save file and the craft files are saved seperately (KSP/saves/xyz \u0026amp; KSP/saves/xyz/ships) so from a logical point of view craft files should be unaffected by a corrupt game save file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the other way around it could be possible that a corrupt craft file corrupts a game save file, because a rocket on the start ramp is a copy\u00A0of the craft file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as always there\u0027s a small\u00A0possibility that a corrupt game save corrupts your saved crafts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-02T09:33:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2016 09:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by *Aqua*\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"datamonkey","CreatedById":156118,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T12:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks Aqua\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven it\u0027s a small possibility, i\u0027ll try a new save with the current craft files, but i won\u0027t try to recreate what i\u0027ve already done in terms of flights/scans/etc, just in case i go through it all and it does end up corrupted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe try to test it by launching all the saved ships, once i\u0027ve cleaned the list up, and see what happens to the save file, at least in terms of what SAVE reports as the status.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
