It appears that as well as the 2D layer varying in hight with its \u0027peaks\u0027, all the altitudes are off set by around -4000m. The default for BA set the alt for rss based on the 2D layer\u0027s starting location but this lowers significantly as the texture rotates. 8150m should place it at an average close to the volume layer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sokar408","CreatedById":75557,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T11:27:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely fantastic mod!
