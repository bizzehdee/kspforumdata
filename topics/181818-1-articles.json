I manage to blackout the tourist on launch and re-entry and don\u0027t get credit for completing the contract. To me I\u0027ve met all the requirements, so I use Alt-F12 to complete them, but I don\u0027t know what I could be doing wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put a Mk1 cockpit with a probe core on a Kodiak solid rocket booster, shoot it straight up and let the capsule fall straight down. The Tourist blacks out right before the booster cuts out, the trajectory goes up to around 750km. Coming down the tourist blacks out again when the capsule hits the atmosphere. I never seem to get credit for the black out. Any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-30T06:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuborbital means \u0022outside the atmosphere\u0022.
