This one is currently remote operated with two empty seats. Our goal is to land, rendevouz with our stranded Kerbonauts, get them on board, and bring them home. The passion of our Kerbal scientists is reflected in their speed with which they made changes and launched this vessel. Waiting on a new launch window was agonizing, but we have made it. Adding a touch more fuel seemed to be the biggest challenge: adding fuel without sacrificing effeciency. It would be pointless to simply burn up all the fuel we added in the process of trying to launch all the fuel we just added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xRwUgpb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xRwUgpb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where we stand. Our rescue lander is currently in orbit around Duna. We should have enough fuel to descend and and land using our transfer stage. Hopefully this puts us on Duna without touching any of the fuel in our lander pod. We\u0027ll have Maynard and Bill run from their dead-in-the-water module to the new one. And hopefully, HOPEFULLY, this will have enough fuel to escape Duna and get a return trajectory. This lander pod has tons of parachutes, so the K.R.A.P. team is counting on massive aero braking from Kerbin\u0027s thick atmosphere followed by parachute decent.

It failed. Miserably. Unable to land, crashing and burning violently. Lucky for our brave Kerbalnauts, the crash was too far away to impact their current safety. But close enough for them to make a mission to recover any useable supplies to help them last. The Kerbin Resarch and Planning [K.R.A.P.] team designed a 3rd variation of the rescue craft. This time WITH landing gear, plus a redesigned engine (the small 909 mini-poodle). However, due to the nature of the launch vehicle, including docking ports was not a possibility. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis unique vehicle required the following sequence of events:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUnmanned launch to Kerbin Orbit.

Brave Bill and Maynard had to space walk to the interplanetary module. This module had just enough fuel and power provided by those two nuclear engines to reach Kerbin. By using the two light single-seat pods, we were able to jettesion the entire craft and parachute down to safety. A single parachute each was the only weight we could stand to afford with this variation. Our K.R.A.P. team determined that this was the best way, as redesigning the entire vessel for a FOURTH time would take too long to reach our stranded kerbalnauts before their supplies ran out. There would be no fuel to slow decent. There would be no fuel to guide decent. There would be no fuel to fix the orbit. This was a single, suicide burn from Duna straight to Kerbin.
