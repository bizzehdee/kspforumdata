It\u0027s a very simple technique but remarkably efficient. The rocket is simple to use and doesn\u0027t require a lot of parts (though a lifter for career mode would likely not be able to use the SLS parts early on). I didn\u0027t have to set a single maneuver node - from liftoff to landing on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn was a single ballistic trajectory. I made a perfect four point landing on the first try (though this isn\u0027t by far my first M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn landing). The only difficulty I had was when I got turned around on takeoff and orbited the wrong way, on my second try I got it right. Again, it was a single ballistic trajectory from takeoff to splashdown. It reminds me of stories of the wild old days before maneuver nodes when everyone had to fly by the seat of their pants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you had told me yesterday that I could get a Kerbal home from the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn on a single FL-T200 tank, I\u0027d have said \u0022Yeah, right Mr. Manley... you and what fuel cheat?\u0022 I am no longer a doubter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only recommendation I\u0027d make would be to try Blizzy\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71536\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAmbient Light Adjustment \u003C/a\u003Eplugin - it will make the scenes on Kerbin\u0027s night side visible, instead of just blackness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-13T06:55:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2014 06:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by HeadHunter67\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EliteShadowLeo","CreatedById":85537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T08:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm very glad you liked it!
