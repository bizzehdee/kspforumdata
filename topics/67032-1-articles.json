The only mods I am using are MechJeb and the kethane mod so I assumed that I would be able to use a kerbin designed aircraft and use the zero bypass kethane engines on eve. However I have ran into a few problems . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I do believe my designs are flawed but I am having a problem correcting it on several accounts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst any kethane desinge aircraft using the zero bypass turbines will not show the center of gravity. It blips for a second then it disappears. so I have been guessing where to place the vtol engins but I managed to get 3 designs to fly ( using the infinite fuel cheat ) on kerbin \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehowever on eve I am running into problems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst the zero bypass turbines overheat and explode ( usually the Vtols ) when ran at 100% they do fine at 95 % but 100% will blow them up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond I placed my aircraft on a transfer rocket and fueled them with kethane in orbit, then sent them to eve, when I deorbit them the zero bypass turbins will not function until the crafts lands on the surface. I tried running them at 20k, 10k 5k and 1K and they wont function unless I use the infinite fuel cheat. and I really don\u0027t understand why. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd all of my aircraft, simple will not fly reliably, they seem bottom heavy as if they don\u0027t have enough lift from the wings, I have to point them at 75 degrees nose up to get lift even with the Vtols on and they are not stable in flight. I understand the atmosphere creates more drag but I don\u0027t understand where I am going wrong, I even took a stock aircraft the areas 3a and converted it ot kethane and while it will fly on kerbin I cannot get it into a stable flight on eve \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso is it just a buggy modd, or is there something I am missing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOgreMagi\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T11:54:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should be asking this question in the Kethane mod thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T13:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out this thread for pics of a few different Eve Kethane powered planes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73048-Flying-(off-of)-Eve\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73048-Flying-(off-of)-Eve\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe center of gravity problem you\u0027re having sounds like a bug, maybe try uninstalling and reinstalling kethane?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe overheating problem is just one of the things you\u0027ll have to deal with when using the ZB-turbine. Once you pick up speed and altitude you\u0027ll be able to go to 100%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the engines not working till you land is probably due to the lack of \u0022Kintake air\u0022. Open up the resource bar and don\u0027t try to use the engines until you have Kintake air. On my runs I was able to use the engines once I got to around 8-9km up, but I was using FAR so I\u0027m not sure if/how that changes things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your balance issues, it\u0027s hard to guess without seeing at least a pic of what you\u0027re trying to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
