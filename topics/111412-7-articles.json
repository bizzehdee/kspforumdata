It\u0027s a minor thing, but it\u0027s super annoying. Also I was wondering, could you add a functionality that allows us to rearrange and organize our kerbals? I\u0027m kind of obsessive about their placements, and the ability to drag them around the list would be so nice.\n\u003E \n\nAre you running 1.2.2 or 1.3?\n\n0.6.2 is the version for 1.3, I made a mistake in the earlier post (which I just fixed)\n\nI\u0027ve started a new thread for this here, please move all discussion there:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/163315-13-trp-hire-formerly-ksi-hiring/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-16T14:29:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2017 02:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-18T14:42:23Z","Content":"I was asked from [@Galileo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150430-galileo/) to check why when TRP and GPP are installed the level of the generated kerbal reverts back to zero\n\nI installed TRP on a stock game, just to get a feel of how it works and:\n\n1- I can\u0027t get the level button to work (click on it but nothing happens)  \n\n2- even if I have not enough funds I can hire the kerbal (funds go down to zero)\n\nAlso, I can\u0027t see anything in GPP\\_Renamer that might mess the level of the kerbal, so maybe the issue is linked to te two bugs I\u0027ve mentioned above.\n\nthe logs don\u0027t show any errors, let me know if you still want them.
