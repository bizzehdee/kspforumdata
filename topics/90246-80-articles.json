No one tests the metadata generated to see if it properly installs the mod before it\u0027s sent out for general use. And no one bothers to provide any out for what happens when CKAN does cause problems and won\u0027t fix it, besides suggesting that I clean up their problems for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat annoys me is when modders start complaining about CKAN as being \u0022unnecessary\u0022, which ignores the lived experiences of many users like myself who have been driven mad by mod incompatibilities.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut mod incompatibilities are rare and can be seen coming a mile away... planet packs, MechJeb-like things, aero models, the only type of common incompatibility is when two things try to mess with the same system, and that takes about 5 seconds of thought to figure out. I don\u0027t see how CKAN is necessary for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat you don\u0027t find something useful or necessary does not mean that other people won\u0027t.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, believe me, I\u0027m well aware of that. We\u0027re talking about a program that replaces copying folders from a zip to a single place. I\u0027m amazed this is even a thing, but there\u0027s apparently demand for it. Makes just as much sense to me as beer; don\u0027t understand how anyone likes that stuff, but I understand that as terrible as it is, people want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t have the time to read through thousands of pages of forum posts searching out clues about compatibility issues, then spend the time manually installing mods in the correct order to make sure nothing gets over-written that shouldn\u0027t be, fix up the flaws less competent modders cause by including dlls from other mods, and still have time to enjoy my game. If the choice is that or stock gameplay, I\u0027ll fall back to stock gameplay. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure if it\u0027s as rampant as that, you can provide a bunch of examples of that, right? I mean, an epidemic of that that requires this kind of tool should result in a list of several dozen mods that don\u0027t fall under the, \u0022it\u0027s obvious they\u0027re messing with the same system\u0022 rule, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn some ways, I almost wish Squad had gone the Steam Workshop route or something similar and insisted that all mods be installed through some defined system that KSP understands.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGod, please no. We\u0027d all get forced onto Curse, have strict limits on what would be allowed, get the fun of bugs in that system getting fixed horribly slowly, have difficulty even identifying the bugs and not even have the option of pushing for manual installs. That would be utterly terrible. Even CKAN is better than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnfortunately, they\u0027ve chosen not to do that, and so CKAN is in the terrible position of trying to get the effect of enforced standards to get mods to play nice together without any moral authority to actually enforce standards. Ultimately, no one is forcing you to do anything about CKAN, because no one has the authority to do so. You have the ability to ignore CKAN completely.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot when CKAN causes problems for me. Not when CKAN causes problems for my users that follow its instructions perfectly and get borked installs. The same users that followed my instructions perfectly for manual installs and never got problems. No, you don\u0027t get to play the, \u0022it\u0027s only your problem if you choose to make it your problem\u0022 card, because \u003Cem\u003Eyou guys\u003C/em\u003E made it my problem and won\u0027t let me opt-out and make it \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E my problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe CKAN contributors that are engaging with you are also your users, or they are working on behalf of your users.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd doing a terrible job of it, because they\u0027ve successfully caused enough problems that CKAN installs aren\u0027t supported anymore. Which slows down support for everyone else.

No. Maybe I\u0027m in the minority, but I don\u0027t think that it\u0027s right that after someone throws a wrench at you that you should be happy to work with them or that you should fix the damage they caused. Hell, why would it benefit me to do that, to send the message, \u0022yes, you can cause problems for me, and I\u0027ll gladly fix them for you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy job is to code and fix my mods. The job of distribution and installation used to be handled perfectly by the host, browsers and extractors. Then you guys came along and decided to take on that job, and somehow sold users on doing a better job of it while doing a worse job and expecting me to clean up the mess.
