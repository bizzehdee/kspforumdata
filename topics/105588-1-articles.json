It took me like 2-3 hours to get a ship that could make orbit and land again, and I wasn\u0027t able to do it with both goo and Science Jr. at the same time. I only had to do one test contract to get there though, and I had about 300k roots in the bank, so money did not seem like a big bottleneck for me. Science OTOH felt pretty hard to come by. After orbiting successfully all I got was grindy test contracts, which I can\u0027t say seemed like a lot of fun to work though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...I should add that I guess allowing quicksave largely defeats the purpose of hard mode, but even without any mulligans I think I still would have had at least half as much money in the bank as I had allowing them. None of my failures would have actually killed my Kerbals, I just would have had about 8 10k-root suborbital flights for no particular reward before making orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T15:11:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 03:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Randazzo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Randazzo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022Hard\u0022 just translates into \u0022More grinding\u0022\u003Cp\u003EThe actual difficulty curve of the game doesn\u0027t really go up.

Yes, once you know how to get a rocket to the mun, your knowledge does not change. However, having to go to the mun without solar panels, a part limit, re-entry heat (and possibly no heatshields), no manouver nodes, no patched conics showing up on the map, etc. gives you additional challenges. It forces you to create different craft than you would build normally. One which may require some creative thinking and might not be as optimal as you would like it to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecondly: career mode is indeed grindy for people who are long-time vets of KSP who find no satisfaction in building crafts which must adhere to what to them must feel like artificial constraints. However, as a mode for people who have never played KSP before, I think it\u0027s pretty darn good. It has a learning curve and introduces you to the ways of rocketry in a step-by-step way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically: any single player campaign in almost any game becomes a grindy bore once you\u0027re so good at it that you can do it with your eyes closed.

Me, I sympathize heavily with the above statement. Toodling around anywhere doing repetitive tasks feels like work to me, not fun. Specifically, in this case, I play this game to play around with getting to and being in space. Having a bunch of other stuff to do beforehand is like doing chores before I get to play my game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, perhaps this is a matter of variable tolerance. I recognize the impulse toward delayed \u0027earned\u0027 gratification. I \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E enjoy a slight lead time before getting to space - maybe no more than an hour. There are people here who seem happy with 5 or 6 hours. Now I\u0027m curious: how far does that go?
