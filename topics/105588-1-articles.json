I think you may have run into the exact same two difficulty spikes that I encountered. It\u0027s a long read, but I wonder if you would agree with my thread on the game progression here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117160-Career-Mode-Progression-and-Game-Design-Analysis?p=1872805#post1872805](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117160-Career-Mode-Progression-and-Game-Design-Analysis?p=1872805#post1872805)\n\nHard difficulty should be challenging to experienced players, but ... I think it should be hard in a *different way* than it is now. Lacking maneuver nodes and patched conics might be the wrong way to do it.

I only had to do one test contract to get there though, and I had about 300k roots in the bank, so money did not seem like a big bottleneck for me. Science OTOH felt pretty hard to come by.

Yes, once you know how to get a rocket to the mun, your knowledge does not change. However, having to go to the mun without solar panels, a part limit, re-entry heat (and possibly no heatshields), no manouver nodes, no patched conics showing up on the map, etc. gives you additional challenges. It forces you to create different craft than you would build normally. One which may require some creative thinking and might not be as optimal as you would like it to be.\n\nsecondly: career mode is indeed grindy for people who are long-time vets of KSP who find no satisfaction in building crafts which must adhere to what to them must feel like artificial constraints. However, as a mode for people who have never played KSP before, I think it\u0027s pretty darn good. It has a learning curve and introduces you to the ways of rocketry in a step-by-step way.\n\nBasically: any single player campaign in almost any game becomes a grindy bore once you\u0027re so good at it that you can do it with your eyes closed.
