Again, I am suggesting a rule explicitly for submarines, not for surface vessels. We\u0027ve been doing rescues on surface vessels forever, that\u0027s fine. The difficulty level is orders of magnitude higher with a missing sub (so tiny). The insurance is only for the sub, else they\u0027d get the same surface search any other wreck would get. Air and sea assets using surface search radar, etc. Remember that this incurs nonzero risk to the aircrews. This entire search was completely fruitless after some time, BTW. They know how long to deploy some asset that could drop a 2\u002B mile line with an ROV to try and hook it to the vehicle, then lift 10,000kg. If that pull the trigger to pulling up the sub with zero delay was 24 hours, then the last 24 hours of search was 100% pointless. If you add slop to deploy, and actually have a few hours to work out issues it\u0027s longer. Realistically there was never any hope of rescue.
