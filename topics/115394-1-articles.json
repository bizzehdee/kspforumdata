(No obscenities!)\n\nRules are:\n\n1: You can only change half of the username, no more. It has to be recognizable. Brownie points if you change less than half. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n2: Absolutely no obscenities, including vulgar language. \n\nExample:\n\nEndersmens: I\u0027ll start the game\n\nPoster 2: Nice to mean you Endermam. \n\nPoster 3: Hello Postman 2!\n\netc\n\nHave fun! The first poster gets to misspell my username. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T16:01:54Z","Content":"Well, hello umm... do I see this right \\*squint\\* ....
