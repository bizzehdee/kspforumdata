Not having cargo doors to worry about enabled me to fit 4 pairs of strakes ahead of cg, but only two pairs could go aft thanks to the space that had to be left for engine decoupling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, we now had some kind of balance, in terms of strakes -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003EAbove \u0026amp; behind CG  |Above and ahead CG\n8 strakes          |2 strakes\n------------------------------------\nBelow \u0026amp; behind CG  |Below and ahead CG\n2 strakes          |8 strakes\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fuselage tanks are also perfectly aligned, height-wise, with the engines. \u00A0 That left just the 2 pairs of Big S delta wings , mounted above the engine, to cause a problem. \u00A0 \u00A0So, \u00A0I used the new feature of 1.2 to give these\u00A0a higher fuel tank priority, meaning they drain first. \u00A0 By the time you\u0027re getting up to altitudes where off-axis thrust is more problematic, these tanks will be mostly used up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinal version -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/AeroGav/Pentastar-Santos-II\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/AeroGav/Pentastar-Santos-II\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161014105818_1_zpspmhn9t0u.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/20161014105818_1_zpspmhn9t0u.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUmm, what the heck !
