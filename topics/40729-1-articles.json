Though it\u0027s good practice for larger missions, so you may as well get into the habit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor what it\u0027s worth my medium lift vehicle can move a 1.25m lander lander and CSM with a several hundred m/s of spare DV at all points for idiot-proofing. You get into orbit with over 1000 m/s for your Munar injection burn. It looks something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECore Stage: 1 Big Orange Tank, 1 x200-16, 6 LV-T30s, 1 LV-T45\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8x Outer Stages (Asparagus Staged): 2 FL-T800s, 1 LV-T30\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will launch a ~10 ton payload with enough fuel to make your Munar injection burn (and possibly enough to circularize) or a shade under 25 tons to LKO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can definitely go a whole lot smaller than my example, but that\u0027s a pretty solid size to keep a lifter. Big enough to be useful but not big enough that it needs struts. For newer players, you can also get a much simpler mission by \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E doing things Apollo style. This also cuts down on launch weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt a guess, a core of 2 FL-T800s with 6 asparagus-staged boosters of the same size will get a very respectable payload into orbit. I don\u0027t want to speak for you, but I imagine that should be plenty of oomph to get a lander up.

The equivalent of a 7 orange tank asparagus staged rocket in terms of pancake staging would be 5\u002B5 with mainsails in first stage and skippers in second stage, capable of lifting around 45 tons to a 100k orbit or so.

Orange tank - skipper - stage separator. Orange tank - mainsail.
