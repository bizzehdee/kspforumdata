I have to admit that I absolutely deplore using the sliding tweakable menus to manipulate control surface deflections. I humbly implore you to at least provide the option for the use of the old style control surface assignment GUI page. That allowed me to do many things that I am no longer able to do, and it makes me a very sad tradesman of soil.
