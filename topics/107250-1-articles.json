I\u0027m wondering if it has to do with mods because I\u0027ve had issues before with mods screwing up my game.  I\u0027ve found that you have to select your probe, click on the scanner and toggle overlay and then you can view your resources in the map when selecting the planet or while the probe is selected.  Its a temporary fix really but it gives you an idea of where to land.
