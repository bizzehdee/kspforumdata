KSP as it is right now is fantastic. Certainly there are some improvements that can be made. However, using Unity as it\u0027s base engine does mean that there are limits to what KSP can grow into. I\u0027m sure there are arguments to be made about various other engines and their respective pros and cons when compared to Unity, but the truth is none of that matters to KSP. The only way an engine change would happen would be if a new project was started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea of a new project built from the ground up on a more capable (or even custom designed) engine by team of experienced devs using KSP as a proof of concept holds a great amount of appeal to me, and it seems to others as well. To be clear, I don\u0027t expect this to happen at all, but I would happily wait the 4\u002B years of development and pay the standard AAA game $60 price for that game. Knowing what a game like KSP can become, and focusing direction and development with those goals in mind, a game that is built from a more capable beginning could give us a something that holds even more possibilities than we have now. It seems unlikely, but it\u0027s nice to dream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, I am happy with KSP. I just don\u0027t think there is too much more room to grow what currently exists.

This week was all about localization and its upcoming pre-release. The amount of effort and work hours that have been put into this project was nothing short of a gargantuan endeavour and our excitement is a testament of watching our efforts come into fruition. But we\u2019re here to talk about everything Kerbal, so without further ado, let\u2019s begin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone in QA has been incredibly busy checking and \u003Cb\u003Erechecking all of the strings\u003C/b\u003E that have been converted, as well as making sure the game still behaves as it should. There are so many different ways of playing KSP, and and an equal number of results. There\u2019s even more ways to break KSP to add on top. The localization effort has highlighted this very well. Variations between platforms can mean that some characters don\u2019t render in the same way as others. Screen space has been a big concern. Another special mention is due to the volunteers that have worked tirelessly through this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, one of the most challenging things we had to deal with the localization process was that, originally, \u003Cb\u003Ethe code wasn\u2019t optimized for localization\u003C/b\u003E and the logic of the game was intertwined with some explicit words in english. We had to deal with this and many lines of code required some tweaking to allow us to introduce new phrasings and characters, i.e., lots of work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the QA team went also through more general bug discovery, confirmation and testing of fixes this week,so you can expect quite\u003Cb\u003E a few bug fixes\u003C/b\u003E for the upcoming update (you may have learned about some of them if you have been following KSP Weekly in past\u00A0editions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn other regards, \u003Ci\u003EBlitworks\u003C/i\u003E is doing some good progress on the builds we\u2019ve been receiving and testing for the past few weeks, they even added a \u003Cb\u003Ecircular menu for the controls\u003C/b\u003E that will make the console\u2019s UI more user friendly. Renowned poet and tester, sal_vager, decided to write a verse to express his experience with the last build he tried:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EPS4\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EMy planes soar\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EKerbals on the Mun\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ESaves compressed\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EStability test \u2713\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EHaving lots of fun\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe development team has also been jam-packed with localization bug busting, too. For example, JPLrepo finished refactoring Biomes (did you know there are over 140 planet biomes in KSP and over 40 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E biomes?), Celestial Bodies, Science System. The devs have had to do\u003Cb\u003E a lot of refactoring\u003C/b\u003E, this week included messages, PartModules and Contracts, too. Refactoring is the process of changing the code to separate UI display strings from strings used internally in functional code. This is what happens when a piece of software is developed without Localization and then Localization is retro-fitted at a later date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDevelopers also did \u003Cb\u003Eamendments to lots of UI screens\u003C/b\u003E and elements to make all the Russian and Spanish fit! As well as fixing some linux bugs, some KSPedia adjustments and the creation of an automated script in python to populate the language prefixes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally we just want to remind you that the Localization Pre-release will take place on \u003Cb\u003EMarch 16th\u003C/b\u003E and that to celebrate that launch we are doing a cool contest with some of the best prizes we have given, yet.

Where squad is concerned though money seems to be at the top of the list of priorities. You can say what you will but since harvester left loose ends were tied up and ksp has been on a downward trend in all areas since.
