According to the above table, the stack has a mass of 2000 tonnes on the pad. At MECO1, the shuttle and external tank have a mass of 126 tonnes. During the climb to orbit, two spent SRBs are jettisoned. The combined empty mass of the SRBs is 175 tonnes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2000 tonnes (initial mass) - 126 tonnes (orbiter plus external tank) - 175 tonnes (two empty SRBs) = 1699 tonnes fuel burned\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel burned is, therefore, about 85% by mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle obviously isn\u0027t in orbit at MECO1 but it only requires a couple of hundred m/s of delta-V to circularise at that point, and the amount of fuel burned to achieve orbit is relatively small by comparison to what\u0027s required during the climb to MECO1.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-08T21:33:29Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2013 09:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SFJackBauer","CreatedById":82269,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T21:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s correct, assuming a fully-loaded shuttle its liftoff mass was 109 tons, of which 30 tons was the maximum payload, 57 tons its dry mass and 21.5 tons of OMS fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt MECO, a shuttle OMS with max payload would have 300m/s dV, from what I\u0027ve seen the circularization burn spent 100m/s so there goes roughly 7 tons of MMH/NTO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma117","CreatedById":24574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T22:15:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I wasn\u0027t expecting that high a number.

You just need that much reactant mass to get up to orbital velocity and altitude...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for 104% throttle, that\u0027s a longstanding, common question. Short version: when the SSMEs were being developed in the 70s, it was discovered that they could run reliably at above the originally planned thrust rating. Since a lot of paperwork and tests had been completed with the originally planned rating being listed as 100% thrust, this meant that if they rerated the engines to higher thrust, they\u0027d either have to go back and change all the paperwork to adjust it to the new 100% rating, or they\u0027d have lots of confusion as to which \u0022100%\u0022 they meant in any given situation. NASA\u0027s solution was exactly the sort of \u0022avoid the problem altogether\u0022 one you\u0027d expect of engineers--they merely redefined the available range of values so that 100% was no longer the absolute maximum power possible. Instead, it was just a reference point, and they would refer to the engine thrust in terms of a percentage of that nominal value. Hence why, very early in the program, they switched to running the engines at 104% power for most of the ascent; they\u0027d found that they could run them at 104% with no loss of reliability, and up to 109% without them failing, albeit at the cost of increased wear. Thus, 104% became normal \u0022full thrust,\u0022 and in an abort scenario, they would throttle up to 109% for that little extra shove that might be the difference between life and death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the 90s, improved metallurgy and a larger nozzle throat allowed SOME of the engines to be refurbished to run at 109% under normal conditions and up to 114% in an emergency, and this became standard on the flights to Mir and the ISS, to increase payload capacity on those flights. (The engine controllers knew which model each engine was, and would operate their throttles independently, allowing the older engines to remain in the flight rotation right up until the end of the program; they could be mixed and matched with no issues, though NASA was careful to make sure there was sufficient TWR for the required payload on every flight anyway and, on a particularly heavy flight, might make sure to have three wide-throat engines grouped together.) This is also why NASA started using the OMS engines during SSME burn, after SRB burnout, as a sort of \u0022afterburner\u0022 to give the vehicle a little more payload capacity on those high-inclination flights...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T17:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere was an article that talked about comparison of a rocket to a molotov cocktail, which pointed out that a typical rocket, has a higher fraction of fuel to total mass than the molotov.
