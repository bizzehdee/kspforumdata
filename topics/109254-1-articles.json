I think the best bet would be to get about 5-10k above the target and let it catch up to you. My guess would be to launch between 10-15 degrees in front of the target, get into orbit around 80km and then maneuver down onto the target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T20:50:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, if you\u0027re trying to launch straight to rendezvous, with the new aero and flatter sub-orbital profile, I\u0027d launch when the target is 60-45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 west of your launch location.

The ideal target position for launch is generally when it has climbed about 5 degrees or so above KSC\u0027s western horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find that my craft\u0027s TWR doesn\u0027t make much difference here, since the lion\u0027s share of time from launch to intercept is either climbing through the first 20 km (where speed is limited by atmosphere) or coasting after the initial burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the above applies to vertical rocket launches only; spaceplanes have a much more gradual ascent profile and would need a bigger phase angle.

I was experimenting with 340-350\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 phase angles. A lot of it depends on your maneuvering style, but with some aggressive maneuvers starting from 345\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 I was able to get within 3km of my target and kill velocity. That was lucky. I am also flying a clunky 4-mission-in-one ship, something more agile would be easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
