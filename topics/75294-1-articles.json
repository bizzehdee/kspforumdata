When you change the warp value it will stop, but you can just resume it when you get to 4x (and yes it will transfer 4x as fast).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou cannot rails warp during fuel transfers, presumably because fuel transfers change the mass distribution of the vessel, which requires physics simulation. IIRC you used to be able to rails warp during fuel transfers, but it was removed - I guess because the sudden change of CoM when coming out of warp was causing kraken attacks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-17T14:57:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2014 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mpk10","CreatedById":109917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T16:58:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help.
