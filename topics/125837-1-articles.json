The engines were just used to correct the Pe to 70km. Monopropellant O-10 \u0022Puff\u0022 engines were used because they work OK even if their nozzles are obstructed i.e. they can be used from behind the heatshield. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only \u0022secret\u0022 here is that everything must be occluded by the heatshield, including the air-brakes. Hence their rotation on the top of the capsule so that when deployed so they don\u0026#39;t stick out into the atmosphere on the way down, otherwise they would heatplode and the rest of the craft would not slow down and it too would heatplode. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis craft didn\u0026#39;t get anywhere near overheating and just one encounter with Eve was required to achieve a landing.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T19:00:32Z","Content":"\nThe problem now is getting the kerbonaut back to space :P\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T19:26:34Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027juanml82\u0027]The problem now is getting the kerbonaut back to space :P[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh, that\u0026#39;s not too hard.
