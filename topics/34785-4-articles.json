Also, the numbers have multiplier letters (d/h/etc., days/hours/mins?), and that\u0027s where I get lost because in my brain (not fluent in Si units), degrees should be in there somewhere, and none of the multiplier values I try for those, even from the Si list, seem to work out like I expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile writing this book/post, I got to thinking about the various \u0022projections\u0022 used to make a global atlas fit on a 2d map. So, question for the community: Which coordinate system does KSP use for planet surfaces? Is it one of those listed here?: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmittedly, I haven\u0027t taken the time to study all this much, but I do think HyperEdit\u0027s interface could be more intuitive. \u0022The Maker\u0022 (of HyperEdit) did the hard part for us, now I\u0027d like to pimp it up a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging and/or clarifying the input units throughout HyperEdit is high on my personal priority list, but others may consider other tasks more important. On that note, setting up our task list priorities according to the community\u0027s priorities for each task is another task that\u0027s also high on our soon-to-be prioritized list of tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeday, I\u0027d like to add many more interface aids, options and go-fasters to all the features in HyperEdit -such as making \u0022Refill resources\u0022 variable and tank/batt-specific, including and not limited to: sliders, up/dn/lf/rt incrementing via arrow keys and mouse, auto-complete/history buffers, customizable/trigger-able hot-keys and presets, and even GUIs where possible. Like if MechJeb\u0027s ascent path plot image were draggable. I\u0027m not \u0022qualified\u0022 as a coder yet, but I\u0027m hoping that this type of thing isn\u0027t too difficult. Regardless, it\u0027s almost certainly pretty low on the priority list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this particular case, the holy grail fix (IMO) would be a 3d graphical representation of the planet\u0027s sphere (is it possible to add another scene to KSP or mimic/use MechJeb\u0027s \u0022Choose target on the surface\u0022 feature?), with an adjustable grid/scale, and one or more draggable pins to mark positions. Of course, with a readout/input to show/enter coords and make other tweaks like \u0022Slew __ clicks N/S/E/W\u0022, \u0022Snap-to-grid\u0022, \u0022Nearest coast\u0022, and whatever else is awesome. It could even evolve into a waypoint based navigation system of some sort, even though I have no idea why that might be useful for a teleporter, but hey.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ezriilc","CreatedById":34556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T18:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yea.

Perhaps its just a matter of making the time set only move time forward and not backwards around the dial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem seems possible to explain some similar issues I\u0027ve seen elsewhere with SAS getting stuck on, but I don\u0027t know if anyone has identified HyperEdit as a cause until now. Remember, knowing is half the battle! Hopefully, it helps someone stop pulling their hair out like it did for me today. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-14T20:08:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2013 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ezriilc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ezriilc","CreatedById":34556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T20:29:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it was finally moving the time forward that corrected it, but that\u0027s a guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the problem above, I was also unable to toggle the lights either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1of6Billion","CreatedById":46191,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T10:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould you consider adding a tool to migrate a savegame to the next version?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe announced \u0022save breaking\u0022 causes a lot of nervosity.
