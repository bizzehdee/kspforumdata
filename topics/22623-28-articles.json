That was the whole point of what I was doing. The command pod is the root part here, and both the telemachus antenna and the thermometer on the command pod are attached to this part. And as I said above, it was pretty clear to me that Telemachus was reporting temp telemetry only from the probe thermometer, which is in the middle of the vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay when the probe is detached, Telemachus will begin reporting the thermometer data on the command pod thermometer (2nd in line probably on the numeric part id), but it appears to require a toggle display cycle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have any suggestions here - probably including an option to select which device telemachus is using to acquire and transmit data is too much work for too little return to functionality. However, it may be good information to include in some kind of user manual or guide that the part used is the first part attached to the vehicle during assembly. When I detached the probe thermometer and saved the ship, and then re-attached the probe thermometer and saved in the same build session, and then launched and monitored with Telemachus, Telemachus appeared to report temp data from the thermometer on the command pod - because that part was now a lower # part ID than the probe part ID (guess).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide Note : I noticed in all of this that Telemachus telemetry appeared to hang only to refresh on some kind of mouse activity in the browser (just a slight move or tap). Looking at the browser on the remote computer (next to my main desk) while KSP was running full screen, the Telemachus page in the browser completely hung if there was no mouse activity. (Firewalls on both machines were completely turned off). Any ideas on this one? Probably has nothing to do with TM itself but any suggestion here would be boss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerTrotsky","CreatedById":120127,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-19T13:19:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the above post in which I said \u0022Telemachus telemetry appeared to hang only to refresh on some kind of mouse activity . . . \u0022 was true in the case of where rather than closing and opening a new browser session when I had closed KSP and re-opened the application, I had simply \u0022refreshed\u0022 the browser on the remote computer.
