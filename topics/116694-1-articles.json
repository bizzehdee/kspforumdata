I\u0027ve been playing with Deadly Reentry for a long time - it\u0027s not that I don\u0027t like the extra challenge, but I can\u0027t stand these random explosions of parts/batteries happening all the time. I want to play with mods including FAR and I want to use part clipping, therefore until RealHeat is finished a plugin like this is the best option imho.

Which, ironically, I did to increase reentry deadliness. (very high conduction makes it hard for heat to build up on the outside of the ship because it immediately conducts it all away)\n\nFrom a strictly thermal standpoint, the only thing this version of DRE is doing is tweaking config files and globals. (i.e. lowering max temps of parts so they behave more like aluminum and steel instead of tungsten or titanium)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T07:31:07Z","Content":"Great!
