The engine is pushing them up rather quickly, and when they turn over the large side profile of the rocket creates a lot of drag which pushes it down and your rocket starts tumbling out of control. In real life rockets start their gravity turn much sooner than 10km up, and have a very gradual turn. If you\u0027re using MechJeb, try setting the starting turn height to 1km, and the curve to 100%. Adding some tailfins near the bottom certainly doesn\u0027t hurt either, but the biggest thing is not turning over too quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are my lifter rockets using FAR: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/VEjQq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/VEjQq\u003C/a\u003E (mixed up the small one with large payload with medium sized one... oh well) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5uz30fhh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225uz30fhh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4aSW0xIh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224aSW0xIh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FooWGizh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FooWGizh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe large one can lift 70 tons into 100km orbit easily. The design is pretty simple: 3 stages to orbit. First stage fires all engines, which are cross-fed to the center (not asparagus staging, but I think it looks cooler when they all come off at once). Without FAR I usually started turning over just as these were dropped, but with FAR you should already have made some progress towards that 45 degree incline by the time the boosters run out of juice. There are sepratrons to clear away the boosters for the second stage, and they work fine even when tipped over. The second stage continues lifting the payload almost all the way to a circular orbit. In some cases it does *too* well and gets all the way into orbit -- I typically then restart the flight because second stage is not equipped to de-orbit itself and I try to avoid space debris. The third stage pops the fairings once above 70 km, and finishes pushing the payload to orbit, and then can either de-orbit, drive the payload to the space station, or sometimes it has enough dv to get a collision course to the mun/minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, FAR makes rockets much easier than stock IMO, but I\u0027ve always favored aerodynamic and aesthetic designs over 100% functional ones. I can even afford putting extra \u0022dead weight\u0022 for redundant systems and safety margins. Planes are also so much better, and I can actually apply the cool aerodynamic principles my dad is always blabbering on about \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hansman1982","CreatedById":62705,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T17:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will get screenshots later when I get back to the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to why I use mech jeb...it\u0027s easier (and I\u0027m guessing more realistic to actual launches (granted, I\u0027m sure in real life the rocket scientists do a lot more work before the launch in programming the launch)).

Basically, if your center of drag is above your center of mass, as is the case with many, if not most asparagus designs, then turning more than a few degrees off of prograde will cause the ship to become uncontrollable because it will be as if you had a parachute attached to the front of the rocket. You can address this two ways, and you should address it both ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you need to make sure your craft doesn\u0027t have a huge amount of drag at the top of it. Nose cones on everything, and fairings around anything that isn\u0027t aerodynamic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, you need to make gradual gravity turns, not the \u0022boost to 10K and then snap turn to 45 degrees\u0022 that are so common in stock KSP launches. The farther away from prograde your rocket is pointing, the more torque the offcenter drag will cause. I remember somewhere before the great forum oops that the FAR dev said that you shouldn\u0027t be farther than five degrees away from prograde during your launch. With enough control, I could manage 10 degrees, but anything more than that, while it could be done, wasn\u0027t practical as the ship started becoming more about controlling the craft than getting anything to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsparagus staging works fine in FAR, though it\u0027s less needed as realistic aerodynamics actually reduces the amount of delta-V you need to get into orbit.
