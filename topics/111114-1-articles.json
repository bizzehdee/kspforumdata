I essentially want to model a ksp ship through ?blender? or whatever program is necessary to do so. can someone point me in the right direction please? walkthroughs or advice? i already read the how to make a part walkthrough, but i want to make a ship that might only be one part... i want to recreate the engineers ship from the alien franchise, the derelict spaceship on lv426 and the one that launches from lv223. I do want this craft to be able to fly but it doesnt need to be \u0027legal\u0027 regarding physics in any way. ive got several other little questions about improving my setup, if anyone feels well versed in .23-.25 mods please lend a hand. i would be very grateful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
