Up to this point my career mode has been a slightly RP-ish Apollo style manned program and a limited unmanned program (few probes to Mun and Minmus and a whole lot of commercial satellites to pay the bills.) Now I\u0027ve been playing for a few months (steam says I\u0027m up to 170 hours now) but this will be my first career mode play-through to more or less complete everything in Kerbin\u0027s SOI. So I\u0027m not entirely sure what I\u0027m going to do after I\u0027m done with my next two missions so i thought I would share the basic plan I\u0027ve come up with and see if you guys had any suggestions or thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to give a quick rundown of my current status; I\u0027ve fully upgraded the KSC and fully unlocked the tech tree. I\u0027ve already gone ahead and started a few strategies to convert the science I have and any future gains in to either cash or rep (currently a 9/1 split). I got a large roster of about 50 Kerbals, the majority are scientists then engineers and then pilots. I\u0027ve got currently about 6.5 million in funds and I\u0027ve learned from my first career play-through and I make sure that after a few missions I do a bunch of contracts and refill the coffers. These last two missions will be a dual launch with the idea that the crew to Minmus (if i get my timing right) will arrive right before the crew to Mun and basically i will run both missions at the same time. This is something I did to see if I can manage to run multiple missions at once. Other active missions include a basic probe on its way to low solar orbit and another on its way to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now onto my plan; My main focus and the focus of my manned program will be the construction of my first space station. The main section and the first section I\u0027m going to build will the be main service mods and the science labs (2 or 3?) plus a few experiments so the crew can keep the labs running and generate science and therefore cash. The next bit to be built will two docking areas for visiting craft along with two areas for the assembly of future vessels in orbit. Also i will add several fuel tanks so the station can act as a refueling point for future missions. Finally once the station is fully operational I\u0027m going to start building at least two large interplanetary ships. While I\u0027m still nailing down what I want to do with those i do know that I want them to be able to reach another SOI and return to Kerbin orbit, carry at least two crews (the flight crew for the vessel itself and two exploration crews that will take SSTO shuttles down to the planet/moon), have some ability to mine and process its own fuel, and carry at least one lab to process the science the ground teams collect. During the building of the station and the ships my secondary focus will be sending probes and rovers to most other planets and moons in preparation for future manned missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this is a truly rough outline of my plan and i bet I\u0027m forgetting something but its late (nearly 1 am) and I wanted to get out there while it was still fresh in my head, so here it is. Anywho, I would love to hear any feedback you guys have. So please feel free to ask me anything. And thanks. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T13:54:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t read the wall of text because I am a lazy so and so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Go to Duna man.

Perusing the forum will provide you with many ideas on new mission concepts with varying degrees of difficulty. Duna mission? SSTO? How about a Moho orbiter, or an Eve sample return? Space stations are fun, however in my experience, new players tend to make them too big, but hey, that\u0027s fun too.
