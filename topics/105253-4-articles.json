Essentially, most welfare programs are run as entitlement programs, in which the government must send X amount of money to people who show Y reason that they deserve it. These programs don\u0027t need to have Congress pass a law every year giving them money; such programs (there are other kinds as well) are called mandatory spending, because the money is spent unless Congress intervenes to change things. Discretionary spending is the opposite; Congress needs to explicitly pass an appropriations act every year to spend money on discretionary things. Here\u0027s the thing: Defense spending is virtually all discretionary, while welfare spending is largely mandatory. So, by ignoring money that must be spend and only counting money Congress explicitly voted to spend this year, you get defense as a huge part of federal spending. If you consider *all* federal spending, you get defense as less than a fifth of *federal* spending; it\u0027s even less if you consider that the feds spend just a bit over half of US government spending, and states spend almost nothing on defense (they do, however, spend *lots* on education, as do local governments).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically: Before you believe something you read about US government spending, look at \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E what it\u0027s saying. If it\u0027s talking about percent of discretionary spending, that means that it\u0027s excluding the spending that the US government will do if Congress doesn\u0027t pass anything about anything (which is largely welfare). If it\u0027s talking about federal spending in general, know that the US federal government specializes in different things than state governments and local governments; for instance, education, which gets *lots* of money but very little of it at the federal level (similarly, defense gets very little money at the state level).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T08:26:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s simply the problem of money.

NASA should be pushing the leading edge of space technology, not having other companies do it for them. And if NASA is not going to push the edge they are going to end up being a regulatory agency like the FAA or the FDA. I am not saying they should throw caution to the wind, but they should NOT be afraid of failure and they should be less cautious development.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022alexman142\u0022 data-cite=\u0022alexman142\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThe whole Space Shuttle debacle taught us many things.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit was not as much as a debacle as people thought it was. It did not live up to its design or press requirements but that is because there were too many cooks in the kitchen. The main reason why the shuttle was designed the way it was was because of the USAF. Originally all military payloads would have been launched on the Shuttle. As such the payload bay was much bigger than NASA wanted it to be. (The USAF getting involved was because of funding issues) The shuttle also had to have the capability to land AT the launch site after ONE orbit of the earth. This was a hard requirement to fulfill and thus caused the design to be bigger and heavier. Over all if NASA had been able to design the shuttle it wanted and not the one the USAF wanted it MIGHT have been better than what it ended up being. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though the shuttle had issues it could do things that no other spacecraft can or could. It could take off with a large payload and then land on a runway with said payload still in the cargo bay. It had a great UP mass capability and an astounding Down mass capability. It was the only craft flown to ORBIT that landed like a plane. and it helped do a ton of science that would not have been possible without it. Also the ISS would have been a LOT smaller and made up of more pieces had the shuttle not aided in the construction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022alexman142\u0022 data-cite=\u0022alexman142\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3E3E3E;\u0022\u003EThe true test of Space Flight is making it affordable.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes it is, but NASA is a research organization.
