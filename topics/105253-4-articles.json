More than 2 times the annual budget of NASA.\n\nThat is stupid, to fight what war?? They had 6 times more budget than arabia and like 20 times more army, and if arabia attack someone, all the other countries needs to answer, so is not USA alone.. which by the way they spent the same than the rest of the world combined.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Science isn\u0027t supposed to be a popularity contest or a gladiatorial sideshow. The MSL and Philae landings showed that many non space-minded people can get excited about robotic missions and maybe even be inspired by them. Maybe not as much as boots on the ground on Mars might, but at the risk of sounding like a broken record, I\u0027d rather that the limited budgets that are available be focused on the highest scientific ROI rather than \u0022inspiring the masses\u0022 (whatever that means).\n\nYou dont need to remplace all probes missions with manned mission. The same that you can not remplace the need for manned missions with probes missions.. \n\nI can not say it any clearer than that. Probes already did what they suppose to did.. now is our turn to go venus or mars.\n\nThe same will be true for an under ice europa mission, first you sent probes, then after some missions if there is still a good potential for discoveries or goals, you sent a manned mission (in case you can deal with radiation).\n\nAnd if NASA management are smart, they will do every once a while what people wants!\n\nBecause that is money from the US citizens, and they will allow huge budgets if they like what they see.\n\nAlso is a way to decrease army expenditures.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E True. My point is that people usually mischaracterize US spending as being \u002250% military\u0022 when in fact only ~20% of US federal spending is military, and that drops a bunch of you include even just State spending. The US is better compared to the entire EU. Also, people fail to realize that the majority of US spending is social programs by a long shot.\n\nfrom 50% to 20%?? you really believe that? sources?\n\nAlso the cost of welfare is to counter the weapons that they also sale to the zones of conflict.\n\nTake a look what it will happen if US citizens keep voting wrong or ignoring this problem:\n\n![af5fc983b13833a5f04b80ad42a6a15d.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/af5fc983b13833a5f04b80ad42a6a15d.png)\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures)\n\nThis is the budget predicted for the 2045 in case USA dont reduce its budget..\n\nThe stupidest army race in the history.. And eventually USA will lost against China of course.\n\nAll that to what???? They can not enter in war... is silly. Nobody can today.. The only they can do is encourage civil wars in afrika to sale more weapons to them, and once every a while enter in those conflicts to said... stop fighting between you two (as excuse, to move all your army and show that is \u0022usefull\u0022)\n\nMeanwhile the real threat is terrorism which can not be stopped with armies, in fact is encourage by them.\n\nAnd all the democracy countries who spent ZERO in defence.. had no problem and not risk to enter in any war or conflict.\n\nTo all US citizens... you need to pressure your goverment to stop this madness. Only then the world would be able to focus in the space."},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T07:22:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E from 50% to 20%?? you really believe that? sources?\n\u003E \n\u003E Also the cost of welfare is to counter the weapons that they also sale to the zones of conflict.\n\n\u0022Welfare\u0022 refers to *domestic* programs. I\u0027m unclear how that can be \u0022to counter the weapons sold to the zones of conflict.\u0022 As for a source, [here](http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go) is a think-tank source on a US budget breakdown for FY2014. 24% on Social Security, 24% on four major national health-insurance programs, 18% on \\*all\\* defense spending, 11% for more social safety net programs, 7% for interest on the debt, and the rest to all other federal spending.\n\nHigh numbers for defense spending are the result of someone ignoring 60% of federal spending for procedural reasons. Essentially, most welfare programs are run as entitlement programs, in which the government must send X amount of money to people who show Y reason that they deserve it. These programs don\u0027t need to have Congress pass a law every year giving them money; such programs (there are other kinds as well) are called mandatory spending, because the money is spent unless Congress intervenes to change things. Discretionary spending is the opposite; Congress needs to explicitly pass an appropriations act every year to spend money on discretionary things. Here\u0027s the thing: Defense spending is virtually all discretionary, while welfare spending is largely mandatory. So, by ignoring money that must be spend and only counting money Congress explicitly voted to spend this year, you get defense as a huge part of federal spending. If you consider \\*all\\* federal spending, you get defense as less than a fifth of \\*federal\\* spending; it\u0027s even less if you consider that the feds spend just a bit over half of US government spending, and states spend almost nothing on defense (they do, however, spend \\*lots\\* on education, as do local governments).\n\nBasically: Before you believe something you read about US government spending, look at *exactly* what it\u0027s saying. If it\u0027s talking about percent of discretionary spending, that means that it\u0027s excluding the spending that the US government will do if Congress doesn\u0027t pass anything about anything (which is largely welfare). If it\u0027s talking about federal spending in general, know that the US federal government specializes in different things than state governments and local governments; for instance, education, which gets \\*lots\\* of money but very little of it at the federal level (similarly, defense gets very little money at the state level)."},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T08:26:20Z","Content":"It\u0027s simply the problem of money.

If anything, the American regime will become even more militarily focused and even less space focused over the next few decades.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The SLS will get canceled due to short-sighted politicians, and we\u0027ll be left with no manned spaceflight outside of Musk at all.\n\nI agree, the SLS will suffer from the same fate as the buran or Ares-1X. I do not agree, however, that SpaceX will be the only manned space launcher left. While they will be the only one in North America, China and India will continue to fire people into space long after NASA, the ESA and the Russian space agency become virtually dead.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E China and India aren\u0027t more likely to send humans beyond LEO than NASA, unless they get a big budget boost.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E India and China need to boost their space budget by a large margin then and even though they could, they don\u0027t plan to. SpaceX doesn\u0027t have a budget like a national space agency has.\n\nThey actually *do* plan to increase their space budgets, both due to political interest, and as a side effect for the nations\u0027 rapidly growing economies. India is already building a manned capsule for launch in 2016, and China isn\u0027t putting any major barriers in front of its SLS-like mega launch vehicle.\n\nAs for SpaceX, they are already making enough money to begin developing the required technologies for their mars missions, and they will become much wealthier once reusability brings down launch costs. This is because launching satelites will be cheaper and hence more customers will do it. And since SpaceX will develop reusability sooner than other launch companies, they will get even more customers who would otherwise choose other companies for their satelites. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E They will really invest money and time to do a Manned Mission on Mars only if it is financially interesting to do, and currently, it\u0027s not.\n\nYou really think that? There are so many ways the colonization of mars could bring SpaceX profits like it has never seen before. Some examples:\n\n- Even if only one in a million people in the united states alone is capable and willing to live on the mars colony for an initial travel cost of $10 million, that gives SpaceX over $3 billion, just from people wanting to get to mars.\n\n- Right now, soil samples from the lunar surface are practically worth their weight in plutonium, and mars rocks will be just as valuable. While the influx of mars soil samples will weaken its value, it will still be a commodity comparable with gold or diamond.\n\n- If just grabbing the dirt isn\u0027t enough, mining the ore underneath could be very profitable. Remember, we are talking about an entire planet that has been left alone for 4.5 billion years, slowly building up mineral deposits from asteroid strikes.\n\n- Even if mining minerals from mars itself isn\u0027t getting the trillions of dollars you want, mars would make a great waystation for spacecraft heading outwards towards the asteroid belt, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of minerals *p* *er* asteroid\n\n- Tourism could also be quite profitable. There have already been people who spent tens of millions of dollars just to get a joyride to the ISS. The surface of mars would be even more exciting, and there will inevitably be many millionaires wanting to go there\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Right now countries needs to stop making new weapons or keep putting money in army research, because is completely pointless today.\n\nI agree. Since when did peaceful diplomacy become so uncool? Right off the top of my head I can name three nuclear wars just waiting to happen..\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The graphs that show a dire decline in NASA\u0027s budget are almost always showing NASA\u0027s budget as a share of the U.S.\u0027s total budget, which is irrelevant.\n\nIt is completely relevant! It shows how much the American government values space exploration compared with everything else! I could even say it is more relevant than the budget itself!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Roscosmos\u0027s budget got a big boost in 2013 and has been steadily increasing for the last five years.\n\nThat graph shows the budget up to 2013, which is just before Sanctions, political unrest, oil problems and everything else blew a smoldering crater in the Russian economy.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The economic benefits for space exploration come decades after the investment. It\u0027s hard to justify spending large sums of cash for a return on your investment years down the road when investing in smaller scale infrastructure gives you an almost immediate, all be it much smaller return.\n\nElon Musk and Xi Jinping have both made it very clear they are both looking on the long-term end of the scale.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What USA budget *should* be:\n\u003E \n\u003E  10% - NASA\n\u003E \n\u003E  7.5% - military (gets higher in war time if war started by another country, goes to zero if we want to start a war)\n\u003E \n\u003E  35% - education\n\u003E \n\u003E  20% - infastructure\n\u003E \n\u003E  15% - other\n\u003E \n\u003E  everything left over - paying back debt\n\u003E \n\u003E  military overlaps with government\n\u003E \n\u003E  other is research and police/paramedics/firefighters\n\nWe should do this plan. I like this plan. Are you going to be busy with anything in 2016? If not, you should run for president.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Take a look in apollo program, at one point was cancelled just for one reason.. **lack of public interest.**\n\nAnd a presidential change. And the Vietnam war.

When one country has a higher military budget than every other country on earth combined, you know we have a problem.\n\nAnd the things they are doing with that money is... horrifying.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Take a look what it will happen if US citizens keep voting wrong or ignoring this problem:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![af5fc983b13833a5f04b80ad42a6a15d.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/af5fc983b13833a5f04b80ad42a6a15d.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...y_expenditures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures)\n\u003E \n\u003E  This is the budget predicted for the 2045 in case USA dont reduce its budget..\n\u003E \n\u003E  The stupidest army race in the history.. And eventually USA will lost against China of course.\n\nThis... is terrifying. To be fair, the growing budgets of India and China are largely just because they have rapidly growing economies, so expect the same kind of growth with their space programs. Also, when china transitions towards a democracy they will inevitably ease off on their military force, persuading its rival India to do the same. India also won\u0027t have to worry about Pakistan any more, so its military will be weakened further.\n\nAnyway, enough of my ranting for now, what\u0027s your opinions?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:29:13Z","Content":"My opinion is that you should have read the post immediately previous to yours.\n\nEdit: Sorry, ChrisSpace, that was harsher than I like to be.

Sure, China is doing cool things, but I doubt that they can get to the moon anytime in the near future; they are all talk right now. Their budget is lower than even Russia, so I highly doubt that they can do it. Even if by some miracle they manage to get to the moon, who would really care? We have done it already and the moon offers nothing of value. We can\u0027t colonize it, we can\u0027t terraform it, heck, we can\u0027t live on it. We\u0027ve done it already, lets move on.\n\nIndia doesn\u0027t even want to. \n\nSpace X? Space X is basically NASA at this point. Them and and United Launch Alliance would not be around if it weren\u0027t for the United States as a customer for their services. \n\nNASA is taking it cautiously, which I support whole heartily. As much as I hate to say it, we need to take our time. We needed the ISS to learn how to live in low gravity for long periods of time. The whole Space Shuttle debacle taught us many things.

This is a TERRIBLE argument. Remember **WHY** we went to the moon. It was to beat the USSR to the moon. Once it was obvious that we had reliable rockets and that we landed on the moon and the USSR had 3 explosions of their moon rocket and cancelled it there was no reason for the US to continue to go to the moon or to push on to mars. As a side note, the USSR severely beat the US in the Space Race. The only thing that we beat them in are some long term spacecraft (voyager, surveyor) and getting to mars (and doing !SCIENCE!), and landing on the moon. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Space X? Space X is basically NASA at this point. Them and and United Launch Alliance would not be around if it weren\u0027t for the United States as a customer for their services.\n\nSpaceX is **NOT** NASA. and they are two different organizations and have different goals. Without getting too much into the politics. NASA is very constrained by the US government, who controls the budget (congress) and the direction (executive). NASA\u0027s goal has been changing about every 8 (sometimes 4 years) as the presidents change. Also NASA has to cover almost all of Aerospace Science. So NASA does not have a bunch of money to spend. SpaceX on the other hand is (currently) a launch provider. They provide the rocket, they don\u0027t really deal with the payload design and manufacturing (yet). YES they are making Dragon V2 (DragonRider) and have made and flown Dragon (cargo only). They are not responsible for large amounts of aerospace science. So SpaceX is **NOT** NASA. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E NASA is taking it cautiously, which I support whole heartily. As much as I hate to say it, we need to take our time.\n\nThis is the wrong idea. In the 50s and 60s most of the rockets NASA launched failed. Even the great Saturn V had tons of development issues. NASA needs to stop being so worried about the safety and being OVERLY cautious and get back to testing things. NASA should be pushing the leading edge of space technology, not having other companies do it for them. And if NASA is not going to push the edge they are going to end up being a regulatory agency like the FAA or the FDA. I am not saying they should throw caution to the wind, but they should NOT be afraid of failure and they should be less cautious development.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The whole Space Shuttle debacle taught us many things.\n\nit was not as much as a debacle as people thought it was. It did not live up to its design or press requirements but that is because there were too many cooks in the kitchen. The main reason why the shuttle was designed the way it was was because of the USAF. Originally all military payloads would have been launched on the Shuttle. As such the payload bay was much bigger than NASA wanted it to be. (The USAF getting involved was because of funding issues) The shuttle also had to have the capability to land AT the launch site after ONE orbit of the earth. This was a hard requirement to fulfill and thus caused the design to be bigger and heavier. Over all if NASA had been able to design the shuttle it wanted and not the one the USAF wanted it MIGHT have been better than what it ended up being. \n\nEven though the shuttle had issues it could do things that no other spacecraft can or could. It could take off with a large payload and then land on a runway with said payload still in the cargo bay. It had a great UP mass capability and an astounding Down mass capability. It was the only craft flown to ORBIT that landed like a plane. and it helped do a ton of science that would not have been possible without it. Also the ISS would have been a LOT smaller and made up of more pieces had the shuttle not aided in the construction. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E The true test of Space Flight is making it affordable.\n\nYes it is, but NASA is a research organization. The bill should be second or third on the list of priorities, not the only thing on the list like it is now. Let NASA do the research and companies like SpaceX and ULA and Ariane make cheap, reliable launchers.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E NASA is on a clear sustainable path, which I applaud them for.\n\nno they are not. The path of nasa changes every 4 or 8 years. sometimes faster if congress gets involved because of pork barrel politics... \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOver all the future is not TOOOOOO dark.
