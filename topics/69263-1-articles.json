However, remnants of the old system are still within the KSP folder. For example, the \u0022Internals\u0022, \u0022Parts\u0022, \u0022PluginData\u0022, \u0022Plugins\u0022, \u0022Resources\u0022, and \u0022Sounds\u0022 folders are all still in the root KSP folder, yet do not contain any files. All of the data previously within these is now in GameData/Squad, making these folders obsolete. I vaguely remember one of the developers (C7?) explaining that the old system will be kept in for a short period of time after 0.20 to allow modders to transfer their mods to the new system. They\u0027ve been given ample time and have transferred, so the folders are useless. Lastly, YES, I do realize that the folder takes up no space on my hard drive nor does it contribute to lag, it\u0027s just that the extra folders bug me (As if removing them would \u0022streamline\u0022 the game somehow).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks For Reading,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Flying! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T17:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, this hasn\u0027t been brought up recently so it\u0027s most likely pretty low on the to-do list, the best person to ask is Ted \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RazorWolf19","CreatedById":62293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T18:04:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game no longer requires or recognizes(I don\u0027t think) the folders, and, like I said, they\u0027re empty.
