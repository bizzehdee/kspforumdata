This imgur\u00A0post is the closest approximation I could find (but it\u0027s not entirely the same):\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/Kb8JnZT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/Kb8JnZT\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happens:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I plot a maneuver to a planet with a lot of moons (either gas giant Jool in the stock system\u00A0or ice giant Gateway in Linx\u0027 Beyond Home Planet Pack),\u00A0 the patched conics start\u00A0flickering. After a few seconds, the game starts freezing/stuttering, the maneuver node controls start freaking out (moving the node to a completely different point when adjusting prograde, radial, etc... along the projected orbit, patched conics dissapearing/appearing at random) and after about 30 seconds, the game gives up and crashes to desktop. Oh, and timewarping at different speeds causes the planets to shift forward and backward along their orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have gone through my \u0022Player.log\u0022 file, and while it is huge, the phrase \u0022[Orbit] SolveClosestApproach: solve took too many iterations, result incorrect\u0022 seems to take up large swathes. I have reduced the patched conics setting from maximum (6?) to 4, but that did nothing. I\u0027ll now try and set it to the minimum (2?), and see if that helps with anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone knows a solution for this or has encountered this sort of behaviour before, please let me know and I\u0027ll upload\u00A0the log file.
