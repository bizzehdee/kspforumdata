Any of the tugs that weren\u0027t already docked rear-end-first to the station were flipped around so that their rear tanks were docked to the station. These tanks will be left behind to hold any excess fuel that the tugs won\u0027t need to return to Kerbin. Hopefully the tanks will be used in the future to hold fuel that is mined from Laythe or Vall...but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E boys in Division 0.19 say they won\u0027t be able to deliver the mining and processing equipment as soon as they originally expected. In the case of the tug that brought the refueler payload (which is in the lower right), there was a game bug that prevented me from just separating the payload from the tug and leaving it attached to the station... I had to undock the refueler along with the Tug, then separate them, then re-dock the refueler, and then move the tug to the next port over. Annoying. (Happily, the program WILL allow me to disconnect the rear tanks and leave them on the station... I checked... apparently it has to do with whether the parts were connected in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or during an earlier orbital docking.)

Today was the start of Aldner\u0027s Big Mission: take the BirdDog rover/plane over to Fredoly Island and prove that it has the right stuff to explore other islands on Laythe. Mission planers also will allow him to explore other islands beyond Fredoly as long as he heads back to Laythe Base when his fuel level reaches 150/300 units. Despite what some people have said in the past (and was maybe even listed in parts info), the fuel can\u0027t be measured in liters... otherwise you get weird densities and mostly empty tanks, if you do the math. Anyway, below we see Aldner in the BirdDog after having left Fido Bay and reached his cruising altitude of 8000\u002B meters where he gets good fuel efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022V99fztv.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V99fztv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter an uneventful flight over the ocean, Aldner reaches the northern part of Fredoly Island (named for the second kerbal to land on Laythe, if you recall), and starts scouting out a possible landing location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zwIluB8.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zwIluB8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an important lesson: Aldner left Fido Bay early in the morning (he\u0027s always excited to get flying), but because he was heading west and because the plane flies faster than the rotation speed of Laythe, he ended up arriving at Fredoly Island\u00A0while Kerbol was quite low in the sky, so the lighting conditions were not great (although this does accentuate the ruggedness of the terrain and makes everywhere look uninviting).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SVWrA0D.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SVWrA0D.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter passing up all the so-so landing areas further east, Aldner decides that the peninsula on the far northwest corner of the island looks pretty good. He circles the BirdDog around and comes in for a landing roughly parallel to the wrinkles in the landscape (ignoring the dune-line texture).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RtQwJo8.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RtQwJo8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe landing is no problem, and he\u0027s safely on Fredoly Island at the place shown by the capsule icon on the map below. Dansen Island with Laythe Base is off the the far right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TvJrDDq.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TvJrDDq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst order of business on Fredoly? Take a nap. Aldner is a kerbal who appreciates a good nap...and there\u0027s not much point in getting to work while the sun is so low. Once the daylight is in full force, Aldner raises the nose gear to put the rover wheels on the ground and drives to the seashore. Below is an overview of the area for anybody pondering nice landing sites on Laythe. It\u0027s a moderately flat area, located about 6.4 degrees south of the equator. The lack of a lot of east-west extent would make landing from orbit tricky to target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022prOXvAi.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/prOXvAi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Yo, Thombles, my Main Man!

I\u0027d like to name this peninsula Jenfir Point, if you would please log that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022After that waitress who works at the Launch Pad Tavern? Aldner, we\u0027ve been through this before...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022No, sir! I\u0027m naming this after Jenfir Kerman, a very famous author from the 4th century.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022Ah. Who just happens to have the same name as the waitress from the Launch Pad Tavern.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Well, yes... now that you mention it, that\u0027s true. Very literary parents, Jenfir has.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022OK, Aldner. I can see that access to the Koogle search engine can be a dangerous thing in the wrong hands.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tcHKOjb.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tcHKOjb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gWJd5H0.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gWJd5H0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner headed southeast, and pretty soon he came up against ridge lines that were too steep to take head-on. The best way to handle these is to drive along at a sideways angle that allows you to keep going at around 10 m/s. The BirdDog can generally keep rising at a vertical speed of around 1 meter/second while doing this...and eventually you\u0027ll either top the rise or end up driving in a spiral around the hill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221A24dKF.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1A24dKF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you do cross a ridge line, be sure to take it more or less head-on. Early experiments driving around on the launch pad at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E showed that trying to drive ALONG a ridge line is dangerous because the wide spacing of the rear landing gear (which keeps the BirdDog nice a stable driving sideways along a slope) can result in bottoming out the center of the rover and damaging the jet engine. One of the reasons the BirdDog uses a standard jet engine instead of a turbojet engine is because the turbojet is longer and more easily damaged. Also note that the rear landing gear are not mounted directly on the underside of the wing, but are connected to small cubic struts that are attached to the wing to give the rear of the plane a little extra ground clearance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O8q9yDy.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O8q9yDy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter driving up over ridges that exceeded 1 km in height, Aldner drove down to check out an interesting low-lying area at the end of a inlet (there is a map at the end of the report). I\u0027m always loath to give up my hard-won elevation because it takes a long time to drive back up slope... but one of the main points of this exploration trip is to check out possible base locations and landing sites. The area you see Aldner driving down into below has a fairly steep beach, but there is a moderate-sized flat area behind the berm that separates the beach from the flat area. And for anybody who worries that Laythe is obviously volcanically active and therefore subject to occasional tsunamis, having the berm as a seawall might be a comfort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PHGEMno.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PHGEMno.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Yo, Mr. T! Do you copy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022I hear you Aldner. What\u0027s up?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022I\u0027m at a nice little site on the end of a long inlet. I\u0027d like to name it Klaudiya Cove if you\u0027d be so kind as to log that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022That would be named after Klaudiya Kerman, the famous historian from the 3rd century Ephebian Empire?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022... Why, yes. I didn\u0027t know you were the historical type, Thompbles old boy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022I\u0027m not. But I know how to use Koogle, too, you know. And I\u0027m pretty familiar with your favorite waitresses.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022I see why you get paid the big bucks, Cappy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022That\u0027s right. And remember to say hi to Klaudiya from me the next time you\u0027re at the Booster Bay Bar. Base out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ktq42Cw.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ktq42Cw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner finds his first rock at an elevation of 1.4 km, so he stops for some samples. Note that we don\u0027t have the darn resource sensing equipment yet, so Aldner is regularly taking soil samples in sealed containers that can be tested later after the appropriate equipment eventually arrives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022afLDYkV.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/afLDYkV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow we see the BirdDog at 2335 meters elevation, topping his highest ridge yet. Notice that the sand dune terrain has given way to a darker terrain that shows what are possibly very eroded impact features. I suppose this (and higher rocky areas) are what gets eroded into all that sand we see at lower elevations. I\u0027d really like some radioactive dating equipment to test the local geology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bzdhT4o.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bzdhT4o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing about going way up in elevation...is that you have to come back down. And driving downhill can be some of the most dangerous parts of roving. But Aldner hasn\u0027t been having any problems with the BirdDog going downhill, so he\u0027s been letting it go a little faster coming down each ridge, even catching a little \u0022air\u0022 from time to time as he passes over a ridge bump on the way down a big slope. But the BirdDog is an airplane...so getting airborne shouldn\u0027t be a problem, right? Below, the BirdDog goes over a sudden drop on a downslope and lands hard, blowing both rover wheels. Happily, the plane still handles well with the blown tires (no careening and crashing). The BirdDog was only going at a speed of 29 m/s when the wheels blew here...but the weight of the plane and the drop distance were enough to blow the wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NTHmnmZ.gif\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NTHmnmZ.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner sets the brake, lowers the nose gear to jack up the front of the plane, and then gets out to fix the wheels. A kerbal is such a handy thing to have along on a rover. Below, the rover wheels still need fixing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224LjYBR3.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4LjYBR3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s another animated GIF of the speeding BirdDog topping a ridge...but this time the suspension absorbs enough of the shock that the tires don\u0027t blow. Note that I always have the Avionics package on when flying or roving the BirdDog for extra stability enhancement. After zooming over another downhill ridge line at over 35 m/s, the BirdDog blew another wheel (only one this time) and it still handled well during the braking to a stop. Good stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022U6zRSnX.gif\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U6zRSnX.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter several ups and downs over ridges in the 2000-2300 meter elevation range and depressions in the 1200-1500 meter elevation range, Aldner comes into view of a big basin area that bottoms out at just under 1000 meters. If you are looking to set up a big inland base area and don\u0027t care about easy sea access, this would be a nice area. Especially if you like scenic mountains off in the distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bX0KJzg.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bX0KJzg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe view below shows the Big Basin area and the general route that the BirdDog took to reach it.

The little depression below (reached from the Big Basin after driving over a kilometer\u002B tall ridge) is as close as you get in this area with a elevation of just 150 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TxHGaaf.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TxHGaaf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Aldner started driving up out of the low depression, Kerbol was getting low in the sky and the rover started draining the batteries faster than the solar cells could recharge them, so Aldner stopped by a big rock to collect more samples and make camp for the night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bsM8qKf.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bsM8qKf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, Aldner sits by the ol\u0027 campfire (just imagine a campfire there) and does a little star and moon gazing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YHXsoF7.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YHXsoF7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next day, Aldner drove further south and decided to see what that lighter-colored material is that makes up the tops of the mountains. This required careful driving at a shallow angle along some steep slopes (see below) as he wound his way up and around a small mountain. The very wide spacing of the rear landing gear of the BirdDog lets it handle slopes like this, but you need to constantly be jogging the right-turn key with quick presses about once a second to keep the nose from wandering downhill. And each time you tap the key, the right landing gear wheel almost lifts up off the ground. Exciting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wO0geWy.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wO0geWy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPartway up the mountain ridge, Aldner came to a flat area where he could park, rest a bit, and collect some more samples, and he noticed that the the upper limb of Jool could be seen peeking above the atmospheric haze. I didn\u0027t think you could see Jool from Fredoly Island, but I was wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZP0DyyU.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZP0DyyU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally Aldner made it to the top of the mountain ridge. It wasn\u0027t the highest point, since there was a higher mountain peak if he\u0027d kept driving north, but this was as high as he wanted to go (3481 meters).

No? I\u0027ll tell you anyway. Because of the wobbly Damned Robotics hinges, driving that rover isn\u0027t nearly as much fun as driving the BirdDog (it has to be kept at a slower speed), but the boys have been driving slowly north from Gusten Bay, sticking close to the coastline. They found a nice beach at 13.6 degrees north latitude, which Nelemy named Corfrey Beach after a fellow kerbalnaut who was with him on the Pol \u0026amp; Bop mission (and a stint at Minmus Moonbase).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ye1DYiZ.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ye1DYiZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bzA3Lyl.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bzA3Lyl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen they headed inland to go see a couple small lakes.

He decided to drive (the point was to test out the rover, after all). The drive down was surprisingly easy. It was steep, but there were no surprise bumps to cause problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hgaNPcc.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hgaNPcc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the bottom of the run, Aldner found a nice beach at about 25 degrees south latitude with a view across the way to the next island over. So he got out to stretch his legs and do a little sampling, then hopped back into the BirdDog and fired up the jet engine and said aloha to Fredoly Island.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227R7CvL0.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7R7CvL0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Qbp35Se.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Qbp35Se.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe distance to the next island over was not too far, so he only climbed up to around 4500 meters before making an approach to a moderately flat area raised up a short distance above sea level.

By then he was kind of bored with roving, so he decided to do more flying. He took off from the depression, headed west up the hill (speed fast enough for takeoff...pull up...land is rising..pull up more...more...excellent) then turned northwest to fly over the interior mountains of Kelby Island.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002237ZoSU8.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/37ZoSU8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221JjKmWj.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1JjKmWj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner scouted along the west coast of Kelby Island looking for potential base sites. There was a moderately nice beach area that rose to a higher-elevation, moderately bumpy area to the north. Possible base area...certainly would be an accessible area if it had good resources. Aldner named it Lambert Landing after the third kerbal on the historic Duna mission (the first kerbal to land on Ike). The landing was a bit of a surprise because he overshot the flatter area of the beach and ended up landing on a bit of an upslope...but part of this mission was learning to land in imperfect terrain, so that was fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KrpxqgQ.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KrpxqgQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some quick sampling and surveying, Aldner took off again and headed north quite a ways to the next island (as yet unnamed). Much of that island is mountainous, but there was a likely looking lowland area jutting out from the west coast at about 6.5 degrees south latitude, so he took the BirdDog in to a little peninsula by a bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tC6VgW1.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tC6VgW1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time he experimented with landing the plane along the shallow slope parallel to the shoreline, with no problems (animated GIF below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ojDL1kE.gif\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ojDL1kE.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Yo, Skipper!

Once the comm link was back, he named it Bill Lake after Bill Kerman, famous kerbalnaut. Also, since the BirdDog was down to 152 units of fuel, this was going to be Aldner\u0027s last stop before heading home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228FjuUI3.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8FjuUI3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting back out from Bill Lake was a bit tricky. Do a downhill run and hope to pull up quick enough to avoid splashdown? No thanks. Sideways run along the steep slope? Doesn\u0027t appeal either. So Aldner drove the BirdDog up the slope at an angle to reach a somewhat more level area higher up. This turned out to be a difficult drive...he got stuck in one place where the slope was getting too steep to drive and he had to do a backwards turnaround at the expense of some hard-won elevation to head back the other direction. Anyway, he got to the flatter area (which wasn\u0027t as flat as it looked), then fired up the jet engine and headed south. The ground almost immediately dropped away as the plane bumped over a little ridge, but it stayed in the air... heading straight toward the mountain slope to the south. Pull up. Pull up. But not too much! The BirdDog is more skittish in pitch as it uses up its fuel...so don\u0027t pull up too much. The BirdDog skirted the mountain slope while Aldner laughed maniacally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wxyZx14.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wxyZx14.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner headed southeast so that he could overfly the site where Fredoly Kerman originally made the second landing on Laythe. It\u0027s an arc of relatively low-lying dunes between 2 and 3 degrees south latitude. A good landing site because it\u0027s close to the equator and has good east-west extent for targeting errors, but it does leave you on the smaller arc of land and not on the main bulk of Fredoly Island. But maybe we\u0027ll be lucky and this is where some useful resources will be located.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225LAEcBM.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5LAEcBM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOut over open ocean, watching the fuel level drop... it sure was nice to see Dansen Island finally rear up over the horizon.

There were some who recommended the turbojet (which I tried in my first version of the plane) and others who recommended the standard jet engine. I got the impression that the guys recommending the turbojet did so because they spend a lot of time zipping along high in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere building up speed to get an SSTO spaceplane into orbit, or traveling long distances, and that\u0027s where the turbojet is clearly King. It also may have an edge on Laythe in that the atmosphere on Laythe is thinner, so its equivalent to flying around Kerbin at a higher altitude. But for shorter hops between close islands or loitering at low altitudes (things the BirdDog also needs to do), the regular jet engine has the advantage. I suspect that my intended flight profiles on Laythe called for tradeoffs that would make either engine acceptable...but when the needs of the BirdDog also being a ROVER are figured into the mix, the standard jet engine gets the edge because it is more compact and less likely to get knocked off by hitting obstructions on the surface. If you want to build a version mainly for flying long distances at high altitudes on Kerbin, the turbojet may be the better choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding extra fuel tanks: When I was testing the BirdDog, I tried adding two more fuel tanks behind the ram air intakes. But that made the plane (with a nearly-full fuel load, anyway) fly like a cow, and I would always crash it when I tried to land. I think it doesn\u0027t have enough wing area for all that extra weight (of maybe it just needed more landing gear to support that weight on landing). I\u0027m not sure...but whereas I (a newbie to the SPH) have been able to get the BirdDog in and out of sites with limited area, I could not get the fat version to land safely. If you were just going to add drop tanks and never tried to land the plane with those drop tanks still on, I think the plane would get you to anyplace in Kerbin and back. I did not pursue the drop-tanks idea because I would have no easy way to reattach drop tanks on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only warning about flying the BirdDog is to be careful about not pitching up too much, which you can easily do if the avionics package is turned off (I guess this is the price you pay for a plane that that lift off in short distances). But I have been amazed by the ability of the plane (when it did pitch up out of control on me in Kerbin test flights) to just keep doing tight loops at low altitudes when I was sure it would smash into the ground. I got out of that situation by rolling over at the top of the loop, and that got me back to horizontal flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T22:32:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kromey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kromey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh, by the way, on your mysterious disappearing solar panels: I\u0027ve seen it with the smaller folding panels that sometimes clipping through objects makes them shatter, although most of the time they behave as if the obstruction isn\u0027t there.
