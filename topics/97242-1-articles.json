Having an impossible time trying to get satellites into the orbit required. I couldn\u0027t do it without MechJeb, and I can\u0027t do it with MechJeb. Do I need to circularize first, then do apoapsis, then periapsis, then inclination and finally longitude of ascending node?? I\u0027m not even sure how to plug in the numbers for the latter. Invariably I end up with an orbit that approximates what is called for, but is off in some way. Trying to execute my own radial, normal- or anti-normal burns seems to accomplish nothing. I guess I\u0027m too slow for MechJeb even? The MechJeb autopilot, when used with ascent guidance, seems to take me into random encounters with the Mun etc if I call for the altitude of orbit asked for (18,692,804 meters, or about 18,692 k(?)). I\u0027m open to pointers or suggestions; want to play the game properly but tempted to use the \u0027debug\u0027 key to cheat-complete all the satellite contracts I\u0027ve foolishly take on.
