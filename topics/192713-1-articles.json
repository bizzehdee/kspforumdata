This kind of rail setup could be used for everything from robotic arms to heavy cargo landers. Not to mention potential uses as a monorail or train system, if scaled up. This sort of thing is technically already possible in stock, but wheels have always been lackluster in KSP and the setups tend to be high part count and low reliability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBreaking Ground could use some pulleys, winches and ropes, too, but that\u0027s another topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-29T00:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith wheels, yep, it\u0027s hard, but we have some other rotating things.
