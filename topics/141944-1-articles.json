The day is also 1. Today is the day that the Kerman family has undertaken a new mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldy go where no kerbal has gone before: another star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few decades ago, the discovery was made by the Kerbal Space Center that there are a number of asteroids in Kerbol orbit with trajectories that bring them close enough to kerbin to be dangerous. Of course this sparked a huge investigation and subsequent missions to study the asteroids and redirect a few of the most dangerous ones. Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent that no matter how many they tracked and diverted, there were just too many to avoid them all. This realization, coupled with the discovery that the Klaw that was developed for these missions turned out to be a beacon for the Space Kraken, led to the demise of this program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey of course kept this a secret, since the news would have thrown Kerbin into panic, and probably started a colossal outcry for planetary kolonization on a massive scale. Unfortunately, this came right about the time that Umbra Space Industries released their new line of \u0022life support\u0022 equipment and the Astronaut Center began demanding that they be supplied with snacks and other supplies on long missions. After lengthy debate, the space program decided that the cost was simply too much and the company would be driven to financial ruin if they attempted this, dooming the space program and any hopes of even limited survival.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, certain kerbals of the Kerman family, high up in the KSC bureaucracy, were not so easily discouraged. They held a family meeting and decided to use their vast ancestral wealth and influence as one of the oldest and most respected families on Kerbin to build and launch their own kolonization attempt, with the goal of sending 16 brave kerbals to another star to set up a permanent, self-sustaining base that would survive if the entire Kerbolar system fell prey to the mysterious Kraken (rumors of its demise on Bop notwithstanding).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the recent breakthroughs in electric and nuclear propulsion by the Post-Terran Mining Corporation and Kerb Kastria Inc, research was done on the possibilities of a gernerations ship using such propulsion methods. However, it was ultimately discovered that that USI products were not capable of creating a closed life support loop in space and the risk of a Kraken attack with such a massive ship would be prohibitive. The entire project was put on hold for several years, while KSC continued tracking the near-Kerbin asteroids, losing money on every redirect mission and worrying that one day they would run out and one of the enormous E-class ones would strike the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, this all changed with the recent breakthroughs in warp propulsion by Umbra Space Industries and Mikel Alkubierre. A genius kerbal named Zefram Kerman took this advanced technology and created a fast, efficient interstellar warp drive capable of propelling a kolony ship to another star in just a few minutes. The Kerman family seized upon this concept and, after some preliminary research involving a secret FTL probe, decided that the technology was all in place to launch their much-hoped-for kolony ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn old launchpad, in a hidden valley on the other side of the world, was dusted off by a secret team and a team was created to make this goal a reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this time, the mission consists of four phases:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nTest a number of components to figure out exactly how much life support is necessary to support 16 kerbals indefinitely, such as:\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe life support capabilities of the Modular Kolonization Systems from USI\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe utility and resource tree of workshops from OSE\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe feasibility of constructing extrasolar launch facilities in collaboration with Kairyuu Shipping.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScout nearby star systems with a series of FTL probes to discover the perfect planet to kolonize.\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThis will also be the test for the as-yet hypothetical transwarp drive, which cannot function inside a star system.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nResearch and assemble the ship, hopefully on another planet to preserve secrecy.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTravel to the target system and set up a new civilization.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, out of character.

As soon as we get back to Kerbin we\u0027ll be taken to our new headquarters and given further details.\u0022 He looked up at Jeb. \u0022What\u0027s going on here? Why would they discharge us? We\u0027re the most famous Kerbals in the Space Program!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb thought for a moment, not sure what to say. \u0022I think they probably have something more exciting and dangerous for us to do and they don\u0027t anyone to know about it until we\u0027ve done it successfully. Maybe they want us to go confirm the rumors about the Kraken on Bop,\u0022 he laughed. \u0022That would cause an uproar. You know the KKK would try and stop us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob scoffed. He was familiar with the recent cultural phenomenon known as the Kraken Kultists of Kerbin, which recently had hit kerbal society like a class E asteroid. \u0022We should send all of \u003Cem\u003Ethem\u003C/em\u003E to Bop,\u0022 he said. \u0022I don\u0027t know why anyone thinks summoning the Kraken is a good idea.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded, just as Valentina floated in. \u0022Don\u0027t say its name, you\u0027ll draw its attention,\u0022 she said, looking reproachfully at Bob, who rolled his eyes and shook his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ve talked about this Val-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Never mind,\u0022 she cut him off. \u0022What was it you wanted to show us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb and Bob exchanged sideways glances. \u0022We\u0027re being discharged...\u0022 Bob began before Jeb interrupted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They\u0027re firing us because you forgot to water the greenhouse,\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah thanks Val,\u0022 Bob added and they both stared at Val with straight faces. Valentina flushed in embarrassment and opened her mouth to say something defensive, but right then Bill floated in from the workshop and asked, \u0022What\u0027s going on?\u0022 causing Jeb and Bob to burst out laughing. Bill joined in without knowing the joke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe were joking Val, it\u0027s not your fault,\u0022 explained Bob after the laughter died down. \u0022Seriously though, we\u0027re being discharged. There\u0027s some sort of secret program they\u0027re starting. They can\u0027t tell us the details but we\u0027re finding out in a few days after recovery,\u0022 he explained.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina pulled herself into another of the chairs and Bill did the same. \u0022Well, clearly they have an important thing for us to do,\u0022 reasoned the ever-calm Kerbette. \u0022Something like-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again she was cut off, this time by Bill. \u0022They probably found out that Minmus \u003Cem\u003EIS\u003C/em\u003E made of desert products and they don\u0027t want anyone to know!\u0022 he said excitedly.

Bill just shrugged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you think we\u0027ll find another planet like ours out there?\u0022 she asked, looking over at Bob, who shrugged and shook his head. \u0022I don\u0027t know. Laythe would almost fit the bill if it weren\u0027t so cold and salty. I doubt we\u0027ll ever find another planet quite like this one though.\u0022 He shook his head sadly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the flight was quiet, each kerbal contemplating the future and the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eGtV4m7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/eGtV4m7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re coming in over the hill now, landing in a few minutes,\u0022 came the intercom with the voice of the pilot, a young kerbette named Hayette who had been a test pilot with the Kerbal Space Program for a few months. None of the veterans had ever met her, although she was shaking in her seat with excitement to meet her heroes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I hope they choose good kerbals for our crewmates,\u0022 Bob said doubtfully, and the other three murmured their agreement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I hope this new headquarters has a bathroom,\u0022 said Jeb, met with much more fervent agreement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithin ten minutes the plane was landed, and the four were inside the underground bunker that served as headquarters, having discovered and benefited from the much-hoped-for facilities. They were standing around, chatting quietly and waiting for some official to come tell them where to go, when Hayette came bouncing into the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It was such an honor flying you,\u0022 she said enthusiastically. \u0022It\u0027s so exciting to finally meet you all. I\u0027ve been following your missions from Day 1. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m gonna go to another planet, with all of you! This is literally a dream come true.\u0022 Her grin was wider than a mk II spaceplane hull as she shook each of their hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If you five will follow me,\u0022 an older voice beckoned them from the hallway. Except for Hayette, who was busy realizing that she had been lumped into a group of five with her heroes and referred to as a single unit, the kerbonauts turned and met the eyes of Werner von Kerman himself, one of the highest ranking kerbals in the Program and inventor of the chemical rocket. Only Bob, the team scientist, had any sort of regular contact with him; the others had hardly ever even met him. Immediately, the tone turned serious as they followed the ageing scientist into the meeting hall, knowing that after this meeting their lives would never be the same again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-20T22:16:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2016 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ruiluth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDidn\u0026#039;t want my post merged\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ruiluth","CreatedById":60427,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-19T03:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey all, thanks for the interest!

In addition to spacious living quarters for the four of them, the base sported a lovely greenhouse with fantastic windows, a well-equipped science lab, and a control center with backup facilities and a fancy life support recycler. In addition there were resource harvesting machines and an ISRU refinery, and automated algae farms to process lunar material into fertilizer suitable for plants to grow in.

The plan at that point was to have two bases, one on a habitable world to live on and set up their primary colony, and another on a body more suited to mining and launching from. That way the starship would only have to carry enough facilities to set up the smaller base, and they could manufacture a more permanent one on site. Their current base was to be a test of this.
