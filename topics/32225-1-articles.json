When pressed for comment Jebediah stated \u0022At least half of those fatalities would have happened even without the faulty module.\u0022 This has caused mixed emotions. While some kerbals are angry, most point out the fact that we are buying our space program parts from a junkyard so defects are to be expected.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-09T23:33:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2013 11:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Oxytropis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShyzyIndustries","CreatedById":68772,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T23:27:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.
