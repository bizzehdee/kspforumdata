This is really overcomplicated and probably unreliable way to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on what you\u0027re doing, it might be easier to use a KAL controller attached to pitch/yaw controls that adjust the thrust limiter of engines to induce a thrust vector effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
