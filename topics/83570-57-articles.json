They\u0027re used in some information displays and in the camera menu, you can attach external cameras (JSI, ALCOR etc ones) and access those in the camera menu but sadly displays with information on top of the camera view doesn\u0027t let you pick which camera to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking ports also work as cameras in the docking view if set to the ship\u0027s reference part in the targeting menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MonaBabii","CreatedById":52027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T23:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight, okay.
