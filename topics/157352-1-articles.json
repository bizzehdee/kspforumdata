Make it so no internet speed it artificially reduced by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E or controled factors(obviously not everything would alway be max). Then when you get 6mbyte you always get 6 mbyte as your gauranteed max. If overall traffic is going to be near max then literally burst upward instead of allowing traffic downward. This then speeds up any traffic likely to going for long because of bandwidth vs size. So that any, or as much as you can, is spead up to speed up time of transport and get it off the network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay during primetime you can get 10-20% of bandwidth off the network ahead of time this would keep it at max speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could be done with any type of bandwidth but the Transmition of live media. Unless all live media were also delayed further to allow more time or the current time is utilized to some extent.(This would likely only get rid of channel hoppers.) All streaming like hulu, netflix, cableTV could then databurst your shows to allow your local maching to load then faster in resrever on the local machine. This solves multiple problems with current viewing of media that take a long time to view. And this actually being a large amount of the data could get rid of alot of traffic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen as the given \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s data is near 70/80/90% full they can ahead of time(as detecting overall data usage) burst this data to remove it from the network. they could also do mass bursts before prime time of anything likely to cover prime time that is a long term download on connections that are likely to be able to dl over. Say all medium to low data connections are flushed by giving it temporary bigger dl times and possibly bigger dl times before prime time. This done with the idea of removing stuff that will span during prime time that started before prime times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen all data advertisement speeds are minimum speeds on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would make everyone happy and is good business. Instead of slowing down things given in advertising you then get that minimum when possible or better. It also acts as an advertisement if you want higher speeds. Maybe you like getting greater speeds during prime time. If you need it during prime time those who need it and can afford it will upgrade. Those with less need will use less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never understood why internet traffic was based on limited speeds, and now data caps, when it\u0027s always potentially more beneficial to crank it to max and get stuff out of the way as often as possible... This then allows a no gaurantee for faster speeds but a good base speed you pay for similar to now or cheaper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think all that might be needed are new modem types or software to limit burst speeds past given \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E speed for internal network traffic controls. Then they don\u0027t burst past the internal network causing more clogs. Or similar things on the way to the LAN to offload traffic similarly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing faster dl times before primetime makes people spread it out more. Plus hardware could be made to make it more convenient to dl off times. If they stopped making cable tv based in all cases on form TV channels, or add a better backmethid for recording where you can record from any time from a backlog of shows and then allow the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E to send the show any time before the time you say to watch, then it could offload the dling with real burst to your DVR, etc. This could get network traffic done on a model of always giving data earlier than needed as much as possible instead of waiting to deal with it when it happens. A much wiser general philosophy. And it would lead to better methods of transmision. Although I always think also doing everything possible is good incase. We should cable TV design plus everything else because those methods always have advantages and are all useful in their own ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are lot of ways to reduce traffic if they are smart. All of it leads to more convenient technology that allows more options and helps all sides. There are also far more ways to get rid of network traffic ahead of time or encourage usage outside of those times, like TV recording when convenient off prime time hours if people were creative that also doesn\u0027t reduce and anger paying customers and accomplishes the goals of network management.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnically this all should have happened along time ago. As all network and other computer design should always use/be designed around all possible methods at the same time that are possible. This is good system design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-05T13:06:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2017 01:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-05T15:57:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI read something somewhere one time which stated that approximately 80% of the traffic (data) over the web is graphics related advertising content.
