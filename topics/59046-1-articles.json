I read up on physics on wikipedia instead of browsing KSP gameplay guides, and I found some things in that that blew my mind as I was able to replicate the effect exactly ingame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, you can reliably run almost \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E lander out of fuel trying to land on the Mun if you simply do it wrong enough. The basic gist is, your engines should be on as rarely as possible - and if they are, they should be on full throttle. Every moment your engines aren\u0027t on full throttle, you\u0027re wasting fuel. That is because you need a certain percentage of your engine power just to cancel out \u0022gravity drag\u0022, leaving the rest to do actual deceleration work. And if you throttle your engines down enough, then all you are doing is maintaining your status quo while not actually doing anything useful, while fuel is still being consumed. Maintaining the status quo is the worst possible thing you can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a practical example, I took a lander to the Mun and, after the initial intercept burn, left my engines on just a little bit, really low, enough to slowly float gently down to the surface. They took almost no fuel, and I was never in any danger of crash landing - until I ran out of fuel before even making it down to the surface simply because it took me so long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I took the exact same lander (loaded from a quicksave), and just let it freefall straight down to the Mun as fast as it wanted to go after intercepting. Once or twice, I did short, hard burns at full throttle to decelerate a bit and get a feel for how much height I would lose while canceling out a certain velocity, but even then, the less of that you do the better. Afterwards, I let it freefall again for a while. The landing made me a bit nervous, braking down from 400 m/s only a few thousand meters before touchdown, but then I afforded myself the luxury of floating the last 30-50 meters on low engine power. I landed, did my EVA, boarded again, hopped the lander a kilometer or two to a neighboring biome, landed again, did a second EVA, boarded again, launched back up from the Mun, escaped to Kerbin, decelerated to aerobraking height and decoupled the final fuel tank still half full before re-entering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the difference between how you do your landings. It is perfectly possible to do so badly that even a completely overprovisioned design fails to go half the way, just because a law of physics you didn\u0027t know or remember at the time eats all your fuel like an insidious little gremlin hiding in your tank. Now obviously this is an extreme example, which I engineered to visualize the difference to myself, but the point is: piloting skill ultimately equals delta-v. It applies to knowing how to launch while minimizing the sum of aerodynamic drag and gravity drag, knowing how to get the orbit you want through cheap mid-flight course corrections instead of expensive inclination tilts, knowing how (and when!) to try for an intercept, knowing how to land without burning more fuel than necessary... every single thing has room for error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, I used to have severe troubles building rockets that got anything useful at all into orbit. I solved this problem not by building better rockets, but by learning how to fly them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and another trick: go for Minmus first. Costs you maybe 5%-10% extra delta-v to intercept, while costing way, way less to land on and launch from. And in 0.23, it now has biomes as well for juicy science.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-06T13:54:47Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2014 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buddhafist","CreatedById":100096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T06:37:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I took the exact same lander (loaded from a quicksave), and\u003Cstrong\u003E just let it freefall straight down to the Mun as fast as it wanted to go after intercepting.

I failed to land 37 times before I got the hang of it, but finally decided that was my best bet to save fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The problem has been that takes up nearly all my fuel. This is for two reasons I think. First, my entry orbit is super steep. Or rather, horizontal once I reach the surface. I spend a lot of time just decelerating. This is turn causes me to have to keep raising my alt to give more time to break. Also, this technique changes up my landing point, which has to be compensated for once I finally get it under control.
