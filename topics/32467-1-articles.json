The aircraft is pretty big, with multiple flaps. When they all work together, things are good, but a few minutes after taking off one or more of the flaps seems to reverse which immediately sends me into a forward spin which this plane can never recover from. I am not 100% sure what is causing but I think it could be fuel related. I have played around moving bits around but nothing seems to cure the problem. Which leads me on to a question which I hope makes sense as I am struggling to explain myself!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/jp9xiv939/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s10.postimg.org/jp9xiv939/herculump.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022herculump.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the CoG within a fuel tank move as fuel is drained?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf so, would a fuel tank that drains top to bottom drain the same way if it was on its side? eg - left to right as if it was ignoring any force of gravity.

When i completely remove the fuel tanks the CoM barely moves. All 4 tanks are draining at the same rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regard to the flaps, I think it is unlikely the the CoM would ever move enough for the flaps to be infront. Also the wings are 90degs opposed to the fuselage with a 10deg pitch so I am confused as to why it seems to be only one pair of flaps that invert. I would have though it would be all or nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT - Just went for another flight adding extra tanks infront of the CoM, and this time all aelerons decided to invert at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2 - Moved the tanks forward to the point of making takeoff a problem.
