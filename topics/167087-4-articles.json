Cyanobacterium do this to the extreme, they compartmentalize nitrogen fixation (which is extremely toxic process to most life forms) into a compartment that can basically be jettisoned when adequate nitrogen is available.

Not by a long shot...\u003Cbr\u003E\nBest,\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Slashy\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSO I think I can answer this debate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets go back 150 years ago, in the age of steam, during the age of steam you where either an industrialist who hired people who build things made to harnass steam (such as a press, or a locomotive,\u00A0 . . . .) no one who did not have resources had access to the keys to unlock the power of civilation of the time. The problem in the 1850 to 1900 period was in order to make steam you need a boiler which at the time was made of cast iron/steel it had to be thick, it had to hold pressure, you had to regulate the pressure. There needed to be a coal stream (remember the christmas carol, the worker got a lump of coal\u00A0 . . . .) it was not uncommon for the common man to due his daily business with a handful of coal per day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe came Rudolf Diesel\u0027s rather odd observation that if you placed a carbon source (cotton, oil, etc) in a cylinder and compress the surrounding air, that material would spontaneously combust, creating pressure. The pressure was generated whether it was a gallon or an thimble-size in volume. Once the full exploitation of this technology was observed the common man could take a used engine and invent something. Edison had a farm of young people from all walks of life inventing things. A couple of bicycle mechanics used a 4 cylinder engine to create the first powered flight and we enter the American Age. This eventually went from manual to electronics to software. Software was once the sole domain of Ph.Ds working on huge machines that produced more BTU\u0027s than actual results, then in the 1970s there was the computer chip, the 808X series most are unaware was not really used first as a CPU for personal computers, but as advancement of the 8008 processor for big machines, displays and equipment, there were like 6 instructions in the instruction set. Then came the Z80 that was really targeting hard programmed devices like cash registers monitors, etc. At the same time the 8086 was released as a competitor to the Z80 in the same market because the better intel chip was delayed. The Z80 was simple enough that anyone who could solder could create a circuit board and hard wire devices into it and create a computer, and the Z80 was cheap enough that it could be done, and a few kids in the bay area decided to build and sell computers. Then came the IBM PC and then the 8088. At that time if you used a computer you learned some aspect of programming you had to.At least one person in every house or company with a computer had to know how to program Dos, and programming in Basic was of great benefit. The Apple II had visicalc (long before excel). Alot of Microsoft apps (eventually part of Dos) where written by users. Microsoft originally sold its windows programming systems for hefty price, but soon after you could get it for free . . . .and that is when Apple got its butt kicked, everybody and their brother was writing software, everybody was stealing software, modifying others software . . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only this but the bulletin boards were occupied by pretty much computer savvy, college kids and geeks. There weren\u0027t forums per say just mail (NNTP versus SMTP) flying on bulletin boards and no such thing as moderation, it was hardly needed, the intellectual universe was exploding . . .\u00A0 then WWW hit then google. Anyone and his brother could now have access to any bulletin board and the old net started to collapse and those well researched folks started leaving to moderated and then tightly moderated groups. Google brags about how they opened up the Internet, but they opened up the internet to complete chaos, they actually resulted in intellectuals closing off the internet from the common folk. So now what you see on the internet is duck-faced precocious teenager ranting about who tagged them in a photo on someone\u0027s facebook page as our equally foulmouthed politicians have moved to twitter to pronounce their general hatred of civility. Now you go to a store, theres a device that any 4 year old can use and probably better than I can, you put the money, you get a sim card and you can then log onto the internet with no knowledge what-so-ever about computers, how they work,\u00A0 . . . . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not a genetic outcome, its a poison of my generations crafting. We build all the equipment, worked day and night to get these unfettered connections between people going. But we paid almost no mind about what it became once it got going. And to say we were not warned about Russian meddling in elections or Fake news . . . .All the fate of Twitter and Facebook can easily have been observed on the Usenet between 1994 and 1998. It is the reason I don\u0027t face or tweet; it is akin to taking an intellectual bullet and blowing your intellectual mind out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem about our society is that there is alot of information in great variety. Eat this, buy this, take this drug, don\u0027t eat this, don\u0027t buy this, don\u0027t take this drug.\u00A0 . . . . . .Our society is undergoing an insideous culture creep in which to keep your wits about you, you almost have to have a Ph.D. to side step all the risk that society creates. The opiod drug epidemic and type II diabetes epidemic are two examples of where you have to pay attention or you can easily get swept into the perils of the modern masses. I can give an example; for a friend that can no longer get out, I was buying a loaf of bread at the store the other day.\u00A0 But its not bread anymore on the shelves, I don\u0027t know what it is but its not bread. \u003Cspan\u003E25 grams of sugar in once serving of bread, enzymatically modified wheat glutin ,\u00A0 . . . . They were selling bread with whole flax seeds on them, you cant digest whole flax seeds, they come out in your poo. I picked up a bag of corn tortillas the first ingredient was wheat, a bottle of soy-sauce . . .same thing. Nothing is what it says it is anymore. And the problem is that all this sugar, excess of animal fat, weird chemicals . . . .Its making people dumb, its literally killing their brains, picking their brains in aldehydes, inflammation is cutting off the blood supply, hormones in the foods are\u00A0 . . . . . . . . . .When I was coming up we never had a test called A1C, people when I was a kid very rarely died from diabetes, it was like #20 on the cause of death list. Now everyone and their brother has a positive score on their A1C. \u003C/span\u003EHow can there not be something really wrong with the way people behave?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd just to make a point, when you have two Ph.D.s in a household its not exactly easy to have kids . . . . .we were working from dawn to dusk for many years, sometimes 4 or 5 years without a vacation. There\u0027s no point where the boss comes up and says, \u0027well we have a time to take a 6 month break\u0027. In fact its the opposite, after you have retired they continue to call you up to do work . . . . .\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
