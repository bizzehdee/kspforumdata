HST carries the deepest divergent mtDNA lineage that splits from other Neanderthals \u223C270,000 years ago, providing a lower boundary for the time of the putative mtDNA introgression event. We demonstrate that a complete Neanderthal mtDNA replacement is feasible over this time interval even with minimal hominin introgression.

Again the point to be made here is that the population of Africa, with a number of hominims was competitive on a global scale, and was a source of repeated geneflow from Africa and some gene flow back to Africa. To some degree the composite population of Africa and the fracturing within Africa were two mechanisms of maintaining diversity. It is likely that the OoA population was the largest of these and tended to create more flux (see other posts) into other Africa populations after 200 kya, prior to that it is hard to know the spatial distribution of the ancestors of that population.

Its the source of Homo, its the source of heidelbergensis/rhodesiensis. If you read the paper I presented 3 posts up, Africa drives evolution in Asia though a sort of episodic gene flow. In that context all of SW Asia is in its wake. If you want a more informative responses I need aDNA samples, both in and outside of Africa.

How to create a model where outliers to the OoA (c. 60 to 80 kya) exodus/(4 to 6% N introgression). I like to create placeholder for variants and put genes into them and wait for the community to find out how the variants evolved, generic morphological entities don\u0027t help. In a generic model genes can flow from anywhere to anywhere without cause, because genes are distributed evenly across isoquants in the population and flow from their origin to the destinations. If I am looking at the B*48 haplotype in East Asia and I say gee how did this come to be here, the generic answer is that some generic African spread in some generic manner to East Asia and interbred with humans. A rather non-informative answer. I wouldn\u0027t except that answer for OoA genes, I would be doing haplotype analysis, modeling recombination of known starting alleles, etc. I know sounds like babble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point is that I want information that resolves possibilities into multiple specific possibilities in which I can select the best.

I want this to be more of a backdrop of sensing when science is correct or not just in the results but the way it proceeds.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo give a sense of how to assess I want to create a logical context of sampling, and the simplest example that I can give is this\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have a patio that is 10 meters by 10 meters. Its recently been painted with a medium grey color and has a course satin finish that shows rain drops pretty well.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo that at a given time, how many raindrops need to fall on that patio before you can assess whether the number of Raindrops are falling at the same rate or different rate at a given confidence range (say \u002B/-50% relative variation)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the formula.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution \u00A0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 By this definition you will have to bracket off both blocks (say 1 x 1 square meters) and your sampling will be over a discrete time interval, which is arbitrary, but the smaller the time period the more accurate the sampling.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo that to assess the variance over time you now have discrete blocks in a 3 dimensional (2 spatial dimension and 1 temporal dimension) construct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that for any discrete element in the matrix the first drop that falls, basically you have a relative variation that is much larger than your average, as more raindrops fall the average moves higher and the relative confidence tightens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK so we are talking about hominid evolution, really a period bracketed by the last 10 M years (we don\u0027t know that when we start the experiment). We have some semi-discrete areas (Africa, Europe, East Asia, S.Asia, SE Asia, Australia, Americas).\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe also have in the late 19th century the work of Charles Darwin which specifies that morphologically similar species likely have common ancestry going backwards in time, these evolve. And the geology points very roughly to the fact that the surface of the Earth has changed weathering exposures over time (more or less 20th century work). Before the study of radioactivity in the Early 20th century precise dating was more or less non-existent. Each of these drops (finds) represents a study, it begins with the discovery and then proceeds over time, in the context we can analyze if or how science has corrected errors that occurred at previous dates in time. There are entirely too many finds to deal with all the errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this is the backdrop for paleontology of humans, lets take a look at the raindrops.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow we know what human skeletal morphology was, the British had a love for raiding graveyards and stealing bodies for various and sundry purposes, and these could be compared with remains in the catacombs elsewhere in Europe.

The first raindrop that hits is from SE Belgium and represents part of a calvaria that has a configuration different from known morphologies. Without any knowledge it was called \u0022modern\u0022. Again we have to remember that almost no or no paleontology is being conducted by Europeans in any part of the world at this point, because prior to darwin it was just assumed that this would have been destroyed by god prior to the creation of adam and eve (dating could never be made that was considered by all to be heretical). So basically this raindrop was ignored for religious reasons and due to the lack of a background.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMissassumption one - god determines when or where species evolved.

In 1991 some 133 years later the bones were radiocarbon dated to 39,900 \u00B1 620; however we have to question the confidence interval in the date, because at 40,000 years carbon-14 (T\u003Csub\u003E1/2\u003C/sub\u003E =\u00A0 5,730) has gone through 6.933 and any bone that has been exposed to carbon dioxide during the modern age (i.e. after the bikini atoll tests) is expected to have some high level of contaminating carbon. The residual C-14 is 1/122.2 the starting carbon and the amount of C-14 in is a tiny fraction. The normal rate of C-14 production is 16,400 and 18,800 atoms per meter of surface per second. If we consider that atmosphere is 101,300 kPa per meter. Then 101,300 / 9.8 = mass = 10, 336 kg per meter.\\\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vostok_Petit_data.svg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vostok_Petit_data.svg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs we can see CO2 varies with respect to time, and C-14 is made from Nitrogen-14 which is created by cosmic radiation. So that the ratio of C-14 to C-12 varies with time. The graph above was made after the feldhofer 1 dating. But lets do the calculations anyway based on 250 ppmv (Volume) To do this we need to convert the 10,336 to volume, any volume will do. 1 mole per liter is 28.95 grams per liter. Thus at this 10366 kg/meter squared x 1000 gm/kg / 28.95 gram/liter = 10,366,000 grams/ meter squared/ \u003Cspan\u003E28.95\u003C/span\u003E grams per mole = 356,000 liters of gas at one mole per liter per square meter. Again, this is not atmospheric pressure on the ground, the gas is in a column extending 100 km up so we don\u0027t really know what the average pressure or volume is, nor do we care. To calculate the moles of CO2 we then have to multiply this by 250/1000000 = 89.26 moles of CO2. We therefore know the amount of carbon per square meter. How many moles is 17,000 atoms/sec then we can calculate how many atoms are produced in a half-life of 5720 years is ~ 3 x 10\u003Csup\u003E15 \u003C/sup\u003E(2.96036E\u002B15 to 3.39358E\u002B15)/half life of carbon. However since these are produced at a steady rate we can surmise that during that period only 1/4th have decayed . . . . so that the equilibrium level of Carbon-14 is basically\u00A0 4.40584 x 10\u003Csup\u003E15\u003C/sup\u003E to 5.0506 x 10\u003Csup\u003E15\u003C/sup\u003E atoms per air column that is a meter squared at Earth\u0027s surface. The air column 40,000 years ago, assuming the data was correct has 210 PPM of carbon in it, we don\u0027t expect the total volume has change then we use 79.28 x 6.0223 x 10\u003Csup\u003E23\u003C/sup\u003E =\u00A0 4.774 x10\u003Csup\u003E25\u00A0 \u003C/sup\u003Etherefore the ratio of carbon atoms in atmosphere at the time was 6.427 x 10\u003Csup\u003E-11\u003C/sup\u003E\u003Csup\u003E14\u003C/sup\u003EC:(\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003EC\u002B\u003Csup\u003E13\u003C/sup\u003EC).

Sigma associated with this number of counts would be small, less than a 0.1% and we might feel confortable with the dating. This might not seem to bad but would not complete collagen purification (not just extraction) been better. In other studies, when exposure related carbon absorption has been noted, the dating of purified collagen has been found to have an earlier date than extracted collagen. Other than Feldhofer 1 calvaria been treated with a preservative containing carbon, it was not adequately protected in\u00A0 a sealed (CO2 free) environment over its life. The other samples (retrieved in the\u00A0 1990s) were recovered from \u0022these\u00A0 specimens were thrown down an approximately 20-m rock face and subjected to breakage by subsequent quarrying activity while on the valley floor.\u0022-\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC130635/pdf/pq2002013342.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC130635/pdf/pq2002013342.pdf\u003C/a\u003E IOW over the last 150 years they have been exposed to the elements, to infiltration of animal excrement, pollution and soot from campfires, etc. For such a very early dating in radiocarbon range (which with perfect carbon dates only to 3.5 halflives earlier-60 kya) and given the small amount of sample. This could be a problem. We have to remember that \u003Csup\u003E14\u003C/sup\u003EC in the atmosphere spiked in the 1960s at twice the level of pre-1960s and has only slowly fallen since. The percentage of loss of 14C from the sample is 99.3% therefore it would only take a small addition of modern carbon, less that 0.05% to markedly change the date. When we look at other work, such as the original work done by Bowler (originally dated to 30kya, then later redated to 42 kya) using charcoal, and the work done on Oase 1, it is reasonable to assume that for such early dating using radiocarbon dating, one has to do everything perfectly, you cannot guess on how pure ancient the sample is. While mtDNA genome was extracted, the specimen lacked adequate quality of DNA to undergo full genome sequence (which requires magnitudes more DNA). It is likely older than 40ky but not greatly older, because in this case its unlikely that any of the DNA would be preserved, we could set an arbitrarily early date at 60ky as the upward time bracket. Feldhofer 1 is an amazing fossil in one regard, despite poor to horrific treatment over the last 150 years it still managed to produce some credible data, but as other studies will reveal, being handled by modern trained hands does no guarantee that good science will be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-02T03:58:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2018 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-02T08:04:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe description of the Feldhofer specimen is from Prof. Herrmann Schaaffhausen, University of Bonn, Fuhlrott was a local scolar who identified the bones as significant, translated them to Schaaffhausen and participated in the analysis.

Critics need details, what was the nature of the preservative placed on the calvaria? Was any means taken to characterized the chert and other material in which the bone fragments were recovered (how disturbed were they after deposition). And of the things we could do this is how we avoided all the created risk. The null hypothesis is that the dating is indeterminate, in all circumstances its up to the authors to prove that in the mess that they have adequately cleaned the sample, the critics responsibility is to point this out if they haven\u0027t. I should also point out that at a certain point in the purification, because the dating is so close to the limit of Carbon-14, that each step needs to be conducted from CO2 (from ancient carbonates that are acid treated to release gas)) purging of buffers and then degassing CO2 purified such that the CO2 itself is tested for \u003Csup\u003E14\u003C/sup\u003EC and found to contain none.

One researched noted that typical injuries are similar to those experience by rodeo riders. There has been speculation that Neanderthals matured 30% earlier than humans, had children at younger ages and died earlier.

Woodward lumped them . . . .Im using his designation. Once upon a time i deemed it important\u00A0 . . . . .but in discussion with African paleontologist I gradually came to realize it could be 750 kya or a recent variant there is no way to tell them apart. Which gets to the point that some effort to have characterize the site as soon after its discovery, maybe even collecting a soil sample from the site, could have been useful. Again he supported a designation of Piltdown man, but also failed to investigate to any degree homo rhodesiensis, which was an opportunity lost. It is true the many archaeologist and anthropologist disputed certain commonly held points of view, but this is not the point, the arrogant bias the permeated human paleontology. From my point of view the focus on European paleontology put a very important discovery as more or less a * in paleontology. You here the word Kabwe, Broken hill, Homo rhodensiensis type specimen being tossed about in the literature, but thats basically the limit in its importance. . .an opportunity lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne has to take the conservative position. You might have an insight that variant X existed, you don\u0027t know what or where existed until you have some pejorative information (which my point about AMH I also apply to my own thinking). The problem in Africa is this, if you can imagine a wall and I take a shotgun and fire gameload with painted pellets at the wall, would that random colored pattern make any less sense than Africa paleoanthropology. And while you could have an indefinite number of pop/subpopulations living all over the place, in the context of population sizes and forces that shaped internal and external African evolution would necessarily make some of these undetectable except in very fortuitous circumstances (like the discovery of recently dated iso-variants in S. Africa).\u00A0 This is where things will stand for the foreseeable future. To be certain, to know, you need context, and the lack of context in many sites means you don\u0027t know much. And in the case of human evolution to know means you need genetic context, and if the context only appears as fragmented DNA sequences over time attached to some odd primative remain. . . .then also you don\u0027t know much. Its also true for Asia, if you have a genetic anomaly and you don\u0027t have a reference to compare it with (like Denisovan) then you don\u0027t have a context.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI read an article that B73 was probably from Denisovan admixture. But it was not found in Denisova and nor was it found in the haplotypes. B73 is not the only allele, and if the admixture was a single event as some believe . . .well . . .B73 is an odd one, so is B48 and so is B67 and so these cannot be from a single individual admixture and there mode is in the Northern Yellow Sea region, not Indonesia (Individuals can at most care 2 variants . .they cannot carry 3). In the same way I detected freaky alleles that created modes in central Africa, I also found these not to be from SSA Africans generally and over time others found similar associations. But if we never find a fossil that links a context to the region of interest, its just a guess. The Zoukoudian fossils could have been that, but they are gone now.
