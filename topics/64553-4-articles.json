Version indication and notification seems to be an important differentiating feature. Without even that, the site is just a file repository. With it, the site can resolve an often-requested community wish list item.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve argued before that the current inoperable state of spaceport and how it has failed to effect us at all prove that we do not need a repository at all, and that remains true. However, none of this is about need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s a really great thing; we do not need spaceport, we do not need spaceport 2, we do not need replaceport. We want to have a neat and useful service for easily hosting mods that is conducive to people finding both new mods they may enjoy and the specific mods they know they want. We want, therefore we do. And we do whatever we want and everybody has been invited to take a crack at it and I really have no investment in who wins. If I\u0027m happy with one of them, I will use it; if I\u0027m not happy with the winner, I have four release threads, dropbox, mediafire, my github repos. I\u0027m not wildly successful, Replaceport won\u0027t change that, and I\u0027m totally content.

Remember, that\u0027s what these are. If you disagree, great: build an awesome site to prove me wrong. While most of this is negotiable, it\u0027s probably easier for everyone if the technologies used are ones the host likes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAs I wrote in the OP: Linux, please. It\u0027s free and can be more conservative with system resources. It also greatly simplifies deployment, setup and maintenance if all VMs run the same OS. All new VMs on my server get \u003Cstrong\u003ECentOS 6\u003C/strong\u003E, and there\u0027s one currently on CentOS 5. This will be hard to negotiate; if your website is so tightly connected to a particular operating system, it\u0027s probably not a very good website.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI like \u003Cstrong\u003Enginx\u003C/strong\u003E. Other high-performance web servers can be considered, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s yet a performance concern that justifies another choice. I will have objections to Apache, again based on experience. Note: For server platforms like Node.js that include HTTP servers, I\u0027ll still ask that a proxy server like nginx sit in front. This is to make configuration easier down the road, to avoid running the server as root, et cetera.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI have a lot of experience with PHP, and accordingly I am \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E a fan. It\u0027s slow, it\u0027s constantly playing catch-up on technology support (radical things like \u0022unicode\u0022) and it\u0027s a pain to get anything done without slotting your code into a framework with dozens of files that you\u0027ll need to tweak because configuration isn\u0027t flexible enough. There are many developers with some PHP experience, but there\u0027s a dearth of real talent. If someone builds a really excellent PHP-based site, I can roll with it, but I\u0027ll certainly be looking out for something else.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI have vague philosophical and practical objections to Ruby and, to a lesser extent, Python. (That probably means Rails and Django in the context of this discussion.) This is a step up from PHP, but I\u0027ll roll my eyes a lot and take the time to refine my arguments against.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EC# is great! We love C# in the KSP modding community, right? Thing is, something like ASP MVC is really quite heavyweight, and it\u0027s probably overkill for a simple site like this. Setup and configuration will be substantially more complex. I could be convinced, but prepare for a very raised eyebrow.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI like \u003Cstrong\u003ENode.js\u003C/strong\u003E. This is weird, since Javascript is a highly dynamic language, and that\u0027s not usually my style. However, having spent some time developing with Node.js, I\u0027ve come to really appreciate the ecosystem that\u0027s grown around the platform. Building a high-performance, data-oriented web service with Node.js is \u003Cem\u003Ereally easy\u003C/em\u003E. This opinion is controversial to some, and I am prepared to defend it. (In #kspmodders, please, not here.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMySQL is \u003Cem\u003Ealright\u003C/em\u003E.

For this site, I think we could benefit from the relative simplicity and easier-to-obtain performance of a NoSQL database. \u003Cstrong\u003EMongoDB\u003C/strong\u003E is a good go-to choice, and there are plenty of other good options.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example site architecture (overly simplified) using the bolded technologies:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i7.minus.com/ibkYhjU2Al8Ih8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ibkYhjU2Al8Ih8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this setup, nginx handles all HTTP requests.

We should think about what situations could cause the site\u0027s perception of a user\u0027s installed mods to differ from reality. A user might download a newer version without actually installing it, or they might download the latest version from a different location (e.g. an auto-updater packaged with the mod).

It is thus not mods that have versions, but uploads; and not mods that have download statistics, but uploads. I think mods should certainly have a description, but perhaps uploads should too (for release notes and the like). As an alternative to uploads, we could call these \u0022files\u0022 or \u0022versions\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI don\u0027t think the dichotomy you present in download metrics is necessary. The server collects and records statistics on things like downloads and subscriptions. Users can view some of these statistics. Perhaps we say that mod owners can view more detailed statistics while normal users can only see summaries, but that\u0027s a lot more clear than slicing and dicing it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI would move the first section in administration tools elsewhere. Administration tools are for administrators. If mod owners need some privileged controls over their own mods, we should enumerate exactly what they can do.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOn that note, something is missing: user accounts. They need to be created, authenticated and probably modified. What properties comprise a user, and how they can be changed, should be specified. Authentication can get really complicated, so for now I suggest we stick with simple password authentication and consider social media and third-party authentication later.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI think it\u0027s okay to allow users to transfer mods without admin intervention so long as there\u0027s a big scary warning about it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI have a minor amendment to make to the proposed system architecture: nginx can handle file uploads and pass just the metadata onto Node.js for processing.

Documentation is important, especially from the perspective of a player looking for mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started exploring KSP mods in my second save, after playing in a completely stock one for a few weeks. And the first mod I tried out was Kethane. The main reason for choosing it: I could see even without downloading what it was about, what parts it added, and how those parts were supposed to be used. That it\u0027s even organized in its own small wiki is a bonus on top. I immediately knew what I was in for, and even more importantly, \u003Cem\u003EI knew that I wanted to have it\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast, during more recent forays into the big wide modding community, I come across mod after mod after mod (both on spaceport and on the forums) that utilize their access to a freeform textfield mostly thus: a cryptic changelog or author musing about future versions, sometimes an outdated imgur gallery of misc rockets in flight or on the launchpad that could really be anything (or sometimes even use other mods in addition to the one in question), and a big bold download link forwarding to spaceport where you find a carbon copy of the forum post, except not quite as up to date. The problem with this goes beyond merely having to figure out how stuff works (that would not be much of an issue). Rather, as a player, I often find myself looking at a thread and thinking \u0022this mod has a really awesome title that drew my mouse to click on the forum topic like a magnet, but for the life of me I cannot actually figure out \u003Cem\u003Ewhat it even does\u003C/em\u003E or why I would want to download it\u0022. This immediately triggers in me the subconscious feeling of \u0022I wonder if the mod itself is just as half-assed\u0022. Which likely ends up being unfair towards the work the author has put into making it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, I\u0027d consider it extremely important to give mod authors the tools to show off exactly those things - to tell the browsing player what they do and why that player should want to download it.

My impression from discussion in this thread is that these ideas are linked, and that subscriptions may also play into mod rankings somehow (even if it\u0027s just a visual indicator). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESearch \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E not belong in the required features list. (Either that, or things like versioning and download metrics also need to be required.) A repository that allows modders to create listings and then link to them from a forum thread would still be quite useful. I\u0027d go so far as to say download metrics are more important, at least from an adoption perspective. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMod metadata could be split into a few categories for requirements levels. Name, author and description are undoubtedly core features. Mod version is probably up there. The rest might not be; the thread has yielded varying opinions there. A document doesn\u0027t necessarily have to iron all that out right away, but it could help to categorize how certain we are about each feature. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERegarding the description field: I haven\u0027t seen any objections to rich text. I like Markdown. Might as well just specify it and be done with it. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe search feature needs a lot of work (in this thread, not just in the document). We\u0027ve said we want it to be better, but exactly how it accomplishes that is something to discuss. My personal thoughts: full-text searches are cleaner than tagging systems, and it would help to use download and subscription counts to weight results. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERequiring users to log in to download is a show-stopper, so it\u0027s fine if the update notification system only works for people who are logged in. We should think about what situations could cause the site\u0027s perception of a user\u0027s installed mods to differ from reality. A user might download a newer version without actually installing it, or they might download the latest version from a different location (e.g. an auto-updater packaged with the mod). What facilities should be available for users to correct their download history? \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI\u0027m not completely convinced that mod versions need to have some discernible ordering. Is there some way we can save ourselves the headache while giving mod owners flexibility to decide which versions come before others? \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI think I agree with your second paragraph about mod versioning, but we need to be clear that this means we\u0027re dealing with two kinds of objects, mods and uploads, where each mod may have many uploads. It is thus not mods that have versions, but uploads; and not mods that have download statistics, but uploads. I think mods should certainly have a description, but perhaps uploads should too (for release notes and the like). As an alternative to uploads, we could call these \u0022files\u0022 or \u0022versions\u0022. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI don\u0027t think the dichotomy you present in download metrics is necessary. The server collects and records statistics on things like downloads and subscriptions. Users can view some of these statistics. Perhaps we say that mod owners can view more detailed statistics while normal users can only see summaries, but that\u0027s a lot more clear than slicing and dicing it. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI would move the first section in administration tools elsewhere. Administration tools are for administrators. If mod owners need some privileged controls over their own mods, we should enumerate exactly what they can do. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOn that note, something is missing: user accounts. They need to be created, authenticated and probably modified. What properties comprise a user, and how they can be changed, should be specified. Authentication can get really complicated, so for now I suggest we stick with simple password authentication and consider social media and third-party authentication later. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI think it\u0027s okay to allow users to transfer mods without admin intervention so long as there\u0027s a big scary warning about it. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI have a minor amendment to make to the proposed system architecture: nginx can handle file uploads and pass just the metadata onto Node.js for processing. It doesn\u0027t need to go into the document, but I thought it was neat. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, I quite like it. Documents are good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made some changes based on your comments. Its probably still often too wordy, but can be edited down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI think my \u0022opt-in\u0022 and your \u0022subscription\u0022 are meant to be the same thing. Users subscribe to a mod in order to receive update notifications. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI believe a simple search function is a functional requirement. Otherwise users would only be able to find content via a direct link or some global index? Now, a lot of traffic does come from the forums so it might actually be usable without it. I just think it would throw a lot of users off if they couldn\u0027t search for mods. Of course, if its worth doing its worth doing well. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI split metadata into \u0022required\u0022, \u0022optional\u0022, and automated categories and specified Markdown. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIn general I like the idea of full-text search, but I also understand why keywording is useful. This may need the most discussion in this forum. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI edited the update notification section a bit. Honestly, I think the email notification is the most useful. Few people are going to want to log on to a mod site just to see if they need to update anything. But options to limit a digest to daily, weekly, or monthly would probably be required as well. The email could provide a direct download link to the updated mods. On the other hand, I also see the utility of a list on a user\u0027s homepage with links to updated mods. A simple \u0022x\u0022 next to each notification could serve to dismiss it if they were not interested in downloading at that time. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI agree that an ordering system probably isn\u0027t required. As we are capturing upload timestamps, ordering of the versions is already taken care of. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI really like using the term \u0022mod\u0022 to refer to a set of .zip files, which retains a continuity over time. Each separate .zip file that is uploaded will be referred to as a new \u0022version\u0022 of the mod. The server can retain past versions for download by users if they so desire. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI specified a possible download log entry. I don\u0027t go into much detail with subscriptions, but I don\u0027t think that needs a log so much as just a sum. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMoved administration stuff around a bit, though it isn\u0027t heavily specified. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUser Accounts are now represented, with some specification. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENon-moderated ownership transfer comes in two steps, I believe. The first is the owner selecting a target mod and target user to assign ownership to. This then generates some sort of message to the targeted user (email?). The targeted user then either chooses to accept ownership, decline ownership, or ignore the message. This implies some time limit may be appropriate, and a results message should be sent back to the original owner. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe file is in the same place, and should be editable by you guys if you have something you want to add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done some reading about MongoDB, and it seems pretty interesting (to one who\u0027s only dealt with relational DBs).
