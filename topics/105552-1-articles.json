When attempting to bind, the axis is recognized, but clicking \u0022accept\u0022 does nothing. Cancelling dismissed the binding box, but then attempting to re-open it grays out the entire Input UI and no other bindings can then be changed without quitting KSP entirely.\n\nI tried a fix from a similar thread wherein the settings.cfg file is deleted then KSP launched. This did not fix the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"ChronosWS","CreatedById":141965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T05:09:40Z","Content":"Update: FIXED by clean installing KSP."}]}
