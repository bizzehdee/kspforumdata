I\u0027m just wondering if most people approve of this decision, or if you\u0027d prefer it to be moved back to tier 6. And hey, polls are fun. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPros as i see it for moving it back to tier 6:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The Whiplash is based on the sr-71 balckbird\u0027s engine, and made its first test flight before we even got anything to orbit (1958), so it\u0027s not exactly super high tech\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-the massively increased funds/science barrier to unlock it kind of discourages people from making jet spaceplanes (sure, you can make them with the panther, but then you can\u0027t really \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E anything with them)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECons as i see it for moving it back to tier 6:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-we already have the panther, and can make mildly effective pure-rocket sstos pretty early on\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-sstos should be quite incapable and hard-to-make anyways\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-the devs did it, and its their game, and thus they probably know best and we shouldn\u0027t bother them about it even if we don\u0027t like it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, yeah.
