That\u0027s a harmonic potential which does result in closed, elliptic orbits, but while gravity-induced orbits have the center of potential at the focus of the ellipse, here the geometrical center of the ellipse is going to coincide with center of the potential well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T17:50:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA better approximation is bearing balls in a funnel.
