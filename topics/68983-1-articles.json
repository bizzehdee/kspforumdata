They weren\u0027t. That was good. So, I stuck an SLS launcher on it (Yep, I was almost done with the Tech Tree) and shot off to orbit. Thing was, I was on a Kerbol escape trajectory \u003Cem\u003EBEFORE I LEFT KERBIN\u0027S ATMOSPHERE!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was like, \u0022WTF is happening here?! Are the SLS engines really that overpowered?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, SLS ran out of fuel, and I had overshot Duna by a large margin. And I decided, \u0022Ah, why not. I\u0027ll get them home safely.\u0022 (What really happened was that I hit \u0022Space Center\u0022 instead of \u0022Revert to VAB\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I set up a Kerbin intercept. And then as I was burning (A 6-min burn, but NERVA\u0027s, so no problem) I realized that the mission wasn\u0027t a total waste, because the Duna lander had a materials bay and goo canisters. So I got science from a High Solar Orbit. Yay \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I aerobraked at Kerbin. Sorta. I was moving at 1000 m/s or so and still on a Kerbin escape trajectory. Again, \u0022WTF?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuess what had happened. Yep, I forgot to turn gravity back on... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, well.

It \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E have a hard time. I wanted the science from the lander, but to do that I got the CSM capsule, stuck it on the lander, and landed with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedesigning Time!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-11T11:39:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2014 11:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starwhip\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
