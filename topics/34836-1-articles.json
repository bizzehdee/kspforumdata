I\u0027m having great fun even within Kerbin SOI, but Mun landing is great. The problem I\u0027m having is a rover \u002B lander combo and my failure to design anything I am fully happy with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy usual approach is to put a small rover under the lander can so that when I extend the landing gear the rover is just above the surface. Then I just drive off. That part works ok, but in order to do that I usually need to put the lander and rover upside down on the lower stage which leads to some issues with the navball. The most obvious is the fact that the ground (the brown half of the navball) is \u0022up\u0022 and the sky is \u0022down\u0022. The maneuver nods are on the opposite side of the ball so a bit of guessing is involved when it comes to it\u0027s position. SAS/ASAS sometimes throws a fit as well. All in all, it\u0027s a less than perfect design until I detach the lander from the transfer stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I try to flip the lander with the rover right side up the rocket usually becomes a lot more unstable even though it appears to maintain the center of gravity in the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESending a rover and a lander on two different mission is an option but I don\u0027t like it.

If you haven\u0027t got anything else to control, you might consider putting an RGU on the top of your booster (right below whatever you\u0027re using to separate your payload. Be sure to give it some power (a pair of PB-NUKs work well, so do battery packs). When the game releases your rocket for launch, switch control over to the RGU and you should be golden. My landers often incorporate Aerospikes, so I have to launch an inverted payload quite often, and this is definitely a viable workaround.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"entaran","CreatedById":67823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T14:34:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could also strap a LARGE rover underneath, and drop it about 5-10 metres above the surface then go land elsewhere. it won\u0027t bounce far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Major Healey","CreatedById":67800,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T16:19:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI once put a rover under the hitch hiker storage can with side rockets to land it with legs on the on them, land the craft, raise the legs, decouple the rover (put the brakes on it has a habit of rolling away) Eva the Kerbal, drive the rover out, put the kerbal back in the lander and lower the legs again.
