If you have multiple gimballing engines you can still sometimes get a cascade effect, particularly when the thrust is high. On one of my rockets I built, with a middle skipper and 4 mainsails surrounding it, in order to be able to pull off the gravity turn without unplanned disassembly, I had to disable gimballing on two of the mainsails, otherwise the entire craft flipped out as I moved away from 90deg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When the SAS is providing a significant input into the PID system already (such as a plane that is nose heavy and thus requires a high amount of pitch up), any attempt to correct it seems to forget the previously required pitch up (ie: your input starts back at zero, rather than where the PID controller is currently applying the force). As a result, it\u0027s hard to trim the craft with SAS on, as the trim resets that axis, and effectively de-binds it from input control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR - it\u0027s great, needs tweaking for one or two scenarios. 2 is more of a priority than 1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Conzolax","CreatedById":62397,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T09:44:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI did watch it, I saw.

It\u0027s literally meant to be this way. ASAS is totally gone, going back to the target is one of the things that went along with it, because it added trouble. The goal of the SAS is to \u003Cem\u003Ehold\u003C/em\u003E the heading, and it does it. Once your craft will have stopped moving, try thrusting forward. You won\u0027t move at all. And that is the goal. Stop your rotation, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethen\u003C/strong\u003E hold the heading you are at. That\u0027s the two things the SAS module does. Unlike the ASAS who went: stop rotation, go back to when I was activated, go back to when I was activated, go back to... You get the pattern? It\u0027s not an error, that\u0027s blatantly what it\u0027s meant to be like.\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, it\u0027s not applying maximum force to not shred your craft apart. If you had a large craft, strong rotational forces could cause breaks. The goal was to make it smoother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor more information on how it works, read\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/41941-New-SAS-functionality-and-You%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E this\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it doesn\u0027t hold the heading! I\u0027ve got an SSTO spaceplane that\u0027s very well balanced, and with an LV-N for interplanetary burns - it doesn\u0027t use the gimballing nozzle at all! It\u0027s impossible to do accurate burns because it\u0027s always drifting off the maneuver node marker. I have to really fight the plane to keep it aligned, and even then there\u0027s a high chance of screwing up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shyanmar","CreatedById":28260,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T10:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have absolutely no problems with the new SAS.
