At one point I had my \u0022standard\u0022 cargobay with a 1.25m docking port on the node, and a 0.625m docking port just below that - adjusted with the part offset tool as to juuussstttt barely have a visible 1 pixel gap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI intended to create a rover with a lower center of mass but the same wheel base to dock there (perhaps even having a thing sticking up to reach that 0.625m docking port, with the rest of the rover being lower).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this was pre-1.0:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002210365487_10103383186199563_5158911516060\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://scontent-frx5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/10365487_10103383186199563_5158911516060112349_o.jpg?oh=29e8a52537a99d60a47af1868c7cab4d\u0026amp;oe=5A2D64EA\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut basically I gave my rover some fins that didn\u0027t work so well for guiding its landing, pre-1.0, parachutes, and retrorockets. That was a better rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also experimented back in those days with landers that had 2 engines on side tanks that extend pretty far down and then had landing legs mounted as far down as I could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then slung a rover underneath in the middle. Like above, the rovers had wide wheelbases using structural girders. It worked better pre-1.0 when there was no need to worry about aerodynamics (in the sense that almost everything except wings was equally draggy and orientation didn\u0027t matter)\u00A0and payload fairings and all that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
