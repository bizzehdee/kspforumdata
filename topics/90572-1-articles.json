First off, assuming that every modder who makes a part pack will take their time to add their stuff to your list is...ridiculous...at best. If you want to make something like this, you cannot expect everyone to just come and drop everything necessary at your feet. Second off, what do you define as a part pack? What about mod parts that require a plugin to function? Your list will effectively include almost every mod in existence. Third, how do you plan on getting KSP to run with that many mods installed? How does this speed up the process at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you seen the KerbalX initiative?
