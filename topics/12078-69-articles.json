Now if you install a strut between the rover and the Pandora shell, this stops. What is happening is the rover is rotating under the skycrane back and forth and is confusing sas. Is there a way to firm up the connection of the cables through cfg editing? And if not, maybe this could be something to trouble shoot for the next update.

Trying to load large and sometimes small .png files tends to crash the game. After converting the bigger textures to .dds it loaded much faster and much more reliably. I know that\u0027s not much to go on, but I hope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The change to the nodes is apparently a flip. If it was attached positively now it\u0027s negative. Or at least that is how I am updating some (this) mod on my own. (I will not redistribute though, This is yogui87\u0027s mod) The nodes simply will not attach. But after going into the .cfg and adding a (-) in front of the first node axis it will now attach properly. I am by no means an expert just a dabbler. But Albert VDS linked me to a helpful article \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation#Node_Definitions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation#Node_Definitions\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on a side note, I converted your textures to .dds for my install and the Pandora will load just fine into 1.0 - The IR cables also work with the latest version of Infernal Robotics 0.21.1 but the engine and node attachment issues appear to be the biggest hurtle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 5/1/15 I managed to get an assembled and working DSL rover in 1.0 with .dds textures. The issues I found during my tinkering are. The engines are very overpowered. With the new aero model you don\u0027t need as much power but they do work just fine. Also the node attachments need to be inverted, The new node attachment system is \u0022more strict\u0022 per a few posts I have read. Now I am fighting issues with the parachute and the heat shield. The parachute / capsule tries to fly in a lateral direction during decent. It\u0027s as though the pod is acting more like a wing than a brick. The parachute will deploy but at a 45 degree angle to the pod. (regardless of sas or rcs) And when you decouple the heat shield it will fall at a slower rate than the pod and roll out from under the pod, then fly up in the air and begin to flip through the air. After the heat shield is dropped the remainder of the pod will continue to fall in a predominantly lateral manner. But once you drop the skycrane out of the pod, the skycrane, winch, decouplers and engines all work like a charm. Mechjeb soft landings and booster separation of the skycrane after landing. The rover drives and all the animations and science experiments appear to work as well. I hope I\u0027m not sticking my nose where it doesn\u0027t belong, I\u0027m just a really big fan of this mod and want to assist in any way I can.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T17:37:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 05:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by V8jester\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristonwilson12","CreatedById":136353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:35:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edo any of these mod work in 1.0.2\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022reese1221\u0022 data-cite=\u0022reese1221\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edo any of these mod work in 1.0.2\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost likely they do not.
