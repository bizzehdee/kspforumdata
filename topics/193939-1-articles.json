I was trying to play this game on ps4 in \u0022science mode\u0022 using the radial preset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would start a new game, build a starter rocket, and launch it as usual. Everything going normal. I can save the game and load it. I land my craft without anything breaking or separating, but I cannot recover the vessel. I can EVA, walk around, go back to the center, do other things but I cannot recover any vessels at all. I have tried starting new games however nothing changes. Please help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
