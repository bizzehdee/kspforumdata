Sure, one could try to strut the heck out of the rocket to stiffen it up but I always aim for the simplest more reliable rockets. The way Anvil is packaged you can combine the CSBs in a variety of ways that will still deliver your payload properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not my intent to separate the engines from the fuel tanks any time in the future unless KSP evolves in such a way as to compel me to.

Often times it only took me a single test flight to satisfy myself with its functionality. Alternatively I have had trouble with the designs and I\u0027ve gone through numerous iterations.
