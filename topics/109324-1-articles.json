Unfortunately, you may find you need to *start* the engine within that range, which can be problematic with some heavy lift engines."},{"CreatedByName":"savior","CreatedById":143722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T07:52:56Z","Content":"Ok so i just need to START the engine in that range ? even for 1 second ? \n\nIt can be tricky indeed.

Is this the correct way to do it ?\n\nThe easiest way to test a single part is to exploit the fact that starting the engine is what matters, not whether it actually works. If you want to test a booster rocket you can remove all of the fuel from that booster first, to make it lighter and thus easier to get where you need it. You can do the same thing with liquid fuel rockets by not bothering to give the test engine a fuel tank.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And could this temporary availability of technology be used to exploit and reach some parts where you could not otherwise ?\n\nYes, it could.

I use that only to limit let\u0027s say, the solid boosters boost to 66% to make it last longer. Can i also put less fuel inside the same way? And in that way does the piece cost less?"},{"CreatedByName":"Amram","CreatedById":8067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T10:24:28Z","Content":"yep, right click your part. if its a booster, right click the booster,and remove some/all the solid fuel, so your only hoisting an empty tube, much easier to get it up there. For fuel tanks, same thing, though when testing engines its simpler to just not attach any fuel for that engine at all, it doesn\u0027t need it for the test(an oversight imo...)\n\nbtw, the pod carries 10 units of RCS, early game, when you have no thrusters, right click, remove, save weight, more dv."},{"CreatedByName":"percyPrune","CreatedById":130676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T10:51:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And could this temporary availability of technology be exploited to reach some place that you could not otherwise ?\n\nOh yes!

You just have to be a little sneaky how you activate it.\n\nHere\u0027s the key: The contract only cares whether you activate WITH STAGING at the desired height/speed. It doesn\u0027t care whether the engine ever was previously activated via another method.\n\nSo for example, let\u0027s say I have a contract to test an engine at 21K to 25K altitude, and it\u0027s one that would actually be useful to get up there.\n\nI go to the launchpad, and activate the engine by right clicking on it, NOT by staging. I use it to fly up to 21K, then I right click it to deactivate. NOW I activate it via staging. Presto, contract is fulfilled. (You can also use an action group for toggling the engine on off, saves hassle.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T18:11:17Z","Content":"What Snark said.\n\n![8zXzOHn.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/8zXzOHn.png?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"ArchGaden","CreatedById":116362,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T18:31:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh yes!

You can build the part onto vessels as long as you have the contract. Once the contract is completed, parts that you still have on vessels will stay there (won\u0027t disappear) and usable, but you just can\u0027t launch a new vessel with the part (no longer there in construction). The only downside is that before you improve the contract center enough, you have limited contract slots."}]}
