The Kerbal model has remained basically the same since this game became available in 2011, it is one of the oldest unchanged assets in the game. Besides the guys in the space buildings, all your astronauts look exactly the same, this move by Squad is an indication of their commitment to the new \u0027Beta\u0027 state of the game, the idea of going back and Redoing and improving the work done in earlier versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe addition of a new model is just the start of that, it is possible that this might lead to a \u0027Kerbalizer\u0027 (god who remembers that) system in the game. Where the Astronauts have certain features, like certain types of hair or facial features and that you can customize them to your own taste, thus creating a Xcom kind of situation where you get more attached to them since you invested time into them.
