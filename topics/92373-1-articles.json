The higher it is, the faster you go up, because it indicate the amount of thrust you have to lift a given mass. So if you have a TWR of 1, you have the exact amount of thrust for...being in place. Because the amount of gravitational force from all that weight dragging down is exactly the amount of thrusting force that you can impart on your vehicle, and the two equal force counter each other out. When TWR is \u0026gt;1, you can achieve lift off. The more you have, the faster you go to space. I don\u0027t know the problems that may occur in stock for too high TWR, but in FAR/DRE, that is just asking for your rapid unplanned disassembly in mid air as you are essentially ramming super fast into the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important note in the case of space planes or stuff with wings and launch horizontally - They have 2 things that allow them to take off with less than 1 TWR: Lift and horizontal vector of thurst. Lifting surfaces generate lift (obviously) and that assist you to fight against gravity. Horizontal vector of thurst means less of your thrust is used to counter gravitational forces. Since gravity drag you directly down, if you want to go directly up, you have to have more power than gravity to lift off. However, if you change that vector into one that is not directly opposite the direction of gravity, less of your thrust is being used to fight gravity and more being used for launching your craft. That said, don\u0027t try having less than 0.5 TWR unless you really know what you are doing. It is hard to fly those things and it is difficult to design properly.

The reason we chose TWR like we do is so that our rockets ascend at terminal velocity, this is the point during a freefall where air resistance equals the force of gravity, the same is true on ascent. If you ascent slower than terminal velocity you lose dV to gravity, if you ascend faster than terminal velocity you lose dV to drag. A good rule of thumb is that a TWR of 2.0 will give you exactly terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Delta-V (dV) is a measure of how much your rocket can change it\u0027s velocity.

If your TWR is below 1 for the body you\u0027re landed on, the ship will not be able to accelerate upwards because its thrust is not enough to overcome gravity. A minimum of about 1.2 is required for an efficient ascent. Higher TWR will allow a more efficient ascent, especially on airless bodies, but too high a TWR means you\u0027re carrying excess mass in the form of engines. Once in orbit, TWR becomes much less important. Very low TWRs can be used there, the only real limit is your patience in doing long burns. A lower TWR in orbit means a more efficient ship, but a higher TWR in orbit means more efficient burns.

Wasteful. The game\u0027s default drag model is based on a number of factors: mass (the unrealistic bit), coefficient of drag, atmospheric density and velocity. The fast you go, the more drag you generate, and the formula uses the square of the velocity - the end result is that the increase in drag generated as your velocity goes up will more than counter the decrease in due to lowering atmospheric density. You start generating sufficient drag force to counter your rate of acceleration, which in turn means more energy is required to overcome the drag, which translates to delta-V lost. And speaking of...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Delta-V is a measure of your rocket\u0027s ability to make changes to its velocity (i.e. to change the speed and/or direction of its travel) under its own power. A rocket in space will travel forever, of course; this figure measures how much it can accelerate before it runs out of fuel. To determine the delta-V, you use the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation: dV = ln(M/Mo)*Isp*Go, where ln is the natural logarithm function (look for it on a calculator), M is the mass of the rocket when it\u0027s full of fuel, Mo is the mass of the rocket when it\u0027s out of fuel (i.e. its \u0022dry mass\u0022), Isp is the specific impulse of the engine (a measure of its efficiency, quantified in units of seconds) and Go is standard gravity (9.8 m/s^2 under ALL circumstances). The equation works for individual stages; for a multi-stage rocket, you determine the delta-V of each individual stage and then sum them all together to get the total delta-V of the rocket, treating any later stages along with the dry mass of the current stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat may have been confusing; hopefully not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. 4500 is generally what you\u0027re shooting for to get all the way into orbit.

The units track there directly and simply. The way in which the dV is \u0022spent\u0022 to change KE or orbital specific energy is purely dependent on the direction relative to travel in which the dV is spent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, there is \u003Cem\u003Eno way\u003C/em\u003E someone could interpret the dV for Joules (or any other measure of energy) on the maps because the dV provided is equivalent across separate vessels where kinetic energy is not. In fact, the dV values being independent of mass is the \u003Cem\u003Ereason\u003C/em\u003E maps are written using dV units instead of kinetic energy. Orbital energy itself is often actually written as energy per [vessel] mass to get around this issue, but I\u0027m guessing talking about J/kg instead of m/s of transfer energy would make half the community\u0027s heads explode...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, it would \u003Cstrong\u003EX m/s dV\u003C/strong\u003E for ship to transfer to the Mun from a 75 km parking orbit around Kerbin if it weighed 2 t or 20 t (given an equivalent set transfer orbit), but it would \u003Cstrong\u003EY Joules \u003C/strong\u003Eof KE for the 2 t ship to transfer and \u003Cstrong\u003E10Y Joules\u003C/strong\u003E for the 20 t ship to transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it that you don\u0027t realize that there are very specific assumptions about transfers and orbits included in every one of those dV maps?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, you can ignore the first two points and that last question. I\u0027m done with this discussion. You either don\u0027t understand the concepts you\u0027re arguing about or you can\u0027t express them in a way to be understood. In either case, further discussion is a waste of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeace.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T22:06:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Empiro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Empiro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe thing is, while you can relate energy to dV, this relationship is extremely non-linear, so it\u0027s rarely ever helpful in expressing things in terms of energy. \u003Cp\u003EFor example, doubling the amount of fuel doubles the amount of chemical energy in the fuel, but in general, it doesn\u0027t double the amount of dV. Likewise, two maneuvers that necessitate the same change in kinetic energy might require vastly differing amounts of dV because of the Oberth effect. This is the reason why we use dV maps instead of delta-Joule(per kg) maps -- in the former case, you don\u0027t need to break out the calculators to see exactly how much fuel you\u0027ll actually wind up burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso agreed here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Long way around to the point that we all agree on: When we refer to DV, we are actually referring to energy although we do not *express* it as such. It is far more convenient for us to work in terms of DV, much like a pilot will prefer to calculate fuel economy in terms of minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrD","CreatedById":103953,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T00:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow you guys are making this way too complicated for a new guy, although the conversaton is very interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta V is change in velocity which is speed and direction. It\u0027s easiest to understand when you make a maneuver node, you will have to point in a certain direction, and change your speed in that direction by some amount. This amount will be shown as a bar to the right of the nav ball. You need enough fuel to bring the bar all the way down to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalculating delta V is very tricky and it\u0027s best to get KER. Or you can just over-build your rockets and play around until you get a feel for what you need in a rocket to get to orbit. You will fail but that\u0027s half the fun.

In fact you velocity changes by the acceleration provided by gravity multiplied by the time in orbit. It\u0027s just that all the velocity changes occur in direction not speed (assuming a circular orbit, of course in eccentric orbits you speed does change as well.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
