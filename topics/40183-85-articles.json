The advantage is that the mod would be able to set the weight of the cargo exactly, which could make the contract easier or harder (and give me a reason to design a ship that can carry a sh*t ton of cargo). In addition, does the mod just require satellites in orbit around Kerbin or other moons/planets as well? I would love a mission requiring me to get a satellite into orbit around the mun, or Jool.... Also, i think science missions should require a polar orbit around the moon/planet, since this is how you can scan the whole surface (perhaps the mission isnt complete until the probe scans the whole surface, so you have to stay in orbit for a while with time warp on, obviously).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Is it possible to add rescue missions around other moons/planets?
