I have animated solar panels but the animation is very wobbly on close inspection. The animation was also very hard to make because I had to go in almost keyframe by keyframe to make it look right.

I can animate, but you can see the horribleness if you look closely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vegany","CreatedById":35541,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-20T17:25:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etry perenting the panels so thay perent in a line so 1 to 2 to 3 to 4.... and so on.

Might help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 If it is \u0022floating off the axis\u0022 then you have three things to look at. The object origin is what it should rotate around. The other thing to look at is to make sure you are actually rotating around the object origin or around the 3D cursor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 If it is floating off after being animated, then you first keyframe is not set correctly. You can try to use ctrl-A to apply rotation, location, and scale when you start on frame 1. I myself prefer to move to frame on, click record, select all, move 0, rotate 0, and scale 1. I find that I have a better starting point for setting up my actions (it gives me all 9 tracks on my keyfram/f curve/NLA/dopesheets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 - This is probably where you are if you\u0027re reasonably decent at Blender but stuck on getting the part into KSP - Make sure that the origin is aligned with your \u0022axis\u0022 or else Unity will not correctly accept the animation. Blender may animate it the way you want to see, but if your object origin is not aligned to your axis of rotation, Unity will have it animate way out of whack. Blenders object data includes an entire stack of transforms (movements and rotations) on objects and can interpolate between when your object transforms bounce from local space to world space. So far I\u0027ve only found the object data being origin based - location on 3 axes, rotation 3 axes, (and maybe scaling on 3 axes, not sure) in Unity. There\u0027s probably a way to change the tracks in Unity to follow world space instead of local space, but you\u0027d have to ask somebody who knows Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
