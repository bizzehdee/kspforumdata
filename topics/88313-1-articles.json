The problem is that with lots of mods comes lots of memory consumption. KSP pre-loads all textures at startup and keeps them loaded throughout the game. This is probably done to speed up load times for when you encounter ships in the persistent environment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this strategy is that Squad only expects to load their assets and only tested for their assets. They expect KSP to run with a 2gb footprint with some margin for in game memory changes.. When you start adding mods to your KSP that add parts you increase the memory footprint. If you have few mods you\u0027ll edge close to the 3.5gb hard limit for memory used by KSP before it crashes. That limit is imposed by the 32bit Unity engine. This means your KSP may suddenly crash mid game for no apparent reason. If you have a lot of mods then you\u0027ll break that limit before loading finishes. In both cases you\u0027ll see a small window saying KSP crashed when you alt-tab out of it. If you were to read the log file you\u0027d find right before the crash dump there was an error for running out of memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far the best way I\u0027ve found to help reduce that footprint is Active Texture Management, which I linked above. If you have a lot of mods installed and have frequent crashes on startup or in game I suggest that you get this mod. It will put the textures on your video card buffer and save at least 40% of the memory consumed by KSP normally. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo a smooth and stable modded experience \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mystique","CreatedById":95628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T11:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a great mod, though after last game\u0026amp;mod\u0027s update I had to disable it - it actually uses more memory when enabled, perhaps due to some bugs or mod conflict (most likely with Texture Replacer), so use it carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
