I use it to unlock all of the tech nodes that I could get for a particular R\u0026amp;D center level and turn on part unlock costs so that I just play career mode with funds but no science requirements. You can also use it to unlock all of the tech nodes, including ones you couldn\u0027t normally reach because of the R\u0026amp;D center level. Additionally, the third mode lets you unlock specific nodes for free, but (for the moment) still requires you to purchase the prerequisite nodes and can\u0027t unlock ones past the R\u0026amp;D center level requirements. If someone asks, I can probably get around those limits pretty easily.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
