So we can actually help you with this. Sometimes, when we test new things for Chaka, it becomes helpful to get a little extra headroom on memory, so we have in the past removed certain parts of the Squad folder to make space. You can remove large chunks of it but yes, there are a few squad parts used in the craft files.\n\nHere is the short list which we reserve the right to edit!\n\n**Cupola interior space**\n\n**stock lights**\n\n**several radial decouplers**\n\n**RCS ports**\n\n**Sound and FX files**\n\n**Squad ladders!** \n\nMaybe more will do some critical thinking.\n\nSo if you leave those in place there is a huge chunk of the squad folder you can toss and gain a sizable amount of memory.\n\nGood question!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-15T04:20:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2015 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T04:34:14Z","Content":"If anyone want the launch smoke on the RS-68 engines unzip and open file and copy the CMES folder to your KSP/GameData folder [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/CMES/CMES_RS-68.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/CMES/CMES_RS-68.zip)\n\nThis is just the 2 engines CFG"},{"CreatedByName":"Phineas Freak","CreatedById":146521,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T08:09:07Z","Content":"To anyone asking for RO configs (and to relieve YANFRET): i am responsible for the CMES RO configs.
