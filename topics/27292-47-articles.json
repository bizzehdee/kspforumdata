I didn\u0027t start out to do that. I was just trying to launch the engine section of what will eventually become an interplanetary ship. The plan was to launch it empty and fill its tanks in orbit. But first I realized I hadn\u0027t installed any empty tank mods since 0.21. Rather than go look for them, I figured I\u0027d just vent the fuel off on the pad using the TAC Fuel Balancer mod I did have. But the relatively small rocket that could lift the empty tanks couldn\u0027t survive just holding up the weight of the full tanks during venting, so I had to build a big rocket just for structural strength. And once I\u0027d got that far, I decided WTF? Let\u0027s see if I can just launch the thing full up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Big Clyde\u0022 here is the result. All the 2-high KW Rocketry tankage is 1 enormous ascent stage with 4 of the big 4-barreled engines. It\u0027s ALMOST SSTO without the SRBs. All the SRBs do is save about 600 dV in the KWR tanks so the main engines can do most of the apoapsis burn. Without them, the payload doesn\u0027t have enough TWR to finish off the orbit. The payload is 5 big nuke engines and tanks, a docking port, and not much else. It weighs 177 tons starting out but burns about 10 tons of fuel at apoapsis, so 167 tons delivered to LKO out of 1710 tons to start with.

I put up a half-dozen scanning probes - one in polar orbit, on in an equatorial orbit, for Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus. I also put up the first module of Ascension Station, which hangs out over Kerbin at 450km. Then I put up my space telescope in geosynchronous orbit over KSC, and I put my first UX-120 Research Outpost down on the Mun. The UX-120 was an idea I came up with awhile ago, for a tiny two-part base that could be dropped on any planet I\u0027m not going to bother colonizing. I\u0027ve put one down on Mun, tomorrow I\u0027ll put one on Minmus. I want to also put them on Gilly, Duna, Ike, and Dres.

Okay, I had gotten four mini sats in LKO, and was just finishing up putting my third massive long-range comsat in KSO when I heard a mild *thud (in my apartment, not the game). I though nothing of it, since it\u0027s a cruddy apartment in the middle of Edmonton that makes weird noises all the time. A few moments later I had just finished getting my orbital period to six hours on the nose, so I took off the SAS and went to point it North. As soon as I turned off the SAS my satellite started rotating uncontrollably, and only with SAS would it stop. Okay, back to the space centre and re-load the craft, same thing. That\u0027s odd, back to the space centre, load up a different craft, and the same thing happens, as soon as SAS is off, it begins to spin. Now at this point I\u0027m getting a bit worried, is it one of the mods acting up? Did I break the game somehow? I pause for a moment and go fill my water bottle that I keep by my couch (beats filling a cup every ten minutes). As I\u0027m walking back I figured out what the problem was... That thud I had heard was my XBox 360 controller falling on the floor, and the way it had fallen took a few seconds for it to flip onto the sticks.

After a few test drops on Kerbin he decided instead of strutting everything together like we normally do he would just hop out of the command module and go down to the hitchhiker can before starting his descent.

Its just a huge weight (nearly empty anyway) on top of the can. Except the landing struts no longer extended to the ground, not to mention Jeb had planned on lowering the struts after landing to put the can on the ground.
