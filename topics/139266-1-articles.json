I can do it with rockets, but it just seems much more viable to me to use a reusable SSTO. I\u0027ve read most of the good guides out there and I watched all the up-to-date youtube videos on the topic (More or less up to date, most of them were in version 1.0.4). Following all of the tips and instructions given to me I made a basic space plane with ~9km of DV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, no matter what I try this thing won\u0027t get into orbit.

I\u0027d put some little canards on the front, but you seem to have plenty of attitude control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT, the deal goes like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) MK2 parts (despite being supposedly \u0022higher tech\u0022) have\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esignificantly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0higher drag than the equivalent MK1 parts. So by using MK2 you are already starting at a disadvantage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) To have lots of fuel left when you get to orbit, you need to get through all that atmosphere with not much drag. So you need to pay attention to the way drag changes with speed and nose inclination. Drag basically goes with the square of your speed -- so you don\u0027t really want to be hitting 600 m/s\u00A0until maybe 8km altitude. 1200 m/s at 22km or so.\u00A0If you\u0027re going faster than that before then, you\u0027re going too fast. Drag increases rapidly as your nose rises from a 2 degree inclination, to 10 degrees, and then to 30 degrees. Then it \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E goes crazy. In the lower atmosphere, keep your nose to maybe 5 degrees above prograde, max. In the upper atmosphere, don\u0027t let your nose go over 30 degrees. 45 degrees is a very bad idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) You have a lot more engine than you really need, and engines weigh a lot. The whole point\u00A0of RAPIER engines is that you do not need any other kind -- admittedly\u00A0they are not as efficient as Whiplashes (or Panthers on afterburner).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like those shock cones myself, and I understand that you need something to stick them on -- but you may just want to try a couple\u00A0of the radial ramp\u00A0intakes, get rid of the nacelles, and the whiplashes, and see what happens when you just run on the two RAPIERs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Heating. If you launch properly, your speed will be between 1300 m/s and 1500 m/s (surface)\u00A0between 25km and 35km alt. This is the danger zone. My answer is to climb through it as fast as you can (this is where I say you should\u00A0let your nose go to a 30 degree AoA). There are other answers for how to get through this zone\u00A0-- throttle back, minimize drag, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Don\u0027t overuse the controls. Every time you hit a key, it slows your plane down. A lot. I like using the SAS system, and just alternating between \u0022prograde\u0022 and \u0022stability\u0022 to control the nose angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T06:27:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 06:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir Derpykins","CreatedById":163791,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T14:13:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it feasible for me to still use mk2 parts if I want something reasonably efficient?
