Oberth about fuel-efficiency: you get more delta-V per unit of fuel burned the faster you\u0027re going at the time. You\u0027re going fastest at Pe so that\u0027s the most fuel-efficient place to burn. But you\u0027re going to burn at Pe anyway because that\u0027s where you need the least delta-V, however efficiently you\u0027re burning fuel to make it, to change your Ap. Thus, even if Oberth didn\u0027t exist, you\u0027d still be burning at Pe to get the desired Ap (or escape trajectory). This will still require the same amount of delta-V, but because there\u0027s Oberth, you get a bonus in fuel efficiency so this delta-V doesn\u0027t require as much fuel as it would otherwise. IOW, Oberth is just a side-effect of what you\u0027d be doing anyway, so isn\u0027t in itself a stand-alone thing you need to plan for. Is this correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it seems to me that Oberth only comes into play at all when you\u0027re not in a circular obit.

This implies that Oberth has no bearing at all on doing transfer burns from parking orbits, except that starting in a lower orbit with a higher speed would be a bit more fuel-efficient that starting in a higher orbit with a lower speed. However, assuming your ship got into its parking orbit starting from the ground on that planet, wouldn\u0027t you have already reaped the benefit of the lower altitude during launch? The delta-V for the actual transfer burn is less from the higher orbit because you\u0027ve already done part of the burn to get into the higher orbit in the first place.

Even ignoring Oberth, you certainly do not always get the same amount of delta-V per unit of fuel. Delta-V is just another word for acceleration (change in velocity) and acceleration = F/m. For a given engine, full throttle F and Isp are both constant but m decreases as fuel burns. Thus, throughout the burn, the instantaneous acceleration you\u0027re getting increases as the mass decreases (IOW, TWR increases), and each increment of the burn consumes the same amount of fuel due to the constant Isp. Thus, you more acceleration per unit of fuel as the burn continues, which is the same as saying more delta-V per unit of fuel. This happens all by itself even before considering Oberth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Kinetic Energy Ek = 1/2 * m * v^2. As fuel burns, m decreases so Ek decreases from that cause. Thus, any net increase in Ek has to be due to a velocity increase. Increasing velocity = changing velocity = delta-V = acceleration. And as outlined above, acceleration increases during a burn, resulting in more delta-V per unit of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now Oberth is adding Ek to the ship on top of this weight-loss process. Adding Ek means increasing velocity, which means accelerating the ship, which means delta-V. That is, what Oberth is doing is adding a bit more acceleration to what the engines are already providing. Thus, you\u0027re getting a higher amount of delta-V out of the burn without having to burn more fuel to get it, so again, more delta-V per unit of fuel.

Even ignoring Oberth, you certainly do not always get the same amount of delta-V per unit of fuel. Delta-V is just another word for acceleration (change in velocity) and acceleration = F/m. For a given engine, full throttle F and Isp are both constant but m decreases as fuel burns. Thus, throughout the burn, the instantaneous acceleration you\u0027re getting increases as the mass decreases (IOW, TWR increases), and each increment of the burn consumes the same amount of fuel due to the constant Isp.

Burning the fuel by itself gives you X delta-V, Oberth adds some more delta-V without burning additional fuel because increasing Ek means increasing, and thus \u0022delta-ing\u0022, velocity. So, you get more delta-V for a given amount of fuel burned if you\u0027re going faster than slower.
