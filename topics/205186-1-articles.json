Anyone know what it is doing while it should be more or less doing nothing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust curious, mostly. Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack is probably the most GPU-intensive mod, but it shouldn\u0027t have anything to do when the paused; other than that I have MechJeb and some parts and textures mods (Near Future, ReStock\u002B), and System Heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
