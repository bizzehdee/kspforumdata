However the problem I have is that the only time I\u0027ve seen them, is in old Lets Play videos of Kerbal Space Program from 2013.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI installed KW Rocketry, with Community Fixes and interstage, using CKAN. However the only part I get is the procedural fairing part. And I really don\u0027t like that bit, it auto-ejects my crafts immediately. I can\u0027t seperate the fairing, without at the same time detaching the spacecraft. Besides they\u0027re four times the work, angular\u00A0and ugly. In fact I can\u0027t even tell what the difference is from the kw parts and default fairings in the game... I wonder if there\u0027s a conflict of sorts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid non-procedural parts get removed from KW Rocketry? They\u0027re not in the tech tree, there\u0027s nothing to unlock anywhere with them. Only the procedural fairings show up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know how you open a procedural fairing without detaching the spacecraft? Say if you\u0027re doing remotetech, and you have a powerful booster, and you want to open the fairing, so you can unfold the antenna, but without leaving the booster stage behind? This looks easy with the old KW fairings, as opening the fairing and seperation are two different stages. Yet with procedurals you get both, and then your craft is ejected swiftly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-12T19:43:18Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2016 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\u0022 class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u002293fff6fcfdfbf2e1f7e3e1fafde7e9d3f4fef2faffbdf0fcfe\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"[email\u0026#160;protected]","CreatedById":158507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T20:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be noted that its definitely the KW procedural fairing, and not the stock equivalent, but it seems to act exactly like the stock procedural fairing, including seperating the craft immediately after opening the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T20:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven the old non-procedural KW fairings deployed and decoupled at the same time when staging.
