I\u0027m playing Career mode from a new game start.\n\nFor the life of me, I can\u0027t figure out how to stuff Goo Canisters in the Service Bay. Do I need to advance to get cubic octagonal struts or something? The best I can do clips them facing inward radially mounted with the mounting section sticking through the module doors and into the next part below.\n\nAm I doing something wrong?\n\nThanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T18:22:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Soda Popinski**"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:33:10Z","Content":"Use the controls (Q,E,W,A,S,D) to rotate it around until it fits correctly.
