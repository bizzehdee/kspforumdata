I quite like where you are going with that; it almost gives off kind of an oldschool SimCity vibe (in a good way). at least as a starting spot, then made 3d and Kerbalized. When I was first replying, my brain went in a kind of subnautica/satisfactory direction (especially with kerbals having inventories in ksp1 these days that they can build with a bit), but I quite like what you are getting at. Having that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E-like ability to adjust and it from all different angles, and tinker/experiment/manipulate stuff would be really useful and would eliminate a lot of potential hassle on larger colonies/bases (in fact, running with that, I wouldn\u0027t mind having some of that functionality on space stations that have dockyards (only the orbital shipyards though, I think; it would be kind of cheating with smaller stations, but for something massive enough to be a shipyard it would be really handy to be able to tinker with the design a bit without having to do massive redocking operations or just building a new station)). Having a way to view resource chains a la SimCity electrical/water view (very roughly analogously, at least), could be handy too, especially depending on how that whole subsystem ends up being implemented, and an auto build/build time system tied to resources seems like a good way to gate things fairly (and also would let you just go crazy in sandbox mode with resource management turned off, assuming that will be an option).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlmost most of all, I really like the concept of being able to destroy/rebuild as you get new and better parts and technology. I definitely like to upgrade bases and stations, both technologically and cosmetically, as I progress along, and the sheer hassle of that has very often led me to just abandon older bases and start from scratch as I move up the tech tree; being able to actually update and evolve, at least the important ones, instead sounds REALLY nice. When I first read your idea, I thought it sounded like too much of a departure from the rest of the game, but after further consideration, I take that back completely, I think something along those lines would be a great way to integrate the new gameplay elements. I also am in favor of things that make you more invested in your colonies and stations; as it stands now, it\u0027s fun creating new ones, but once they are in place,\u00A0 there is really nothing, apart from a bit of science and fuel, outside of your imagination keeping them actually relevant for anything. I\u0027m definitely glad they seem to be moving pretty heavily in that direction for ksp2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I\u0027ve seen, they have shown us next to nothing about what they are actually implementing for those gameplay elements and systems, but I hope they are at least heading in a direction closer to your ideas than to ksp1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astroneer08","CreatedById":223777,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-16T18:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have ksp 1 and love the idea of procedural parts!
