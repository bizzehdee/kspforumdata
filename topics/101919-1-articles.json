Instead of asking Squad to make a new one per update, why don\u0027t Squad simply let us edit the icons like the flags?"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T14:21:28Z","Content":"Wouldn\u0027t that be confusing when streaming or showing movies?"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T14:52:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wouldn\u0027t that be confusing when streaming or showing movies?\n\nNo more confusing than streaming or displaying a modded install and having people ask \u0027what mod is that part from?\u0027. \n\nI agree with OP, it\u0027d be nice to access the icons.
