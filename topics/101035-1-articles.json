It was launched to a 420km orbit and had a thruster to keep it in orbit for 18 months. But for some reason it has lost altitude every day and is now gone. It could be solar winds but all other satellites are fine, odd.

And yes I have done the same in KSP, however my point stand, had this been the final circulating burn by the satellite after it upper stage separation it would be very understandable. However not understanding that is wrong then the satellite orbit become lower then they do an orbit raising burns over a week sounds more like an organization issue than quality control. Don\u0027t they have an copy on ground? I thought that was pretty standard for non standard satellites and probes?"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T22:14:13Z","Content":"Okay, I have learnt that the issue was not due to the thruster firing the wrong way, if fact the thruster was never fired for some reason (one theory is thermodynamics breaking pipes). This leaves the important question of how it decayed in less the a month when the previous satellite Navid lasted 2 months at the same altitude. My guess is solar winds."}]}
