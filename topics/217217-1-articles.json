I have over 100 mods installed, including MKS, Galaxies Unbound, and Blackrack\u0027s volumetric clouds. I\u0027ve experienced my fair share of bugs (exploding crafts, editor bugs/craft file corruption, crashes, removing some stars from GU which I\u0027ve never visited despawned crafts which were in orbit around Mun), and the performance is pretty poor due to poor CPU and GPU utilization levels (~40 fps in orbit), which pretty much nullifies any benefit to my having an RTX 4090, etc. That being said, the gameplay is so rewarding that I still push through the bugs and poor performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt made me realize what I really want KSP 2 to be, and what it is basically supposed to be: Modded KSP 1, but with better feature implementation, and VASTLY better performance. Personally, I think MKS does colonization pretty well, and while I\u0027m excited to see what the KSP 2 devs have done with it, I\u0027m mainly looking to KSP 2 to implement the same or better quality features without the bugs and performance issues you have to endure (no matter the hardware) with modded KSP 1. It is through this lens that I view KSP 2\u0027s development: not so much whether they\u0027re implementing new parts, features or reworked science. These things are nice, but they\u0027re not so different from what we already have with FREE KSP 1 mods. The NEW thing I paid $50 for, is the promise of eventually getting these things, plus performance and stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current performance and stability issues KSP 2 has aren\u0027t so concerning to me- rather, it\u0027s to be expected. What IS a concern, is when a community poll shows that a vast majority people on this forum don\u0027t believe the game has the \u0022foundations\u0022 to make 1000 part vessels a reality, and most respondents didn\u0027t think the game would ever get to that point. This gets to the question of reworked systems, and there is a concerning pattern:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The \u003Cstrong\u003Ephysics system\u003C/strong\u003E is supposed to be substantially changed, to make larger crafts performant. According to data miners, they\u0027ve made some edits to the base unity physics engine, but anyone who\u0027s played the game knows that they haven\u0027t reworked the physics system in a fundamental way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- They demoed an \u003Cstrong\u003Eatmospheric scattering system\u003C/strong\u003E that hasn\u0027t been integrated. We don\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible to make it performant and game-ready.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The \u003Cstrong\u003Ereworked terrain system\u003C/strong\u003E has not yet been implemented. For now, we are stuck with almost the same thing that we had in KSP 1, with some revamped textures and new heightmaps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The \u003Cstrong\u003Ereworked heating system\u003C/strong\u003E is not yet in place, though hopefully it will be soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The \u003Cstrong\u003Ereworked aero model\u003C/strong\u003E is fundamentally similar to KSP 1, with maybe some tweaks to formulas and weightings to accomodate procedural wings.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The \u003Cstrong\u003Emaneuver system\u003C/strong\u003E has been reworked, but creating maneuvers is very clunky and we don\u0027t know if the rework was fully successful due to having no interstellar bodies to test it on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The \u003Cstrong\u003Etrajectory system\u003C/strong\u003E was reworked to accommodate long-duration burns and\u00A0brachistochrone transfers, however it is currently broken. Good luck getting a Tylo gravity assist, I hope Tylo ends up being where the game says it will, but in my experience, it almost never is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- We have not yet seen the full \u003Cstrong\u003Epersistent supply consumption and transport system\u003C/strong\u003E that will facilitate colonies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- I\u0027m not sure if they\u0027ve implemented the \u003Cstrong\u003Elocation system which moves the origin\u003C/strong\u003E to accommodate interstellar distances- if they have, seen my trajectories bullet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- We don\u0027t know what the \u003Cstrong\u003Enew science system\u003C/strong\u003E is going to be, but I suspect it will be fine, so not much worry there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- We don\u0027t really know about \u003Cstrong\u003Emultiplayer\u003C/strong\u003E. Presumably this will require fundamentally new under the hood tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- I\u0027m not sure where the \u003Cstrong\u003Etutorial system\u003C/strong\u003E stands- I haven\u0027t really paid attention to it. I remember there being lots of bugs, but presumably those will be fixed. What remains to be seen is if these tutorials will succeed in attracting or onboarding new players more effectively than Scott Manley videos- that question is way up in the air ATM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Am I missing a reworked \u0022under-the-hood\u0022 system from this list? Do I have inaccurate information? Please let me know- I\u0027m going off memory here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is not that we don\u0027t have all the features or that it\u0027s very early access, or that the game should be in a more advanced state- those debates have been played out (and are still playing out) elsewhere. My point is that, in my opinion, KSP 2 will live or die by\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethese\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0bullet points, not just in the extent to which they are implemented, but that they\u0027re implemented\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eperformantly\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eand\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Erelatively bug-free\u003C/strong\u003E. These core systems and their quality are what really counts, long-term. I\u0027ve heard this sentiment expressed elsewhere in the fanbase and I wanted to state it clearly here. I\u0027ve seen a lot of comments to the effect of: \u0022Wow, KSP 2 obviously has a great team of visual artists. They are good at designing parts, planets and they are good at having ideas for the game. But we have no idea if that beautiful planet texture and terrain tessellation will make it into the game, and we don\u0027t know if they physics system will allow players to make use of those massive interplanetary transfer parts.\u0022 Are they doing well at implementing reworked core systems? We just don\u0027t know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI asked this question for both of the Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s, and despite the fact that, in my view, it is the single most important question facing KSP 2\u0027s development, I don\u0027t believe they addressed it (at least not in my brief review of the transcripts). \u003Cb\u003EDoes anyone have information that I\u0027m missing on this? Or just interesting opinions?\u003C/b\u003E\u00A0I feel like I see a lot of yelling about \u0022BUGS BUGS BUGS\u0022 and a lot of yelling about \u0022IT\u0027S EARLY ACCESS OF COURSE IT\u0027S LAGGY\u0022, but these conversations tend to miss the point if the cause of the low FPS is a fundamental issue rather than bug-hunting or other optimization problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-15T14:26:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2023 02:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by VlonaldKerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alexoff","CreatedById":145774,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-15T14:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224283564\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217217\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221684160216\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225683\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VlonaldKerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, VlonaldKerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe don\u0027t know what the \u003Cstrong\u003Enew science system\u003C/strong\u003E is going to be, but I suspect it will be fine, so not much worry there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it will just be copied from KSP1, since the developers did not show us anything in the gameplay videos that would not be in KSP1 mods.

Of the new, only a wrapper that requires a lot of computer resources. The new gameplay element - colonies - is definitely not coming this year, and Nate has already told us that they won\u0027t be as impressive as they were in the 2019 trailer. I don\u2019t understand at all why KSP2 was (poorly) created twice from scratch, in 6 years it was possible to disassemble the KSP1 code line by line, improve the existing one and make improved game. Does anyone care what Portal 2 is based on Portal 1? If KSP2 turned out to be KSP1 with a big modpack integrated inside, there would be less dissapointment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PDCWolf","CreatedById":58026,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-15T16:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is important to know they \u003Cstrong\u003Edidn\u0027t promise\u003C/strong\u003E a \u0022new codebase\u0022 or physics system, or aero, and other core stuff.

A good example of this is the terrain system: there\u0027s a very small chance that changing from PQS\u002B to CBT (which shouldn\u0027t work as they described it) will magically fix performance. Another good example is the janky orbits: provided CBT magically frees a lot of performance budget, how much of that new performance budget and how much work has to go into fixing what seems to be some nasty floating point and thread race issues causing the jank orbits?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce those 2 are fixed, the performance budget left for all of the other planned systems doesn\u0027t look so good.

I\u0027ve often used a quick comparison to find out that we are somewhere 10 to 15 times worst than it should be / it has been advertised, to run 1000 parts craft at decent (let\u0027s say 20 FPS) framerate. It\u0027s... Gigantic, enormous. 50-200% framerate gain are already something really hard to achieve, I don\u0027t see how they could accomplish such a thing while keeping the game as it exists right now. And this performance topic is very centric as it will condition most of what can be added / improved / enhanced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see more and more people saying that they\u0027re not happy with how the game is looking so far. Or actually, I don\u0027t find much people saying otherwise anymore. At the beginning, it was clearly IMPOSSIBLE to say that the game was not looking 2020\u002B as it should. It\u0027s debatable, I guess, but I maintain that it really must be looking decently modern and technically up to date, I don\u0027t understand how / why people are okay, saying that \u0022C\u0027mon it\u0027s KSP who care about graphics\u0022. I do. It\u0027s like, core-feature for a game like this. It means everything. It\u0027s an incentive to visit, to move, to build rovers and plane to find a place and settle cause you find the sweet GPS coordination and to share it with others, to make forums lives, etc etc etc. I very (very (very)) honestly find myself asking if *this* screenshot is KSP1 or KSP2, I mean it ! How is it even possible ? Anyway, now theses people are less prone to engage aggressively when other are saying that they find the game lacking visual attractiveness. I consider it to be very very lacking on this point, and nowhere close to what it should have been.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it\u0027s running bad, while looking bad, and it\u0027s not going to be easy to fix it properly. We might end up with a 1.0 KSP2 in about 18 months, I\u0027d say, including some okay new features, and with performance improvement allowing for 30 FPS with 1000$ rigs and 200 parts craft. Okay. But then... What is the point of KSP2 at all ? It\u0027s what KSP1 is able to do, using mods, for years. I\u0027ve been waiting KSP2 since 2015 : I already had something like 2500 hours and faced the situation where this Indie Game could be so much more beautiful, performant, featureful, bug-less, etc. I\u0027m probably not the only one, for sure ! KSP1 is my favourite game, period. Still, it was already possible to feel a dead-end, the need for a 2nd opus that would be held by professionals, enjoying new techs, new core-dev, new engine, new everything, from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s lightyear from what we have so far, and what we\u0027ll have at the end, i\u0027m afraid. And I would be pleased to be proven wrong, of course.

is Nate, the art director for Human Resources. Hi.\u00A0 I just wanted to address your comment, since it sounds like you think HR is a cool idea, but you\u0027re concerned that we won\u0027t be able to deliver on the promise of the pitch. I am stoked that you liked our idea, first off. I was genuinely worried that folks would think HR was too nuts, so it\u0027s a relief to discover that the idea has traction.\u00A0 I\u0027ve written this in a couple of other places, but I want to reiterate that Uber is for the first time choosing to grow to accommodate two equal-sized projects simultaneously. I am one of several people who were hired explicitly to build this new project. PA is remaining fully-staffed, and that staff is committed to continuing to deliver on the promises made in that Kickstarter.\u00A0 The nice thing is that with a multi-project structure, the company will be better able to support all of our offerings, regardless of their short-term economic viability. With two games on a staggered schedule, we can afford to bring every game to a good level of polish. That\u0027s a whole lot harder to do when you\u0027ve got one team working on one project. If that project hits a rough spot, you\u0027ve got to scramble to figure out how to keep the lights on.\u00A0 There are other benefits to the two-project structure -- namely, that because Human Resources is being built on the PA engine, any improvements we make may also improve the PA experience. We just have more brains working on the problem, and that\u0027s good for both projects.\u00A0 I hope that all made sense. Personally, I think Human Resources is going to be a great game, and it\u0027s existence will help ensure that PA gets the full gestation that it deserves. A vote for Human Resources is a vote for a better PA.\u00A0 We\u0027d love to have your support. Because monsters and robots.\u00A0 Thanks,\u00A0 Nate\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNate Simpson replying to the fallout when Human Resources got cancelled (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/planetaryannihilation/comments/2jtlbf/human_resources_an_apocalyptic_rts_game_canceled/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink to thread\u003C/a\u003E):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get why you feel this way. I think we had a little less control over the timing than many suppose. But regardless, PA will continue to receive upgrades, and I hope very much that it meets your expectations at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m seeing this comment enough on these postmortem threads that I\u0027m going to copy-paste my way-too-long explanation of the timing from the kickstarter comments. Apologies in advance, but I hope it sheds a little light on the timing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cancel the current project, finish PA, come back to HR later.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way game teams work, different people come into play at different points in the pipeline. It starts with a small team doing design and concept art, and then as prototyping gets underway, engineers begin to roll on. Then content starts to get made, which means artists and animators and scripters and more engineers. And once the bulk of that stuff is done, there are loose ends to tie up, bugs to hunt, random UI tweaks to do, visual effects to polish. There\u0027s marketing art, trailers, music and sound effects. In the case of PA, there are also lots of rewards to complete (the art book, custom commanders, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you look at the way the actual hours add up, it resembles a boa constrictor with a wild boar inside it -- narrow at the ends, fat in the middle. And all those surplus people at the ends need to either do something else or go find another job. This is why medium-sized studios often develop two or more projects at a time. If you do it right, you can sort of rotate your crops so that the land is always growing something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPA is at a point where there is still lots of engineering to do, and there are a bunch of engineers dedicated to making that game as awesome as possible. No engineers are working on HR right now. Part of the reason we are doing the Kickstarter is so that we can afford a few engineers to get us to alpha.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe did, however, get help from several PA artists to make the HR trailer. This is a good thing, because the bulk of the art for PA is complete (not all of it, but the bulk of it). I am the only new full-time hire for Human Resources at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuman Resources is its own project, separate from PA, and as such is expected to pull its own weight financially. Ideally, it will eventually bring in enough revenue that it can make the company more stable and more able to lavish the sort of polish on PA that we want, even if financial winds start blowing in an unfavorable direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe existence of HR, while it may seem impertinent or poorly timed to some observers, is actually a thing that A) is necessitated by the distribution of occupations within the company and B) good for PA in the long run, both as a financial buffer and as an incubator for further development of the PA engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this answer was long, but I hope it gives you some insight into why we can\u0027t just stop a thing that we\u0027ve already dumped a bunch of time and money into, teach a bunch of artists how to fix bugs, push them onto PA, send me off to go find another job somewhere, fund the entire company for a year with a single project, and then have me quit whatever other job I got to come back to Uber and try to resurrect a project that has completely lost its momentum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuman Resources lives or dies by what is happening right now. PA will continue to improve and thrive, and our communication with the community will continue to improve (as you\u0027ve seen with Jeremy Ables). Clearly, there are major perception issues right now -- after all, here we are in a thread that\u0027s supposed to be about Human Resources, and we\u0027re talking about a different project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs Uber\u0027s past performance a legitimate topic of discussion? Of course it is. Do we have room to improve? Absolutely. Do I personally think we are a company that is committed to quality and able to deliver on ambitious goals? I absolutely believe it, or I wouldn\u0027t have taken this job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the only place that an idea like Human Resources could have thrived, and these are the only people that I know of who have the right combination of expertise, passion, and technology to get the job done. If we get to make this game, it will melt faces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you need to wait for a while before your faith in Uber is restored, I get it. PA gets better every day, as the recent spate of major updates has shown. I hope we win back every person who feels we\u0027ve let them down.
