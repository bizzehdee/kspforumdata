It\u0027s mainly lag when I have a higher up part count, and get this, when I look at the engines of a ship, it\u0027s framerate is perfect, but if I look at the nose of the plane or ship, it lags a bit? I twaddled with the settings that I didn\u0027t understand, like\u00A0v-sync and shaders and all that, did I mess something up? It ran fine before? And after my first flight, the edge highlights went away, and my shadows slowly disappeared as I played?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speadge","CreatedById":145302,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T08:31:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you have a small plane and just have problems with it when changing the view?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nu could delete the settings file ion ksp directory forcing it to set all done config to \u0022default\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the Part count: there are ENOUGH threads already - and as a new forum member u should fairly learn to use the search function or even check the first side of THIS Topic!.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort: its about your CPU that cant handle a high amount of physic calculations.
