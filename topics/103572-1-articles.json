It\u0027s called \u0022All Utopias Fell\u0022, and it looks very much to me like a crashed Kerbal spaceship (modded, of course):\n\n![MzoNZGA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MzoNZGA.jpg)\n\n![QIX4ls7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QIX4ls7.jpg)\n\nYou can see the solar panels of course and the collapsed parachutes (which are, apparently, persistent in this version). The interior was closed today, but I\u0027ve been inside before and it\u0027s freaky. Exploring it you can find notebooks and other left-behind items that give some clues of who built the spaceship, why, and how it came to crash where it did.

We stopped for a picnic after the drive from NY and noticed the ship \u0022crashed\u0022 up in the catwalk. We hadn\u0027t been inside yet or read anything about it so we didn\u0027t know what it was or if it was even part of the museum. So my daughter and I climbed up and explored it, not quite sure whether we were supposed to. Going inside and finding the abandoned instruments, notebooks etc we started to piece together the backstory. It was really neat to discover the whole thing for ourselves without any meta-explanation."},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T15:39:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s awesome klesh! I remember some friends of mine going to that concert too. Old school cassette for the win!\n\nI bought that cassette in 1990 as a 12yr old and was determined that *that* is what I wanted signed. Jason Faulkner and I had a good laugh when I took it out; he was surprised to see the 24 yr old cassette tape. The groups were going to check out the art museum after the show. Also of note was that I was standing next to the opening act Sean Lennon for awhile (I don\u0027t really go for his stuff, so I didn\u0027t want to ask for his autograph just because of who his parents are) after the show, and he is very short and thin. He was looking like Hey Jude era John Lennon with long hair and a beard. It was very odd, because in the evening light one could very easily mistake him for a diminutive JL. Please ask your friends if they thought the show was too bass-heavy. I was up close and it was chest-explodingly loud. \n\nI didn\u0027t really get to check out the exhibits much, other than walking past that one. There was zillions of people all over and I was more concerned with elbowing my way up close to see my fav guys doing their performance. I live on the east coast of MA, so its hours and hours of driving to go back, but definitely worth it. What a cool venue.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKf-ay2EqLI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
