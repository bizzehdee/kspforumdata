There are several things needed to create a new part; I don\u0027t know about everything involved, but you will need some experience in 3d modeling, texturing, and some other things. I personally don\u0027t know how to do most of it, but I do know that it can take a while to build up the skills required. If you are interested in making parts, and you have the time (lots and lots of time), NovaSilisko and Sunday Punch are the creators of two of the most-used parts packs on the site. You might be able to get some advice, and maybe a starter, from one of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry I can\u0027t help more, but I\u0027ve never been much use. :\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"C7Studios","CreatedById":3895,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-13T05:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a lot of information on how to create parts on the wiki.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=Part_Modelling_Guidelines\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=Part_Modelling_Guidelines\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sdk is only really used to check that your part can be loaded into KSP. It gives you errors and allows you to check how your model will look in game. I\u0027d suggest starting with the wiki first and seeing if that can answer your questions. Otherwise, I can point you to some reference material on the specific skills you need to make a part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make a complete model you need two things, both of which you can get for free. A 3d editing program such as blender to make the models and an image editing software to make textures such as gimp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darrknox","CreatedById":2513,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-13T05:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Part modelling forum has extensive insights into the process from all modeling packages.
