You would either have to hit Bop exactly at one of the nodes with your current inclination or combine your plane change and transfer burn. Both options suck unless you can do precise calculations and there is no mod for it that I am aware of. Just make your plane change first and then go for intercept. You\u0027ll lose some dV but it\u0027s worth avoiding the hassle, especially since your orbit is so high.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfull","CreatedById":61722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T22:56:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter waiting a few orbits, I actually did find a low-dV way to intercept Bop close to one of the nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/3335218360666968018/4C88A65288DEC7F856679B33940B97722974E713/\u0022 alt=\u00224C88A65288DEC7F856679B33940B97722974E713\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it would cause me to arrive at Bop at a very odd angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/3335218360666921689/A9C9481805B127DBCC090B443731947723A2FB56/\u0022 alt=\u0022A9C9481805B127DBCC090B443731947723A2FB56\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering which option is more efficient in terms of dV:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting an intercept at the node with less than half the dV it would take to match Bop\u0027s plane, but having to make a somewhat larger burn to circularize around Bop (even more if I want to move to a more equatorial orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing the full plane change but arriving at a better angle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T23:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would I do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/ burn prograde at the inclination marker which is not the one closer to Bop\u0027s trajectory and move the other one (the closer one) to cross Bop\u0027s trajectory.
