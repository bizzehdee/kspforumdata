the low periapsis, now what do I do?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the why, the answer is \u0022because physics.\u0022\u00A0 Specifically, \u003Ca

engine, the more bang for your buck you get.\u00A0 Therefore, you really want to do all your burns at low altitudes, since that\u0027s when you\u0027re going fastest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the how:\u00A0 Use a maneuver node, like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nGet to LKO.\u00A0 Aim for a circular parking orbit that\u0027s as low as possible (under 90 km).\u00A0 The lower the better for conserving dV.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThen set up the map view so you\u0027re looking straight down at Kerbin\u0027s north pole.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRotate the map so that the Mun is just slightly above the 3 o\u0027clock position\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlace a maneuver node at the 6 o\u0027clock position and drag its prograde marker until your Ap rises up to the Mun\u0027s orbit.\u00A0 You should see a Mun intercept.\u00A0 (This will take around 850 m/s of dV for the node).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow grab the \u003Cem\u003Emaneuver node itself\u003C/em\u003E by the big white circle in the middle and gently drag it forward and back.\u00A0 Watch what happens to your munar periapsis when you do this-- it will go up and down.\u00A0 Slide the node around until you find the spot where your munar periapsis is the lowest possible.\u00A0 (It may be underground, i.e. the periapsis marker disappears, meaning \u0022impact the Mun\u0022).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrag the prograde/retrograde handles of the node until you\u0027ve adjusted the periapsis to something low-but-safe, like 10-15 km.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRepeat steps 5-6 as needed.\u00A0 You now have an optimal, cheapest burn to give you exactly the munar approach you want.\u00A0 It will likely be around 850 m/s of dV, plus or minus depending on how high your parking orbit is.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, now you just coast to the Mun.\u00A0 You will approach and get really close to the surface.\u00A0 Right when you\u0027re at munar periapsis, burn retrograde.\u00A0 You\u0027ll be going really fast when this happens, don\u0027t worry about it, it\u0027s a good thing.\u00A0 The amount you should burn retrograde is enough to circularize your orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongratulations, you\u0027re now in a very low circular orbit around the Mun.\u00A0 From here, landing is the best deal you\u0027re gonna get.\u00A0 Pick your spot, do a retrograde burn a ways westward from there to drop your orbit into the ground, then do a suicide burn to land.\u00A0 Ta dah!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022

land there without killing my Kerbil\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus is MUCH easier for first landing missions because of its gravity and wide flat areas. \u00A0In order to get there, however, you\u0027ve almost certainly\u00A0had to use the manoeuvre nodes to change your orbital inclincation to match planes with Minmus as well as just increase your Ap to get there. \u00A0Give yourself another pat on the back for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
