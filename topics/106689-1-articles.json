They have a base white coat which is used for all splaceplane parts, but there are about five different shades that are used for wing trims. SO..... rather then complaining about it, I\u0027m going to try and solve it.\n\nIf you know of any part textures (exempt from parts in GIF) that are in need or retexturing, complain here!\n\n![Uyo7EYB.gif](http://i.imgur.com/Uyo7EYB.gif)\n\nI will be releasing these edits in a mod. - more info on that later\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T22:47:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:18:44Z","Content":"Can you do the SLS (NASA) parts?
