While possible under the known laws of physics, the scientific community has no real evidence that any exist anywhere. Thus we can only speculate as to its properties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, almost certainly a wormhole should be movable through the universe like everything else, including a black hole. Unlike in video games (and bad sci-fi movies), the universe does not have any absolute coordinate system and thus no way for any entity to be \u0022anchored\u0022 immovably in space. In order to move it, all you need to do is move yourself the other way and then claim that you are the reference point. More practically, we don\u0027t have an obvious means of making a wormhole move, but once we start making them I presume we\u0027ll figure it out. Probably it\u0027ll involve a strong magnetic field or something of the like to hold it within a solid container or frame, which can then be carried aboard a spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand @ Bill: that all depends on your altitude.
