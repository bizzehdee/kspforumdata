I\u0027ve always believed that the late Neil Armstrong (R.I.P), Buzz Aldrin and the rest of the brave men went to the moon and back. My friend however has always firmly believed that they had in fact faked everything. This was a long time ago and there were claims left right and centre for and against the conspiracies. Has there been anything that has completely confirmed the moon landings? (or debunked?) I\u0027ve always believed that if the moon landings had been faked that the USSR would have made sure that any chance of faking would be exposed (That\u0027s what I\u0027d do anyway, and then laugh at them)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mustwinfull","CreatedById":41681,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-14T06:08:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, your friend doesn\u0027t have common sense because of the evidence everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat did the do with the astronauts that were clearly taking off if you were at the launch site, it would be a waste of money just to fake it and surely we would of already detected it if it wasn\u0027t fake, if you even brought them up there to the landing sites they would probably say \u0022Oh it was put there by a blah...\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERIP Neil.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientAstronaut","CreatedById":36093,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-14T06:11:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour friend is an idiot.
