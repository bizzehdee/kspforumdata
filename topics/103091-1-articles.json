I watched 5th horseman\u0027s video tutorial, but I\u0027m finding it increasingly difficult to figure out which way to turn to draw parallel. It\u0027s not helping that every time I do get some idea of which way to draw parallel, I input the 270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 direction from it, then the 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0....so I am making 4 direction changes to get pointed in the right direction.

Some people teach and learn differently and maybe someone else will be able to help you better.\n\nBut I suspect you just need time and effort, and patience. You are learning something that is not only new, but tantalizingly familiar at the same time. You need to not only learn new habits but break old ones. Keep at it.\n\nI wasn\u0027t lying when I said that docking and rendezvous were among the hardest things in the game to learn. The good news is that they get easy, once you DO learn them.\n\n*\\*My tutorials may or may not actually be fabulous*."},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T02:05:42Z","Content":"2 meters!

Just don\u0027t overcomplicate it too much. When you are this close, forget about complex orbital adjustments - just go with the navball.\n\nMake sure to be in a \u0022target\u0022 mode.\n\nTurn to the retrograde marker. Thrust with your main engines until velocity goes to 0.0 m/s or very close (if your engine is too powerfull, right click it and set the thrust limiter to something small, like 10 % - this makes your throttle slider go from 0 - 10 % of engine\u0027s max thrust).\n\nNow turn your nose to the target. Give it a small burn with the main engine (not more than ~0.5 m/s).\n\nWatch your ship slowly move to the target. If it hits, you\u0027re done. If it misses, just repeat the procedure (turn to retrograde, wait until you are close, burn to zero out relative velocity, etc).\n\nOh, and don\u0027t forget to arm your grabber, otherwise it won\u0027t grab anything ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nGood luck ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starchaser","CreatedById":139724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T10:01:29Z","Content":"I finally got the lander.

If you click where it says \u0022Orbit\u0022 it\u0027ll toggle between 2 modes, Orbit and Surface. If you have a target set (and you should) you\u0027ll have a 3rd mode, Target mode. Then you can aim at your retrograde marker and burn until your speed relative to that target is 0 m/s.
