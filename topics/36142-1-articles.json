Not very surprisingly, Eve was clearly the most difficult in all ways. It took heaviest boosters, nearly 2000 tons, and the largest number of ground and LKO tests and the longest play time. And it took also two kerbal\u0027s lives. I made it once with version 18.2. I tried exactly same construction again with version 19 or 20 and send also a rover (with separate launch). Astronaut drove nearly 100 km to ocean shore and back without significant problems, but something has changed in aerodynamics or controls and that ship could not ascend. Steering system was just pod\u0027s reaction wheels and it was inefficient for 60 ton\u0027s ship. After many tries (with purely hand control, SAS and Mechjeb) I build a new rescue ship with one LV-T45. It succeeded and the brave astronaut survived back to Kerbin. I think that it is my toughest achievement in game. I used only Mechjeb and ISA Mapsat mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
