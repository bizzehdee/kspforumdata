That\u0027s just something assumed by game\u0027s logic when it figures out thrust vectoring. The thrust vector itself should pass through the center of mass, or close to it. That will allow you to keep the craft stable.

If this is not the case you need to raise the CoM, lower the CoT (by moving those two jets further down), or disable thrust vectoring on those engines so at least they aren\u0027t making your control issues worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtip for the intakes: you don\u0027t need that many. If you\u0027re trying to fly high and fast you\u0027ll need ram air intakes (not the radials, they are worthless at altitude), and if you\u0027re okay with flying low and slow you can probably use just one radial intake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks pretty neat and I hope it works out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galahir950","CreatedById":72940,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T02:11:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is the ship file.
