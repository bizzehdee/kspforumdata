KSP really operates with just one LoD and one texture map, no normal, AO, curvature, materialID, nada? I was looking at Venn\u0027s work and was thinking it looks like he\u0027s just burned an AO/shadow map into the texture, I guess I was more or less right. If that\u0027s the case I\u0027ll need to something similar, but that\u0027s easy to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me clarify that on Venn\u0027s, he did a lot more than that, I have it installed and you\u0027ll have to pry it from my cold dead hard drive if you want me to uninstall it. However, one of the primary visual improvements is simply much more realistic ambient occlusion. When you are working with a game that doesn\u0027t support real AO and multiple maps per object, one trick is to create an AO or shadow map and blend it down into the texture so that part of the lighting is burned into the texture, pretty sure that was one of his steps from looking at them, at least I hope he didn\u0027t try to hand paint in all of those shadows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
