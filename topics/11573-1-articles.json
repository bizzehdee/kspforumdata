Unlike the moon, the red planet has both an atmosphere and a sizeable force of gravity, so getting back out of it\\\u0027s gravity well and to the earth would require a return stage much larger than what the Apollo missions required.\n\nThe most common trip itinerary produced involves assembly of a large spacecraft in low earth orbit, which would fly both the astronauts their return ship and fuel to Mars. All of this is based on future technologies, too. Additionally, because of how staging works (requiring ever larger lower stages to accelerate the added mass of fuel from higher stages), the cost and magnitude of the project go up exponentially if this method were followed. Additionally, it wouldn\\\u0027t be a sustainable method of transportation, which would probably result in a planetary \u0027hit it and quit it\u0027.\n\nZurbrin\\\u0027s suggestion, which I am completely in support of, involves using technology which is already available and low-weight, low cost methods of getting there and pack. An initial unmanned landing vehicle would arrive without any return fuel about a year before the manned launch, and during that waiting time it would synthesize new fuel through chemical processes powered by some small nuclear reactor it brings with it. Then, with the return capsule fully fuelled and ready, the astronauts blast off and reach the red planet, landing close to the return vehicle. They can then spend the time between then and their next launch window to conduct ground experiments, exploration and other scientific pursuits. When their launch window comes back, they ride their fully fuelled and stocked return vehicle back to the earth.\n\nIf you\\\u0027re simply looking at the orbital maneuvres however, I\\\u0027m afraid that a direct Hoffman transfer is really the only feasible solution that optimizes trip time for the crew and fuel required. Spiralling out using an ion engine of sorts is a possibility, but it also increases trip time and it\\\u0027s unproven technology, at least as far as manned missions are concerned. Ultimately that means that if we want to reach Mars in the near future it\\\u0027ll probably be on well proven chemical engines.\n\nEDIT: Exoscientist, I took a look at both articles you posted, it seems I haven\\\u0027t seen his up to date plans..."}]}
