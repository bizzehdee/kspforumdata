You have a basic, non-boosted version that delivers a given payload and then you expand it to increase payload or send it further. For example, to send the 2 ton (total) Mars Science Laboratory to Mars, only an Atlas V 541 (4meter shroud, 4 SRB) was required. Juno, sent to Jupiter weighed 4 tons at launch and only required 1 more SRB (the Atlas 551 configuration) to be launched to Jupiter.
