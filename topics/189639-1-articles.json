I am no economist or business expert, but I\u0027ve done my best to estimate a couple of ways this might work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003ELEO Tourism, How Might It Work?\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMusk recently said that Starship could cost as little as\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-flight-passenger-cost-elon-musk.html?utm_source=twitter\u0026amp;utm_medium=social\u0026amp;utm_campaign=dlvr.it\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E$2 million\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0per launch. Which for a 150 tonne payload capability means an incredible $13/kg price tag, about 1000 times cheaper than a Delta IV Heavy, which still boggles my mind, based on that, and a stated passenger capacity of 100, launch cost per person (and 1.5 t associated hardware/consumables) could be as low as $20,000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, it\u0027s worth noting that Starship won\u0027t just be a big crew capsule, it\u0027s essentially a recoverable space station, with a pressurised volume\u00A0of 1,000m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E,\u00A0each passenger could have 10m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0of space, which translates to a cubical\u00A0about 2.15m on each side. That sounds small, but in space the floor, wall, and ceiling can all be useful spaces, whereas on Earth it\u0027s mostly just the floor (or rather, what we put on the floor), so you can imagine it\u0027d be the equivalent useful surface area of a room 5.3m on each side, so I think it\u0027s reasonable to say that you could probably live in such a room fairly comfortably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with a 1.5 t mass allowance per passenger, how long could you reasonably spend in orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can assume about 100 kg\u00A0of that allowance will be made up by the passenger and whatever luggage they have brought, we can also assume that about 330 kg of that will be life support systems (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6cae/dec89af1dfe5ce7e48dddba03c6c590a1000.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe ISS life support system on the Zvezda module weighs 2.3 t\u003C/a\u003E, the ISS has a maximum capacity of 7 crew, therefore each crew has 330 kg of life support), and perhaps another 330kg of associated internal structures. All in all perhaps half\u00A0of the mass allowance per passenger will be dedicated to life support and comfort. Effectively leaving 75 t of payload that can then be used for consumables that can\u0027t be recycled, like food. Let\u0027s say each passenger uses up 3 kg of these consumables per day, that means you could support 100 passengers for about 250 days, or about 8 months, of course in reality you\u0027d want to have a good margin on that, so let\u0027s say you can keep them in space for 6 months, about the same as a trip to the ISS, so there\u0027s loads of relevant data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, assuming 10 of the passengers are actually employees of SpaceX, chefs, janitors, room service etc, and you pay them each, say, $20,000 on their 6 month stay, then your total cost is about $2.4 million. Say SpaceX operates at a profit margin of 100%, and each ticket for the other 90 passengers will cost about $53,000 dollars. At a rate of 20 launches a year, this amounts to a profit of around $48 million.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, this works under the assumption that people will want to spend 6 months in orbit in a small cabin, this seems unlikely if the destination is LEO. Rather I imagine passengers might want to spend perhaps a month in orbit in a much larger cabin, where microgravity activities and sports could provide an attractive source of entertainment, as well as sight seeing and perhaps even recreational EVAs. So instead let\u0027s say each launch consists of 25 passengers, perhaps 5 of them being members of staff (each payed perhaps $3,000 a month), in this scenario the total cost is $2.015 million, and ticket prices per passenger are (at a 100% profit margin) about $200,000 each, with each passenger having a much larger 40m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0of space, or a cubical\u00A03.4m long per side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow many people would pay to experience such a holiday is a hard question to answer. But it\u0027ll probably have to be people earning at least more than $1\u00A0million a year. In America, that represents some 235,000 people, of which perhaps 1% would be interested in such a holiday. So let\u0027s say theres a market of 2,000 people a year who would pay for such a holiday, meaning that SpaceX could launch around 100 passenger Starships a year at a profit of\u00A0$200 million. That market size may sound optimistic, but considering 600 people have already signed up for a few minutes of weightlessness on Virgin Galactic\u0027s SpaceShipTwo, for roughly the same price, I\u0027d say it\u0027s a reasonable guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDoes Starship Necessitate\u00A0Space Tourism?\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Starship, if/when it flies, will be so capable it\u0027ll instantly dominate the global launch demand. There were only 111 rocket launches in 2018, perhaps a cumulative payload of a few hundred tonnes, and a single Starship could satisfy this demand by launching a handful of times a year, at a cost 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the current competition.\u00A0Clearly, another source of launches must be found to make Starship economical. SpaceX themselves are\u00A0already creating\u00A0one possible source of launches with their\u00A0Starlink constellation, which may one day consist of up to 42,000 227 kg satellites, a\u00A0total mass of 9500t.\u00A0But even though that\u0027s\u00A0over double what\u0027s currently in orbit, is\u00A0still less than 70 Starship launches, even at SpaceX\u0027s current launch capability of 30 rockets a year, that only gives Starship a couple of years of work. It seems inevitable that SpaceX will have to branch off into services that, as of now, do not exist. Space tourism is one such service, and makes a good stepping stone for SpaceX to build up experience with human crew before committing to shipping massive colonies off to\u00A0Mars, which is ultimately what Starship is designed for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t help but think that other launch providers, such as ULA or\u00A0Blue Origin, will have to\u00A0really up their reusability game to stay in business in the next decade. My personal hunch is that Blue Origin is already on it, and their mysterious \u0022New Armstrong\u0022 vehicle is a fully reusable Starship analog. I\u0027m not sure about ULA though.

Though when the ISS is eventually decommissioned sometime in the mid 2020s there will be a need for a new interim orbital research lab for operation and recovery of microgravity experiments. Starship fills this role pretty well, it has more pressurised volume than the ISS, and likely a similar power capacity (most recent numbers I can find are 300 kW for the ITS, so perhaps half\u00A0that for the current iteration), one can imagine space agencies or even universities hiring out a Starship to do\u00A06 months of research with.

Assuming that this is the majority of vehicles costs, with\u00A0say\u00A0an added 10% cost\u00A0for the rest of the vehicle, each Starship could cost between $1.3 - $13 million. Meaning that you could theoretically build a space station of 1 million occupants for $5.4 - $54 billion. Why off Earth you would need such a station (pun intended, sorry not sorry), other than planetary invasion, I don\u0027t know, but it\u0027s an interesting idea nonetheless.

Until someone tries it of course we won\u0027t know, but I\u0027d wager that people wouldn\u0027t get sick of it so easily. What seems most likely to me is that some may spend short ~1 week sorties in Starships, and then up to ~1 month stays in bigger space hotels (possibly longer, you may be an employee there who stays on board for months at a time), with artificial gravity to prevent muscle atrophy and to aid in many gravity adjusted tasks. I doubt you\u0027ll stay in space beyond that as a tourist, only if you were a researcher, employee, or permanent resident (of which there would likely be few). If we\u0027re talking Lunar or Martian tourism the travel times involved make longer stays more attractive, kinda like how some people might spend a couple of years abroad for a change of scenery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-08T23:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think rotating places could have some real allure.

Heck, not even modern airline safety, it\u0027ll be a high bar for them to get to airline safety levels from the 1930s (or 20s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an economic benchmark, Shotwell has said that P2P would cost between economy and business class. That\u0027s likely ~$2000. SS has the internal volume of an A380, which means you could fit hundreds in SS---the flight is only \u0026lt;30 minutes after all. Say 500 people (low compared to A380 all economy). That\u0027s $4000/seat. LAX-SYD this Monday is ~$1000 RT economy (less, actually). ~$5000 business class, and 13k 1st class. I suppose that 4k is less than business class, but that\u0027s just break even for 500 per flight. Perhaps operations P2P would be under 2M$/flight? Maybe a single stage SS since it\u0027s suborbital? Price for that application must be lower or it doesn\u0027t close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a critical issue for the economics of tourism, because you need safety, and you need costs in the right ballpark. P2P competes with airline travel, so it must be cost competitive at least in the value for money regime. 28 minutes vs 10s of hours is huge value, and many people would spend that if it was safe. Perhaps the inner seats are value for money, and there are window seats for 1st class sorts of prices? Everyone doing P2P becomes a BO/Virgin style space tourist into the bargain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we assume spacecraft pricing for tourism to LEO\u002B, then it\u0027s 2M$/flight, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming that this becomes possible, then it\u0027s just a matter of building the infrastructure. Every single destination in space for humans is a 100% built environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/186973-ol%E2%80%99-musky-boi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022186973\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/186973-ol%E2%80%99-musky-boi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Ol\u2019 Musky Boi\u003C/a\u003E said, Starship itself is a spacecraft (crew version) that could be a short term hotel for early tourism. You\u0027d not want to be packed in, because bathroom space becomes a serious issue, and it apparently takes a while to use a space toilet. I\u0027d honestly think that for tourism, you\u0027d need cabins with a bathroom for at least each set of people sharing a room. The craft can\u0027t generate revenue (say P2P) while in space for a week, so even just exactly earning its keep might be worth 4M/day (1 RT flight someplace antipodal). So a week in space has to make more than 28M$ just to not waste the SS asset and break even. If you put 30 people aboard (no one want to be packed in for such a trip), you\u0027d have to charge at least a million bucks I\u0027d think. You could get takers, but it\u0027s a limited market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we were to pack people in, say the same 500\u002B as P2P, then the price drops per seat to a few thousand... but then you need a place to bring them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it was a flight to the Moon (say a tourist place there), then the SS will need to refill. You\u0027d send a tanker to the same orbit ahead of time to an elliptical orbit, 7 refills, then you send the passengers. So we have 9 launches to get the thing to the Moon with minimal delay (can drop one, then they sit in orbit far longer). now it\u0027s not 4k/seat, it\u0027s 36k/seat if 500 seats (too many for days flight) (lunar RT flight). At cost. So probably more like 250-300k would be entry level for a lunar trip (100 seats, not 500). Course the base has to be built, too. Maybe it\u0027s leveraged by State actors. Build a research base, then expand it for tourism to pay for continued operations?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-09T18:15:45Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2019 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-09T17:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223701915\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189639\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221573193400\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/8/2019 at 7:10 AM, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was talking marginal launch costs, including I think amortized vehicle costs since he said 900k$ was propellants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally I think that while space tourism is a good model if cheap enough to gain mass use, it has to be safe first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 months is not going to be a thing.
