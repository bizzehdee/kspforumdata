My game took over a minute to load when starting up because of how much stuff I\u0027d added so I decided to just delete KSP all together (persistance, settings, ships, everything) and reinstall it and start over using only the mods that I will miss which will be closer to 5 or 6 than the 19 I had installed. Also I\u0027ll go through the parts folder and delete parts I\u0027ll never use like alot of the parts from novapunch.
