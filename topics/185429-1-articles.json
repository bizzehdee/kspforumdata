everyone understand exactly what I\u0027m doing here.\u00A0 Nonetheless I\u0027ll try to explain it:\u00A0 I\u0027m making an add-on for Life-Support mods:\u00A0 This means that mods like, say, Kerbalism will work with my add-on, but without it\u00A0my add-on will not work and maybe break your game.\u00A0 Kerbalism as a base has food and drinks and storage for them.\u00A0 My add-on may add\u00A0new ways of storing food, and creating it.\u00A0 DeepFreeze is a mod that adds cryo-pods.\u00A0 My add-on would possibly add it\u0027s own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe goal of this add-on is simple:\u00A0 Create a visually appealing add-on\u00A0for life support mods that work ONLY with those mods enabled.\u00A0 This add-on may make it easier for you to deliver food to your Kerbals, or give them alternatives to growing food in orbit.\u00A0 It might allow them to enter cryosleep or make it so the year long trip isn\u0027t so stressful on them.\u00A0 They may be protected from radiation better, or other elements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you take into account that I had a paying job as a 3D artist about a year ago, it\u0027s not too far fetched to say this is entirely feasible.\u00A0 I have never done code, and I have never made any items for KSP.\u00A0 The reason for this add-on isn\u0027t only to improve the variety of items and tools you may have at hand while using the mods required of it, it\u0027s also to act as a stepping stone for myself.\u00A0 If I learn from this experience, it\u0027s entirely possible I can create well thought out and designed mods for the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this answers your question.\u00A0 If you have any other concerns, let me hear
