It also started off having no name, just being called HALVE (High Altitude Longitude stable Vehicular Energy). On the low altitude tests which did not include landing, the aircraft was very sensitive in the roll and pitch axis. These were taken down in the high altitude tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first test went well, with a perfect landing, the second and third went from high altitude into orbital. The second test orbited the earth while the third orbited the sun. Needless to say, Icarus was retired the next day, without a crash to its record.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft was based off the Jefferson Starship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/VoTUOnelxnY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/VoTUOnelxnY\u003C/a\u003E (Sorry about the music).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow working on Daedalus, and the Twin Daedalus.
