More science (funds) and faster drilling could be worthwhile.\n\nI will grant pilots don\u0027t offer many unique benefits,. Maybe levels 4 and 5 should give them commander bonuses that improve other crew members performance. Anything a pilot can do, a probe core should be able to do as well, so the pilot needs to be more than a pilot to have a niche. Either that or an ability to selectively unlock the safties on equipment. Nukes get higher ISP (via increased thrust), but generate much more heat (to the point you need radiators to use them). Reaction wheels produce more torque, but sudden control jerks can break them like rover wheels.
