I\u0027m still having trouble with 0.90. I have MechJeb2 installed, that\u0027s the only mod I have installed. I was playing for a while this afternoon, managed to get a large piece of space station in orbit, went to land, landed my rocket on a nice four-point landing but then it wouldn\u0027t let me reclaim the ship. I backed out to the playing field, my memory is gone today can\u0027t remember the right names for the parts of the game, either way it stopped accepting mouse input. I clicked on the tracking station a hundred times and nothing happened. I hit escape to quit and couldn\u0027t go to the main screen. None of the buttons worked. So I had to alt-f4 the thing and ever since then, the same issue has persisted. I can get into the game just fine but can\u0027t get back out without alt-f4\u0027ing it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Anyone else have this issue, anyone ever heard or seen this issue?
