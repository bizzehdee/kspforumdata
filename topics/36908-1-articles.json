It seems I deleted the RCS blocks long ago. There are two parts stacked together: One a B9 aerospace reaction wheel. Then there\u0027s a Fustek Munox RCS ring clipped around it. If clipping wasn\u0027t so lenient it wouldn\u0027t really work but I\u0027m guessing it just doesn\u0027t like having two parts on the same attachment node. I thought it would be an easy fix when I recognized the \u0022missing part\u0022 dialogue as \u0022shuttle.rcs block\u0022 as an rcs port but its a little bit harder. \u0026gt;_\u0026lt; my question still stands though. id love to know how to remove a non structurally crucial part from save file correctly. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T14:13:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the element is stacked, you\u0027re gonna have a hard time.
