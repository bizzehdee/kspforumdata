I have encountered this yesterday twice. \n\nIt happened when I was trying to warp to my periapsis which was just above the Kerbin atmosphere but my Apoapsis was still verry high (close to the edge of Kebal SOI). \n\nNow I asume the cause for this might be the very high speed of my craft when nearing the \u0022warp here\u0022 point (near Periapsis) so the game didn\u0027t manage to slow down the time warp in time. In my case first time the time wapr stayed at 100 and second time it stayed at 10.\n\nWorakound for this was placing the \u0022warp here\u0022 sooner on the orbit where the craft didn\u0027t have so much speed.\n\nI\u0027ll try to do some more testing on this today to see if my teory is corect or not.
