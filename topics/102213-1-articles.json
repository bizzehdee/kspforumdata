I\u0027ve been sending probes and Jeb on solo missions (Jeb don\u0027t do ride share!). Now want to train a new three kerbal crew for missions.\n\nIf I sent the crew kerbals to orbit, then to Mun (all 3 plant flags) and on to Minmus (all 3 plant flags) and return to Kerbal, will they get exp for all three tasks, or only one. Also, is exp divided by three (number of crew), or do all 3 get full points?\n\nI love my atomic rocket landers, \u003E10 kps delta V on the space center pad and soft land entire lander, atomic motors, all science packs etc on Kerbal.\n\nI wish there was a RockoMax sized atomic motor, 2-3 ganged are needed for decent acceleration with 3 kerbal crewed \u0022Kondor\u0022. Test last night with 2 motor version had a bit over 15 minutes burn time with on-board fuel only (about 5 kps delta V). Adding drop tanks, I\u0027ll need 30 minutes of burning to get thru all my fuel.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T20:57:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 08:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rematog**"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T18:25:14Z","Content":"All crew that reaches a particular location get their own full share of experience. So you don\u0027t need to do separate flights for each, if you have the crew capacity.\n\nAs far as Nukes goes - don\u0027t get too attached to them in the atmosphere, as they are probably going to lose a LOT of thrust, while in atmosphere in v1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T18:34:03Z","Content":"The best way to do as I\u0027ve seen is to skip the Mun landing. Just orbit, and instead add an extra step of leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI briefly, which saves dV.\n\nSo you should have:\n\n- Orbit Kerbin\n\n- Orbit Mun\n\n- Plant flag on Minmus\n\n- Orbit Kerbol (sun)\n\nThis gives you just enough xp to hit level 3.\n\nAlso, each Kerbal gains xp by themselves. It doesn\u0027t matter if I send 1 Kerbal or 100 on this mission: they all get the same XP.\n\nAlso, XP is calculated by the most difficult task done per body. So, flag planting trumps landing, which trumps orbiting, which trumps a fly-by. So if your Kerbal already planted a flag on the Mun, orbiting it again will have no effect.\n\nLastly, for non-interplanetary (as in you\u0027re not going to Duna, Eve, etc.) you don\u0027t really *need* LV-Ns. In fact, you might be better off with lighter, but less efficient engines (LV-909s, for example). The LV-Ns are insanely efficient, yes, but they\u0027re also super heavy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T18:36:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 06:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rematog","CreatedById":134130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T20:55:44Z","Content":"Great, thanks for the mission plan, much appreciated. \n\nI\u0027m currently finalizing my 3 seat Atomic powered belly lander \u0022Kondor\u0022, so need the test flight anyways. I\u0027m planning on it and it\u0027s single seat predecessor \u0022Eagle\u0022 to explore all the small bodies in the system, i.e. with gravity of 30% Kerbin or less. Jeb just got back from a fast trip to Gilly. Wasn\u0027t in launch window, used 4.9 kps burn to fast track home. I love aero-braking... Jebs coming in hot.\n\nMy mental \u0022back story\u0022 for Kerbal Kind is that Kerbin has a mantel with more uranium and thorium than earth . So Ker-life is much more resistant to radiation exposure. They are green and can get a little \u0022life support\u0022 by photosynthesis. Most important, Kerbals have a natural ability to hibernate, so that while I\u0027m X1,000,000 thru a long trip, Jeb is hibernating so that his time perception of the voyage is only a bit more than my game playing time.

Other bodies yes, flag for a better xp yield than landing, but those 2 closest bodies dont need this extra step, the Kerbal gets max xp when he lands, which saves some EVA/flag spam.\n\nMy preferred route for training (since some folks mentioned theirs) is orbit Kerbin, flyby Mun, land Minmus, return. This only lifts crew to 2 star rather than 3 but is easy to swing with \u0027bus\u0027 designs that carry large crew numbers and is a pretty simple mission to plot. My favorite vessels for this run 10 Kerbals to 2 star at a time for very little mass."}]}
