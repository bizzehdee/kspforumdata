I try putting moving the center of lift closer or further from the center of mass, but can\u0027t find any spot that works (either the plane doesn\u0027t take off, or it spins upward).

I\u0027d advise a set of canards and pull the wings aft. You also have WAY too much yaw authority with that tail. With a bird that small, a fixed vertical stabilizer is good, since the command pod torque can give you your yaw control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T02:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, no pitch control. A plane needs either elevators or elevons, since your plane is not a delta wing, elevators it is. Elevators should be as far from the center of mass as possible for optimum pitch control, while ailerons should be in line with the center of mass and far out on the wing tip for optimal roll control. Finally, either use smaller wings (or even winglets) or make your plane a little longer. You have too much lifting force there for such a small plane and it will make it heavy. Make sure you also right click each control surface (including winglets and tail) and set their desired function. Most times it will work anyway, but sometimes it does weird stuff. Elevator = pitch, Ailerons = Roll, Tail = Yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have Ven\u0027s installed but you should be able to get the basic idea from this (the control surfaces on the inside wing are flaps, not ailerons):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/434950296027849513/88C01822D0FE2A875CA9EBCAE0475314CDAFAA25/\u0022 alt=\u002288C01822D0FE2A875CA9EBCAE0475314CDAFAA25\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T02:46:05Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thestuff","CreatedById":150686,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T04:15:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt flies!
