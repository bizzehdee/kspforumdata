You do this by jettisoning your lifter stage BEFORE you circularise for orbit. This means you need to use your return craft for the final circularisation burn. You can then deploy your satellite, do a retro-burn on your return craft and then the only thing left in orbit is your satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake your current design and reduce the fuel load until your lifter stage runs out of fuel just before the top of the orbit (the AP marker on the map).
