Now, this is an easy fix.\n\nYou need another decoupler on top of the current one. In the staging menu, put the bottom decoupler in a stage below the top one. Now, when you decouple, you\\\u0027ll first disconnect from the rocket, and then the other decoupler will fall away."},{"CreatedByName":"RealDarko","CreatedById":22682,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-03T05:52:55Z","Content":"I will explain a bit more my problem. I buil a rocket.\n\n- propulsion stage that put me in orbit\n\n- decoupler\n\n- satelite\n\n- decoupler\n\n- small propulsion part and command pod so I can go back.\n\nSo I reach orbit, prop stage out, that stage will be forever on that orbit, the same one of the satellite, and I want that used stageto go back to Kerbal so it doesnt stay orbiting at the same height of the satellite. Is possible?"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-03T05:56:48Z","Content":"You need to change your craft design so that your lifter stage falls back to Kerbin and crashes. You do this by jettisoning your lifter stage BEFORE you circularise for orbit. This means you need to use your return craft for the final circularisation burn. You can then deploy your satellite, do a retro-burn on your return craft and then the only thing left in orbit is your satellite.\n\nTake your current design and reduce the fuel load until your lifter stage runs out of fuel just before the top of the orbit (the AP marker on the map). This means you\\\u0027ll have to jettison the lifter and it will fall back to Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T15:51:13Z","Content":"To release satellite to orbit without creating any space debris you need to build a space tug.
