SubAssemblies. Nothing is more frustrating than making a sub-assembly for use later, only to discover that the sub has only *one* attachment point - inevitably in a useless place. This is because the sim seems to allocate only one attachment point for a sub, and this is always the last point in the direction of the initial build item (a pod). The fix for this is to make sub-assemblies with robotic units, and during the build move the rest of the assembly around and attach it to the robotic core item, and then save each sub-assembly based on it\u0027s specific attachment point. This all seems a bit too much work just to have a sub-assembly that can be attached as though it were a collection of parts put together normally.
