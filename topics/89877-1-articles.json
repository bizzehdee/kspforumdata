Now I have 0.25 I loaded save, made craft to dock another side of ,,my,, station, but at first dock, they got magnet effect, but were not connected. My ship had docking port on both sides so I tried the other one and its doing nothing at all, both ports are Clamp-O-Tron Docking port. I cant for god made it docked. I tried to turn off SAS while i was in dock, both ,,ships,, has electricity and fuel. I dont really know where is the problem. Please if somebody can give me some advice.
