So installed it by copying the zip file contents into GameData folder next to Chatterer which is the only other mod i have. Chatterer works fine. It seems that asteroid day mod is not recognized / loaded. I even started a new sandbox game but can\u0027t find the infrared camera for the mod anywhere in the parts stuff in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E nor in any box in the research facitily in a career game. It seems that the mod is not recognized / added when loading. Did i miss something, do i need to configure something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T18:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuys, you are such bloody amateurs! Do you ever test your stuff??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter renaming the mod-folder inside GameData folder from \u0027Asteroid Day for Kerbal Space Program 1.2\u0027 to \u0027AsteroidDay\u0027 it worked. Note: there is NO BLANK in the mod folder name now. Before \u0027AsteroidDay\u0027 i also tried \u0027Asteroid Day\u0027 with Blank between Asteroid and Day and it also didn\u0027t work. Blanks in mod-folder names obviously aren\u0027t working. That should be changed in KSP so that it can work with blanks in mod folder names. And until this is changed in KSP the folder name in the zip file should be changed to \u0027AsteroidDay\u0027 or something without blank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also explains why Chatterer (no blank) worked well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-30T18:07:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2016 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DocMoriarty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
