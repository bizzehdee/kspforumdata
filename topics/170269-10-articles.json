The movie indicates that the trip from Earth to Pandora takes 6 years. To keep the acceleration of the craft within tolerable limit, we assume it requires 6 months to accelerate, and 6 months to decelerate in order to maintain a manageable acceleration of 1.5G (1.5 times acceleration due to Earth\u0027s gravity), and the cruising speed would be approximately 80% speed of light. Mass increases as velocity approaches speed of light, a 1 kg mass would become 1.6 kg at 80% speed of light. This means a significant increase in energy requirement to travel to Pandora. At 6 years travel time, the significant increase in energy becomes unavoidable. Normal chemical propellant won\u0027t do the job. According to the film material, the spacecraft uses antimatter/ fusion reactor hybrid for propulsion. Antimatter has already present today, albeit in very small amount, and we already created a fusion reaction in hydrogen bomb. However, antimatter is very difficult to make, has short shelf life and incredibly expensive with a price tag of $60 billion/ microgram, not to mention the difficulty in storing it. With the depiction of spaceship in the movie around a mile long, the required antimatter would be on the order of thousands of tons. Even if antimatter becomes cheap enough to beat the cost of fossil fuel by the factor of 1000, it still cost millions of dollars to transport a single kilogram of stuff into Pandora.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E4. What\u0027s the reason humans go to Pandora? To mining Unobtainium! The same term (but not the same stuff) used in The Core! The film material stated that Unobtainium is a room-temperature superconductor, and it sells for $20 million per kilogram. Sounds profitable, but the economic principle teached us that high price means tiny market, making the profitability of mining it seems rather iffy. If it was indeed a lucrative bussiness, then sooner or later, someone would figure out how to synthesize it, because come on, a culture that can go to moon on the another planet on another star system surely could figure out how to sythesize it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E5. As explained above, the energy requirements of transporting stuff from Earth to Pandora is immense, and the cost is very expensive. Shipping heavy equipment, such as mining excavator, trucks, aircraft, ect. directly from earth is not cost effective. A single truck could cost billions to send to Pandora, so they had to be manufactured on site, and they need to build a lot of infrastructures. Weapons and ammunition must be locally produced, otherwise, the quote of \u003Cem\u003E\u0022...It costs four hundred thousand dollars to fire this weapon for twelve seconds.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E becomes literal. Also, why sending workers from earth? It would be cheaper to just send some colonist there, grow population and treat pandora as their home instead of having to spend money for regularly transporting workers to and from Pandora.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E6. It\u0027s hard to believe that human militia seems awfully under-equipped compared by today\u0027s conventional military. No drones, no automated robots, no super-abnormal ammo like incendiary or guided bullets.

What\u0027s the point of linking a human into a body of Navi? The movie claimed they created that to learn/ observe/ communicate with Navi in order to gain information or negotiate. Why would you communicate with them if you gonna get rid of them entirely anyway? Using drones to spy on them is much more cheaper and cost-effective than creating a Navi body and controlling it wirelessly from afar.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E9. Although they were visually stunning the floating mountains were arguably the most ridiculous features in the entire movie. They were gigantic chunks of real-estate floating in the sky apparently suspended\u00A0 by some form of magnetic field. We surmised this from the fact that electronic instruments on all aircraft in the vicinity are driven crazy by the area\u0027s \u0022high flux level\u0022, presumably a high magnetic flux level. Magnetic fields are also about the only available explanation. Other possibilities such as buoyancy, wind, and electrostatic forces are even more easily ruled out. Unfortunately, the magnetic field strength needed to levitate mountains would have numerous disastrous side effects on the movie\u0027s story line, that is if the movie stuck to real physics. First such a field would rip magnetic materials out of aircraft if they flew into it, but that\u0027s just the beginning. Even if the aircraft had no magnetic materials in them, moving a conductive material of any type--magnetic or otherwise--through the field would create a large voltage difference across it. All electronic systems or controls, not just the navigation systems would be seriously disrupted. It\u0027s doubtful that an aircraft could fly in such conditions.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E Since both the human brain and heart are conductive, both would have voltage differences generated across them by the motion of riding in an aircraft. Any variation in direction or magnitude of the magnetic field, even subtle changes from vibrations or body movements would induce random currents in the brain with an endless list of possible results including memory loss, hallucinations, psychotic events, and seizures. Randomly induced currents in the heart could result in fibrillation and death.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E10. The movie claims that Pandora\u0027s gravity is slightly lower than Earth, which helps justify the tall figure of the Navi, and their ability to jump higher. But apparently, that reduced gravity doesn\u0027t apply to humans since we don\u0027t see them gaining any increased mobility.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n11. For some reason, while preparing to blow up the tree of life, Humans also to decides mount a land assault. The Navi meet the ground force head-on with a cavalry charge, a well known form of suicide since at least 1914. And guess what? They get butchered. Meanwhile other blue guys mounted atop flying critters swoop down on the aircraft from above. Aircraft designed for ground assaults could indeed be vulnerable from above. These aircraft used high speed counter-rotating propellers contained in large circular shaped pods. Shooting one of the Navi\u0027s spear-like arrows or dropping big rocks into the rotor blades should have been more than enough to severely damaged them and disabled the aircraft, they don\u0027t have to jump on the aircraft and throw grenades into the propellers. In addition to performing such attacks from the flying critters, in at least some places, the Navi could have hidden archers atop the floating mountains and rained arrows down on the aircraft attempting to pass between them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAvatar is a sci-fi movie that while it\u0027s beautiful and has little to no technobabble about the technology, still bears the implausibility and impracticality in terms of technology, practical appliation and physics if viewed thoroughly and carefully examining every detail it provides from dialogue and background materials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-06T01:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223286310\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170269\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517855507\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace operas never get old.

Although they were visually stunning the floating mountains were arguably the most ridiculous features in the entire movie. They were gigantic chunks of real-estate floating in the sky apparently suspended\u00A0 by some form of magnetic field. We surmised this from the fact that electronic instruments on all aircraft in the vicinity are driven crazy by the area\u0027s \u0022high flux level\u0022, presumably a high magnetic flux level. Magnetic fields are also about the only available explanation. Other possibilities such as buoyancy, wind, and electrostatic forces are even more easily ruled out. Unfortunately, the magnetic field strength needed to levitate mountains would have numerous disastrous side effects on the movie\u0027s story line, that is if the movie stuck to real physics. First such a field would rip magnetic materials out of aircraft if they flew into it, but that\u0027s just the beginning. Even if the aircraft had no magnetic materials in them, moving a conductive material of any type--magnetic or otherwise--through the field would create a large voltage difference across it. All electronic systems or controls, not just the navigation systems would be seriously disrupted.
