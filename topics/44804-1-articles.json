Keeping the last two Mainsails around for another tankfull achieved much more altitude. I\u0027m thinking of moving the pipes over to the first pair of Mainsails to keep all the big engines around longer than the first two drop. Experiments showed me that Skippers are more efficient in the upper atmo, thus the final push configuration has three plus the two small ones still hanging on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother item of import with this vehicle is to lock the gimbal on the center Skipper before launch. It makes the wobble go away. Won\u0027t make it to orbit otherwise because of extra fuel burn by MechJeb bouncing the throttle. I dunno how just that one engine makes the launch wibble so badly, or why locking just it fixes it, when the other two Skippers and the four Mainsails are left unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can download the craft files for Alan Aerospace Recycling \u0026amp; Packaging\u0027s ongoing Mun attempt \u003Ca href=\u0022http://partsbyemc.com/pub/AARP-Mun-collection.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E or get them with everything else I\u0027ve done (that I\u0027ve kept) in KSP \u003Ca href=\u0022http://partsbyemc.com/pub/AARP-Kerbal-Space-rockets.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eover here\u003C/a\u003E I build something, modify until it does what I set out to do, then rename for a major change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-12T19:48:50Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2013 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Galane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T08:19:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Galane\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Galane\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow I got it (nearly) to orbit. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/photos/27748767@N08/9657123873/in/set-72157635319720861\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.flickr.com/photos/27748767@N08/9657123873/in/set-72157635319720861\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get to 70KM it requires an in-flight fuel transfer to be able to finish the circularization burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shouldn\u0027t need to refuel or transfer fuel between tanks during \u003Cstrong\u003Elifting\u003C/strong\u003E when using a decent lifter.

The big drawback of this rocket is the part count is about 1500- with no payload. The game crashes a lot when I use it, mainly because for some insane reason, the devs of KSP went with a 32 bit executable and the game runs out of memory all the time, but its the only way for me to get my biggest designs into orbit. I don\u0027t have any screenshots here, but I can post them later when I get home. Anyway, there were four concepts I utilized in both these designs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Very high thrusts by using A LOT of 1.25m engines. I find that get higher thrusts under a stage if I pack a bunch of 1.25m engines instead of using full size 2.5m or 3.75m parts. Unfortunately, this leads to a high part count (and part clipping needs to be enabled usually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-High efficiency by using 1.25m engines. The ISPs for a cluster of 1.25m (and smaller 2.5m engines) is MUCH better than a single, big engine. It is MUCH easier to get to orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Lateral staging instead of stacked staging- KSP rockets are too structurally weak to support huge, long rockets. So both my big lifter designs utilize a central 3.75m section surrounded by six 3.75m sections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Engine nacelles- the bottom of my 3.75m stalks have engine nacelles to hold additional fuel and provide a place to put more engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I would have used bigger fuel tanks (Novapunch has 5 m diameter tanks, but they are only 12m long), but I have A LOT of problems with Novapunch fuel tanks (and to a lesser extent, engines)- sometimes they just randomly fall off, do not stay attached well, etc. Still, despite these problems, Novapunch is useful for other parts that they add (just, IMO, stay away from the fuel tanks!). Anyway, the KW rocket 3.75 meter fuel tanks look better and are structurally sound.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"superm18","CreatedById":57755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T18:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is my Grand Tour Tug:\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AV4CQmD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AV4CQmD.jpg\u0022\u003E351 t to orbit 150 km x 150 km (2348 t on the pad)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T20:01:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EY\u0027all are making my little dual Rockomax 64 lifter look real puny. ;-) I need a better PC.
