My rationale for this wouldn\u0027t be to grub for views or money, but to offer another point of view or way of doing things. It seems like a lot of new players come to the forums looking for help or advice, and the standard response is \u0022Look up Scott Manley on YouTube.\u0022 While I think Scott is a great resource, I know that when I first started playing the game years ago and I was told to go look at his videos, sometimes they just didn\u0027t click for me. For certain concepts, I had to search around YouTube looking for other players and see their suggestions and advice before finding one that did click. So, having more points of view can be helpful, even if its already been done to death. I guarantee, my start to stock career is very different from the usual, and seeing that might be beneficial to other players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for feedback on the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E video: get a better mic. Sound quality was definitely an issue for me. The content of your video was solid, though a bit \u0022sloppy\u0022 for my tastes; ie: launching your first vehicle with the parachute deployed in the same stage as the booster, and just ignoring it because \u0022it shouldn\u0027t really matter; normally it should be alright.\u0022 I cringed at that. Failure to check your staging before launch is a critical oversight that leads to the unplanned disassembly of many spacecraft, and sets a bad precedent for the noobs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck with the video series!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geek0saurus","CreatedById":179538,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-07T12:06:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, thank you very much for your feedback.

The first episodes are kind of the backstory of everything. The \u0022solution\u0022 i\u0027m trying to use at the moment is only mensioning (Ep.X) at the end of the video title and to start with the content of the video, so that the backstory (the series) becomes less important that the missions themselves. For the first 6 episodes it\u0027s more backstory and after that I think i\u0027ll try going with titles like \u0022KSP:\u00A0Mun\u00A0Space\u00A0Station build\u00A0in 3 launches\u00A0| KSP Stock 1.3 | Career mode playthrough (Ep.8)\u0022 or something similar.

In my stock career games, I\u0027m orbiting the Mun on my 3rd launch, and doing manned Mun landings by my 5th launch. And I\u0027m also just taking the basic contracts and not wasting a lot of time part testing or doing tourist runs or biome hopping to grind science.
