I have models for Space Station 5, Disovery, Discovery Pod, Moon shuttle, Orion \u0022plane\u0022 and some interior parts or the space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing around with adding some of the parts to the game as a test. Unfortunately I haven\u0027t decided exactly how I want to do this yet as in order to keep them in scale they have to be HUGE. For instance, to even get the station to load in the game I had to scale it to 0.1% and it is still larger than the entire KSC launch complex. Something like this would obviously have to be hyperedited to orbit. I\u0027m thinking maybe I might make a series of \u0022docking ports\u0022 inside the station shuttle bays for the other crafts to dock to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now this is just an idea I\u0027m playing around with and I don\u0027t know how far it will actually go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a quick mockup of Space Station V in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HIaPQ0P.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HIaPQ0P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-11T03:24:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2014 03:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by raidernick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T02:51:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy couldn\u0027t you put it in a lower orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T02:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was causing orbit errors where it\u0027s velocity would get stuck at 0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T02:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022raidernick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022raidernick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt was causing orbit errors where it\u0027s velocity would get stuck at 0.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a major problem.
