As far as I can tell, this can be replicated every flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn most cases the revert to SPH/VAB button does nothing when clicked, but reverting to launch results in the above issue (the \u0027space center\u0027 button also does nothing, and opening the settings menu produces rendering problems). This bug does not always occur, and is much more difficult to replicate (I think it only happens when reverting from the death menu, rather than the pause menu). When reverting to SPH/VAB, operations initially appear normal, but clicking launch again causes a partial crash. All sounds operate normally, but all navigational (top row) buttons become greyed out, and some graphical updates stop - parts cannot be moved or added in the place menu, but rotations and translations still work (as do all decorative animations). The game never exits the SPH/VAB (nor does it accept any other input), and must be killed. The log ceases to be updated as soon as launch is clicked and the anomaly begins.
