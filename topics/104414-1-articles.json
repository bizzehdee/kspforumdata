Destroy craft through impact with ground. Revert to launch/SPH/VAB. Launch again \n\nGame stops accepting input after reverting *after a craft has been destroyed*. I don\u0027t think it occurs when the craft hasn\u0027t been destroyed, but it could be a function of some other variable such as duration.\n\nWhen reverting to launch the camera suddenly leaves the surface at ~20km/s, stops responding to any input, and the log is filled with an absolute avalanche of NullReferenceExceptions (log: [http://pastebin.com/xfQSwrjz](http://pastebin.com/xfQSwrjz) - I\u0027ve removed most of the repeated exceptions, they continue to generate (several megabytes in a few seconds) until I kill the process, and CPU usage exceeds 135% (RAM usage does not exceed 30%)). As far as I can tell, this can be replicated every flight.\n\nIn most cases the revert to SPH/VAB button does nothing when clicked, but reverting to launch results in the above issue (the \u0027space center\u0027 button also does nothing, and opening the settings menu produces rendering problems). This bug does not always occur, and is much more difficult to replicate (I think it only happens when reverting from the death menu, rather than the pause menu). When reverting to SPH/VAB, operations initially appear normal, but clicking launch again causes a partial crash. All sounds operate normally, but all navigational (top row) buttons become greyed out, and some graphical updates stop - parts cannot be moved or added in the place menu, but rotations and translations still work (as do all decorative animations). The game never exits the SPH/VAB (nor does it accept any other input), and must be killed. The log ceases to be updated as soon as launch is clicked and the anomaly begins. Log - [http://pastebin.com/6knvkTt9](http://pastebin.com/6knvkTt9)\n\nOther notes:\n\nLoading flights (though not the initial game load) takes longer them I expect, by instinct and compared to KSP running under Windows 8.1 on the same machine.\n\nA common graphical glitch is all engines producing the full thrust animation when not firing, both in flight and in the SPH/VAB, and both in the expected direction and 90 degrees to the side. When this occurs, the staging GUI disappears and all parts can only be activated by right clicking. All engine sound is also missing.\n\nLog files and screenshots:\n\nRevert to launch KSP.log - [http://pastebin.com/xfQSwrjz](http://pastebin.com/xfQSwrjz)\n\nRevert to SPH/VAB KSP.log - [http://pastebin.com/6knvkTt9](http://pastebin.com/6knvkTt9)\n\nGraphical error produced by opening the settings menu (and then closing it) as described - [http://postimg.org/image/wb0kb65mj/](http://postimg.org/image/wb0kb65mj/) (why this image host you\u0027ve never heard of? because nothing else works.)\n\nTL;DR - KSP, along with Ubuntu, is an absolute mess on my machine.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T00:25:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 12:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Draekris**"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T23:39:48Z","Content":"I noticed this bug happened to me once, I couldn\u0027t revert or reload or anything and my craft was destroyed.\n\nApparently the game won\u0027t load ANY save file, even Shift\u002BF9.\n\nI had to close and restart the game.

In any case, reverting to version .25 appears to solve the problem with reverting, but I now experience random crashes (I can find no correlation with any event, though obviously there is one) which require the process be killed from the terminal.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T00:56:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 12:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Draekris**"},{"CreatedByName":"Draekris","CreatedById":103172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T23:27:02Z","Content":"I\u0027ve got another error, which, again, occurs when reverting to the SPH/VAB.
