The wheels spinning won\u0027t help. But when you perform your gravity turn at 10km how far over are you pitching? If its too much too soon yea it\u0027ll fall right back down. With a craft that large.. delay your gravity turn until about 250m/s then SLOWLY start pitching over. You say the craft tumbles over after the first stage. Is this before ( ideal ) during ( not ideal lol ) or after the pitch? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther then that.. idk. Honestly I\u0027m sorry to say, but that rocket looks like a nightmare. The problem could be a little bit of what everyone said. Something like that is very hard to diagnose. You may be better off starting back at the drawling board. Look at your payload by itself ( the crane ) is the mass on center? Switch off gravity in the debug menu ( alt - f12 ) and see if there\u0027s any phantom torque. Make sure the payload is tested so you can rule that out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen build and test the rocket a section at a time. Sub orbital tests to orbital tests and so on. Also it might not hurt to take a look in the space craft exchange. Look at some heavy lift, asparagus launchers. Just to get some ideas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I just noticed...
