I have a few special things that I\u0027ll do too during the mission that aren\u0027t part of the original mission parameters, just for fun stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the first part of my Jool V mission. I finally launched out to Jool and did an epic landing on Laythe, barely balancing out at the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond video is the rescue of Jeb at Laythe.
