recently got into them mostly because i wanted to try something new (never really tried kraken drives seriously before) and frankly got fed up with the limitations of stock with regards to making sci-fi themed stuff.\u00A0 I still enjoy the challenge of fuel limits, but many things do become fairly mundane in KSP especially after doing them multiple times, and thats why for quite some time now ive used teleport to destination to transport craft under the condition that ive at least proven once or twice that i can get x ship to x location 100% legit, and that there is some sort of IRSU/fuel tanker where i want to teleport the ships to.\u00A0 I personally think using kraken drives in these situations is no less of a \u0022cheat\u0022 then simply teleporting them there which is purely cutting down on the time i need to spend doing multiple refuels using IRSU (stock IRSU in its own way is sorta a \u0022cheat\u0022 as IRL there is no such thing as infinite resources (kethane back in the day is a great example of a realistic IRSU concept, it actually limited how much you could get fron a hex shaped grid area on each planet).\u00A0 I also have started messing with them on craft that arent built according to stock aerodynamics (and using ANY of the stock engines would never go beyond 2km), and there are so many concept craft i have sitting around that are simply never gonna work under stock aero.\u00A0 While i do like the 1.0\u002B aero, it does seriously limit the asthetics of viable craft, and sometimes i want to just build something that flies in KSP that would never work IRL for obvious reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fRRkSwi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022
