I actually recently found this happening on my landers also. Some just seemed to want to sink into the ground more than others. If you send a Kerbal on EVA, you will see that it will say the strut is \u0027broken\u0027 and it\u0027ll sink into the ground (Which is really incredibly annoying). The only way to fix this I\u0027ve found is use more struts, a lot more. And locking the suspension doesn\u0027t really help, in fact I think it breaks them easier (Try jumping and landing without bending your legs). What I had to do was simply send out a Kerbal everytime I landed and repair the legs one by one. You have to be careful doing this as the legs will spring out of the ground as soon as they are repaired (Also ridiculous).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an annoying problem, but not impossible to fix \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T03:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry, but I have no technical advice to give you however, the explosions and crashes were quite entertaining!
