So if you were trying to hit an orbit of 9 degrees from a launch site of 15, you would be SOL. (You can use a dog-leg launch, where you launch toward the plane you want, get your apoapsis onto it, and then circularize at your apoapsis but in the target plane rather than your orbital plane. Costs fuel, but not as much fuel as if you circularized before changing planes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that you are trying to do the opposite (go from 9 to 15), it is possible to put your ship into that orbital plane. You have to launch when your ground site is in that plane. So you are constrained in timing. But in order to launch directly to a rendezvous, you can only launch when the target is at the right spot. That ALSO constrains your timing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe chances that the target will be in the right spot at the same time as your launch site is in the orbital plane are very, very low. I think that\u0027s why MechJeb can\u0027t do it for you automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest thing usually is to just launch to the target\u0027s orbital plane (if you can), establish an orbit either higher or lower than your target, and then do an in-plane rendezvous at the appropriate later time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"futrtrubl","CreatedById":77310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T21:19:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smjjames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smjjames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do I get rendezvous to target to work from a location other than Kerbin?
