I thought for sure I\u0027d either get burned up, or at the very least the kerbal wouldn\u0027t survive the impact, even in the water, and yet he did.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T02:35:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 02:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by guitarxe**\n  \nchange to answered"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T00:59:38Z","Content":"Kerbal helmets are indestructible. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) It\u0027s saved Jeb many times, when I chose a bad landing site and had to bail out of the ship.\n\nAnd re-entry heating is pretty weak when it\u0027s just from LKO.
