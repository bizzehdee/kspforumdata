With planes with multiple engines, I\u0027ve come to accept that this will always be an asymmetric loss: one turbo jet will be starved of oxygen before the other, resulting in a yaw effect and a flat spin if left alone. At this point, you have to throttle back to reduce the air requirements of both engines until the engines\u0027 thrust is symmetrical again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery occasionally, one of my SSTO designs won\u0027t suffer from asymmetric thrust as it climbs for no obvious reason that I can discern. The plane can fly as high as it pleases at full throttle with perfectly symmetrical - albeit gradually reducing - thrust from both engines. Only when one finally flames out does anything bad happen. I\u0027ve yet to discover whether this something to do with the plane\u0027s design or simply a bug. If it\u0027s the latter, I\u0027m loathe to exploit it as it makes the designs much more effective but given that I\u0027ve not seen it called out specifically in any of the SSTO design tutorials, I\u0027m assuming its a bug. The designs I\u0027ve had this with are not-particularly-air-hogging, i.e. an intake-to-engine ratio of 4:1 or lower. The latest was a twin turbojet with two ram intakes and a radial each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else experienced this effect?
