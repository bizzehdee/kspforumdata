Toning it down makes the boosters not be OP and also use solid fuel which is a little more \u0022realistic\u0022. I also put in the sounds from KW rocketry so I get the cool thundering solid booster sounds \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. Performing various launch stress tests I can get the KSO to 200-250km polar orbit carrying a 8-10 ton payload reliably (that was the uh... Kerbal armed forces\u0027 design requirements). If I am flying with less payload I reduce the booster thrust, solid fuel amount, and liquid fuel amount in the EFT as necessary to not carry surplus fuel to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy most recent KSO mission was to launch the Cacteye telescope to 250km orbit at 60 degrees inclined; I landed with about 100 m/s dV left which seemed a pretty good safety margin although I could probably tweak it further to make it more challenging to get into orbit. I just used ballpark numbers to start with and they were pretty good so I kept with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried the FAR configs published earlier but had no success. Using the stock cfgs I have no trouble whatsoever landing reliably on the runway, but with FAR the whole craft becomes unstable, even during launch. Maybe I needed to tweak the control surface paramters or the cfg I used was incompatible with newest KSOS pack. Using the stock configs it flies like a dream except for the fact that my dromoman shuttle arm causes some funky behavior on re-entry since the parts inside the cargo hold are not shielded from the airflow. Anyway I am not sure what problems people are having with FAR, unless they are using the FAR specific configs which I found to be unnecessary. I tried just making the cargo hold to be a \u0022Part\u0022 and not a \u0022Winglet\u0022, but even that one change made the ship very difficult to control (it became very sensitive to payload mass, MJ for some reason was not able to hold it on the right launch vector but I could do it manually for a while before I lost it too). I do not understand the FAR configs enough to try to make my own so I will have to put up with the unshielded cargo bay until someone comes up with a fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also found a pretty good solution to the \u0022mechjeb problem\u0022 (where burns in orbit using MJ cause the node to drift around and the orbiter to spin around and around unable to finish the burn). The source of the issue is that the OMS engines are offset from the axial direction of the ship, so when MJ points the nose at the burn node the thrust vector is not pointed in the same direction, so burning without compensation (as MJ apparently does not during orbital maneuvers... although it can do so during launch using corrective steering?) will cause drift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fix this you need to get the thrust vector in line with the maneuver node. I accomplished this by surface mounting a stock cubic octagonal strut behind the nose cone, but angled it down by 10 degrees. I then put a stock probe core (I just call it the \u0022orbital computer\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E) on top of the cubic octagonal so it too is pointed down 10 degrees. Setting the OMS engines to have a trim of 10 degrees puts everything more or less in line (there is a lateral shift between probe core axis vector and thrust vector but overall it is much better than default layout). I have not experimiented with mounting the probe core in other areas of the ship such that the thrust vector, CoM, and probe core axis are all incident, but that should make the craft fly even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure why the default/recommended OMS setting is to be at 14. Based on my observations of CoT and CoM in the VAB/SPH I found that a 10 degree OMS setting produced a thrust vector that was pointing through the CoM. This varies some depending on what payload and fuel remaining you have, but on average it seemed much closer at 10 than at 14. Anyhow setting the engines to 10 degrees offset also makes the thrust vector in the same direction with the probe core axis, so when MJ burns there is vastly reduced drift. Using this solution MJ can auto-pilot orbital maneuvers to within the default 0.1 m/s tolerance about 75% of the time; the rest of the time it will start to lose it at 0.2m/s, necessitating a manual disengage of MJ to prevent it from spinning around and around. I believe if you changed the burn tolerance to 0.2 or 0.3m/s it would work no issues pretty much all the time. I always have RCS enabled during the burns too which helps the ship compensate. Manual burn accuracy should also be improved using this method too since you are again fixing the fundamental problem which is that the thrust vector and ship\u0027s nose vector are not aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways to use the solution above, you have to \u0022control from here\u0022 on the angled probe core before initiating any orbital burn (hinged nosecone is great for this!). This will essentially shift the orbiter 10 degrees nose up to the direction you want to go. One side effect I noticed is that going to IVA causes the \u0022control reference part\u0022 to be the cockpit again so you cannot burn from IVA (the workaround is to burn by hand, but instead of pointing at the maneuver node just point about 10 degrees nose up from it). Also remember that RCS is aligned with the cockpit so your RCS maneuvers may be a little off until you \u0022control from here\u0022 on the cockpit again. Basically what I do is always have control from teh cockpit, and change the control to the \u0022orbital computer\u0022 for any OMS burn, then reset control to the cockpit once the burn is complete for RCS maneuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI I may be wrong but I believe this is the same issue experienced by the real shuttle, and they compensate in a similar manner by not pointing the shuttle nose in the direction they want to go but rather offset it some amount so that the thrust from the engines is pointed where they want to go instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do not want to futz with all the 10 degree offset and control part switching stuff above, the easier but slightly less realistic solution is to add a 3rd OMS engine on the spare node on the shuttle\u0027s rear surface. Then make all the OMS engines have trim of 0, and reduce the two upper OMS engines thrust output to 45% (if you leave them at 100% output the thrust vector will again not be pointed through CoM). This arrangement is slightly heavier/less efficient since you are carrying an extra engine, but it lets you MJ around to 0.1m/s accuracy with no issues whatsoever and you do not need to juggle what part you\u0027re controlling from. The increased ISP of the OMS engines might also make this slightly more efficient than simply using the main engines at 0 trim to burn around in orbit (also slightly less realistic).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry this is a LOT of text, the whole concept is pretty straightforward if described with a couple diagrams/pictures. I may try to put those together and post them this evening. The unintended but neat side effect is that it forces you to consider CoM, CoL, and thrust vector of the ship when designing various payloads, something that was carefully accounted for on the real shuttle missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to make this solution more integrated? I don\u0027t know if there is an easy way to automatically switch which part is used as the reference, or how to get it to be offset in IVA mode, but maybe making a new KSO nosecone part that has built in probe core with 10 degree offset would remove the need to add the angled octagonal cubic and probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T17:04:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice!
