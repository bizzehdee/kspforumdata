You don\u0027t want to waste a good release hype by not having the game available on a platform where most people will expect to find it. Especially when your game runs on Unity and platform you\u0027re talking about is Steam. Yes, you\u0027ll get to keep more of your revenue with direct sales, but it\u0027s not going to make up for lost volume. Not by a long shot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsole release is in the same category. Next gen is just a no-brainer. (I\u0027ll keep calling it next gen until you can actually go to a store and buy a PS5/XBSX.) There\u0027s no reason not to release on these. Yeah, performance won\u0027t match up to high end PCs, but it will be better than what some people are intending to play KSP2 on PCs. And all you have to do to not muck up that launch is basically have a good UI team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current gen is a bigger question. Thing is, though, that they aren\u0027t shipping on bespoke engine that they have to somehow squeeze onto current gen. It\u0027s Unity, so the game will either do fine on consoles or it won\u0027t. Delaying won\u0027t make a lot of difference. The other part is that, again, because it\u0027s Unity and because current gen has more than enough horse power to handle rendering in KSP2, you don\u0027t have to worry about the console release being full of bugs and glitches. Really, the only limitation is going to be that threshold for ship size and number of ships your system can handle before losing\u00A0frames is going to be a lot lower. And it is something you can play around. Some of the optimizations they basically have to get in to make KSP2 work across the board will also help mitigate these problems on current generation of consoles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBottom line, yeah, performance on current gen will suck, but you aren\u0027t going to help that without completely rebuilding the core of the game, and Intercept doesn\u0027t have enough resources for that. So delaying won\u0027t help. It\u0027s a question of whether you release for current gen or not, and financially, it makes sense to release. I just hope T2/PD are transparent about the fact that the game will not play as well on PS4/XB1 and make sure people get free upgrade whenever they do jump consoles. I think, that\u0027s the most reasonable way to handle all of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-04T13:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223903188\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199038\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221609704240\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022207217\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr. Kerbal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Dr. Kerbal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst direct download then on STEAM download.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that direct download was an option only because at the time Steam didn\u0027t allow for automatic access to the store to self-published titles, you had to go through that terrible Greenlight lottery (which is still better by a mile compared to ther platforms who\u0027s standard policy was \u0022no you can\u0027t\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Steam Direct none of that is needed and, even putting aside the visibility Steam brings, I don\u0027t know if a small studio would gain anything in distributing their game digitally directly, costs for servers and customer support are not low and I suspect they could even be higher than that \u002230% Steam tax\u0022.

I don\u0027t think they even need to go through Steam Direct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for setting up your own distribution, it\u0027s not that expensive anymore, even if you pay for cloud hosting. If you go with almost any sort of canned DRM solution, it will have an option for verifying license via a token, so you just need to set up a simple database for licenses and a store front that can take cc payments, say, via Stripe. Store like that is cheap to maintain and wouldn\u0027t be expensive to outsource the development on. I\u0027m glossing over some details like taxes and having end points for launcher to check for updates, but it\u0027s a solved problem in web development. A game dev team might not have internal experts on this sort of stuff, but like I said, it\u0027s easy to outsource. It\u0027s not free, but for a large title, can be had for way less than 30% of revenue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, I would say it\u0027s all about visibility, marketing, and ease of access. In general, marketing costs start at half of your total publishing costs and go up from there. If you put a game like KSP2 on Steam, it will be on the front page for a couple of weeks. That kind of exposure honestly is worth the cut that Steam will take. There are also\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of people out there who will be hesitant about putting in their payment details with your web site. They\u0027ll also be weary of yet another store and yet another launcher, with who knows how many bugs and update problems. You can make your store front flawless, but you can\u0027t make people believe it without a lot of marketing and PR.\u00A0Steam makes it a one click purchase for hundreds of millions of potential customers. You can\u0027t buy that with marketing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn that note, cross-publishing on other store fronts makes sense for all the same reasons. Hassle of getting your Steam-ready game up on GoG and Epic GS is minimal. I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll generate nearly the same kind of sales, but any additional sales you get there is pure profit, and they take similar or smaller cuts. PD already has relationship with Epic, so that should be simple, and GoG tends to be pretty chill about what gets in. So no reason not to add these two as distribution platforms as well.
