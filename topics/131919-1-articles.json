So im currently building a Jool 5 Challenge craft and decided to use Nukes to get there with however I struggled to get anywhere near the TWR I thought I\u0027d need so decided to do some testing. I launched a small probe with a heavy fuel tank and a nuke.

But when you are on orbit you do not have to fight against gravity. You push forward and even extremely low TWR can accelerate your ship to high velocities. Probes with a real ion engine can have TWR of 1/100000 compared to g and they are capable of high dv interplanetary travels from LEO (actually much more capable than probes with traditional thrusters).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, very long burns are difficult to time. There are not suitable tools in KSP or any mods. My thumb rules are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. stage (\u002Bpossible SRBs):\u00A0 dv 1500-2000 m/s, TWR (at start) 1.3 - 1.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. stage: dv 1500-2000 m/s, TWR (at start) 0.7-1.0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point ship is on low Kerbin orbit. If my destination is Mun or Minmus, it is typically 100 km and 300 km for interplanetary operations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. stage: dv depends on target and mission profile, typically from 1000 m/s (Mun) to 5000 m/s (Moho), TWR 0.25-0.35.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lower TWR you have in ejection burns the larger errors you have, if you do not calculate exact trajectory and time burn with separate software. Therefore I use 300 km orbit and TWR around 0.3. The higher parking orbit the less errors you get but you have to use more dv because you do not get Oberth effect. And the higher TWR the shorter and more accurate burn but payload ratio is hit by heavy engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T10:50:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222404990\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131919\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455261978\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022130574\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maceemiller\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, maceemiller said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there something im missing here as I believed TWR had to be over 1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack beta 0.9, I did a tylo landing with a nuke powered lander. It was 14 tons with 2 LVN. The TWR before deorbiting was around 0.95 (Tylo-related). That\u0027s not an issue in the begining. You first need to reduce your horizontal speed, the gravity will pull you down to tue surface but in the begining the pull is quite manageable. When the pull start to increase, you already cancelled a good part of your horizontal speed and your ship is lighter. your TWR raise above 1 and you can land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo do that, you can\u0027t follow retrograde, you\u0027re velocity will increase too much and you won\u0027t be able to cancel it. You\u0027ll have to do an unefficient landing : you start burning retrograde but as you vertical velocity start to rise, you must conteract it by raising AoA. Vertical velocity must be kept under control (less than 200m/s) while you cancel horizontal speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have the lander precise specs, but I think that the TWR was 1.25 when I landed. When reorbiting, I burnt 6000m/s in total, way more than the 2270 x2 I should have. BTW, I also landed a TWR=3 probe using exactly 2267m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue with this design is that LVN engine weight was risen to 750kg more since 1.0. and physicless parts have mass now. Building such a LVN powerd ship is now quite hard and much more massive. It may not even be practical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T14:57:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222404990\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131919\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455261978\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022130574\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maceemiller\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, maceemiller said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there something im missing here as I believed TWR had to be over 1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTWR = Thrust to \u003Cstrong\u003EWeight\u003C/strong\u003E Ratio\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeight varies by the local gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving a TWR of 1 or greater simply means you have enough thrust to lift your weight on a given body.
