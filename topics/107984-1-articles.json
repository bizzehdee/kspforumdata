Sporting a stealthy, tail-less design, this fighter truly looks ready for the future of warfare.\n\n![hNwUOOR.png](http://i.imgur.com/hNwUOOR.png)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Glad ya\u0027ll like the pack. I will say that I did have a wikipedia-sourced image from Lockheed Martin showing the real-life overhead, side, and front views of the F-35A while I was building it, and that I tried to get it to a good, working scale in-game.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E F-35 actually does have two engines.

Nice plane BTW.\n\nYup! As Rune said, the F-35 doesn\u0027t have two engines, but the F-35B STOVL variant (utilized primarily by the USMC) does have a VTOL lifting fan powered by the main engine. I only included the two engines (albeit clipped together to make a singular nozzle) so that the performance would be appropriate. Glad you guys like the replicas! I\u0027ve got one or two more I might add to this pack, so stay tuned!"}]}
