I want to know how to work around the bug. I\u0027ve seen people land on bop before and they didn\u0027t explode. I have even landed on it once without exploding. I want to know if you have any tips for avoiding the bug. Like landing at latitudes which are nearly multiples of the tile resolution, or near/far from the poles, what kind of landing gear to use, what kind of altitude be at when loading the planets, spells and prayers to say before landing, offerings that please the kraken, that kind of thing. Anything you know, please share.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT, I suspect that the collision mesh is just off in most places. If you have a craft successfully landed on bop, please share the coordinates, because it\u0027s probably in one of the few safe places.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-02T04:02:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2012 04:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by nhnifong\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunJumper","CreatedById":27062,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T04:12:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a craft successfully landed on Bop, but when one kerbal came down to walk on the surface, he instantly became smeared across every point in the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T04:57:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply, you need to offer more Kerbals to the Kraken.
