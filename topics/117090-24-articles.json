Though, I don\u0027t think that I will be following that type of balance. Bigger is not necessarily less efficient (isp wise), and one of the biggest RL engines is -also- one of the most efficient engines ever made (RS-25; not many engines are larger; and very few are higher efficiency in vacuum).

Combine these issues with a part with an animated collider; and you can probably see the problem. When open/deployed, the animation is always playing, collider is always being moved by animation, and physics tree is fully updated every tick. And to complicate things more (on trying to solve them), the stock animation modules are extremely inconsistent in how it handles state update and reloading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.. it might be worth it to try a \u0027fixed\u0027 animation module on the stock shielded docking ports to see if that cleans up some of their performance problems (as I believe they have colliders that are moved as part of the animation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022falken\u0022 data-cite=\u0022falken\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnsure what is happening here, but with the latest version, the LC-ISA goes wonky after saving and reloading.\u003Cp\u003EThis is what this setup should look like: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter reloading, it goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s reversable, and works fine in the flight scene when corrected, but I have to do this every time I do a launch.

This should allow for a decent level of detail at the default resolution while still allowing for \u0027decent\u0027 detail if the textures are downscaled to half-size. I will be using whatever texture size is needed to get the necessary minimum texture scale for these engines. As the F1 is the \u0027largest\u0027 engine, and only required a 1024x, this means that most other engines should use less (far less) texture space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: And just because it is so \u0027cool\u0027 : (RL-10 engine during testing, forming icicles along the edge of the bell)\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/4eM1mNNdguA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-09T20:27:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2015 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T21:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecool stuff:)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuickly googled subject; an idea how to differentiate RL10-A-3 and A-4:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estandard colors for A-3:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets/Diverse/P\u0026amp;W_RL10_engine/RL-10A-3-3A_2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RL-10A-3-3A_2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eblue strip for A-4:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OcY0xr0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OcY0xr0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno idea / preference for B-2 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T21:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIcicles... someone please explain to me how a cryogenic engine works.
