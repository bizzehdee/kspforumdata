I\u0027ve observed fps jumps issue similar to the one with docking ports (running animation increased fps from 22 to 59). So the issue might be embedded deeper than just docking ports themselves :/\n\nSpreadsheet - have updated the sheet a few times since then, it now includes the thrust values for the engines. Though, I don\u0027t think that I will be following that type of balance. Bigger is not necessarily less efficient (isp wise), and one of the biggest RL engines is -also- one of the most efficient engines ever made (RS-25; not many engines are larger; and very few are higher efficiency in vacuum). Though their general TWR will fall on that type of curve (lifters generally have higher TWR than upper stage engines).\n\nMinimum thrust - noted. I\u0027ll probably leave the engines as-per stock with no minumum thrust / 100% throttle-able. Easy enough for others to change that setting through patches if they want.\n\nDocking Ports / Animations - I\u0027ve noticed that the stock animation code has a \u0027bug\u0027 where it constantly replays the last frame of the animation (or rather, the last couple miliseconds) (as opposed to actually -stopping- the animation); and as I understand it with Unity/phyiscs that whenever you manually move a collider it causes a full-tree update of all physics objects. Combine these issues with a part with an animated collider; and you can probably see the problem. When open/deployed, the animation is always playing, collider is always being moved by animation, and physics tree is fully updated every tick. And to complicate things more (on trying to solve them), the stock animation modules are extremely inconsistent in how it handles state update and reloading.\n\nSo.. it might be worth it to try a \u0027fixed\u0027 animation module on the stock shielded docking ports to see if that cleans up some of their performance problems (as I believe they have colliders that are moved as part of the animation).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Unsure what is happening here, but with the latest version, the LC-ISA goes wonky after saving and reloading.\n\u003E This is what this setup should look like: \n\u003E \n\u003E After reloading, it goes like this:\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s reversable, and works fine in the flight scene when corrected, but I have to do this every time I do a launch.

Likely something I changed in one of the recent releases (unified node-offset positioning) that is not playing nicely with the ISA code, probably pretty simple to get fixed. \n\nSadly, as the mod gets bigger and bigger it becomes harder/unrealistic for me to be able to test \u0027everything\u0027 prior to each release, and bugs such as this are more and more likely to make it into releases. So, here in the next week or two, I\u0027m going to start moving the \u0027finished\u0027 stuff over to a public release thread. Those releases will be updated far less often (likely only once a month or so), will only contain features or parts from the dev branch (the current release branch/this thread) that are finished, and releases will have extensive testing before being moved over to the public release branch/thread.\n\nPlans this week:\n\nRL-10(A3/A4/B2) - Three separate engines - UV unwrap done, layout and texture WIP\n\nJ-2 - maybe, if I have time. Seems possible, as I aim to wrap up the RL10s today/tonight.\n\nFallout 4 - Yep, will be taking some \u0027time off\u0027 to play some games as an official part of my todo list this week; namely the newest game in one of my favorite series, from one of the few developers that I have any remaining faith in.

This should allow for a decent level of detail at the default resolution while still allowing for \u0027decent\u0027 detail if the textures are downscaled to half-size. I will be using whatever texture size is needed to get the necessary minimum texture scale for these engines. As the F1 is the \u0027largest\u0027 engine, and only required a 1024x, this means that most other engines should use less (far less) texture space.\n\nEdit: And just because it is so \u0027cool\u0027 : (RL-10 engine during testing, forming icicles along the edge of the bell)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/4eM1mNNdguA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-09T20:27:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2015 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T21:05:54Z","Content":"cool stuff:)\n\nQuickly googled subject; an idea how to differentiate RL10-A-3 and A-4:\n\nstandard colors for A-3:\n\n![RL-10A-3-3A_2.jpg](http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets/Diverse/P\u0026W_RL10_engine/RL-10A-3-3A_2.jpg)\n\nblue strip for A-4:\n\n![OcY0xr0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OcY0xr0.jpg)\n\nno idea / preference for B-2 ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T21:06:01Z","Content":"Icicles... someone please explain to me how a cryogenic engine works.
