But yeah iv\u0027e been playing KSP for the latter part of 6 months; picked it up after i had gotten curious when i had Scott Manley\u0027s \u0022Interstellar\u0022 series on while studying for exams as background noise. Been to the Mun, Minmus, and sent probes to Duna and Eve. I have actually landed on Duna; but the little dudes got stranded there and my rescue mission was a spectacular failure after the kracken spun it end over end post-landing straight into the ground. So..i\u0027m waiting for the next Xfer window to try again; and milling contracts to get the required funds in the meantime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLittle background on me personally\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m in my early 20\u0027s and studying computer science; i\u0027m a novice C\u002B\u002B programmer (Wanting to improve). I\u0027m a gamer; played skyrim, TW3 etc. I love modding; dabbled in it a little myself but mostly use other people\u0027s work.
