After looking through the configs and comparing them to stock planets, here are some bugs/inconsistencies/bad-things-TM I\u0027ve found:\n\nFor reference: \n\nGilly has a radius of 13,000m, and a gravity of 0.005g (10x less than minmus)\n\nMinmus has a radius of 60,000m, and a gravity of 0.05g\n\nKerbin has a radius of 600,000m, and a gravity of 1g\n\nJool has a radius of 6,000,000m, and a gravity of 0.8g (apparently the devs set it so low so that the escape velocities and SOI wouldn\u0027t be too large)\n\n- --------------------------------------- -\n\nKosarn: The place has gravity similar to Minmus but a radius 3x smaller, and it\u0027s config is a mess.\n\nMina: It\u0027s about the same size as Minmus, but has twice the gravity. It\u0027s also way over Kerbin\u0027s hillsphere, which is the maximum limit at which celestial moons are stable.\n\nAlo: It\u0027s 9x as dense, and has 1.5x the gravity as Eeloo... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nMysterio: It\u0027s still too small in my opinion, should be upped to at least 1200000 (4x it\u0027s current size), which is still 5x smaller than Jool, and 2x smaller than Neidon, (Neptune analogue) from OPM.\n\nMTM-1 Haricot: It\u0027s got too much gravity (0.03g), while being 4x smaller (15000m).\n\nMTM-3 Phoop: It\u0027s too small for it\u0027s gravity, and it\u0027s too close to MTM-1 (stupid me!)\n\nMTM-4 Tihoratus: Way too small (6x smaller than minmus) for it\u0027s gravity.\n\nAll in all, things need to be about 3-4x bigger. Yeah, that\u0027s pretty much it. Also, most of the planets are either blue or brown. Only Alo and Mina break that trend. We need more colors ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nIf it\u0027s ok with you guys, I\u0027d like to redo the stock-planet moons; they are badly in need of a makeover. I\u0027d also love to see some pictures of the lava oceans on MTM-2."},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T00:09:08Z","Content":"Yeah, I honestly agree, however, the planet pack is made for realism and non-realism, and we can shove the gas giant into an unrealistic category (may need to add that to the spreadsheet, I added some extra things there), and everything else can be semi-realistic (after all, the density is screwed up in KSP, well, as I\u0027ve heard of).\n\nSo, Alo needs updating and Kosarn needs to be updated as well, sounds good, however, I would like to Keep Mysterio and its moons the way it is, but I guess we could modify Mysterio and it\u0027s moons to make them slightly more realistic.\n\nEdit: I still want some really overkill fictional stuff added in as well for the sake of variety so that this planet pack is a bit different from the rest, that is, until other forum users are inspired by this mod."},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T00:30:03Z","Content":"I acccidentally deleted the post, so I rewrote it here:\n\nI think that, at the very least, Mysterio and all of it\u0027s moons need to be scaled up 2x.
