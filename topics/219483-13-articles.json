Honestly the only reason I even am responding to this is because I accidentally left the browser open and came back to some replies but as a game dev, the release of this game has been inexcusable regardless of how large the code is strictly because of the hype leading up to the early access release in which we were led to believe the game was much further than it is. I don\u0027t doubt that it\u0027s not easy and that it\u0027s a lot of code but perhaps they should voice those concerns with the community instead of claiming it\u0027s full steam ahead and going swimmingly with nothing to show for it except concept art and constant promises with no delivery.

We were lucky to get a full decimal content update every six months, sometimes as long as a year in between\u2014as we saw between 1.0 and 1.1. Half the time even those were just a dozen or so part re-skins. Squad was great, but generally there was essentially zero communication until a month or so before a big version update. The communication is about 10x better than it was back then. The central issue was and is the actual state of the game, which definitely started rough, but genuinely is getting much better. Its just taken time, and honestly less time than it took for KSP1 issues to be addressed. I mean were wheels and jumping landing legs ever actually solved? All of this seems based on a very glossy view on times gone by.

At the \u0022best\u0022 time we\u0027d get an upnate that told us they couldn\u0027t tell us the date, and then a communication from Dakota that the patch was near, and then it was just bugfixes and nothing more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last proper devblog was July 21 (83 days) , about the heat system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last \u0022dev chat\u0022 was 12 days ago (after being delayed from a release statement in August, from which another video is still missing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last \u0022upnate\u0022 was June 30 (104 days).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, you could argue that the dev chat would obviously stand as the latest communication, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027d quickly be reminded that not only did it state \u003Cstrong\u003Enothing about the game\u003C/strong\u003E but it was also nothing about what could be coming to the game, considering it was only theoretical talk about an internal tool to maybe let them try some solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne can call people naysayers, haters, meltdown havers, and whatever else, but I once again invite you and everyone to take a snoop outside these forums (and much more the discord), and actually get a taste at what differing opinions look like. It\u0027s way too easy to call people toxic and cower under the blanket thinking everyone else is the problem. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/WQme0yO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere you go, have an album\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
