The alternative is to make a spaceplane, rule of thumb is if it can get to orbit on kerbin then it can get to orbit in laythe, finding somewhere to land might be more of a problem though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T18:00:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasicly, it requires,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALOT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI speak from experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T20:08:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a mission you should do \u0022Apollo style\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you do it apollo style and use aerobraking: 9,000 m/s for your main ship, starting from the surface of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4500 m/s starting from LKO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you also want a lander that can do 2800 m/s-\u0026gt; this is easy enough to acheive with a FL-T400 tank (remove some oxidizer), a lander can, a rapier engine, and some radial intakes \u002B parachutes \u002B landing legs.
