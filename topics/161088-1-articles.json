I\u0027m not (yet) looking for help on how to fulfil this contract and why I\u0027m posting this is altogether much simpler.\u00A0 It\u0027s to do with resources which are disabled in the right click menu.\u00A0 Let\u0027s suppose you wanted to keep the 10 units of monopropellant which comes with a Mk1 Command Pod as a sort of emergency reserve and decide to disable it so it can\u0027t be used until you need it, how do you bring it back online?\u00A0 I\u0027ve tried this a few times with monopropellant. and electric charge, but once I disable them I can\u0027t get them to reactivate later on?\u00A0 I suspect I\u0027m missing something very simple and will feel like an idiot when I get the answer, but for now I\u0027m stuck on this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-26T07:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need full craft control (both a commnet link and electric charge) to operate this toggle on an unmanned craft, IIRC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lelitu","CreatedById":146287,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-26T07:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame way you deactivated them, click the little red circle.But, you have to have control of the craft to reactivate locked resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving control means a kerbal, or electricity and communications.
