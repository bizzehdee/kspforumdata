I know that KSP Interstellar has Beamed Power arrays (Thankyou Scott Manley) but was looking for a stand-alone system I could use with Near Future power and Propulsion Packs instead.\n\n1. I know Roverdude had considered creating such a thing for his USI Modpacks. Has he indeed made it and if so what modpack?\n\n2. Is there another Beamed power mod I just cant find?\n\n3. Is it possible to separate the Beamed Power parts and DLL\u0027s from KSP interstellar to create a stand-alone package?\n\nTIA"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T00:12:24Z","Content":"#3 - I haven\u0027t pulled pieces out of KSP Interstellar but I have used partial mods quite often. Just copy the mod into a test game folder and delete all the parts you don\u0027t need. I usually just leave the Dll\u0027s. Easiest way to find out if it works is to start a new test game and try it."},{"CreatedByName":"Phelan","CreatedById":160924,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-14T19:11:54Z","Content":"I wish I could go with wasml\u0027s method, but Interstellar has dependencies that conflict with other mods I\u0027m using (can\u0027t use TweakScale or FuelSwitch), so I\u0027d love an actual standalone mod, too."}]}
