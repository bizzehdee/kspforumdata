Turn on Adv SAS to keep the plane centered on the runway, max throttle and hit that spacebar and listen to the turbojets roar into life. Being a big fat SSTO Dreamchaser is quite heavy, so no need to nose down on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The runway is actually a little bit above the ground. Nearing the end of the runway flip Adv SAS off and pitch up. As the wheels leave the runway the plane will nose up. Immediately switch Adv SAS back on and the plane will start climbing. Retract landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Pitch up to 45 degree angle and let it climb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At 8,000m, hit stage to fire up the aerospike rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. At 19,000m disengage the jet engines. Around this point there should be some pitch instability due to fuel being used up in the forward section of the side stacks and loss of effect from control surfaces. if Adv SAS can\\\u0027t handle it turn it off monumentally and control your pitch manually. The instability should be fairly short lasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Once apapsis is at 70,000m, do an engine cut off and perform a course correction and nose down to the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Wait till about T-30 seconds till AP and fire up the engines again to build speed, get to about 2,000 m/s and turn off the engine again if AP is still ahead of you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Nearing the AP, fire the engine again for final circularisation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\\\u0027t touched C7 before so I\\\u0027m still practicing landing with a trainer, but this plane should have plenty of lift to glide down to KSC runway particularly with empty fuel tanks.

I had intended to use this craft as a shuttle in the future when docking comes into play and the RCS will be for translation when docking. After all the whole point of SSTO is to get people and cargo cheaply into orbit by not dumping any rocket parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI originally put on SAS to counteract a mysterious yaw force. Eventually I discovered the reason: my fuel lines confused the game as KSP can\\\u0027t handle two fuel lines coming out of one tank, it will just use one of the two lines. This caused one side to hold more fuel than the other and hence the yaw. I fixed this issue but forgot to take the SAS off. After flying the plane without SAS I agree they\\\u0027re not needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt makes sense lightening the plane even by a slight bit will greatly improve fuel left upon reaching orbit. The hardest thing about making a SSTO both in real life and KSP is to get the propellant mass fraction high enough. For Earth a craft needs 25 to 1 ratio fuel to vehicle hardware ratio to be able to achieve SSTO. On Kerbin it\\\u0027s a lot less, I calculate the current incarnation of Dreamchaser to be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmpty: 15.16\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake off: 25.76\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in other words, almost 42% of the planes takeoff weight is fuel. If you add on two SAS it becomes 16.76/27.36, which worsens the propellant mass fraction to slightly above 38%, hence why the plane suddenly have a lot more trouble reaching orbit. Surprisingly removing the SAS also seems to improve handling somehow as I suddenly feel a lot less \u0027phantom force\u0027 when in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway back when I made Dreamchaser I didn\\\u0027t know about the brake button. Now that I do I realize I only need one drag parachute (if any). So in addition to removing SAS I\\\u0027ve cut down the number of parachute to 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve also made some improvement to the flight program:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[list type=decimal]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]Turn on Adv SAS to keep the plane centered on the runway, max throttle and hit ignition on the turbojets. Upon reaching the end of the runway turn off Adv SAS and pull back on the stick. Once the plane leaps off the end of the runway it will nose up. Alternatively if you miss the end just keep Adv SAS off and after gliding on the grass a bit it will pitch up.[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]Pitch up to 60 degree angle and let it climb[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]At 12,000m, hit stage to fire up the aerospike rocket engine[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]At 19,000m disengage the jet engines[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]At around 50,000m you will have an AP of about 60,000m.

By the time you pitched down the AP will be about 70,000m which[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]Keep your nose on the horizon and keep the engine running until 2,000m/s[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]Wait till T-30 till AP and fire up the engine again to 22,000m/s.
