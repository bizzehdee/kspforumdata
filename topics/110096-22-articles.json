That number of possible universes is always decreasing. It decreases at a faster rate if you take a lot of chances: every game of Russian roulette, for example, instantly decreases the remaining number of possible universes by 1/6. Eventually probability catches up with all of us, and everyone elses\u0027 infinite universes go on without us.\n\nI dunno. I think the number of parallel universes you create far exceeds the number you lose. And don\u0027t forget that everything else in a given universe is also constantly creating parallel universes itself and most of those include you. Thus, your number of bolt holes far exceeds your need for them and it\u0027s hard to imagine how you ever really die until all your copies run out of juice due to age.\n\nBut the real challenge of parallel universes isn\u0027t staying alive, it\u0027s determining which afterlife you ultimately end up in. If each choice creates a copy of you in a parallel universe taking the other path, then the true answer to all moral decisions is \u0022all of the above\u0022. So come judgment day, whichever deity holds court will be faced with an infinite number of copies of each individual, and these copies will run the whole spectrum of morals.

I actually reloaded several times from a point before the Hummlebee entered atmosphere, and had the lift problem show up in different ways each time. I attempted a landing with the symmetric case shown in lower left, and was in reasonably good control of the craft but for Reasons had to pause the session, quicksave, and try to pick up where I left off. When I did, I got the mode shown in upper right. That one resulted in a really cool \u0027auto-rotate\u0027 mode with the ship corkscrewing to the surface and me controlling descent with the VTOL. Unfortunately that playthrough was unusable for the comic due to atmospheric graphics being inconsistent with previous panels (something wonky with that install of EVE textures). So I ported the save to a second, moar powerful computer--and and the lift problem went away entirely. All that would have made for way too many 4th wall breaking pages even for me, so I compressed as shown ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T20:52:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T20:56:50Z","Content":"Bill is clever **and** persistent.\n\nWell done on the storytelling for that.\n\nThe explanation was interesting, too.
