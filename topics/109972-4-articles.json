Also, the recent discussions on cargo bays revealed some interesting things about CLS. Currently, CLS considers a Cargo bay passable.\n\nThis poses an interesting realism issue if you were to open the cargo bay doors to space.... \n\nI personally think that a cargo bay part itself should not passable (it is not designed to hold an atmosphere), but you should be able to add a docking port and make it possible to be passable all the way to the port. So, while the part itself is not passable, the \u0022walls\u0022 should be. This can easily be accomplished with a Module manager config by making the part Not passable but making the passablenodes the top and bottom.\n\nThe module Manager Config would look like this (Mk2 small cargo bay as an example):\n\n    @PART[mk2CargoBayS]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]] {    MODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\t\tpassable = False\t\tpassablenodes = bottom, bottom2, top, top2\t}}\n\nThe main issue is that the current CLS code does not support this configuration condition.\n\nI\u0027m working this out now, and I think this will give us a more \u0022realistic\u0022 experience...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T16:09:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 04:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T17:46:18Z","Content":"The cargo bay example is interesting.

I was looking at the code and trying to determine the most efficient way forward. The passablenodes idea is limited as it does not easily allow distinguishing between spaces and does not seem to have been plumbed. Atm, the passablenodes attribute does not appear to be usable or needed. The multiple modules method may well be the right way, but impacts other areas of the code.\n\ngood thoughts both of you.

You should be able to transfer through any parts that make sense, such as capsules, adapters, docking ports, and a few others. Some parts don\u0027t let you transfer if the docking port is attached to a wall instead of the end (such as the mk1pod).\n\nIf you dock two ships, then you will have to open the hatches between the ships before you can transfer (via right-click on the part).
