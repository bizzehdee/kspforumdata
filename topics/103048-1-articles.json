There is nothing much to do, just some blueprints of crazy ideas with tons of dust on them. Jebediah is bored, which is not pretty safe thing, as it may hurt KSC employees, as well as buildings. And who know what else. Then one guy get it. We have landed on all planets. But most of moons remains untouched. Decision came to send Jebediah on very long mission, so peaceful time with no explosions will come to whole Kerbin. For as long as possible...\n\nBasically, you have to land on as many moons in one mission as possible. There are 3 difficulty options. Order shown here is not required for attempt to count.\n\n**Take me to the Moons - Extra Small** (Level 1): Mun, Minmus, Ike and Gilly (all moons excluding Joolian moons)\n\n**Take me to the Moons - Small** (Level 2): Mun, Minmus, Ike, Gilly, Vall, Bop and Pol (all moons excluding Laythe and Tylo)\n\n**Take me to the Moons - Full** (Level 3): Mun, Minmus, Ike, Gilly, Laythe, Tylo, Vall, Bop and Pol (all moons)\n\nRules\n\n**1.** No cheating. No infinite fuel, no gravity hacks, no hyperedit, no modified (unbalanced) parts. There are more prohibited things, not needed to mention, of course. Quicksave is ok.\n\n**2.** Everything have to be set on LKO, assembled and ready to go as one huge ship without returning to LKO or sending any additional landers. One refueling is possible.\n\n**3.** You can take as many Kerbals as you want (at least 1), but you have to return them on Kerbin (so you will basically recover them from surface/water). They also have to come back to Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere in one vessel. You can\u0027t use command seats in interplanetary.\n\n**4.** Your ship can only divide into multiple usable parts in SOI\u0027s of other planets (than Kerbin) and non-Kerbin moons. Debris is allowed. Leaving planet\u0027s SOI is only possible with everything in one part and all Kerbals on board. So you can\u0027t leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI and then divide into multiple ships leading to different planets.\n\n**5.** You have to touch moon\u0027s surface from EVA in order for landing to count. You can use tricky methods as EVA landing if possible. So double-check ladders for Tylo.\n\n**6.** Take images of everything. No image and it did not happened! If you use some informative mods, take screenshots of Delta-V before and after maneuvers.\n\n**7.** I accept Grand-Tour only if you originally attempted for this challenge and something has gone \u0022wrong\u0022. I don\u0027t accept The Ultimate Jool-5 entries.\n\n**8.** If your attempt is longer than one slideshow or is kind of long slideshow, post here link to report posted in [Mission Reports](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/55-Mission-Reports).\n\n**9.** If something seems like it is prohibited, ask me or simple do not do it. I have last word on everything. If something seems like rules violation for me, it IS rules violation.\n\nMods\n\nPart mods are allowed, if they are balanced. Parts must not have advantage over stock ones. If you find cool mod not in list, check balancing (TWR, ISP etc.).\n\n**List of allowed mods:**\n\n- All visual and informative mods, which don\u0027t affect physics and don\u0027t add parts. (Mechjeb, KER, KAC)\n\n- Docking cameras/assistents\n\n- ALCOR landing capsule\n\n- Deadly re-entry, FAR and NEAR\n\n- KW Rocketry\n\n- B9 Aerospace\n\n- TAC Lifesupport\n\n- Infernal Robotics\n\n- Near Future Electrical (nuclear thingies forbidden), Solar, Construction (excluding NFM fuel), Spacecraft\n\n- Tweakscale\n\n- Ubio Welding\n\n**Prohibited mods:**\n\n- Mods adding new types of fuel\n\n- Kerthane and Karbonite\n\n- KSP Interstellar, Near Future Propulsion\n\nScoring\n\nIf you finish a level of challenge with any score and you are approved by me, you can use one of these (from left to right level 1-3). You can use any of same or lower level badge than you completed.

Taking notes. About remotetech, keep in mind that you have to take at least one Kerbal with you.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Landing on Eve and returning should be 1000 points instead of 150\n\nI was thinking about that. Theoretically it should, but it will break scoring system. People would try to make all different goals, make as small ships as possible, and one would come with giantic ship to land on Eve and become first on scoreboard. Eve is awesome achievement to do, but is not main thing in this challenge. That\u0027s reason why Tylo has higher rating (thinking about further increase) than Eve and everything else. It is goal to land on all moons, so every bonus moon should make most important difference. I will try to balance it as challenge will be going.\n\nGool luck everyone, who is doing, thinking-about or planning his attempt!"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T15:18:41Z","Content":"Ok, I did the challenge, but didn\u0027t bother to set up communications whilst I was at it, for a few reasons (I had only about 40 m/s of delta-v when I got a collision course with Kerbin).

I\u0027d carry a bucketload of fuel, around 3 of the largest tanks with nuclear thrust. I\u0027d use the ALCOR capsule as it has a great IVA.
