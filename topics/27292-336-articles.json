It cannot go much higher than 30000 m before the jet engines start to apply asymmetric force, yet the LV-N will use too much fuel due to drag if the apoapsis is not already above 35000 m before they are ignited. Also every m/s horizontal speed the craft has when switching engines helps greatly. My usual goal for the jet engine stage is an apoapsis above 35000 m, and speed wrt. the surface above 1650 m/s (better: above 1700 m/s). To get this, I usually go for a pitch angle of \u0026gt;45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 right after launch (turbojets have a low Isp at low heights) and keep that until 18000 m, and then reduce it to slightly above 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Then I try to keep the pitch at this angle (which will change if you solely rely on SAS due to Kerbins curvature), until speed and apoapsis are OK. Afterwards I usually leave the SAS on, and only reduce thrust if intake air is getting low. Luckily, the Turbojet engines work with very little. With a bit of luck, you can keep the plane stable with just 0.03 or even less units. As soon as the jet engines start to really pull asymmetrically and reducing thrust does no longer help (at some point drag gets stronger than thrust), it\u0027s time to switch off the Turbojets, close the intakes (this is *very* important) and launch the LV-Ns. Also, the pitch angle should be increased in order to get to low drag heights asap, I usually use around 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut back to topic: Yeterday evening I sent two additional tankers and a rover towards Eve.

I can get to Eves SOI with a single burn from LKO, yet the flight path is tilted and would require quite a bit inclination adjustment at Eve. Therefore I\u0027d like to do a correction burn at the node, which the game does not show... If I miss Eves SOI, the AN/DN are shown...

Mine that I refer to as Valkyrie will start to flameout right around 24km no matter what I\u0027m doing so that\u0027s when I toggle modes for the RAPIERs, cut the Turbojets, fire the NERVAs and pitch up to about 45 degrees. I try to have it moving at least 1400m/s by then unless I accidentally flameout early from not paying attention, but a little over 1500 is preferable (note: I may be referring to orbital speed instead of surface, I just let it switch when it decides to so it\u0027s one less thing I have to remember). Much more than that takes too long to be worth hanging around at that altitude.
