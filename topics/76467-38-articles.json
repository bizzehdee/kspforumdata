I have a program now that automatically gathers data points from a curve with minimal effort (no guessing now), and then exports that data to an excel sheet which calculates fuel burn and creates the fuel remaining vs. thrust curve. The results as I said (as long as other key info is right) makes a curve that is data generated with no guesswork, and testing and matches the curve every second of flight. Don\u0027t believe me get the UA1205 curve and you can literally follow your flight and watch your thrust vs time perfectly match that on paper.
