Bummer. Congratulations on building a capable design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is still hope. It might be possible to right the ship. Drain all the RCS fuel from the top tanks to the big one below. Retract and extend landing gear while rolling around. Either you\u0027ll be back on your feet, or more things will explode. If you do manage to get upright, right-click on the opposite engine and shut it down, leaving the other two activated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, just press F9.
