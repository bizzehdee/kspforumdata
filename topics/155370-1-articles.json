I need to come up with a way to extend the battery life of the probe controller in the booster long enough to handle the deorbit after staging).\u00A0 That\u0027s 16 T (the two Command Pod stacks and their fairing) orbited by a single booster.\u00A0 I\u0027m pretty happy with that, given I\u0027ve been playing the full version for about two weeks, and I\u0027m still on Year 1, Day 4 game time (which includes a fair amount of warping waiting for maneuver nodes and such).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext upgrade on this is likely to be conversion of the uppermost orange tank to a stage, which ought to give enough additional \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to send the upper section to Mun and hopefully even do the Munar capture burn.\u00A0 That will be accompanied by conversion of the lower Command pod to a lander, while the upper command pod stage will push itself and the lander\u0027s Command Pod back to Kerbin after descent, ascent, and docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeptune One Mod. 3\u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/0k61ft3vcv0z60i/Neptune%20One%20Mod_%203.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft File\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n71 parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n132.8 T liftoff mass (including launch clamps?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n38.4 m high\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.6 m wide (2.5 m booster diameter, plus Twin Boar skirt)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.6 m \u0022long\u0022 (Twin Boar engine setup and skirt)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Neptune%202b_zpsc3zd0qh0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022591\u0022 src=\u0022http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a183/dqualls/KSP%20Images/Neptune%202b_zpsc3zd0qh0.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Neptune%201_zps1lrsreyh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022591\u0022 src=\u0022http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a183/dqualls/KSP%20Images/Neptune%201_zps1lrsreyh.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Neptune%201b_zpsxisprivy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022591\u0022 src=\u0022http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a183/dqualls/KSP%20Images/Neptune%201b_zpsxisprivy.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInline images don\u0027t seem to want to work from Dropbox -- but this is the first time I\u0027ve tried to share from there, so it\u0027s probably me missing something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-21T23:23:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2017 11:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Zeiss Ikon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T20:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the saying (apparently) goes, no pics, no clicks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T20:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pictures are on the \u0022naked\u0022 links.\u00A0 I\u0027d welcome assistance on how to edit them to show inline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T20:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, ok.
