Initially I thought they\\\u0027d be rather similar but the Mun\\\u0027s orbiting speed is roughly half that of our moon. Are there other differences? What is the needed speed in M/S for a low orbit of Kerbal compared to earth?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Bugs: After returning from the launch pad to the hangar, sometimes struts has changed position. Sometimes a craft launches okay, but crashes, and on the next launch (no changes), falls apart on the landing pad before the engines are even engaged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Variable stress tolerance - see 3 - is there randomness in how much stress parts can take?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5:Accelerated time seems to make a craft in atmosphere become less stable. (It will crash and burn in accelerated time when it won\\\u0027t at normal speed). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: A friend of mine - we both donated \u0026amp; got the 0.14.4 update - made test craft to find out how many fuel tanks a 200 thrust engine could lift. He got it up with six tanks - mine did not. Even when I had a barebone version and he had some extras(sas, wings, etc). (Another time, the exact same design took off. Thrust was at full both times, no boosters.). Seems to be something wonky with the physics when you\\\u0027ve had crashes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7: A question on mods: They seem to be either silly, offer overall better things (thus reducing the challenge) or specific designs you can\\\u0027t alter (which removes most of the fun of the game). Assuming I want mods that mostly extend the basic components of the game with more utility but not change the basic balance, is there any good ones?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8: Lastly, is there any good guides on the gimbal / navball / thingy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn advance, thanks! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-11T03:38:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe navball is pretty simple, the yellow circle points toward the direction your travelling, the green circle with the \u0027x\u0027 points directly opposite the direction your travelling.

Both Kerbin and Mun are approx. 1/4 the size of Earth and Moon, respectively, and their mass has been chosen so that they have the same surface gravities as their real-world counterparts.
