Not a huge deal as I\u0027m still able to pull things up---but when I\u0027m in flight mode the icon ends up hiding behind the warp and time indicator at the top-left corner of the screen, and I\u0027m unable to adjust the horizontal or vertical placement of the icon in the settings. The issue only presents itself when the 000_Toolbar folder is dropped into KSP GameData---but without it, of course, the docking alignment doesn\u0027t function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, not a huge deal as I can work around it, but I was just curious if anyone has encountered the same problem and has found a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlease disregard:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cem\u003EI just had to open up the \u0022Unlock size and position\u0022 option by right clicking on the icon toolbar.
