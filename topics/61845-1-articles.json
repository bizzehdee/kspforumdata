That\u0027s the orbit that costs least dv to establish as you use Oberth effect when braking at your low Pe. It also costs least dv to leave the orbit again although it may require some waiting till the orbit is aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside of such orbit is, each ship will have its own, based on the direction from which it came. For such parking it is impossible to build an orbital refuelling station (or they\u0027ll have to spend significant dv on aligning) so it\u0027s better to send up individual refuelling missions. Also not everybody handles elliptic parking orbits at funny inclinations well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal favorite orbit for an orbital station is 650 km above surface. It\u0027s high enough that Kerbin doesn\u0027t take up half the sky (and doesn\u0027t render in much detail), it\u0027s possible to time warp all levels at that height, and departure from that height costs way less dv for near targets and almost the same dv for distant targets (Eeloo, Jool, Moho) compared with LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jart","CreatedById":101732,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T20:56:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EG\u0027th, we are thinking along the same line of thought.

The reason you don\u0027t want to have a naked space station in some arbitrary orbit above Kerbin is because it\u0027s not just about the fuel you get there but the ease of getting there. Minmus has enough gravity to make it a lot easier to rendezvous with than a station orbiting Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea with using Minmus is that you\u0027re less than 50 m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv from an interplanetary trajectory, so if you refuel at a station there, you save almost 1 km/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv. The problem is Minmus might not be at a convenient place in its long orbit for your interplanetary burn. Also, once you develop heavy-lifters, it\u0027s just not worth it. An extra 1 km/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv is no longer a big deal when you can throw 400,000 kg into LKO, especially considering the extra work you have to do. Making a stop at Minmus is just the final step; first you have to build the damn station, move it to Minmus, and keep it fueled.

No thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second kind of fuel depot is just a fuel tank with an engine and a probe core you throw at your destination. When your crew gets there, lands, and ascends back to orbit, they rendezvous with it to siphon the gas to fuel their way home. This is what I did to get the crew back from Moho, except I staged a depot at both Moho and Eve, because the first depot didn\u0027t have enough gas to get the crew all the way back home. Again, this is superseded by heavy-lifters.

When escaping a planetary body, you lose a certain amount of energy (for a fixed mass). But when you are moving faster, that same loss of energy translates into a smaller loss of speed. Because the same burn gives the same delta-v at high and low speeds, it\u0027s better to do transfer burns when you are moving as fast as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, you need a certain velocity relative to the Sun to be able to use a certain transfer window. At a low orbit, you may already be close to (or even past) that velocity when traveling to the right direction, so you don\u0027t need to accelerate that much to get to the right velocity and to compensate for gravity losses. At a high orbit, your velocity relative to the Sun is pretty much the same as the velocity of Kerbin, so you may actually be farther from the destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s use the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELaunch Window Planner\u003C/a\u003E for some concrete numbers. Starting from day 1, the best transfer window to Duna requires 1034 m/s from a 100 km orbit, and 596 m/s from a 30000 km orbit. In this case, you are saving something by refueling at a high orbit, but the savings are less than half of what you need to get there in the first place. If you are going to Jool instead, you need 1986 m/s from a 100 km orbit, and 2490 m/s from a 30000 km orbit, so you are actually losing by getting to a high orbit to refuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether refueling stations around Kerbin are useful depends on the kind of ships you are using. With disposable ships, there is not that much point in refueling before launch, because you can just build a bigger lifter and launch the ship with more fuel. On the other hand, if you are using modular reusable ships, you usually need different modules for different missions. In that case, refueling is just a small part of the refitting between missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-02T08:46:55Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2014 08:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jouni\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alchemist","CreatedById":8825,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T09:34:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith starting interplanetary missions from Minmus (or just edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI), the best approach would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Escape Minmus against its direction of propagation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Get highly elliptic Kerbin orbit with periapsis just outside the atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Burn at the periapsis to get your tranfer trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe total cost wouldn\u0027t differ much from low orbit assembly, but the delta-v requirements for the final craft will be about 1 km/s lower (you are getting back what you spent by delivering all this to Minmus).
