If they could give us a toggle-able option where each ship is one rigid body and not the worm of moving parts they are, then ships or stations regardless of size or number (within reason) could be in the same area at the same time. Basically right now Squad has it where each piece of the object has it\u0027s own physics calculations, causing lag when a certain number of parts or higher are in the area. The only problem I can see they would have with this is for the launch phase where everything and anything that goes wrong happens because of the physics between the different objects of the rocket, the only way I can imagine them implementing it is as an optional feature, or only done for stations so you can build absolutely huge ones without lag, or if it\u0027s used when in need like lagsbane is, or only enabled when orbital and then disabled when suborbital. IF they gave us an option like this where the physics load could be reduced then you would see your problem remedied (unless you\u0027re trying to place \u0026gt;150 ships next to each other).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-09T11:52:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2013 11:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ricardian19\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammatical errors\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synapse","CreatedById":72502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T12:09:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually think Ricardian may have a point.
