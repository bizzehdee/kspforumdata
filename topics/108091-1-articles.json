Please feel free to correct me if this isn\u0027t the place this should go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I recently have found myself facing a conundrum for developing the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/655/Model%20Rocketry\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EModel Rocketry Add-on\u003C/a\u003E. My original Idea, when I started creating the mod was to make to-scale model rocket parts, but these turned out to be WAY to small to really use in the editor. In light of this, i had decided to upscale the parts I had made to 1.25m parts and give them some customization for fun (like you can do with a real model rocket.) However, recently I thought about this problem again and realized that it might be possible to create a new editor just for the model rockets (and a new tiny launch-pad as well. This would be beyond my ability as a modder for KSP at the moment, but I am sure it could be done (it would just take some help or a really long time). Any feed back on what you guys think I should do would be appreciated. Also, feel free to offer help, criticism, and ideas, one mind can only think of so many things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:52:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a bit of assistance and collaboration, I think it would be a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
