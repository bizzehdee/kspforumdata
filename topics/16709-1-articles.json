I\u0027m pretty new to this game and the modding process. I was looking at a tutorial that said I needed the Intrepid SLS Rocket, Larger Solid Rocket Boosters, Lunar Landing Module (LEM/LM), and Larger Liquid Fuel Tanks, and also gave me a link to this site. Unfortunately, after a little searching, I haven\u0027t been able to find a download page for those mods anywhere. Can anyone give me a link please?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and if I\u0027m running the demo, will any of those parts work?
