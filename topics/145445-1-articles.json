Something like what\u0027s been done for the Endurance and the Hermes. I\u0027d like them to be full-scale, not Kerbal-sized, so they can fit in better with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E if needed. I *think* Distant Object Enhancement can handle ships being fully visible and looming even when hundreds of kilometers away, but I\u0027m not sure because I\u0027ve never dealt with anything that big before. Hopefully someone can give me that experience!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSP Bros KS","CreatedById":160459,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-12T19:32:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTell whoever does it to use my mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
