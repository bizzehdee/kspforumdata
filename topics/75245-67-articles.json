If you switch to the Mun sat, it\u0027s now the active vessel, so the connection drops. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy general design rule for RT sats is one of the longest useful antenna, and a minimum of 3 dishes. One dish is always a downlink toward KSC or whatever control station you are relying on. One dish is a *fixed* uplink toward either a remote exploration ship or to a remote local network. The 3rd dish is to active vessel, so whatever I\u0027m flying always benefits from a connection from literally every satellite in the solar system within range. For most permanent networks, I\u0027ll usually have 5 dishes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Downlink to Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Peer comm sat in same SOI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Other peer comm sat in same SOI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Ground base within SOI (Mun base, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Active vessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) and 3) are for redundancy purposes. More than once I went to replace/upgrade a sat and broke my network because I forgot to switch targets on another sat and had to rendezvous with it to regain control. I always have 4) because even with sufficient antenna range, I\u0027ve had problems with networks bridging from omni to target in the past, so I only use omni for transit vessels and backup - and use a fixed connection for anything permanent. 5) is only useful for transit vessels and useless for maintaining the network itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be very useful and interesting is a \u0027lock on last active vessel\u0027 upgrade/option so that all non-focused sats connected to the active vessel (assuming they have active vessel selected and sufficient range - current behavior) and then \u003Cem\u003Emaintained that connection when you switch to them.\u003C/em\u003E If you then switch to another vessel, they\u0027d follow to that vessel. But it\u0027d allow you to repair a mis-configured network by walking the graph up from KSC configuring each satellite as you go. It would still preserve the existing active vessel functionality, and it would be doing nothing magical since it requires already being able to create that connection - we\u0027re just having it hold the connection over vessel change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziff","CreatedById":27566,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T16:51:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would take a guess that your Mun Satellite has a dish pointed at the Active Vessel, and so when you control the Long Range Kerbin satellite, it points at your craft and has a connection.

Can anyone help me out? \u003Cp\u003Ethanks, Andrew (please PM with a solution, if you have one)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre those unmanned rockets? Because 3km is the range of the build in antenna of probe cores if I remember correctly. So you might either have no external antenna with longer range installed and active the rocket, or if you use FAR and used anything but the DP-10 it might have been ripped of due to drag forces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphon","CreatedById":58513,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T00:33:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Peder\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Peder\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just like to say Im playing 0.90 beta with 0.25 RemoteTech-v1.5.1\u003Cp\u003EI also started a new career game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 6-10 houres of playing 0.90 with remote tech, then im happy to say that so far I have had 0 problems in the start of a new game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also started a new career in 0.90.

Meaning one of the dish antennas. The 3000 km limit is the antenna on the probe core. Also, you will probably want to launch a satellite network using a manned mission so that way you can maintain contact with your unmanned craft on the far side of Kerbin (away from mission control). Try the Reflectron KR-7, activate before launch and set Mission Control as the target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphon","CreatedById":58513,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T04:07:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerBob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerBob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou have to have an antenna that does not break under dynamic load.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the DP-10 is intended for this role, with a range that is sufficient to get out of the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeconded on the need for a satellite network, ideally at synchronous orbit (2868.750 km, which you will end up memorizing too), using a DTS-M1 dish targeted at Kerbin to contact low-orbit ships.

You just need to have complete coverage. For 3 satellites that means more than 600Km (I use usually 650-700km). Rule of thumb for 3 satellites: double the planet radious for the minimum heigh requiered. That allows for the complete coverage on every planet/moon. Also you dont need to have a perfect circular orbit. Not even the same orbit (i.e same apo/peri).
