One problem, though. I\u0027m doing career mode and it seems to be impossible to earn more than 6 science points. I\u0027ve tried different combinations of parts and crew but I just don\u0027t ever earn science points after my first tech unlock. Any suggestions for this hapless n00b?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ub43","CreatedById":119634,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse goo, take surface samples, crew reports, whatever.

Science points decrease rapidly for each time you repeat them. There are many combinations of experiments to be run. For example. You can run a crew report on the launch pad, and if you run a crew report while on the runway, this is classed as a different experiment. Then there are the mysterious goo and thermometer (and others) that you can run also. Check the kerbal wiki for more tips.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo Kerbonaut","CreatedById":65299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:10:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScience is abundant in KSP.
