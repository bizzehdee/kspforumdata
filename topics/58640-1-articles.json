For one reason that you\u0027ve already mentioned, you\u0027re not risking the living of your kerbonauts. Another advantage is that unmanned probes, if designed right, are incredibly light.

Each probe had a science experiment and when one discovered a new biome I renamed it to match. Then I knew where to send the manned mission to pick up data.

The thermometer attaches to the side. Attach the 4 solar panels to the putnik too and an antenna. Now stack below the putnik the battery,reaction wheels, and the 4 toroidal tanks. Put the legs and the rocomax thrusters on the bottom tank. This probe should come in at half a ton max with about 1500 delta-v. The clampotron head attaches to your mothership in a place where the probe can detach without hitting anything. The probe has enough fuel for a 1 way trip down to the mun without any course corrections. The mothership should do the course corrections. If you have a landing mod then the probe will come out with fuel to spare. Once the probe is landed check the thermometer to see if the location name is different from a spot you landed before. If it is, rename the probe after that spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T21:56:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63481-Runaway-rover-Science-Lab\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63481-Runaway-rover-Science-Lab\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost #4\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Semtex89","CreatedById":99507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T01:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs it\u0027s been pointed out, it\u0027s good for transfer stages and to launch parts for a multi-part ship or station into orbit since you don\u0027t really need a manned flight for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that it has virtually no torque, so you might want to slap on a SAS module.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T03:03:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order for any assemblage of KSP parts to work as a controllable ship, it must have either a capsule with crew in it, or a probe core.
