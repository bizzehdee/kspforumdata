So instead of putting the updater file into your KSP root folder and launching it to install/update the mod files, you rename the updater to DMPUpdater-Development.exe and run it. It\u0027ll give you the latest build of the DMP mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note; I just did this, and DMP doesn\u0027t show up in the main menu now. It did before I ran the dev build updater. Any clue as to why this happens?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T22:26:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else had extreme difficulty with Asteroids in DMP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a recent game, I got myself attached to one, hooked up several smaller probes with RCS on them around the asteroid to help it turn, then in the main vessel tried rotating the asteroid to make the burn and something very wrong and artificial was making the asteroid \u0022spring\u0022 back every time I tried to rotate it. I know asteroids are large and hard to turn, but this was different from the usual behavior. Pushing more and more just caused the oscillations to get bigger, rather than actually making any real progress toward rotation. it was as if something was holding the asteroid in place and turning it only caused the spring back when I let go to be stronger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never had this outside of DMP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
