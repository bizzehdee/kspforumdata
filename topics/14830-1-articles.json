This isn\\\u0027t a forum campaign, its a community list. So this is the plan; there will be three categories: General, Rocket, and Spaceplane. In each of these categories, objectives will be listed as the community comes up with them. I will update this list with your suggestion as time goes on, so lets see how diverse we can make this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOBJECTIVES\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003EGENERAL\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETBA!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EROCKET\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Get out of the atmosphere; above 70 km[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Put your craft into an orbit of 105 km[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Put a satellite into Keostationary Orbit (2868.4 km)[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Land anywhere on the Mun[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Land anywhere on Minmus[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003ESPACEPLANE\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Get out of the atmosphere; above 70 km[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Put your craft into an orbit of 105 km[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Put a satellite into Keostationary Orbit (2868.4 km)[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Land anywhere on the Mun[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Land anywhere on Minmus[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T01:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDunno if this is the kind of thing this thread is for, but I guess posting here beats making a separate thread for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a couple of days now, I\\\u0027ve been thinking of a level that\\\u0027s sort of inspired by the movie \u003Cem\u003EEvent Horizon\u003C/em\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The backstory is that years ago, in the very early days of the space program, a manned ship was sent to explore areas outside the solar system, but contact was lost after it left. Recently, the tracking station picked it up re-entering the solar system, and it\\\u0027s now orbiting Kerbol. Your job is to construct a ship to rendevous, dock with it, and tow it back into orbit around Kerbin to be safely retrieved later. The mission is considered to be won when the lost ship is in a sufficiently circular orbit around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting from the rendezvous, things take a turn for the strange. The ship would use noticeably older and more primitive parts. Attempting to enter the ship via EVA will show that the command pod is empty, though you can send members of your own crew to sit in it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you dock with the ship is when the weirdness really starts. During the trip back to Kerbin, your trajectory can mysteriously change abruptly, forcing you to re-orient. You\\\u0027ll sometimes see the tags of ships going past that do not show up on the map view or tracking station, and they disappear before you get close enough to see them. Speaking of the tracking station, neither you or the ship you\\\u0027re towing are now visible on their end. Maybe your throttle will jump suddenly, or cut out while you\\\u0027re using it, or the SAS will turn off. Not ALWAYS, or even often, but enough to contribute to an unsettling atmosphere on the trip back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a Kerbal or Kerbals sitting in the abandoned ship\\\u0027s pod at any time, it is possible that their portraits will cut out, or switch to \u0027KIA\u0027, even if they\\\u0027re still alive. Much more rarely, the docking could disengage itself, making you maneuver to reattach it. I\\\u0027d love to see other ideas, too. Just things that can be subtly \u0027off\u0027 about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main question of the mission: \u003Cem\u003EWhere the hell has this thing been?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T03:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest anyone (Especially Squad) looking at a campaign option, take a *very* good read though the campaigns that have been running all ready..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10408.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10408.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=11947.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=11947.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
