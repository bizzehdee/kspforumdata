120,000 funds for a contract, and it only costs me 20,000 funds to build a rocket to fulfill the contract, it\u0027s simply not worth it to bother recovering any cash from the rocket itself.\u00A0 If I recover 0%, I have 100,000 funds profit.\u00A0 If I could somehow recover 100%, I would have 120,000 funds profit.\u00A0 120,000 is just not that much better than 100,000.\u00A0 The money\u0027s all in the contract reward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBear in mind that the limiter here is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eyour time\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 You could point out to me \u0022well, yeah, but 120K is still better than 100K, right?\u0022\u00A0 That\u0027s true... except if I spend a lot of time and effort to try to build something recoverable, it means I spend \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emore of my time\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E on that 120K contract.\u00A0 If, instead, I just say \u0022to heck with it\u0022, don\u0027t bother recovering anything, and just focus on trying to complete the contract as efficiently as possible, then I save time that I can then use to do the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enext\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E contract.\u00A0 And that next contract is worth a lot more cash than any extra funds I might have saved in recovering stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt boils down to this:\u00A0 How many funds per \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehour of your time\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E can you earn?\u00A0 I contend that \u0022recovering stuff\u0022 is a worse return on your time than \u0022do more

rocket design, and that it only costs you 20K funds to build a craft for that 120K contract.\u00A0 If it\u0027s taking you 80K worth of rocket to do the contract, I can see why you\u0027d be concerned.\u00A0 But if that\u0027s the case... the answer is not to \u0022recover parts\u0022.\u00A0 The answer is to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edesign the rocket more efficiently in the first place\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E so that you can get the contract done with something small and cheap that you don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eneed\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to

harsh taskmaster.\u00A0 If you\u0027re doing things in a somewhat-inefficient way (as we all tend to do, when we\u0027re new), then the mass and expense of your rocket tends to blow up in a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehurry\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may be that your problem isn\u0027t \u0022I\u0027m not recovering stuff\u0022, but rather
