Add some antennas to either end of the assembly (never hurts to have spares). On one end, put a service bay and fill it with equipment such as a probe core, batteries and so forth. Put whatever kind of manned control module you\u0027d like on top of that (cupolas look nice if you have them), and then to the top of that add another Clamp-O-Tron. On the other end, put your science gear; you might consider a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62368-0-23-Tutorial-Mission-Planning-and-Ship-Design-for-SCIENCE%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u0027\u0026gt;Geschosskopf Sci Bomb style design here; that makes for a good place to put some solar panels, incidentally. If you want, you can replace the center Girder with a piece of Structural Fuselage. And then on the bottom of that assembly, add another Clamp-O-Tron. You might consider adding Rockomax adapters to the endpieces to make the whole thing look nicer, but that\u0027s not really necessary if you\u0027re going for function over form.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice I didn\u0027t add a lab. You could add a lab to the core easily enough - could even make it the centerpiece.
