Two mods to consider (if you\u0027re not adverse to mods) are [RCS Build Aid](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-0-90-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-6-1-engine-gimbals) (useful for setting up RCS systems so they don\u0027t produce adverse torque - and incidentally helpful if/when you decide to start using spaceplanes) and the big one: [Navyfish\u0027s Docking Port Alignment Indicator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-0-90-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-6-1-Updated-03-07-2015%29) (which you can use as your sole instrumentation for the final alignment, approach and docking - it\u0027s that good). I dock a lot (my space station around Kerbin is used as a staging area), I use both, and I rarely have problems with the actual docking bit. That said, I did earn my stripes with stock docking first...\n\nI would definitely recommend a modular station design. If you\u0027re in career, get to the Clamp-O-Tron (not the Jr) before you launch your first part, then launch a core module with ports on all six axes (port, starboard, fore, aft, zenith, nadir). A training guide that is dated but still potentially useful is the [Salyut Programme](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Salyut_programme) tutorial on the wiki, in particular its steps in building a replica of the Mir space station (does a good job of it except for the antenna assembly on the Kvant-I module). The Mir tutorial was written before the MPL was added to KSP (like I said, it\u0027s dated), so you might try swapping out Hitchhikers with a lab or two every now and again, should you decide to build a replica of your own. A lab with science parts is a potentially quite beneficial use of a space station."},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T16:59:05Z","Content":"Whatever you do, watch your part count closely.

Add some antennas to either end of the assembly (never hurts to have spares). On one end, put a service bay and fill it with equipment such as a probe core, batteries and so forth. Put whatever kind of manned control module you\u0027d like on top of that (cupolas look nice if you have them), and then to the top of that add another Clamp-O-Tron. On the other end, put your science gear; you might consider a https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62368-0-23-Tutorial-Mission-Planning-and-Ship-Design-for-SCIENCE%21\u0027\u003EGeschosskopf Sci Bomb style design here; that makes for a good place to put some solar panels, incidentally. If you want, you can replace the center Girder with a piece of Structural Fuselage. And then on the bottom of that assembly, add another Clamp-O-Tron. You might consider adding Rockomax adapters to the endpieces to make the whole thing look nicer, but that\u0027s not really necessary if you\u0027re going for function over form.\n\nNotice I didn\u0027t add a lab. You could add a lab to the core easily enough - could even make it the centerpiece. You\u0027ll have to make a bigger launcher to compensate for the increased mass, of course.\n\nThat oughta get you a core module that can be adapted easily for many purposes, with a sufficient number of berths for new modules or visiting spacecraft.
