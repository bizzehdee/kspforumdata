The Saturn V in fact actually encountered this issue twice during launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComplicated answer; the vibrations are from the rocket engines of the rocket that at a high enough intensity could cause the structure to \u0022vibrate\u0022. This was a focal point in one of Nikola Tesla\u0027s machines (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla%27s_oscillator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETesla\u0027s Oscillator\u003C/a\u003E) that would move a piston back and forth at a set speed against the structure of a building to cause it to shake and that at the right speed (frequency) it could (in theory) cause a building to collapse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis same issue was noticed in the build of the Saturn V due to it\u0027s engine power and tall size. This was known as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/#q=pogo\u002Boscillation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022pogo oscillation\u0022\u003C/a\u003E and was the result of the combustion\u0027s frequency and escape through the rocket nozzle and could cause severe structural damage to the vehicle. This was best noted in Apollo 6 (unmanned flight of the Saturn V) where the oscillations were so great they damaged the second stage S-II engines and caused them to shutdown prematurely and also damaged the J-2 (third stage) engine to the point it was unable to fire making the mission a near failure (but a complete success as far as data). The issue returned during the ill fated Apollo 13 mission and is the cause for the early inboard shutdown of the second stage center engine (the oscillations were likely not the cause of the mission\u0027s later SM explosion).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo combat this NASA added \u0022throats\u0022 and filters through the rocket nozzle to limit the fluctuations in the combustion and minimize the chance of pogo oscillations occurring. It should be noted this was done before Apollo 13\u0027s mission but to no effect in that one particular instance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever as to the \u003Cstrong\u003Esound \u003C/strong\u003Easpect of your question; the answer is \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eno.\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E This is sadly because the frequency would be below that of the audible spectrum for humans. However this doesn\u0027t mean you cannot hear the sounds this causes such as the rumbling of objects attached or within such an object. Just not the oscillation itself. Granted in the case of a rocket; even if it was within the audible spectrum, it\u0027d still be a challenge to hear considering the volume of the Saturn V is 220db, a volume that won\u0027t just deafen you, but likely kill you and do very much worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-15T21:36:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2017 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ZooNamedGames\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-23T12:46:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood.
