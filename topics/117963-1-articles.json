I bought the game a year or two ago and played it a lot but was unable to continue due to time. Just recently downloaded the ksp installer to pick it back up and am unable to play the game at all. I have no mods installed. The game loads up fine and I can create and enter an already created game fine. When I am in these games, I am able to enter any building fine except for VAB or SPH. It loads for a fraction of a second then crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve checked the forums and thought I found a couple answers and when trying them out they don\u0027t work.
