I bought the game a year or two ago and played it a lot but was unable to continue due to time. Just recently downloaded the ksp installer to pick it back up and am unable to play the game at all. I have no mods installed. The game loads up fine and I can create and enter an already created game fine. When I am in these games, I am able to enter any building fine except for VAB or SPH. It loads for a fraction of a second then crashes.\n\nI\u0027ve checked the forums and thought I found a couple answers and when trying them out they don\u0027t work. I\u0027m running from the ksp launcher and have the 64bit option unchecked.\n\nI\u0027m running on a laptop with specs:\n\nWindows 8.1 64bit\n\nIntel Core i7 - 2.0 GHz\n\n8GB RAM\n\nNVIDIA 740M which has 2GB dedicated\n\nThe output file is located here:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/8x9aqexbo29j0ci/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8x9aqexbo29j0ci/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nAny and all help is appreciated, I\u0027m looking forward to getting back in to the game and trying out Science/Career modes."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T16:50:39Z","Content":"Hi Zinq, something\u0027s not right as KSP is not using your Nvidia 740M, it\u0027s using the Intel gpu.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Renderer: Intel\u00AE HD Graphics 4000\n\nDepending on your laptop there will be a physical switch for the graphics card, a keyboard combination or it\u0027ll be en/disabled via software.\n\nYou may also find an option to run KSP with the Nvidia when right clicking on the exe file."},{"CreatedByName":"Zinq","CreatedById":31852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T16:51:40Z","Content":"Oh man, can\u0027t believe I didn\u0027t even think of this as I\u0027ve had this problem before.
