I called it the Tortuga program and it had several variations. It has onboard: Thermometer, 2x Goo canisters, and a Sci Jr. I used MechJeb to lock the thrust to 3% or less due to high speeds making it bounce and explode. Its not incredibly efficient, but a larger variation got me (almost) to the mountains.
