And even then, my first priorities would be Ariane 1-4 and Titan IV. Then maybe down the line if there are some launchers that are sorely needed and have not been made yet, I can go ahead and do those. But until such time, anyone with free time can go ahead and make whatever is not made yet.\n\nAt some point I want to do Vulcan and Liberty, but I realize I have much, much work to do before I can even start working on those ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAs for my Delta III, if it is still up to par when KK releases his, I can have a separate download for it. But KKs work is always so fantastic, so I don\u0027t see many people using mine once his is released and combined with the Delta portion of his mod. It is more convenient for people to download from his pack than having to find my mod to get just the Delta III, and then go back to KKs mod to get the rest of the Deltas. Seems more logical to me to have any and all Delta launchers in 1 single mod."},{"CreatedByName":"frostsid","CreatedById":139516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T15:07:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Doing the Europa program would be fairly quick work as the rockets are not too complicated.
