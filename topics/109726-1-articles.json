I started seeing this crash this morning after updating some files from CKAN. I have quite a few mods running, but other than taking a while to load, my game was working fine up until today. When I monitored memory use on Windows Task Manager, the game goes up to about 7Gig of my machine\u0027s 8gig installed (before loading my memory shows about .6 Gig used). I have no idea what\u0027s causing all this memory usage, and am not sure how to read the crashlog, and it does seem to say I\u0027m using a lot of memory, but I can\u0027t figure out what\u0027s causing it. \n\nHere\u0027s the list of my mods, all loaded from CKAN and up to date (with version numbers in parenthisis.

Right after this window starts is when my memory usage spikes and my game crashes. Has anyone else seen this popup window? Is it a Squad thing or something added by a modder? Could it be a virus or other malware phishing in the KSP community?"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackSoldierB","CreatedById":103414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:08:02Z","Content":"First of all, you are running out of memory. \n\nKSP is 32bit and can only use around 3.2 gb."},{"CreatedByName":"Seaview123","CreatedById":130421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T00:17:37Z","Content":"I thought that might be it but wasn\u0027t sure.
