Skipping, as Apollo did, creates lift. What you did was to delay the total reentry.\n\n![Command_Module_Aerodynamics.png](http://nassp.sourceforge.net/w/images/5/59/Command_Module_Aerodynamics.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-03T16:46:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2015 04:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lajoswinkler**"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T17:35:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Rain, it really isn\u0027t that hard to skip, the trick is to set your periapsis so it is not too deep into the atmosphere that you land on the planet, in this case, Kerbin until you come around again for another run!

Like lajos said, it is not skipping.\n\nHere is an image of possible entry path of a space shuttle: \n\n![Ingreso_reentrada.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Ingreso_reentrada.svg)\n\nA is where they perform a direct reentry from orbit, G is where the entry path is too steep and it results in bad things, C is when the entry angle is too shallow and the craft bounces off the atmosphere. \n\nA skipping reentry is a calculated C - shallow reentry angle and use that to bounce off the upper atmosphere a few times, with every contact with the atmosphere shed a lot of energy and speed away until it approach a safe speed for normal reentry. It is a super risky move, but it will save your craft from burning up in the atmosphere when you are coming from a very high orbit going right down without spending fuel to slow yourself. My amateur understanding is that, it is different from aerobrake in that it doesn\u0027t actually enter very deep into the atmosphere and use drag to slow down. It is just skimming the top of the atmosphere, slamming its body on the atmosphere and release its energy that way.\n\nI haven\u0027t managed to do it with a capsule alone without any sort of propulsions (might be possible to do that in KSP with just RCS?), it just doesn\u0027t have enough lift even with FAR or my capsule piloting skill is bad. With a lifting body design like space planes though, skipping is much easier.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-03T18:11:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2015 06:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T17:54:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Guys, he didn\u0027t use aerodynamics, he just aerobraked so that the spacecraft would go up for a while before coming back down.\n\u003E I\u0027ve done it several times, generally reduces the G-Load and allows the heatshield to cool down, both things are useful when playing with Deadly Reentry.\n\nYes, this is very easy to do, Pe can not be to low I say above 20 km at normal speeds, if you prograde vector is above the horizon at Pe you will start to climb again, however your are still braking if Pe was above 32 km you will often get back to space but lower and your Ap drops to its inside the atmosphere and you will continue brake all the time."},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T20:26:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Rain, it really isn\u0027t that hard to skip, the trick is to set your periapsis so it is not too deep into the atmosphere that you land on the planet, in this case, Kerbin until you come around again for another run!
