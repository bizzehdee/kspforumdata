It is a super risky move, but it will save your craft from burning up in the atmosphere when you are coming from a very high orbit going right down without spending fuel to slow yourself. My amateur understanding is that, it is different from aerobrake in that it doesn\u0027t actually enter very deep into the atmosphere and use drag to slow down. It is just skimming the top of the atmosphere, slamming its body on the atmosphere and release its energy that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t managed to do it with a capsule alone without any sort of propulsions (might be possible to do that in KSP with just RCS?), it just doesn\u0027t have enough lift even with FAR or my capsule piloting skill is bad.
