But the post you are quoting is stating that nobody has achieved this before (and offering praise for said accomplishment). Your reply doesn\u0027t obey even the most basic laws of logical reasoning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatement \u002B irrelivent fact = Statement must be false. Hmmmm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf he\u0027d said \u0022OMG making multiplayer in unity 3d is so hard nobody has ever done it...\u0022 then your reply would make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut replying to \u0022yay your doing awesome keep it up\u0022 with \u0022Psshht thats easy\u0022 leads me to believe you are about to bring out your own multiplayer mod? otherwise a more sensible approach would\u0027ve been to shut up and let the man get the praise - hell i thanked my cleaner for emptying the bin this morning - not because its hard, but because nobody else had done it. If i\u0027d said \u0022yeah well emptying the bin is easy\u0022 i doubt she\u0027d have done it again next week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand a final note: blatant doesn\u0027t mean what you think it does. Wrong is more what you are aiming for (i\u0027m guessing, not agreeing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANYWAY: that was all off topic entirely so i\u0027m going back to lurking #PeaceOut\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EONTOPIC: I agree with devo \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt may not be much yet, but it\u0027s still more than anyone has managed to accomplish since KSP began, including Squad.
