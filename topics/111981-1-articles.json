This is to prevent asteroids, kerbals, and other parts that aren\u0027t intended to be visible (including mod parts) from showing up. If you want to block something, you change the subcategory rather than the part.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T21:16:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hosch","CreatedById":137329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T14:34:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You need to change the Utility subcategory definition to block those parts.

It does work exactly as i imagined. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) i did not expect the FE author to nitice this ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)\n\nanyway, this is my final edit:\n\n    CATEGORY{    name = Filter by Function    type = stock    value = replace    SUBCATEGORIES    {        list = 19,Life Support    }}SUBCATEGORY{    name = Life Support    icon = Lifesupport    FILTER    {        CHECK        {            type = folder            value = ThunderAerospace        }    }}@SUBCATEGORY[Utility]{    @FILTER,*    {        CHECK        {        type = check        invert = true        CHECK            {            type = path            value = ThunderAerospace            }        }    }}\n\nTAC\u0027s parts are now no longer in the utility folder, but in a seperat one similar to your additions (e.g. Airintake, Langing Gear, ect.)\n\nagain, thank you very much ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T21:27:17Z","Content":"Yay for things that work first time\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thank you very much!
