QuickBasic is fun but so old, I doubt I have any of what I did in the past around anymore ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nHonestly, the language is really needed as a good \u0022How to really program\u0022 despite the spaghetti programming that it often creates. There\u0027s much more to be said when you write your own simple 2D engine and learn all the problems that it creates, how to fix them, how to improve framerate... than when you just download a library and plug\u002Bchug until something works. (Then again, I didn\u0027t really do anything WITH what I made, I was often more interested in the backend than the actual games.)"}]}
