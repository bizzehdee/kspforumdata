I entered the game, loaded my career save and as soon as I go to my space station it explodes. I believe it\u0027s only 1 part but my station becomes useless without it.

Please read the sticky thread in this sub-forum that has details of information that will help people diagnose the problem (mod list, how to find log files etc) and maybe also upload a copy of your save file so that others can try it (I presume you still have a save from before the explosion).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lubo","CreatedById":136723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T13:50:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey i have similar issues with 1.0.3 so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Kerbin and mun space station wherer not usful anymore. after selecting their circuling body disappaird and the station kind of broke. non the less i had the terminate both \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E for the sake of 1.0.3, as long as we experience less bugs i can life with that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx Squad for this great game im truly loving it like no other game before, but plz dont call it finished or released yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplus my eve Rover was unoperable and crushed the game\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coisoecenas","CreatedById":95645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA new update came out.

The affected parts for me are the Mk2 cargo bays and the Cubesat battery and access hatch modules. It\u0027s consistently these parts on different craft. At first I thought it was a Cubesat issue that popped up after 1.0.3, but it\u0027s happening to stock parts as well. One of my craft has several of the battery modules, and most of them explode on launch but the few that don\u0027t display their temp gauges and they fluctuate pretty rapidly before exploding without the temperature passing half way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a list of mods if it helps at all, but I\u0027m too sapped at the moment to put more detective work into this problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EKSP: 1.0.4 (Win32) - Unity: 4.6.4f1 - OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (6.1.7601) 64bit\u003Cbr\u003EUSI Tools - 0.4.1\u003Cbr\u003EAmbient Light Adjustment - 1.4.3.1\u003Cbr\u003EAnalog Control - 1.5.2\u003Cbr\u003ECommunity Resource Pack - 0.4.2\u003Cbr\u003EContract Configurator - 1.4.2\u003Cbr\u003EContract Pack: Initial Contracts - 1.0.2\u003Cbr\u003EContract Pack: Kerbal Space Station - 2.1.1\u003Cbr\u003EContract Pack: RemoteTech - 1.1.4\u003Cbr\u003EContract Pack: Unmanned Contracts - 0.3.10\u003Cbr\u003EContract Pack: Tourism Plus - 1.1.5\u003Cbr\u003EContract Reward Modifier - 1.0.2\u003Cbr\u003EContracts Window Plus - 1.0.5.2\u003Cbr\u003EDangIt - 0.6.1\u003Cbr\u003EDMagic Orbital Science - 1.0.4\u003Cbr\u003EDynamic Deflection - 1.1.2\u003Cbr\u003EEditor Extensions - 2.11\u003Cbr\u003EEngine Lighting - 1.3.5\u003Cbr\u003EFirespitter - 7.1.3\u003Cbr\u003EFlight Manager for Reusable Stages [FMRS] - 1.0\u003Cbr\u003EFuel Tanks Plus - 0.11.1\u003Cbr\u003EInterstellar Fuel Switch - 1.11\u003Cbr\u003EKAS - 0.5.2\u003Cbr\u003EKerbal Construction Time - 1.1.8\u003Cbr\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux - 1.0.16.6\u003Cbr\u003EKerbal Joint Reinforcement - 3.1.4\u003Cbr\u003EKerboKatzUtilities - 1.2.9\u003Cbr\u003EForScienceContinued! - 1.0.4\u003Cbr\u003EKIS - 1.1.5\u003Cbr\u003EKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.5\u003Cbr\u003EModularFlightIntegrator - 1.0\u003Cbr\u003EDocking Port Alignment Indicator - 6.2\u003Cbr\u003EProcedural Parts - 1.1.3\u003Cbr\u003EQuickScroll - 1.2.2\u003Cbr\u003EQuickSearch - 1.1.2\u003Cbr\u003EQuickStart - 1.0\u003Cbr\u003ERCS Build Aid - 0.7.2\u003Cbr\u003ERealChute - 1.3.2.3\u003Cbr\u003ERemoteTech - 1.6.6\u003Cbr\u003ESaturatable RW - 1.10.1\u003Cbr\u003ESAS Tuning Fix - 1.0\u003Cbr\u003EShipManifest - 4.4.0.1\u003Cbr\u003ESmartParts - 1.6.5\u003Cbr\u003ESpaceTux: Shared Assets - 0.3.6\u003Cbr\u003EStageRecovery - 1.5.6\u003Cbr\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer - 2.5.1.7\u003Cbr\u003ETextureReplacer - 2.4.6\u003Cbr\u003ETAC Life Support - 0.11.1.20\u003Cbr\u003ETrajectories - 1.3\u003Cbr\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock - 3.3.2.1\u003Cbr\u003EAlternate Resource Panel - 2.7.1\u003Cbr\u003ESounding Rockets - 0.2\u003Cbr\u003EUniversal Storage - 1.1.0.5\u003Cbr\u003EWaypoint Manager - 2.3.3\u003Cbr\u003E[x] Science! - 4.5\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bosun","CreatedById":146083,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T06:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDitto for me on batteries mounted inside service bays.
