I entered the game, loaded my career save and as soon as I go to my space station it explodes. I believe it\u0027s only 1 part but my station becomes useless without it. Can this be related to 1.0.3 (because it didnt do that before the update) and how can I solve it?\n\nThank you."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T13:45:42Z","Content":"It could be related to 1.0.3 but without more info it is impossible to tell. What part is it that explodes (F3)? Please read the sticky thread in this sub-forum that has details of information that will help people diagnose the problem (mod list, how to find log files etc) and maybe also upload a copy of your save file so that others can try it (I presume you still have a save from before the explosion)."},{"CreatedByName":"Lubo","CreatedById":136723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T13:50:42Z","Content":"Hey i have similar issues with 1.0.3 so far.\n\nMy Kerbin and mun space station wherer not usful anymore. after selecting their circuling body disappaird and the station kind of broke. non the less i had the terminate both ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) for the sake of 1.0.3, as long as we experience less bugs i can life with that. \n\nThx Squad for this great game im truly loving it like no other game before, but plz dont call it finished or released yet.\n\nplus my eve Rover was unoperable and crushed the game"},{"CreatedByName":"Coisoecenas","CreatedById":95645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:29:42Z","Content":"A new update came out.

The affected parts for me are the Mk2 cargo bays and the Cubesat battery and access hatch modules. It\u0027s consistently these parts on different craft. At first I thought it was a Cubesat issue that popped up after 1.0.3, but it\u0027s happening to stock parts as well. One of my craft has several of the battery modules, and most of them explode on launch but the few that don\u0027t display their temp gauges and they fluctuate pretty rapidly before exploding without the temperature passing half way.\n\nHere\u0027s a list of mods if it helps at all, but I\u0027m too sapped at the moment to put more detective work into this problem:\n\n    KSP: 1.0.4 (Win32) - Unity: 4.6.4f1 - OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (6.1.7601) 64bitUSI Tools - 0.4.1Ambient Light Adjustment - 1.4.3.1Analog Control - 1.5.2Community Resource Pack - 0.4.2Contract Configurator - 1.4.2Contract Pack: Initial Contracts - 1.0.2Contract Pack: Kerbal Space Station - 2.1.1Contract Pack: RemoteTech - 1.1.4Contract Pack: Unmanned Contracts - 0.3.10Contract Pack: Tourism Plus - 1.1.5Contract Reward Modifier - 1.0.2Contracts Window Plus - 1.0.5.2DangIt - 0.6.1DMagic Orbital Science - 1.0.4Dynamic Deflection - 1.1.2Editor Extensions - 2.11Engine Lighting - 1.3.5Firespitter - 7.1.3Flight Manager for Reusable Stages [FMRS] - 1.0Fuel Tanks Plus - 0.11.1Interstellar Fuel Switch - 1.11KAS - 0.5.2Kerbal Construction Time - 1.1.8Kerbal Engineer Redux - 1.0.16.6Kerbal Joint Reinforcement - 3.1.4KerboKatzUtilities - 1.2.9ForScienceContinued! - 1.0.4KIS - 1.1.5KSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.5ModularFlightIntegrator - 1.0Docking Port Alignment Indicator - 6.2Procedural Parts - 1.1.3QuickScroll - 1.2.2QuickSearch - 1.1.2QuickStart - 1.0RCS Build Aid - 0.7.2RealChute - 1.3.2.3RemoteTech - 1.6.6Saturatable RW - 1.10.1SAS Tuning Fix - 1.0ShipManifest - 4.4.0.1SmartParts - 1.6.5SpaceTux: Shared Assets - 0.3.6StageRecovery - 1.5.6TAC Fuel Balancer - 2.5.1.7TextureReplacer - 2.4.6TAC Life Support - 0.11.1.20Trajectories - 1.3Kerbal Alarm Clock - 3.3.2.1Alternate Resource Panel - 2.7.1Sounding Rockets - 0.2Universal Storage - 1.1.0.5Waypoint Manager - 2.3.3[x] Science! - 4.5"},{"CreatedByName":"Bosun","CreatedById":146083,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T06:23:09Z","Content":"Ditto for me on batteries mounted inside service bays.
