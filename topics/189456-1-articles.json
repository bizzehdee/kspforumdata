I\u0027ve got a jet powered surface vehicle using the first landing gear set...one steerable front wheel and two fixed rear wheels, and a single jet engine. Some of the time throttle control and steering work, some of the time they don\u0027t...no steering, and only full throttle or no throttle. I\u0027ve had all 4 of the first kerbonauts drive it successfully, and yet other times, using the same vehicle, I\u0027ve got only full throttle or no throttle, and no steering. Has anyone else seen this? I\u0027m not running any aircraft mods at all. I\u0027ve only seen this on ksp 1.8\u002B with the latest Breaking Ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-31T18:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like you don\u0027t have full control - which either requires\u00A0 a pilot or a probe core with power and a comm connection back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u00A0 Only Jeb \u0026amp; Val of the first 4 are pilots.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\u00A0 With partial control, you have 0 or 100% throttle \u0026amp; can only use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to hold or set one of the available cardinal directions (pro/retrograde, radial in/out, etc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-31T19:11:16Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2019 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Cavscout74\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Michel Bartolone","CreatedById":181707,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-31T20:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow can you not have full control of a vessel on the ground at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
