Because this breaks the \u0027SpaceBuilt\u0027 theme, I\\\u0027m going to branch this part into its own mod. Working title of this new plugin is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThe Hypergate Network\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConcept\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis new branched plugin, as currently envisioned, will allow players to create a network of hyperspace \u0027gates\u0027 (actual name pending) to teleport around the Kerbal solar-system using a hyperjump \u0027drive\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECurrent Status\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis concept is all-but implementation complete. Since this functionality was inspired and implemented in Zorkonian\\\u0027s SpaceBuilt plugin, one can go and fire up a playable jump-drive right now. The changes necessary to branch this into its own plugin are mostly administrative and in GUI creation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it, fun mods have two major components: functionality and flavor. This mod already has 90% of its \u0027functionality\u0027 (largely due to Zorkonian\\\u0027s great work on SpaceBuilt and partly my laziness managing resources when using that plugin). This is a mod that needs \u0027flavor\u0027; models, textures, cool names for its parts, and maybe some science-fiction rules. I\\\u0027m hoping you might be interested in helping with that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EParts:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plugin really only requires two (possibly three) parts, at least for its first incremental release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E1. A Hyperspace Gate:\u003C/em\u003E When mounted on a vessel, this allows the ship to act as an \u0027endpoint\u0027 for hyperjumps. To jump, a ship must be within a certain distance of a Gate, and must select another gate to jump towards. Unlike a true \u0027gate\u0027 from previous science fiction shows, it\\\u0027s not necessary to pass through anything; only to be in local space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my head, this mounts radially, and could resemble a futuristic solar-panel, or a large antenna of some kind. However, I\\\u0027m very open to alternate thoughts. I can contribute concept art, but it\\\u0027s going to be on the order of kindergarten crayon drawings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should not be necessary to \u0027deploy\u0027 the gate to use it (as I don\\\u0027t want to track gate deployment status in the persistence file).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E2. A Hyperjump Drive:\u003C/em\u003E When mounted on a vessel, this allows the ship to jump from local space of its current gate to any other available hyperspace gate. It is limited only by certain sci-fi rules: for example, a maximum range to select a gate and a minimum altitude to activate. This part may have a 1 meter scale version and a larger scale version (with larger range).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my head, this part mounts like a fuel tank, and has a central spindle with a torus (or more than one) around its midpoint. Cheesy particle effects (which I can add) stream from the center of the part. No nozzle of any sort should be required: this drive need not be at the end of the rocket and generates no thrust. I can provide concept art, but it\\\u0027ll be bad. I\\\u0027m also very open to different ideas!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConclusion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the next version set to include many new planets to explore, being able to create larger ships, or specialized landers is going to be very helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterested? As I\\\u0027m a complete idiot with any sort of art, I could use the help! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceBuilt probably could use the help, too, but one thing at a time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
