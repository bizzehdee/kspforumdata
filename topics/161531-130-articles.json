They might not be accurate, but they might be game balancing reasons to maintain them. The atmospheric accumulator currenly have a liniear relationship between power and perfornace. The more power you put into it, the more it will produce. Most likely this doesn\u0027t scale so well. I can imagine that at a certain point not matter how much power you going to put into it, you aint going to collect more resource and only produce WasteHeat. The high power cost might simply a way to preventing you from reaching this point in the first place. Of cource this goes well untill you start getting very powerfull power systems. Note that the atmospheric concentration I asume to be above the atmosphere are probably way too high. A week ago I spoke with someone from NASA and he told me it requires years to accumulate any signifiant amount of resource this way. And that it\u0027s simply cheaper to use conventional methods than to try to collect any resource in space. Of cource he assumed having only acces to power generated from solar power, but still it\u0027s something to think about. Noticethat a few release back, I made the accumulator function with any High Isp engine, this allows you to collect resource with antimatter reactor. It would probably a major waste of antimatter, but it would still work.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re probably right about there being game-balance reasons for not tweaking the power requirements. Plus, you are correct about the currently-assumed concentrations being a little on the high side (although, were you clear about the ALTITUDE of the orbits with the guy from NASA? The ISS orbits at around 420 km, whereas a Propulsive Fluid Accumulator would operate at between 100 and 200 km... At 100 km Earth orbit, your numbers aren\u0027t THAT far off- maybe only only 4-5x what they should be...) which is a good enough reason to leave power requirements how they are...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the NASA guy talking about the economics, he\u0027s talking, mainly, about the cost of developing such a system vs. the benefits received. There is NO QUESTION that the marginal cost of operating such a system is much less than the cost of launching the same mass of propellant to orbit- the problem is developing such a system in the first place would be enormously expensive. And thus, probably not worth it in the current era of only messing around in Low Earth Orbit... The moment you start getting more ambitious and seriously looking at traveling to Mars, Venus, and maybe someday even Ceres or Jupiter, it becomes IMMENSELY more worthwhile to develop such a system, however. It is true that it would take years for a small-scale system to generate a significant amount of propellant- but the beauty is there is no real practical limit to how much you can scale such a system up (with more accumulator cross-sectional area, not more power), and you can use the same technology around other planets for return-propellant (CO2 form Mars orbit fed into electric thrusters, for instance- something already being looked at for very highly-specialized unmanned orbiters that would actually orbit inside Mars\u0027 upper atmosphere...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thought- it ALREADY takes game-years to accumulate any significant amount of resource this way, at least if you power it with a conventional fission reactor. Something I discovered all too late with a Duna mission I attempted in-game with Real Solar System a while back. I ended up only being able to collect a small quantity of Nitrogen from orbit after roughly 54 days of Propulsive Fluid Accumulator operation- enough to top off some small auxiliary Nitrogen tanks on a manned mission that were already mostly-full, but nothing more than that. It takes a massively scaled-up PFA, or a lot of time-warp (a couple years at least) and several missed transfer-windows, to accumulate enough Nitrogen (which is by far the most abundant resource around Kerbin) for anything more than a small probe mission...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, they would probably just overcome this obstacle by launching a whole fleet of Propulsive Fluid Accumulators- once you\u0027ve gone through all the effort of developing the technology for and designing one, launching a few dozen of them doesn\u0027t cost that much more (and, at least in the short term, helps make up for the lost profits launch-providers would suffer when we don\u0027t have to launch many spacecraft to orbit with more fuel than it takes to reach a propellant depot anymore, and can refuel them before, say, heading to Geosynchronous Orbit...) and it does provide a lot of redundancy in case one broke or got hit by something... In-game, it makes more sense to just leave PFA\u0027s with a 4-5x higher collection-rate than they should have (especially when balanced with higher power-requirements than they would have in real life).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the same old narrative- a large one time investment (developing usable Propulsive Fluid Accumulators from preliminary designs we already have on the books- not a cheap proposition by any means) for huge long-term rewards (being able to fuel all your probes, and with a large enough PFA fleet, your manned missions, at least partially with gasses collected from Earth Orbit).
