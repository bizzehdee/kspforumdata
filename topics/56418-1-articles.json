I\u0027ve also built a rover I\u0027d love to send to Mun using my favorite rocket/lander combo. However, I haven\u0027t been able to figure out how to combine the 2. I\u0027ve tried saving the rocket as a subassembly, but when i load it in when I have the rover first, I cannot attach the rover to the rocket. Also, I cannot save the rover as a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket was originally manned, but I want to send a rover using an unmanned module, drop off the rover and keep this other lander there so I can bring my 3 guys back...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts almost looking like I will have to rebuild the rover while I have the rocket loaded.

If you build your rover starting with a command module then attach stuff on both ends of the starting component (command module in this example) the root node got no attachement points available and thus can\u0027t be a subassembly. Any subassembly needs to have at least one attachment point available on the root node. By root node I mean the first part you put out, the one you select to move the contrapment around in the VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough the other way around, that you can\u0027t attach the rocket (that you have successfully stored as a subassembly) sounds odd. Could be that you can\u0027t attach the root node of the rocket to anything but an attachment point and got no such available on the rover. Few parts you can radially attach, if the root is of that type we\u0027ve got a serious problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this little rand doesn\u0027t help you, could you elaborate what it is you\u0027re doing with maybe a picture of the two parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T01:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout screen shots of the attempt to attach the rocket I cannot say definitively, but if you have a rover that does not have an open node you won\u0027t be able to attach it, your best bet at this point would be to put a radial attachment point on your rover, then attach your rocket (Assuming enough clearance between the two, and don\u0027t forget the decoupler)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T03:19:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see your rocket and let\u0027s see your rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, your option is to pick a different part of the rover as the root bit - this will be the part that attaches to your rocket. Take off as much as you can from the current core bit, pick the smallest assembly of what\u0027s left and rebuild it using the topmost piece as the new root, then reattach what\u0027s left.

The original root bit was an OKTO2 core located under a structural plate, which was under that Modular Girder Adapter you see up top. That was a natural place to make an attachment point when I wanted to start sending it off to other worlds. To do that, I took the rest of the rover off the bottom of the probe core, ditched the probe core to select a new root part, and started rebuilding the top of the rover starting with the Girder Adapter. That went Adapter - Structural Plate - OKTO2 - the rest of the rover.
