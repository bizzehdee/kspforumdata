I\u0027d assume you\u0027d need some sort of rover ability to move it around the surface a few hundred meters, but being able to land within 500m is a lot different than landing 20km away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the scarce info we have my impression is that colonies themselves will have a \u0022colonial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 (think construction yard from command and conquer) as the first structure/core which will build the rest of the structures using some kind of input (resources are an obvious one, but I imagine we would be able to send pre-fabs from Kerbin?\u00A0 I think something like that might have been implied or mentioned once, but who knows), so no actual attachment like we did in KSP1 with rovers, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E cranes and docking ports would be required.

The difference between a fuzzy red ball and the full-res Duna we see isn\u0027t actually any different from a gameplay standpoint. There is zero actual gameplay value in visualizing this this distinction. Again, without actual gameplay information like \u0022where are the biomes\u0022 or \u0022where are the nice flat places to land\u0022 or \u0022where are the POI\u0022 the distinction is cosmetic and not actually important to the game.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the devs stated goals is making it so you can just look at the bodies and intuit where and what the biomes are. It\u0027s not perfect, but it\u0027s much better than it was and I\u0027m having no problem figuring them out from orbit. All that\u0027s really needed is the science checklist from ksp1 to keep track of your experiments: no doubt this will be added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot of people are forgetting that a lot of important game design won\u0027t apply to us, it\u0027ll be for first time players (or for us veterans in the new star systems). Making it a \u0022fuzzy ball\u0022 absolutely changes the gameplay. Imagine a first time player planning their first trip to the Jool system and wanting to land on Laythe. Sure we know that\u0027s it\u0027s primarily an ocean world with a substantial atmosphere, but a new player would have no clue (wiki articles notwithstanding). Currently they can just look at it in the tracking station and see all that without ever going there (or studying it in some other way). If it\u0027s a fuzzy ball at first without much data available they\u0027ll have to study it (go there and do science) to figure out how to plan their mission. They also get the reward of discovering all the cool details about the moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is no doubt primarily a rocket building/flying game. At close second it\u0027s about exploration and discovery. Some of gamers\u0027 favorite experiences are the first time they get to explore a game world whether it\u0027s Subnautica, Skyrim, BOTW, or whatever you\u0027re personal favorite is. Sure discovering the Kerbal system might be wasted on us veterans, but that\u0027s still a huge part of the game for newcomers. And the gameplay decisions made for the starting system will apply to the new ones, which is where we can get our \u0022playing for the first time\u0022 experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarcAbaddon","CreatedById":192494,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-08T11:06:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am also critical of KSP 2 (but also the KSP 1) implementation of Science, and I agree that you do not need to produce a solution in order to be allowed to criticize as some seem to suggest.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally, I think criticism of KSP 2 science falls into two areas for me:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETheme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t get a strong feeling that I am doing actual science, it feels like pressing buttons.

The science they collect would influence the directive of the space program, for instance discovering a water resource on Duna could provide incentive to increase development of resource extraction and long-term crewed mission technologies, or discovering an exoplanet could incentivize development of larger space telescopes and instruments that can characterize planetary atmospheres.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, I want science in KSP2 to function as sensors that gather data about the environment, not as currency dispensers that unlock new parts as a reward for traveling someplace new with limited technology.
