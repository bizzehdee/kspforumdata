Stock Parts\n2. NEAR\\FAR get rated separate from Stock aero\n3. No SAS or ASAS units\n4. Two Rockets must be used on lift off\n5. After two rockets are spent must be at full throttle\n6. Cannot throttle down till the final landing\n7. Wheels must touch the ground before lifting off again\n8. Legs 2 \u0026 3 must be in the upper Atmo (gotta see the burn effects)\n9. Legs 2 \u0026 3 must achieve over 1k m/s\n10. Time is based on Mission Time (F3)\n11. Top speed in based on captured speed (F3)\n12. Craft must still be airworthy after the final landing\n\nPath:\n\n![GftjFkK.png](http://i.imgur.com/GftjFkK.png)\n\nCapture your top speed and overall time.

I figured the toughest part would be the dive from the upper atmo to land. It makes things interesting! The safe landing without breaking things was a last second thing to make it even more so hahaha!

I designed the plane to fly very straight so I could come in low, level out and just skip off the top of a hill. You saw how that went at the end. lol Great challenge."}]}
