My idea was that there would be a player who was a \u0022kerbal\u0022 and a player who was \u0022mission control\u0022. The mission control player would get all the stats and orbital info, and the kerbal would actually have to use the controls, going by what the mission control person says. The kerbal would be stuck in IVA mode, and maybe if squad ever releases advanced IVA\u0027s, then they would have accsess to that, as well as EVA\u0027s and collection science.The kerbal\u0027s navball would not have any targets or prograde/retrograde etc. markers, so the purpose of the mission control is not defeated. The kerbal would also not have altitude, speed, vertical speed, or atmosphere gauge, or anything else i\u0027m missing. Both players would have to have a microphone, but that may be a given in the entirety of multiplayer. This would only be a mode of multiplayer, so players are not stuck in the real-life player to mission control gamemode.

But the basic instruments should be available for the pilot. However, the \u0022only-IVA\u0022 thingy sounds bad. What really should matter for the mission control is the map view. Only mission control should be able to see the map view. Everything else the pilot could see, just like IRL. Also, it would be cool if the mission control was able to point the ship retro/prograde etc by clicking on the auto pilot icons, just like IRL. And even control thrust. So, like IRL, mission control could make some manoeuvrers, leaving the hard manoeuvers to the pilot (landings and entering orbit).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T02:31:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by h4didact**"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T01:33:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve had an idea that i think would be great fun as a mode, not the entirety, of mutiplayer, when it comes out.
