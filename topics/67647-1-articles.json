While this makes perfect sense for rocket engines that only need Fuel and Oxidizer, the idea of Pumping intake air across an entire airplane to the Jet engines made the physics student inside me twitch uncontrollably. In reality, the air intakes are part of the engine and pumping air through pipes doesn\u0027t really work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if it would be better to design jet engines seperately, save them as a whole jet engine and add them to your plane similar to subassemblys that you can\u0027t edit (which would allow engines to work like a single object, saving CPU power and preventing eventual wobbling) or just build them like anything else in the SPH/VAB - but now let\u0027s get to the actual engine concept:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea would be to construct each engine out of its single components: intake, compressor, combustion chamber and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to simulate the engine behaviour, the airflow inside each engine will be described with four properties: air pressure, air temperature, airflow speed and the amount of oxygen/oxidizer. Every engine component will change these four values acording to its purpose and depending an \u0027how the air arrived here\u0027: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntakes will basically provide the air \u0027as is\u0027, fan compressors will increase pressure behind them and decrease the pressure in front of them, bring the airflow speed closer to a target value (based on their rotation speed) and increase air temperature slightly, combustion chambers drastically increase pressure and temperature, increase airflow speed and decrease oxygen amount while burning liquid fuel and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf radial intakes are needed, a radial intake body part that allows to use the air provided by them would be an idea to make them compatible with the new system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine construction begins with a combustion chamber: it determins the radius of the engine (if we get engines of different diameters) as well as its type (Turbojet, Ramjet or Scramjet - each with different behavoiur in different altitudes / at different velocities). (nearly) all combustion chambers need their intake air compressed, and if the engine temperature gets too high precoolers would finally have an effect worth the name \u0027precooler\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadditional parts allowing a wide variety of engines would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-afterburners\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-oxidizer injectors (quite self-explainatory)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-thrust vectoring nozzles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that this system may be quite complicated, but KSP itself also requires some explaining, and as tutorials are already planned and the description system present in SPH/VAB can help a lot, And for beginners some basic example engines should allow them to get used to the engine system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Engines are to be built seperately, allowing a testing function where you can test engines in a pressure tunnel would also be an Idea to help people build the engine they need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really appreciate hearing your opinion about this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHector\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S4qFBxkFFg","CreatedById":83727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T19:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI definitely think the air-breathing jet engines could be improved, and made a thread about it: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72881-Changing-the-way-air-breathing-jet-engines-are-constructed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72881-Changing-the-way-air-breathing-jet-engines-are-constructed\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be perfectly happy with something more like you described, but maybe that\u0027s too complex?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T06:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI completely agree with you in principle.
