In my little diagram the planet is the green blob and your ship is leaving the atmosphere at point A on the red path. No matter how much fuel you burn at point A, your orbit will always come back around to that low point at A. (Experts on this stuff: I know I\\\u0027m cutting corners on the explanation, but I\\\u0027m trying to keep it simple and clear.) Burning fuel at A does, however, raise the altitude of point B. Later when you get to point B, again you can\\\u0027t change its altitude from there, but burning fuel there will raise the altitude of point A, putting you on the yellow path. So reaching orbit always requires 2 burns: one to reach altitude, and one to keep you at that height. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this isn\\\u0027t your issue, sorry if I sound like a know-it-all.
