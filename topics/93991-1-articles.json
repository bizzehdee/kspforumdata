When I go to launch, none of the default controls work and the craft will not even start. When I return to the hangar and select Launch again, I get a message that there are no manned or un-manned control modules and that the craft will not be controllable. If I select the second tutorial that talks about pitch, roll and throttle, those do not work and the final button \u0022Set thrust to max\u0022 is grayed out. The tutorial window also does not have an \u0027X\u0027 to close it with, as the professor tells me to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENon-Steam version, previous working copy was over 2 years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T21:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you have crew, there is a crew tab at the top where you can put crew into the pod, though you may have found a way to break the tutorial if you deleted your first pod and chose another.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
