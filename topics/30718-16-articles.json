Sorry folks - for various reasons I ended up working on more than one chapter in parallel - and it was the next but one chapter that got finished first. Not a great plan for keeping a steady pace of updates but on the plus side there\u0027s a lot of new stuff coming right up, starting with where we left off with James and Sherfel aboard \u003Cem\u003EEndurance.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo without further ado.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDocking - Part II.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat kind of a problem, Sherf?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe boost cover over PV-B is stuck. Looks like the bolts fired but one of the dampers is only halfway open. Seems that\u0027s enough to trigger panel deployment though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames swore under his breath. \u201CWell at least that explains some of these warning lights,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CHow much panel can you see?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot much from this angle,\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel, \u201Cbut enough to see that it\u0027s trying to unfold. Looks like all six sub-panels have started to separate cleanly anyway, which is something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI guess,\u0022\u00A0said James, \u201CYou\u0027d best get back through here, Sherf. We\u0027ll both need to be on the loop with Mission Control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat have you got for me, CapSys?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mission Control room was crowded with kerbals. Nelton could barely hear herself think over the babble of controllers conferring with their teams and calling suggestions to each other across the room. Both shifts of controllers were huddled around their respective consoles, Hanbal and Danfen stood behind Nelton\u0027s console and Joebal, head of electrical and environmental systems was standing at the CapSys console, conferring with the systems team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObler looked up. \u201CWe need to shut down the...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CQuiet at the consoles!\u0022\u00A0Nelton shouted. The room fell silent. \u201CSay again, CapSys.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe need to shut down the power to the PV array motors before they burn out, Flight,\u0022\u00A0said Obler. \u201CThen we can work on freeing PV-B.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPV array motors, CapSys - not PV-\u003Cem\u003EA\u003C/em\u003E array \u003Cem\u003Emotor\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s correct, Flight,\u0022\u00A0said Obler. \u201CBoth sets of motors are powered from a common circuit, so unfortunately we don\u0027t have any way of leaving the PV-A steering online if we shut off PV-B. Not without re-routing most of the power network anyway.\u00A0He coughed. \u201CWe might want to change that design in future.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe can worry about that later,\u0022\u00A0said Nelton. \u201CRight now I need a shutdown procedure for the array motors - then I need numbers for the reserve batteries. Then I need options for PV-B.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTell the crew to toggle PVM 1 and PVM 2 to OFF, Flight. That\u0027ll disable the primary and backup power supplies. Reserve batteries are good for three orbits with all systems powered up. I\u0027ll have my team pull out the time limits at current draw levels but we do have time to work this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, CapSys. Options for PV-B?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwo options, Flight. EVA to release the boost cover manually, or we can try applying transient loads with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and hope we jerk it loose that way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton nodded. \u201CCapSys, Telco - I\u0027m going to need an EVA plan. Flight Dynamics - we\u0027re going for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E solution first so I need a run-through. Can we do this without breaking anything else?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s affirmative, Flight,\u0022\u00A0replied Lemgan. \u201CToo little force is going to be our problem here rather than too much.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Flight Dynamics. Just do what you can.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames tapped the controls and watched the rate indicators drop to zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRates nulled,\u0022\u00A0he reported. \u201CStill nothing happening with PV-B. Hope you\u0027ve got another plan, Flight because we\u0027ve spun this ship every which way now and this is just not working.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe concur,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 said Nelton. \u201CWe think it\u0027s time you took a little walk.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s about what Sherf and I were thinking too, Flight. So what\u0027s the plan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCapSys has the procedure,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E. Stand by.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two kerbonauts listened wordlessly to the stream of instructions from Mission Control. James muted the radio link and turned to Sherfel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s the best they can come up with? We spend Kerm knows how much on this temple to technology and they want me to go outside and poke it with a stick?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel shrugged. \u201CIt\u0027s not ideal but I can\u0027t think of anything else to do - can you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u0022\u00A0said James heavily, \u201Cnot really.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLook on the bright side,\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel, \u201Cpoking things with a stick is a long and noble engineering tradition. But you\u0027ll be the first to do it in space.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames scowled at her and clicked his microphone on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, Flight. We have the flight plan and we\u0027re suiting up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames peered down into \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s cockpit one last time. Sherfel scanned the instrument panel, tugged on the umbilical and then tipped her head up to face him. He could see her nod inside her helmet. She clasped his calf for luck - not that he could feel anything through the layers of insulation - before giving him a solemn thumbs-up. He reached up over his head, took a firm grip on the edge of the hatch and slowly pulled himself out of the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe immediately sensed the blue glow pouring through the top of his visor but kept his gaze resolutely fixed on \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s hull. Carefully, he worked his hands around the hatch rim, grabbed hold of the nearest handrail and made his way slowly down the spacecraft, hand over hand, until his boots were level with the first pair of foot loops. Blinking the sweat out of his eyes, he swung his body sideways from the ladder, hooked his boots into their restraints and straightened up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole of Kerbin hung over his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpellbound, James stared up at the azure expanse of Great Tranquil Sea. A scattering of islands off the coast glowed jewel-like in the sun, girded all about with the rich turquoise of shallower water. The Kolus coastline itself was picked out in a thousand shades of green and brown and fringed with shining white sand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJames?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m here, Sherf,\u0022\u00A0he said softly. He tore his gaze away from his homeworld and cast his mind over the checklist. Suit systems were looking good, no kinks in the umbilical, suit to ship comms loop was working. \u003Cem\u003ETime to get this done.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, time to go to work. Patch me into Mission Control please, Sherf.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPatching you in now, James.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis headphones crackled. \u201CDo you read me, EVA-1?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLoud and clear, Flight,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CI\u0027m out of the capsule and heading aft towards the busybox.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, EVA-1,\u0022\u00A0said Nelton. \u201CHow\u0027s the suit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHard work, Flight,\u0022\u00A0said James. \u201CRange of movement is acceptable but maintaining joint flexion is tough, especially in the gloves. Suggest we add a wrist and hand exercise regime to the flight training.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNoted, EVA-1.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, Flight, I\u0027m passing the first set of windows on the hab module.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, EVA-1. The busybox should be aft and left as you face the hull.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI see it, Flight. Moving off the main ladder. A little more umbilical please, Sherf.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames\u0027 boots rebounded off the hull and he cursed under his breath as the abrupt change in momentum swung his torso away from the ship, threatening to tear him free of the ladder. Straining against the stiff fabric of his spacesuit, he shook his head to clear the sweat from his eyes, clenched his hands around the ladder rung and twisted. By the time he\u0027d brought the unwanted rotation under control his wrists were aching with the strain and he was panting hard inside the confines of his helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton watched in alarm from the Mission Control room as the readouts for James\u0027 heartbeat and temperature spiked upwards. His increasingly laboured breathing filled her headset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSecure yourself and take five, EVA-1,\u0022\u00A0she ordered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy...that... Flight,\u0022 came the halting reply. \u201CLet me just....okay... got the foot loop. Sherf - could you turn up my air supply for a moment please - need to demist my helmet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cool air blowing through his helmet slowly cleared the fog from his visor. James wedged both boots firmly into a foot loop and hung against the ladder, head swimming with a combination of stress and increased oxygen flow. \u003Cem\u003ESo much for the suave kerbonaut - here I am clinging to this thing like a spider on a tin can.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooking clearer now - thanks, Sherf. Air supply to nominal please and lets see if we have more luck with this box than we did with PV-B.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames inspected the busybox whilst the air washing over his face subsided to its usual comforting trickle. He leaned back to get a better view, glanced down to make sure his boots were properly secured and then cautiously took one hand off the ladder rung. \u003Cem\u003ESo far so good. Fingers in here... good thing they left plenty of space, think my gloves have expanded a bit in the vacuum. OK...squeeze and lift.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe box lid pivoted smoothly open. James automatically lifted his elbow to stop any free floating equipment from escaping but, somewhat to his surprise, everything was still safely clipped down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhoever stowed this gear did a good job, Flight. CapSys was right too, looks like the wrench is about the longest thing in here. Securing it to my belt now. Closing the lid... okay, Flight, EVA-1 confirms successful equipment transfer. Proceeding to PV-B shroud.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNice work, EVA-1. Copy you in progress to shroud.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wrench bumped against a ladder rung and began to swing back and forth, ricocheting between the ladder and James\u0027 leg. He was barely aware of the impact through his spacesuit padding, although the extra mass pivoting about his waist was an unwanted distraction. \u003Cem\u003EIgnore the damn wrench and keep going. Just take it easy around PV-B.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, Flight, I\u0027m in position. It\u0027s going to be a stretch but I can make this work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy, EVA-1. CapSys is asking whether you can get any closer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s a negative, Flight. Available foot restraints won\u0027t let me get any nearer from this angle.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, EVA-1.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTell CapSys that I have visual confirmation of bolt release but the damper is jammed. I\u0027m going to see if I can free up the joints some.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust go easy on the percussive maintenance, EVA-1.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames grinned inside his helmet. You had to dig deep sometimes but Flight had a sense of humour if you knew where to look. \u003Cem\u003EAnd on that note - initiating percussive maintenance. \u003C/em\u003E He wriggled his glove through the safety loop attached to the wrench handle and pulled the bulky tool free from his belt. Stretching forward as far as he could in his foot restraints, he reached out and gingerly tapped the damper mechanism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOkay that didn\u0027t do much. Maybe the centre pivot?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot even the thick, many layered fabric of his spacesuit arm could prevent James\u0027 hand trembling as he withdrew the wrench slightly and aimed it carefully at the pivot. \u003Cem\u003ENot enough wrist movement to give this a proper swing - probably just as well.\u003C/em\u003E Standing on tiptoes, boots barely in their restraints, he thrust the wrench delicately forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two levers sprang a little way apart before jamming again. James tapped the pivot one last time and hastily pulled the wrench back as the damper mechanism unfolded in a smooth mechanical ballet. The blue skies of Kerbin shone through the sudden gap between the open boost cover and the partially unfurled photovoltaic array.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, this is EVA-1 reporting PV-B cover clear!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe see it, EVA-1 - excellent work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe instant the cabin pressure warning light blinked off, James lifted his helmet off with a sigh of relief. Sherfel handed him a squeeze tube of sapwood juice and he took a long swallow of the sweet milky contents before handing it back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, Sherf. I needed that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet\u0027s see if this bucket of bolts was worth all the trouble,\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel. She stowed the squeeze tube and pushed off towards the lower hatch.

By radio however, the two ships were shining beacons sailing across the night sky. Fercan reflected that the Kerbin Interplanetary Society\u0027s fledgling space program had probably done more for Kerbin\u0027s amateur radio enthusiasts than any other single event in kerbal history. \u003Cem\u003EAlthough Ademone\u0027s crowd aren\u0027t doing a bad job either. The TV footage from inside their space station was incredible!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio began to crackle. Fercan caressed the fine tuning knob, eking out the last few seconds of transmission time before the signal faded into impenetrable static. Behind her, the pilot\u0027s voice dissolved into white noise too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E..py that B...kton. See y..... xt orbit. \u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFercan reached up behind her chair and clicked the secondary receiver off, fingertips unerringly finding the right button amidst all the paraphernalia crammed onto the narrow equipment racks that occupied most of the room. Fans whirred overhead, straining to expel the humid, ozone tinted fug inside Communication Room Number Three At times, Fercan swore she could almost \u003Cem\u003Esee\u003C/em\u003E the fresh outside air swirling in through the ventilation grilles. She frowned at the green trace still scribbling its way across the main display. \u003Cem\u003EHmm - second one isn\u0027t switching off it\u0027s telemetry either. Corvan will be happy though. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFercan tapped at her keyboard, instructing the computer to save the incoming telemetry into a new file, before blanking the scribble from the main display and calling up the extended tracking data from the radio telescope. \u003Cem\u003EOkay, lets cross-check the frequency shift data.\u003C/em\u003E Numbers blurred up the screen. \u003Cem\u003EPoint oh one three delta. Hmmm.\u003C/em\u003E Her fingers flew over the keys. \u003Cem\u003EKeep the telescope tracking data in the primary buffer, store telemetry in secondary buffer... extract channel data into new file...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time the telemetry feed faded into background noise, Fercan was reasonably confident in her predicted trajectory for the second spacecraft. She pulled on her headset, leaned forward and clicked the quick dial button for Beta station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA familiar Spierkan brogue filled her ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Beta station here. Tracking and comms.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hi Corvan, Fercan here. I\u0027m tracking a second Moho - should be with you in fifteen minutes or so.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Another Moho?\u0022 said Corvan skeptically,\u0022You sure about that, Fercan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pretty sure,\u0022 she said, \u0022Telemetry streams look almost identical, orbit is more or less equatorial. Can\u0027t see where else it could have launched from other than Barkton and we\u0027d have heard something if they were launching anything bigger.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorvan whistled. \u0022Sounds like another Moho then. Their flight director must be doin\u0027 his nut trying to follow two flights together.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Either that or they\u0027ve scraped together two flight control teams,\u0022 said Fercan. \u0022Wouldn\u0027t want to fit both of them into that bunker though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Me neither,\u0022 agreed Corvan. \u0022By the way, don\u0027t suppose yeh got a recording of that telemetry?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFercan rolled her eyes. \u0022\u003Cem\u003EYes\u003C/em\u003E I got a recording. Here - file\u0027s on it\u0027s way now. Luckily for you, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E seem to broadcast their telemetry to whoever\u0027s listening.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No reason not to,\u0022 said Corvan. \u0022Not like anyone can do anything with it and I\u0027m not thinking the pilots can be bothered switchin\u0027 it on and off as they go. Hey, Fercan - how much do yeh reckon a Moho weighs?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFercan blinked. \u0022How in the... how should I know, Corvan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No reason,\u0022 he said equably, \u0022Just trying to figure out how efficient their maneuvering rockets are. I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve untangled enough of their telemetry to pick up their propellant levels and I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027ve figured out which bits of the stream match up to burn times...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFercan interrupted him incredulously. \u0022Corvan - they\u0027re coming to \u003Cem\u003Evisit\u003C/em\u003E next month. If I ask them nicely, they\u0027ll probably tell me what every beep, burp and whistle in that data feed matches up to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And don\u0027t yeh dare spoil all the fun by sharing it with me, girlie!\u0022 Corvan chuckled at Fercan\u0027s patient sigh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As if I would, Corvan. Besides Sheldun and the rest of your gang would never forgive me for taking away their little puzzle.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorvan laughed, \u0022Nope - and you don\u0027t take Sheldun\u0027s puzzles away. Tis terrible to see a grown kerbal sulk like that. Yer file\u0027s here in one piece by the way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Should be plenty more coming your way in a couple of minutes,\u0022 replied Fercan. \u0022I\u0027ve got a couple of calibrations to run, so I\u0027ll let you enjoy it in peace.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Got it.\u0022 Corvan paused, \u0022What do yeh reckon they\u0027re doing up there, Fercan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Only one thing I can think of,\u0022 said Fercan, \u0022and that\u0027s an orbital rendezvous.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Makes sense,\u0022 said Corvan slowly, \u0022Now that Rockomax have done it, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E won\u0027t want to drop too far behind. You say they\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E coming to Alpha next month?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As far as I know,\u0022 said Fercan. \u0022You planning to take a bet on them both joining Lodan\u0027s scheme?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Och I never bet against a certainty,\u0022 said Corvan, \u0022Specially now they\u0027re both working on rendezvous and \u003Cem\u003Especially\u003C/em\u003E now that Rockomax have got a decent sized crew cabin in orbit.\u0022 He paused. \u0022To be honest, I couldn\u0027t see either of them doing much more than orbitin\u0027 Kerbin with their one or two kerbal capsules. But if they can start \u003Cem\u003Ejoining\u003C/em\u003E stuff to the capsules in orbit - well I reckon things are about ter get a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E more interesting. Ahh - sounds like that second Moho is comin\u0027 into range! Speak soon, Fercan!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flickering light on Joemy\u0027s control board brightened into a reassuring green glow as the rendezvous radar found it\u0027s target. The flight computer beeped and it\u0027s screen lit up with range and bearing data. Joemy glanced at the tiny display, nodded and toggled his microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flight, Moho 6. Radar is locked on and I have a good transponder return. Moho 5 dead ahead, range three two dot five kilometres, closing speed negligible.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that, Moho 6,\u0022 replied Geneney, \u0022Five Team confirms lock on to you, range three two dot five. You are Go for computer check.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Checking now, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight computer keypad was enormously simplified in comparison to a standard general purpose keyboard but it was sufficient for the task of flying and navigating a spacecraft. Privately, Joemy preferred it that way although he knew that not all the engineers back at Barkton shared his opinion. As a pilot though, fewer buttons to worry about was just fine with him, provided that they were enough for the job. He reached out and tapped in a manoeuvre request. The computer display blanked out and then produced a string of numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, Flight. Closing speed ten metres per second. Attitude and burn numbers are as follows.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney waited whilst Joemy read out the manoeuvre data. Bill and Edsen were both busy at the consoles next to him, entering the data and cross-checking it with their own tracking information. They both flashed him a quick thumbs up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Moho 6, Flight. Flight Dynamics confirms, Guidance confirms. You\u0027re Go for approach to holding point two.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Understood, Flight. Orienting for burn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney heard the distant thump of relays in his headset as Joemy fired his thrusters. Bill and Edsen watched their console screens intently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good burn, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flight, Moho 6. Approach burn complete, closing speed ten metres per second.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that, Moho 6. Please hold at five kilometres. We\u0027ll check over the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E telemetry on the next pass and get you set up for final approach. Three minutes to loss of signal - good luck.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney leaned back in his chair and toggled his headset over to his private channel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re on our way, Jeb. How\u0027s Richlin getting on with those cards?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Got the numbers right here, Genie. They look about right to me but I\u0027m no computer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney clenched his fist in triumph as Jeb read out the simulated burn data. \u0022I think we each owe Bill a bottle of Jorful\u0027s finest,\u0022 he said, \u0022Those are pretty much the exact numbers we got from Joemy\u0027s computer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Astronavigation by pen and paper,\u0022 replied Jeb, \u0022Still seems like a crazy way to run a space program, Genie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That it does,\u0022 said Geneney, \u0022but I\u0027m glad to have another backup option on board.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two spacecraft soared over the Great Tranquil Sea, flying a bare handful of kilometres apart. They were too close for the limited resolution of the main tracking screen and Geneney watched the single spacecraft icon drifting along its orbital track, flickering as the computer tried in vain to display both spacecraft at once. In cosmic terms Geneney knew the two ships were practically touching. In practical terms, they were still light years apart. The culminating moments of Project Moho were about to begin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Moho 6, Flight. Your telemetry is green and you are clear for final approach.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoemy\u0027s voice was steady in Geneney\u0027s headset. \u0022Copy that, Flight. Proceeding to one kilometre, maximum closing speed four metres per second.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney switched to his private channel. \u0022We\u0027re moving,\u00A0Jeb. Holding at one kilometre, max approach speed four metres per second.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gotcha, Genie. I\u0027ll have Richlin keep an eye out of the window.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoemy\u0027s eyes flickered in a constant loop from the radar display to the flight computer to the navball and back again. He could hardly resist the temptation to look out of the capsule window even though he knew it would be a waste of time at this range. \u003Cem\u003EJust focus on the instruments Joemy\u003C/em\u003E, he told himself, \u003Cem\u003Eno point trying to eyeball the manoeuvres either at this range.\u003C/em\u003E He toggled the air to ground loop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flight, Moho 6. Range two kilometres, closing speed two metres per second.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy, Moho 6. Any sign of Moho 5?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I haven\u0027t been looking, Flight but I doubt it at this range.\u0022 Joemy paused. \u0022Tell the truth, Flight, this orbital mechanics stuff takes some getting used to. Retrofire to speed up and all that good stuff. Right now I\u0027m just watching the instruments and trusting the maths.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s working so far, Joemy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s what the radar tells me, Flight. Okay, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to FINE, correcting residual plane alignment. Range one point eight and closing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichlin stared out of the window, scanning for any sign of an approaching spacecraft. He shook his head in disgust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m not seeing anything,\u00A0Flight. Radar has them holding steady at one zero two one metres - I should be seeing \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E by now but I just don\u0027t have visual contact.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Understood, Moho 5. I\u0027ll have Six Team put their capsule in a slow spin - give you some movement to track. Flight Dynamics also recommends a plus two degree yaw.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy, Flight.\u0022 Richlin nudged the thruster controls and the starscape outside drifted ever so slightly to one side. \u0022Still not seeing... hold that, Flight! Correction - I have an intermittent light source in the upper half of my window!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good work- and now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gone again, Flight - just one more star amongst thousands.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s one star that\u0027s going to get a lot closer, Richlin. Six Team reports Moho 6 on final approach!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking back at his first spaceflight, Richlin would always compare the last minutes of rendezvous to landing onboard an aircraft. The same sense of almost imperceptible change, without any true impression of changing scale, followed by an abrupt shift in perspective as the ground rises up to meet you and the sudden realisation of quite how close you really are to the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, the Moho 5 seemed to hang in space, slowly but surely swimming across the stars towards him. And then suddenly - it was there, with sunlight glinting from its windows and brief tongues of flames licking out from it\u0027s manoeuvering thrusters as it came to rest. One final burst of flame as the nose swung round to face him and then the unbelievable sight of Joemy waving at him through the capsule window. Two kerbonauts separated by nothing more than a few centimetres of bulkhead and a few metres of hard vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good to see you out there, Richlin. Thanks for waiting!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichlin\u0027s face split into a huge grin. \u0022Good to see you too Joemy. Thanks for not scratching my paint!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two spacecraft soared over the Great Tranquil Sea, now flying a bare handful of metres apart and their pilot\u0027s ears ringing with the sounds of celebration from Mission Control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo green figures stood on top of a makeshift concrete bunker and watched a pair of orange parachutes float serenely towards the waiting ocean. Geneney\u0027s thoughts floated too, drifting back to another pair of parachutes marking the safe return of Jeb, Bill and Bob. \u003Cem\u003EThirty five kilometres up - not even close to the edge of space. But it was enough. The launchpad for\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EKerbal 2\u003Cem\u003E. The crucial technological stepping stone for our satellites around Kerbin - and the M\u00FCn. The inspiration that set other kerbals on the road to the stars. And the prelude to Project Moho - kerbalkind\u0027s first true journeys into space.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs always Jeb seemed to sense his mood. \u0022Not bad for a bunch of volunteers working out of a junkyard, Genie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney smiled. \u0022Not bad at all, Jeb - not bad at all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stared out to sea. \u0022Still seems like a dream sometimes to tell the truth. Crazy, magnificent, but still a dream.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sometimes they\u0027re the best ones,\u0022 Geneney said gently, \u0022Don\u0027t stop yet old friend - we\u0027ve got a long way to go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked at him wryly. \u0022I like it when the money guy tells me to keep dreaming. Seriously though, Genie - its gonna take more than that to get\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E into orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneneys eyes shone. \u0022We\u0027ll get there, Jeb.\u0022 He swept his arm out, flicking his fingers at the Space Centre buildings around them. \u0022With the team we\u0027ve got now, I honestly don\u0027t think there\u0027s much we \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E do if we decide to give it a try!\u0022 He grinned. \u0022We\u0027ll get that last picture for your office yet, my friend - just you wait!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-family:Roboto, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=1015003\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E Chapter 28\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-family:Roboto, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=1034361\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 30\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-family:Roboto, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-14T07:00:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2019 07:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T18:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThe Cords that Bind\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gene - where in my mother\u0027s Grove \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E we?\u0022 said Jeb. He switched off the motor, breathing heavily as he stared out at the dusty white rope, marking the boundary between road and roadside. \u0022I have no idea where this blighted stretch of hardpack is taking us but I am \u003Cem\u003Econspicuously\u003C/em\u003E failing to spot so much as a gronnek-biting road sign, let alone a state of the art tracking, research and general wonderfulness centre.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney fought to keep the irritation out of his voice. \u0022You tell me, Jeb,\u0022 he said, \u0022Last turning but one according to the map - like I said at the time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb growled. \u0022First order of business at this meeting is to politely find out why a damned \u003Cem\u003E space\u003C/em\u003E agency can\u0027t find anyone to draw up a decent map. For Kerm\u0027s sake, a \u0027facility for all of Kerbin\u0027 and they hide it halfway up a mountain and give us a kerblet\u0027s treasure map to find it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So you\u0027ve already said - many, many times already,\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe that\u0027s the first test,\u0022 said Neling cheerfully, \u0022A place at the table but only if you\u0027re smart enough to find it first.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked over his shoulder. \u0022Perhaps,\u0022 he said through gritted teeth, \u0022they should lead by example by being smart enough to put up a snake kissing \u003Cem\u003Esignpost.\u003C/em\u003E to their precious table.\u0022 He grabbed his water bottle from under the dashboard and took a swallow, grimacing at the lukewarm, faintly metallic taste.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory knocked her head against the window. \u0022Look,\u0022 she said, \u0022why don\u0027t we turn around, go back and at least have a look up one of those turnings. I\u0027m with Jeb - this way is taking us nowhere.

You don\u0027t build a space centre with spades, dust and bad language. Whatever road we\u0027re looking for has to be big enough to get a good sized truck up at the very least.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Last but two then you think?\u0022 said Geneney.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Only one that looked likely,\u0022 said Ribory, \u0022unless we\u0027re even more lost than I thought.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We could well be,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney. \u201Cbut that\u0027s good enough for me. Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s only reply was to start the motor and jab the accelerator. The little car bumped awkwardly over the marker rope and shot off in a cloud of dust and flying gravel, leaving the high pitched whine of an overstressed drive train hanging in the air behind them as they rounded a bend and disappeared out of sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Should be about another hundred or so metres after the corner, Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded and eased back on the accelerator, searching the road ahead for the first sign of turning. \u0022Okay - I see it, Genie. Still not convinced but we\u0027ll give it a try.\u0022 He slowed the car to a walking pace and cut across the road, trying not to wince at the sharp jolt of wheel hitting pothole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stop the car!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStartled, Jeb automatically slammed on the brakes. Ribory threw the door open and dashed over to the side of the road. Geneney blinked as she bent down to pick something up out of the gravel and then his face split into a cheerful grin as she waved a dusty, weatherbeaten but above all, \u003Cem\u003Esignpost\u003C/em\u003E shaped piece of wood over her head. All three kerbals caught a glimpse of a faded image of Kerbol rising over a curved horizon with the letters KSA emblazoned underneath. Ribory propped the signpost against a nearby rock, hopped back into her seat and slammed the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let\u0027s go!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo kilometres later the rapidly improving mood inside the car became positively cheerful as they swung around yet another shallow bend and came face to face with as convincing a collection of roadbuilding machinery as Jeb had ever seen. The construction crew waved at them enthusiastically from their vehicles as Jeb bumped over a ragged asphalt apron and onto the road proper. Ribory and Neling leaned out of the rear windows and waved back at the yellow-hatted kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks, Ribory,\u0022 said Jeb, \u0022Should have had you in the front here instead of, Genie!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney shrugged. \u0022What\u0027s a kerbal supposed to do with a map like this?\u0022 he said equably. \u0022Especially when it looks like a gronnek \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E been chewing on their signpost.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s laugh was cut short by Neling\u0027s excited cry. \u0022Look - over there on the hill!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney whistled as he spotted it. \u0022Now \u003Cem\u003E that\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E what I call a radio telescope. What do you reckon, Ribory?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I reckon that\u0027s one beast of a tracking system, Gene,\u0022 said Ribory, \u0022Probably long range comms as well.

I think you\u0027re right, Gene - nobody builds something like that on the off-chance that it \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E be used.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Works for me,\u0022 said Jeb, \u0022I\u0027m more than happy to fly stuff to the M\u00FCn if they\u0027re happy to keep paying good money and sharing good data for the privilege.\u0022 He slowed down as they approached a pair of bollards blocking their way and blinked as they sank smoothly into the road. \u0022And they certainly seem to have plenty of good money.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking around, Geneney was inclined to agree. The radio telescope sat atop the hillside, surrounded by well cared for lawns that were artfully dotted with trees and clusters of outbuildings, all sprout profusions of radio antennas and other communication equipment.The main roadway led up to a generous parking space in front of a large, elegantly proportioned building. Two wings swept out from a central portico, one adorned with the flag of all Kerbin fluttering from a tall cream coloured pole and the other flying the same Kerbol-over-the-horizon emblem that he remembered from the fallen signpost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb pulled up in the nearest parking space with a creak of brakes and a rumble of wheels over close set paving blocks. He pressed a button on the dashboard and the steady persistent hum of the motor died away. The four kerbals looked at each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well,\u0022 said Jeb, \u0022we\u0027re here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Here just in time too,\u0022 said Geneney ruefully, \u0022although I could do with a moment to unwind before the meeting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeling bent over with a muffled groan and rummaged around between her feet, emerging with a plastic box. \u0022No idea how cold these are any more,\u0022 she said, popping the lid off the box and handing round a set of wet flannels, \u0022but they might help a bit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb wrapped a flannel around his neck and sighed as the cool dampness trickled down his back. He mopped his face briskly and wadded up the now less than pristine cloth, dropping it into the proffered box with a grin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s the second time you\u0027ve kept me cool in a crisis.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeling laughed and opened her door. All four kerbals sniffed happily at the herb-laden scent of fresh mountain air. Geneney\u0027s back popped as he stretched. \u0022Fresh air, cold water on the neck - you havn\u0027t got any coffee back there have you, Neling?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fraid not, Gene.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not a problem,\u0022 said Jeb cheerfully, \u0022You did say this place was for research?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded. \u0022It\u0027s kind of an all purpose research centre, HQ and tracking station.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They\u0027ll have coffee then,\u0022 said Jeb, \u0022Rule 1 of science - where you get scientists, you get coffee. The place probably runs on the stuff.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In that case,\u0022 Geneney said firmly, \u0022I think I\u0027m about fit to be seen in public again. Let\u0027s go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGolden afternoon sunlight poured in through the skylights, casting a lambent glow over the foyer as Jeb led the way through the main entrance and strode up to the reception desk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good afternoon. We\u0027re here to see Director Lodan.\u0022 He stuck out a hand. \u0022Jeb Kerman, Kerbin Interplanetary Society. Here with my colleagues; Geneney, Neling and Ribory Kerman?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first receptionist visibly pulled himself together. \u0022Uh, of course, sir. K-kerbin Interplanetary Society. I have your name badges here. Yes, yes, Jebediah, Geneney, Neling, Ribory.\u0022 The box rattled in his hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked puzzled. \u0022Is everything all right?\u0022 he asked, \u0022We have got the right date yes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh yes, sir. It\u0027s just, just we never...\u0022 The receptionist lunged beneath his desk, surfacing with a tube of paper which he hastily unrolled. Jeb was astonished to see a poster of Geneney, Wernher and Lucan standing in front of the salvaged \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E. He dragged his attention back to the receptionist\u0027s nervous chatter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Couldn\u0027t get one of the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E. Tried to - for my boy you know - but they\u0027d, you\u0027d that is, sold out. But a signed poster ... that would just make his birthday.\u0022 He thrust his pen into Jeb\u0027s hand and looked at him hopefully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned. \u0022What\u0027s your lad\u0027s name?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, Bobney. He\u0027s a real \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E fan you know. Actually, he\u0027s more of an all over spaceflight fan. Anything to do with rockets or kerbonauts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb thought for a moment, then quickly wrote something on the poster and signed his name with a flourish. He gestured to the rest of the team waiting behind him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You lot want to sign this as well?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory smiled at the receptionist. \u0022Sure, why not.\u0022 She looked over Jeb\u0027s shoulder. \u0022Hmmm, \u0027To Bobney - See you out there some day! Your friends, Jeb....\u0027. Not bad,\u00A0Jeb!\u0022 She took the pen and signed her name underneath Jeb\u0027s, where it was rapidly joined by Geneney\u0027s and Neling\u0027s signatures. With a faraway look in his eyes, the receptionist stared at his newly signed poster and then rolled it up, taking great care only to handle it by its edges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment there was silence. Jeb coughed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So - where should we find Director Lodan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe receptionist blinked. \u0022Director Lodan? Oh of course. The meeting room is in the south wing. Just down that corridor there, you can\u0027t miss it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks,\u0022 said Jeb, \u0022and a happy birthday to Bobney when it arrives.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh it will be now, sir - it will be now!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E team were safely out of earshot, the second receptionist turned to her colleague and raised her eyebrows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So congratulations are in order then, Bob? Good thing you\u0027re not the superstitious type - giving your son your own name and all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory eyed the rack of laboratory coats. \u0022You guys reckon we need one of these?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe later if we get a proper tour,\u0022 said Neling. \u0022I\u0027m not going to bother for now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney tore his gaze away from one of the posters adorning the corridor walls. \u201CMe neither,\u0022 he agreed, \u0022but if this summary is anything to go by, I\u0027d love to get a look through that door. Anyone got any idea what MIR stands for?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not a clue,\u0022 said Jeb, \u0022and I\u0027m not feeling LOST yet either.\u0022 He gestured down the corridor. \u0022Space Radiation Laboratory seems pretty obvious though. Come on - l...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe door to the MIR lab flew open and a small bespectacled kerbal dashed out, narrowly missing Jeb. She blinked at the newcomers and then her eyes widened. Stammering an apology she bolted back through the open door and slammed it behind her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney laughed. \u0022Losing your touch there, Jeb,\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Getting a chance to say something would have been a start,\u0022 said Jeb. \u0022Anyway, as I was saying - let\u0027s go find this meeting room.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they walked down the corridor, the four kerbals heard door after door opening around them, together with snatches of whispered conversation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No - Jeb the janitor. Of course I mean \u0027that Jeb\u0027, sponge-brains...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...recognise, Geneney too. Wow...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t know either of the ladies but I\u0027d sure like to...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh that was classy, Lim...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah - you should apply to Rockomax. I hear they\u0027re looking for someone to grit-blast...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lim\u0027s so smooth he wouldn\u0027t even need the grit...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where have you been people - that\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ENeling\u003C/em\u003E...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNeling?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeh, the controller that saved Jeb\u0027s ... on the Moho 1...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory bit her lip, shoulders quaking as she tried not to laugh. Neling stared at the floor, flushing dark green as Geneney clapped her on the back. Meanwhile, Jeb was in his element, waving at the rapidly building crowd, offering a quick word here, a bright grin there and even shaking hands with one or two of the bolder scientists. A tentative handclap rapidly turned into enthusiastic applause and then became a standing ovation from the dozens of kerbals crammed into the corridor behind them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe door closed with a soft thud, cutting out the commotion behind them. The group sitting around the large round table in front of them stood up politely although some of them looked rather bemused by all the noise. A grey eyed, balding kerbal stepped forward to greet them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E team I presume? It seems a little superfluous after your... enthusiastic reception but nevertheless - welcome to the Kerbin Space Agency.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shook his hand vigorously. \u0022Pleased to meet you - Director?\u0022 Lodan dipped his head and Jeb looked relieved. \u0022This is Geneney, our flight director and head of systems integration, Neling, flight control, guidance and electronics and Ribory, flight control and spacecraft systems. I\u0027m Jeb and I help fill in the gaps around the rest of the team.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan looked momentarily confused at Neling\u0027s name. \u0022Forgive me but I was expecting another member of your team - Bill I believe?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ahh - allow me to present Bill\u0027s apologies, Director. I\u0027m afraid he was needed to oversee the final equipment installation and checkout of our next spacecraft. We had hoped to have that finished in time for the meeting but...\u0022 Jeb looked apologetic, \u0022unfortunately it all took a little longer than expected.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the kerbals around the table stepped forward and shook Neling\u0027s hand. \u201CNelton. Flight Director and head of crew operations at Rockomax. Just wanted to say that was a solid job with the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 1\u003C/em\u003E!\u0022 She turned to Lodan. \u201CI\u0027m sure Neling will be a perfectly competent stand in, Director.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan coughed. \u201CI think we can take \u003Cem\u003Ecompetence\u003C/em\u003E as a given in this room,\u0022 he said dryly. \u201CPerhaps we could finish the introductions and make a start?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tall, female kerbal in an elegantly fitted suit came forward and shook Jeb\u0027s hand. \u201CAdemone - founder and company manager of Rockomax Corporation. You\u0027ve met Nelton already but allow me to introduce Joebal, our head of electrical and environmental systems and Professor Melvey, flight control, spacecraft systems and...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDiscoverer of the Melvey Radiation Belts,\u0022 said Jeb with a smile, \u201CPleased to meet you all and it\u0027s an honour to meet you in person, Professor.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd likewise to meet you, Jebediah,\u0022\u00A0said Melvey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb opened his mouth but was interrupted by Lodan. \u201CAnd I\u0027m here as Director of the KSA, alongside my colleague Fercan - our chief telecommunication and systems engineer. Please take your seats everyone.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone sat down amidst a general fussing with water glasses and shuffling of notes. Lodan tapped the table for attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood Kerbals, we are here today to discuss opportunities for mutual benefit and cooperation between the Kerbin Space Agency, Rockomax Corporation and the Kerbin Interplanetary Society. Specifically, we are here to discuss the creation of a Kerbin wide tracking, data and communications network to support future spaceflight efforts. It is my fervent hope that we can create a global resource that avoids unnecessary duplication and waste, whilst providing common facilities for the common good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan took a sip of water. \u201CIt is our equally fervent hope that by pooling our expertise with that of Kerbin\u0027s two spaceflight pioneers, we can define the data exchange protocols necessary to make that global network work and that those protocols will then become the de-facto standards for any new entrants onto the spaceflight stage. I therefore call upon the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E to start the discussion off by presenting an overview of their current systems.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory stood up. \u201CGood afternoon, everyone. I\u0027d like to start by giving you a \u0027console side\u0027 view of our systems from a flight controller\u0027s perspective. At present we have two tracking and communication sites, our main facility at Barkton and a second smaller station at Wakira. Our primary communication links are...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time Ribory finished her presentation, Geneney thought he had a good idea of where the differences between the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and Rockomax systems were. \u003Cem\u003EAssuming that I\u0027m reading the body language right. A lot of our stuff didn\u0027t seem to surprise them much but I think we\u0027re going to have some interesting discussions ahead of us on some points.\u003C/em\u003E By the time Nelton finished her overview for Rockomax, most of his ideas were confirmed. \u003Cem\u003EOkay, I think we can deal with most of the technical details but smoothing out two sets of procedures is going to take some work. I wonder who\u0027s going to get that job.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and Rockomax teams listened intently to Fercan\u0027s presentation on the KSA tracking systems and the communication links between their three main sites. By the time she finished, Geneney\u0027s mind was quite made up. He glanced across the table at Jeb and wasn\u0027t surprised to see him nodding slowly to himself. \u003Cem\u003ELooks like I\u0027m not going to get any arguments from Jeb either. He\u0027s not big on working with the government but he can see sense when it\u0027s written in big enough letters. Be interesting to see if Rockomax are reading those letters too.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe discussion moved on to a general brainstorming session and it wasn\u0027t long before Geneney noticed both Jeb and Ademone subtly siding with Lodan on some issues and equally subtly steering the discussion away from a KSA agenda on other issues. More importantly he quickly noticed the two company managers quietly backing each other up on various items whilst offering carefully phrased suggestions to defuse the more heated areas of contention or set them aside for later talks. Geneney rested his chin on one hand, carefully concealing a smile. \u003Cem\u003EYou two would make quite the politicians, although I doubt either of you would thank me for saying it. Looks like you are both reading the same letters.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt long last, Lodan tapped on the table again. \u201CThank you everyone. Lets take a break and reconvene in twenty minutes. There\u0027s coffee and drinks in the next room and the washrooms are just down the main corridor outside.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a general surge in the direction of the drinks. Geneney set aside his wistful visions of steaming hot coffee urns and fell into step alongside Ademone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCould I have a word please, Ademone?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone stepped aside to let Melvey and Jeb past. \u201CBy all means, Geneney,\u0022\u00A0she said. \u201CWhat can I do for you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney waited until everyone had left the room before quietly closing the door behind them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone raised an eyebrow. \u0022A \u003Cem\u003Eprivate\u003C/em\u003E conversation, Geneney?\u0022\u00A0she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think that might be best for now,\u0022\u00A0\u00A0said Geneney, \u201CAt the very least, I\u0027d prefer to keep these... business proposals out of earshot of the good Director.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027re going to be working with the good Director,\u0022\u00A0Ademone pointed out. She smiled faintly at the carefully blank look on Geneney\u0027s face. \u00A0\u201CPlease don\u0027t bother telling me that comes as a surprise. I saw you watching Jebediah and myself at the meeting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe shrugged. \u201CI think it makes sense. We could certainly use the facilities and unless you\u0027re a lot further ahead than we think, I imagine that you could use them too. Incidentally - how are the \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E crew? They must be nearly ready to come home by now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey\u0027re doing very well thank you,\u0022\u00A0said Ademone, \u201Cbut come, Geneney - what are these business proposals that we need to keep secret from Lodan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney looked at her. \u201CWe\u0027ve got two...collaborative projects in mind,\u0022 he said. \u201CWe think the first one makes sense, in much the same way that Lodan\u0027s proposal makes sense. The second one is a little more speculative.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLets put the speculation to one side for now,\u0022\u00A0said Ademone. \u201CWhat does your first project involve?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb and I call it the CORDS programme,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney, \u201CShort for Common Orbital Rendezvous and Docking Systems, although I\u0027m sure the media won\u0027t miss the obvious jokes about tying Rockomax and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E together. I\u0027ll be blunt Ademone. We\u0027ve both worked out the details of orbital rendezvous, you\u0027ve developed systems for docking and that\u0027s probably going to be our next step too. Rather than charging off and building our own systems, why don\u0027t we both sit down together and hammer out a common set of standards that we can both use.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStandards, not designs?\u0022\u00A0said Ademone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot unless you want to share them too,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCommon standards would make sense,\u0022\u00A0Ademone conceded, \u201Cbut with respect Geneney, we\u0027re not ready to hand over our designs just yet.\u00A0She paused. \u201CI presume you\u0027re thinking about emergency options?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney, \u201CI think you know as well as I do that it\u0027s only a matter of time before \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E goes wrong for one of us up there. Speaking personally, I\u0027d feel a lot more comfortable having another rescue option - or the possibility of another rescue option at least.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAgreed,\u0022\u00A0said Ademone, \u201CI\u0027ll need to speak to my Board but I think they\u0027ll be amenable. So what\u0027s your speculative proposal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney took a deep breath. \u201CA joint Munar landing programme.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone\u0027s mouth quirked upwards and then froze at the look on Geneney\u0027s face. \u0022You\u0027re serious aren\u0027t you?\u0022\u00A0she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell then, allow me to be blunt in return, Geneney. What on Kerbin would Rockomax get out of such a ridiculous idea apart from the chance to spend a lot of money and take on a lot of extra risk?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you want the business reason or the other reason?\u0022 said Geneney calmly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone raised an eyebrow. \u0022There\u0027s a business reason?\u0022 she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We think so,\u0022 said Geneney. \u0022Confidentially, Probodyne have offered us a contract to put a second satellite in orbit around the M\u00FCn. We\u0027re not precisely sure what it\u0027s for but it\u0027s a lot bigger than the Muna 2. Based on the specs we\u0027ve been given for stability and control, Bill\u0027s best guess is that it\u0027s for detailed mapping of some kind.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Interesting,\u0022 said Ademone, \u0022but I\u0027m not sure I see your point.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well why bother with a detailed map unless you plan to do something with it?\u0022 said Geneney. \u0022I mean there\u0027s curiosity and scientific interest but another Muna 2 style probe would be enough for that. No - we\u0027re thinking that this could be the beginning of something much bigger - and probably something that will eventually involve putting hardware on the surface. Now we could do that ourselves given time but we could do it a lot faster in partnership with Rockomax. Fast enough to corner the market before anyone else gets a chance to even compete.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe leaned forward. \u0022Think about it, Ademone. We give Probodyne - and whoever is backing them - exactly what they want. No need for another Probodyne Prize when they can just use our ready to go Munar transportation system!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone looked thoughtful. \u0022Confidentially?\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course,\u0022 said Geneney.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ve been offered a contract too,\u0022 she said. \u0022Long duration \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E satellite for mapping the Melvey belts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They start quite far out don\u0027t they?\u0022 said Geneney. \u0022We sent up a couple of counters on the last Moho flights but didn\u0027t see much off-background.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Professor Melvey has the detailed numbers,\u0022 said Ademone, \u0022but yes they start well outside low Kerbin orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And even then, they didn\u0027t noticeably affect Satellite 4?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone grimaced. \u0022We don\u0027t think so. There was some lasting noise on the camera images but everything still seemed to be working when we got out to the M\u00FCn. We did wonder whether the guidance systems were damaged but Melvey thinks that any radiation strong enough to do that would have caused more damage to the cameras.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded. \u0022And without wishing to salt old wounds, we didn\u0027t have any major problems with the Muna 2. We might just have been lucky though - sneaked through a gap in the Belts or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Possibly,\u0022 said Ademone, \u0022but in that case we\u0027ve managed to sneak all our communication satellites through the same gap. No - the more I think about this, the more I\u0027m inclined to believe Nelton\u0027s theory.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Which is?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That we\u0027re being hired to check whether the Belts are...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Safe for crewed flights?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo pairs of eyes met across the table. Ademone shook her head and leaned back in her chair. \u0022Anyway,\u0022 she said, \u0022What was your other reason?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney steeled himself. \u0022Because we can,\u0022 he said quietly. \u201CThe first kerbals to walk on another world, Ademone - and \u003Cem\u003Ewe\u003C/em\u003E would put them there. It could be the dawn of a new era or we may get to the M\u00FCn and never go back - it doesn\u0027t matter. What matters is that we \u003Cem\u003Etried\u003C/em\u003E. What matters is that future generations will be able to look back at a time when we dared the impossible, when we braved the unknown and journeyed to a realm beyond the dreams of kerbalkind!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe paused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAt a time when we were magnificent.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe soft applause from the doorway startled both kerbals. Geneney looked up and saw Jeb standing quietly in the corner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCouldn\u0027t have put that better myself, Genie. So what do you say, Ademone?

Beneath him, Joenie squatted on the lawn, tallking to herself and poking at something in the grass. Jonton couldn\u0027t see exactly what she was playing with but it certainly appeared to require a great deal of concentration, along with a large number of different coloured stones.

The village lights twinkled in the dusk and the first stars of the evening were just coming out over the tree tops. So far as he could tell, everything was perfectly normal - which was definitely at odds with the urgent call from the local Keeper. \u003Cem\u003ECorrection, \u003C/em\u003E thought Donman, \u003Cem\u003E the local Keeper\u0027s partner.

Donman\u0027s eyes watered at the sudden intense smell of Kerm leaves that gusted out from the doorway. Blinking furiously, he peered through the gloom, coughing as he tried to make out more details through his tears. He was dimly aware of a pair of luminous orbs floating amidst the great profusion of foliage around the base of the enormous Kerm trunk, Somehow they seemed almost ethereal in the muted dusk of the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman wiped his eyes and the room slowly swam into focus. Breathing deeply to calm himself, he glanced at the foliage and bit back a startled cry as the orbs resolved themselves into a pair of kerbal eyes. The rest of the kerbal was almost completely hidden by leaves and - to Donman\u0027s horror - roots that burst up from the ground and twined about its legs, binding it securely to the trunk. From his vantage point by the door, Donman couldn\u0027t see where the root tips went but at that moment he decided that he really didn\u0027t want to know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWelcome, Ambassador.

Whatever\u0027s happened in here, I\u0027m still standing next to a living kerbal.\u003C/em\u003E Then he shivered. The voice was almost as unsettling as its owner. It was oddly cultured in its way but echoed with hidden undercurrents that spoke directly to the darkest corners of his mind. The ones that it didn\u0027t normally pay to re-examine too closely, especially not in the half light before nightfall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen he realised. \u003Cem\u003EOld - it sounds very very old.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe frowned, \u201C\u003Cem\u003EWe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0are Jonton?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt would be easier to show than to tell. Please Ambassador - make yourself comfortable on our bed and join me. There is a great deal you must see.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe voice contained none of the usual deference that even a Keeper would normally show a chief Ambassador. Under the circumstances, Donman did not feel inclined to take issue with the lack of courtesy, nor to point out that sharing a Kerm would be a gross breach of etiquette and tradition. He looked over at Gerselle and was surprised to see the pleading in her eyes. Trying his best to control his sudden nausea, he lay back on the bed and braced himself. The leaves dipped towards his head and swiftly coiled around his temples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA torrent of incoherent images blazed though his mind, like an old fashioned film strip accelerated beyond the point of sanity. Sounds, smells and even textures cascaded through his brain, threatening to sweep his fragile consciousness away altogether. Distantly, he could feel the convulsions, the ligaments in his back stretching as he arched off the bed, throat clenching around a silent scream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMercifully the deluge began to subside. The odours of hot tin and cinnamon drifted away into the background, the chaotic shriek of sound faded into a rushing of wind through the branches and then into the faint rustling of leaves. The torrent of images slowed and swirled into blackness. His stunned mind latched onto the rustling sound, finding in it a precarious mental ledge to cling to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m sorry, Ambassador. Believe me I know what you\u0027ve just been through but there was simply no adequate way to prepare you.\u0022\u00A0Somehow the voice seemed much less threatening, almost apologetic. \u201CIf it\u0027s any consolation, it was far worse for us.\u0022\u00A0Jonton did his best to sound reassuring. \u201CHold on to the sound of the leaves, Ambassador. Hold on and watch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blackness faded into a grainy twilight grey shot through with streaks and whorls of washed out pastel colours. The colours coalesced into a faded image of a Kerm sapling surrounded by a group of kerbals. \u003Cem\u003EOr I don\u0027t see what else they can be. They\u0027re odd looking though - smallest heads of any kerbals I\u0027ve ever seen.\u003C/em\u003E. The grainy picture made it difficult to tell for certain but they also looked...coarser than most kerbals, with ragged, almost twiggy tufts of hair sprouting from their heads. With a shock, Donman noticed that the nearest figures to him were also carrying crude stone axes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy apologies for the picture quality Ambassador,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton, \u0022but as you\u0027ll have noticed, they \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E rather old. They\u0027re also filtered through the perceptions of one of the other kerbals in the group and unfortunately, at this point in history, those perceptions aren\u0027t terribly acute.\u0022\u00A0He paused. \u201CAlthough neither were ours for that matter.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman couldn\u0027t take his eyes off the axes. \u201CAre those really...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStone axes? Yes, Ambassador. Late Stone Age I believe, although you\u0027ll understand I hope, if our own memories are rather vague on that point.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYour \u003Cem\u003Ememories\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\u00A0said Donman in disbelief. \u201CThat\u0027s impossible!\u0022\u00A0He snorted in disgust. \u201CIf those are late Stone Age kerbals then that would make you...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMany thousands of years old.\u0022\u00A0Jonton said calmly. \u201CCome, Ambassador - this should come as no surprise. Have you never grafted a new cutting onto the stump of an old departed sire? It is true that all trees will pass on in time but properly cared for, the \u003Cem\u003EKerm\u003C/em\u003E will still endure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell yes, but not for thousands of years.\u0022\u00A0A thought struck Donman. \u201CBesides, if this is true, then why is it not common knowledge amongst the Keepers? Surely there are other Kerm as ancient as you claim to be?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere are - but even for us, memories this old are hard to retrieve. The only reason why this one is quite so clear is because it\u0027s rather personal. You see, Ambassador - \u003Cem\u003Ewe\u003C/em\u003E are that sapling you see before you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman frowned, \u201CYou keep referring to yourself as \u003Cem\u003Ewe\u003C/em\u003E. Am I speaking to Kerm or kerbal here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u0027s voice sounded strangely sad. \u201CI promise you that all will be revealed in time,\u0022 he said. \u0022In the meantime, welcome to the Kerbin of your far distant ancestors.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman recoiled from the series of grainy images flickering past his minds eye. A group of prehistoric kerbals curled up around the foot of a Kerm tree, all with their heads wrapped in a leaf cluster. The same group in pitched battles with other armed kerbals, leaving nothing but bloodied earth and mutilated corpses behind to rot amidst swathes of wilting and sickly vegetation. Worst of all, kerbals chopping down other Kerm trees, straining to uproot the stumps with their primitive tools and then planting something deep inside the scarred and muddy sockets left behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton sighed.\u00A0\u201CKerm and kerbals, both guided by little more than co-dependency and brute instinct. In a sense though, nothing important has changed over thousands of years. The Kerm still talk to us, they still provide us with food and shelter and still heal us when we are sick. And in return we spread their seeds for them as we have always done.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman was still trying to take it all in. \u201CBut why the fighting? Why the cutting down of other Kerm?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause in many ways Kerm are not so very different from any other plants or trees,\u0022 said Jonton. \u0022Almost all plants compete with other plants for space and nutrients and many of them rely on animals to distribute their seeds. The one \u003Cem\u003Ecrucial\u003C/em\u003E difference is that Kerm are sentient beings - and so too are their chosen seed carriers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flickering images slowed to a halt as Jonton went on talking. \u201CHowever a single Kerm tree by itself is barely sentient and at this point in history - or prehistory - our kerbals were only marginally more so. True, they were intelligent enough to use tools but they were still guided more by instinct and obedience to us than by any real awareness of the future.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a pregnant pause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt was not a pleasant combination,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton at last. \u201CKerm are intensely territorial and a new Kerm sapling was simply another competitor to defeat. In such an environment, the saplings are naturally highly aggressive - they must be in order to survive. The adult Kerm respond in kind and even worse, \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E constant struggle to survive triggers an instinctive response to reproduce as quickly as possible. The result was a vicious, unending cycle that only intensified with the steadily increasing intelligence of both Kerm and kerbal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA note of savage pride tinged Jonton\u0027s voice. \u201CBut \u003Cem\u003Ewe\u003C/em\u003E survived. Our roots were the more cunning and our kerbals were the stronger!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman swallowed. \u201CBut what happened? Something must have happened.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh yes,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton softly, \u201CSomething happened. Such a simple thing but it was enough to bring about the end of an era. Watch, Ambassador.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA new image swirled into place. A single kerbal stood by a stick, planted upright in the ground. In the distance, a young Kerm tree stood silhouetted against the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt doesn\u0027t look like very much does it, Ambassador? We\u0027ll probably never know why but a single kerbal decided to plant a stick in the ground and leave it. But that was the pivot on which the entire history of Kerm and kerbal turned. Indeed, it was the reason why there \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E such a history and why we\u0027re here today watching it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou see, Ambassador, Kerm are also like other trees in one vitally important way. Plant a cutting from one Kerm tree in the ground and in time, it will develop and grow into a new tree \u003Cem\u003Ethat is identical to its parent\u003C/em\u003E. And \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E is the crucial difference. The parent tree recognises the other as self - and rather than fight, the two trees join and become a single larger being.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton paused and his voice shifted subtly. \u201CWe weren\u0027t truly aware of the difference to begin with but I did know that it felt good. And because we knew it was good, my kerbals also knew that it was good and planted more cuttings in response. Dropped branches to begin with but later they grew quite adept at cutting off parts of us whilst causing the least amount of damage.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe images started moving again, although now they were much sharper and less grainy. Donman watched the kerbals plant their sticks and saw them grow. He saw the surrounding vegetation take on a more ordered aspect and watched the kerbals grow stronger and more numerous amidst the increasing harvests. As the generations flickered past before him, Donman saw the cuttings planted in many different arrangements and spacings until the kerbals found a pattern that would be familiar to any modern day Keeper. He also began to see an entirely different sort of pattern emerging. The kerbals would plant their cuttings, the cuttings would grow and then beyond a certain number they would abruptly die back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman had a sudden suspicion. As the next generations of planters paraded before his eyes, he made a careful count of the number of cuttings planted before the dieback. Suspicion crystallised into stunned certainty. Each and every time the number of cuttings exceeded thirty seven, everything seemed to go wrong. And as Donman well knew, thirty seven was the exact number prescribed in the Records for founding a new Grove.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was as if Jonton could read his mind. \u201CIndeed. The Records do set a limit of thirty seven - and for a very good reason, as I recently found out. His voice shook slightly. \u201CAs I mentioned, a Kerm is a collective organism Ambassador - a web of many trees. As each cutting grows it adds to that web and the whole organism develops greater intelligence, more complex feelings and instincts and much greater control over it\u0027s surroundings. However, even a full thirty-seven tree Kerm is not really self-aware in the kerbal sense. It has a great \u003Cem\u003Ebreadth\u003C/em\u003E of memory and experience but very little of the \u003Cem\u003Edepth\u003C/em\u003E necessary to develop a true conscious personality.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton paused. \u201CBut add another cutting and the Kerm crosses that final barrier - with disastrous consequences. You experienced a little of it yourself when you joined us. Now imagine an entire \u003Cem\u003Elifetime\u003C/em\u003E of sensations dropped into your mind in a single overpowering burst. You might barely be able to handle it but only because you\u0027ve had - literally - a lifetime of practice and a brain that has evolved for the task over hundreds of thousands of years! The Kerm has no chance at at all. At best it gets one brief moment of self awareness before its newly awakened personality shatters under the strain.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman was thunderstruck. Dimly he could hear Jonton\u0027s voice in the back of his mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGradually though, some of the kerbals learned. Slowly and painfully, they learned the Law of Thirty-Seven and finally they learned the Law of Territory and started planting their Kerm seeds far enough away from the older Kerm. And with that, the ancient cycle was finally broken.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot broken,\u0022\u00A0said Donman slowly, \u201Cso much as reversed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton smiled. \u201CIndeed. The new peace blunted the old instinct to reproduce at all costs, which led to fewer new Kerm, which helped to prolong the peace, which further blunted the urge to reproduce. It was far from an overnight change but within a relatively short span of generations, the modern pattern of dispersed, slow breeding Groves was well on the way to becoming established. It did help that a Grove of secure, well fed kerbals, with time on their hands to plan and build, tended to be more than a match for any that still held to the old ways.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe images began to shift again. Donman caught glimpses of crude fortifications, earthen walls and wooden palisades. The kerbals patrolling the the fortifications seemed to be rather better equipped too. Metal weapons and even pieces of armour began to make an appearance and quickly diversified into an inventive array of suitably lethal looking implements. To his surprise though, away from the walls, \u003Cem\u003Egroups\u003C/em\u003E of kerbals sat in communion with each tree of their Kerm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnfortunately, with peace came arrogance and overconfidence in their developing civilization. Many kerbal generations later, when the seeds started to drop again the memories of conflict had faded and the Law of Territory had been all but forgotten. Rather than setting forth to wage war on nearby Kerm, the kerbals decided to plant the seeds within their groves. To their credit, some of them did at least remember to uproot an older tree first but...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman interrupted. \u201CThey were not self?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CEven in those groves which enforced the Law of Thirty-Seven, the sudden introduction of a foreign Kerm caused chaos. For the Groves - such as ours - that did not remember, the result was tragedy. Rather than destroy the \u0027invader\u0027, we tried to assimilate it. It fought well but in the end, our thirty seven were able to subdue it. But then the thirty seven became thirty eight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman had a sudden awful premonition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBelieve me, Ambassador,\u0022 Jonton said quietly, \u201CThe pain you experienced joining with us today is \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E compared to the agony of a Shattering mind. But even that agony pales into insignificance at the searing realisation that you just Shattered yourself \u003Cem\u003Eby killing your one and only child.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis voice turned bitter. \u201CAs if that wasn\u0027t enough, the backlash from that realisation was enough to break the minds of our kerbals too. All of them that were communing with us went berserk. They couldn\u0027t be reasoned with because there was nothing left of them to reason with. The only thing left to do was to kill them. For the first time since the Breaking of the Cycle, kerbal was forced to murder kerbal in order to survive.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGradually Jonton regained a measure of control. \u201CThey did survive but at a terrible, terrible cost. By the end of the Age of Madness, the kerbal population had been cut in half and hundreds of verdant groves had been reduced to smouldering wasteland.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle watched fearfully as the body of the Ambassador twitched and thrashed on the bed. Suddenly his eyes snapped open revealing a face that was haunted and drawn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlease,\u00A0he croaked, \u201CPlease let me drink and rest a while.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSilently, Gerselle went through to the eating room and came back with an earthenware mug of water. Donman sipped at it slowly, gathering his resources. Then he put the empty mug to one side and with a look that was equal parts resignation and resolve, he lay back down on the bed and let the Kerm leaves wrap around his head again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven though he was better prepared the second time, union was still a wrenching, nerve shaking experience. The last of the explosions faded from behind his eyes, leaving him flailing helplessly in the darkness, with the sound of rustling leaves in his ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe leaves... focus on the leaves.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u0027s voice was sympathetic. \u201CWe\u0027re sorry, Ambassador,\u0022\u00A0he said.\u00A0\u201CI truly am. Believe me, this is a painful lesson for us also - and it\u0027s one we desperately need to master if we are to share these memories with others.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShow me something,\u0022\u00A0Donman pleaded, \u201CPlease. Anything for a distraction from this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pounding in his temples splintered into dozens of fractured knives which coalesced into a dull hammer beating at his skull. The whispering leaves became a susurration of kerbal voices flowing past him. Colours swirled before his eyes and resolved themselves into a picture of muddy streets and half finished clapboard buildings. The image lurched sideways and Donman felt a momentary sense of nausea that the clean salt air swiftly washed away. His viewpoint shifted upwards and he caught a glimpse of a slate grey sea, streaked with lacy white foam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere are we?\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA long way from home,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton, \u201Cat least for that Age. And the last journey our first Keeper took before returning to the Grove to take up his duties.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHold on, hold on,\u0022\u00A0said Donman, \u201Cyour \u003Cem\u003Efirst\u003C/em\u003E Keeper?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, Ambassador,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton. \u201CLet us see if we can... ahh.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe muddy streets and building sites vanished abruptly and were replaced by the more familiar vista of the early Grove, complete with walls, guards and....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGroups \u003Cem\u003Eof kerbals\u003C/em\u003E, thought Donman. \u003Cem\u003EA whole group communing with each tree.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton sounded pleased. \u201CThis seems to be getting a little easier,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CAnyhow - observe...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can see,\u0022\u00A0interrupted Donman, \u201CThere must be at least a hundred kerbals communing with... uh, with you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think so too,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton grimly, \u201Cand all of them doomed to insanity. That was a lesson that the kerbals learned all too well, Ambassador. A vocal minority advocated complete separation from us but even the more rational majority were scarred by the knowledge that communion with the Kerm bore a terrible terrible risk. Eventually, a handful of brave leaders volunteered to take that risk for their followers and from that day forward, they \u003Cem\u003Eand only they\u003C/em\u003E would commune with their Kerm. That tradition has remained unbroken ever since.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd says everything about the Age of Madness,\u0022\u00A0said Donman soberly. \u201CBad enough to scare us - us kerbals that is - into a tradition that\u0027s lasted for centuries. What happened to the separatists though? Did one of the new leaders take them in? That would be a pretty big gesture towards a group of miscreants that wanted nothing to do with the Kerm they volunteered to Keep.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe image of the Grove shimmered back to a view of muddy streets and half finished buildings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, Ambassador - they sought a new life here. I don\u0027t remember if any of the new leaders did volunteer to take them but it wouldn\u0027t have made any difference. After the carnage and the chaos of the Age of Madness, they were determined to build a new kerbal society. They called themselves the Kerm-an, which in the language of the time meant literally \u0027outside the Kerm\u0027 or \u0027outwith the Kerm.\u0027 And just in case that wasn\u0027t enough, they called their new capital Bar-Katon, which translates roughly to \u0027freedom from the forest.\u0027\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBarkton,\u0022\u00A0whispered Donman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton. He sighed. \u201CFor a place called \u0027freedom from the forest\u0027, they certainly used a lot of the forest to build it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey built well though,\u0022\u00A0said Donman. He frowned. \u201CAnd yet, modern day kerbals are all born in the Groves. What happened to the Kerm-an?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNothing happened to them,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton, \u201CCome now, Ambassador. Even today, a kerbal that chooses to live outside the Groves calls himself - or herself - a kerman, although as a practical matter, \u0027male\u0027 and \u0027female\u0027 are mere labels. You see Ambassador, just as we Kerm have evolved to be entirely dependant on our kerbals to disperse our seeds, so too are the kerbals dependant on us to disperse theirs.\u0022\u00A0He coughed, \u201CIn a manner of speaking.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sensed Donman\u0027s next question. \u201CAnd before you ask - no I don\u0027t know how. Some scent compound or other I expect - a kerman equipped with modern technology could probably work it out but all the original Kerm-an knew is that they couldn\u0027t bear children outside of the Groves.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnother historical tradition then,\u0022\u00A0muttered Donman, \u201Cand yet it works. Groves are good places to raise kerblets after all.

Some of them were more a sketch of an idea than anything else but they still made their point. \u003Cem\u003EA second hand memory perhaps?

A row of kerbals sat behind great desks, pens in hand and heads bent over heavy parchment scrolls. Jonton resumed his narrative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Kerm-an didn\u0027t give up easily though. If they couldn\u0027t live apart from the Kerm, they could at least warn future generations about the perils of associating with them. The first scrolls in the great Archive were... controversial... and apparently included rather more Kerm-an propaganda than was thought to be strictly helpful. To their credit though, the first Keepers eventually recognised the value of an accurate - and permanent - record of the Age of Madness and the errors in Grove Law that caused it. In time, they also became the repository of accepted Grove Law and all \u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E knowledge about the Kerm and their effect on the local plant and animal life.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C \u0027Controversial\u0027 is a favourite word of diplomats,\u0022\u00A0said Donman dryly. \u201CIt can cover so many situations.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFortunately,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton, \u201Cmemories of the Age of Madness were still too fresh for anyone to want to spill blood over it. My Keeper remembered a lot of shouting and hollow threats but very little of substance.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI imagine the possible loss of trade stopped things getting out of hand too,\u0022\u00A0said Donman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot really,\u0022\u00A0replied Jonton. \u201CIt helped a little but both communities were fairly self-reliant at this point in history. Trade was for exchanging luxuries rather than staples of life. However, the communities diverged over the next several generations - kerbal generations that is. Agriculture without Kerm support is \u003Cem\u003Ehard,\u003C/em\u003E Ambassador and eventually, even the most die-hard kerman found it much easier to trade for most of their food rather than grow it. Meanwhile, the Groves grew increasingly attached to the quality of life improvements that the kerman kept inventing. Our second Keeper was particularly fond of her new eyeglasses for example.\u0022 He sighed. \u201CShe was a good kerbal - worked hard to really embed the new ways in popular thinking.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd so our modern system arose,\u0022\u00A0said Donman wonderingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton, \u201CThe kerman of the time called it the Age of Prosperity. We don\u0027t have many memories to show you I\u0027m afraid Ambassador, because our Keepers only travelled so far. But believe us when we say that thanks to rigorous enforcement of Grove Law, Kerm, Grove and Kerman all flourished. It was about this time that Grove dwelling kerbals began to refer to themselves as Kerm-olia, or \u0027protectors of the Kerm.\u0027 The modern rendering is kermol of course.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA thought struck Donman. \u201CForgive me but we must be getting close to the history \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E know by now? The Age of Sail and the Bill of Land, Jebediah Kerman and the First Council? Everything that I learned as a kerblet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe are,\u0022\u00A0replied Jonton, \u201Cbut your lessons missed the most important part. Hardly surprising really since the older reaches of the Archives are now obscure to the point of gibberish. But humour me for a minute,\u00A0Ambassador - what is the Bill of Land?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman thought for a moment, choosing his words carefully. \u201CIt\u0027s a treaty,\u0022\u00A0he said at last. \u201CIt\u0027s the bedrock of all international law and it was designed by Jebediah Kerman himself to ensure a fair and equitable allocation of land to Kerm, Kermol and Kerman alike.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CAt least one of your teachers knew his law,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CSo why was the Bill necessary?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Age of Sail opened up new lands for Kerm and kerbal,\u0022\u00A0Donman said mechanically. \u201CThe proto-nations of Kerbin saw great opportunities across the oceans and raced to exploit them. What began as harmless competition threatened to become armed conflict as each nation vied with the others to secure their land holdings. The Council of the Twelve Pillars was formed as a peacekeeping force but it\u0027s first leader, Jebediah Kerman, recognised that the only long term way to stave off conflict was to create a Bill that all could agree to.\u0022\u00A0He coughed. \u201CSo my history lessons and reading of the Archives tells me, although I\u0027m getting the distinct feeling that you\u0027re about to overturn them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAgain, your lessons and researches are quite accurate as far as they go,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton. \u201CIn many ways, the formation of the Council was \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E defining moment for the kerman and Jebediah was undoubtedly a gifted and far-sighted leader of the Council. We only wish that we could list him amongst our Keepers. However, I fear that the true reasons for the Age of Sail have been lost.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton gathered himself with an effort. \u201CPicture it, Ambassador,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CThe Age of Prosperity. Groves and Kerman spreading across the land in waves, each wave driven by a new generation of Kerm. The great Seedings came more and more slowly with time and in truth, the last Seeding of the age was as much a surprise to us Kerm as it was to our kerbals. Only this time, there was no ready room left to expand into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe void around Donman flickered and he found himself staring at curiously geometric swathes of browned and dying vegetation. \u003Cem\u003EThese look too stylised to be real memories. More second hand information I assume.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s hard to believe, Ambassador,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton, \u201Cbut this time all of us were lucky. Each area of scarred land you see marks a battle between a new Kerm sapling and the Kerm of the surrounding Groves. Only this time, the Law of Thirty Seven was indelibly stamped into kerbal culture and the Keepers were able to prevent their Groves from assimilating the new Kerm. By this minor miracle alone, did we avoid the catastrophe of a second Age of Madness.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe geometric scars swirled away and were replaced by a view of a large Kerman city. Donman was impressed in spite of himself. Clearly Kerman architecture had come a long way from the days of clapboard houses and log cabins and many of the newer buildings wouldn\u0027t have looked too out of place in a modern city. He grinned to himself. \u003Cem\u003EThe buildings might look the part but dear Kerm the fashions would stick out. Why - why did anyone think that eyebrow wigs were ever a good idea? \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe viewpoint swam through neatly paved streets, through leafy squares where ornate fountains sat amidst elaborate mosaics and finally down to the dockside. There, a small army of kerbals swarmed over, what seemed to Donman, to be a rather rickety looking sailing ship. He frowned. \u003Cem\u003ESomething about the view out to sea looks familiar.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton resumed his story. \u201CThe Age of Sail was a heroic time but no romantic wanderlust called these beings onto the waters, Ambassador: desperation drove them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething clicked in Donman\u0027s memory. \u201CBarkton,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cthat\u0027s Barkton again surely?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt is,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton, \u201CThe kerman of Barkton already had a reputation as fishermen and seafarers, so building a shipyard there was a natural enough decision. Building the ships was another matter entirely. A small coastal cutter is one thing, an ocean crossing vessel something else altogether.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman eyed the ship. \u201CI see what you mean,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CI\u0027m no sailor but that craft doesn\u0027t look particularly sturdy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMost of them weren\u0027t,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton shortly, \u201CA lot of Groves lost a lot of good kerbals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAnd a lot of inconvenient Kerm seeds too,\u003C/em\u003E thought Donman, then silently rebuked himself. \u003Cem\u003EWould you be so callous if it were shiploads of kerblets going to a watery grave Donman.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAloud he said, \u201CThose battle scars you showed me looked strangely familiar but I\u0027m not sure why.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey should do,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton grimly, \u201CHere\u0027s our memory of a KBS news broadcast from a few weeks ago. You might recognise it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe emergency team stared around in horror. The village itself seemed to be largely intact but the surrounding fields and orchards were ruined. Most of the villagers wandered aimlessly, or sat outside their huts gazing blankly into space. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe hut door swung open and the medical team emerged, carrying an elderly kerbal on a stretcher. Sallow skin drooped off his emaciated frame in slack green folds and his eyes rolled wildly in their sockets as he thrashed against his restraints.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThey\u0027re coming!

The senior doctor shook her head sharply and bent closer to the old kerbal, murmuring into his ear.
