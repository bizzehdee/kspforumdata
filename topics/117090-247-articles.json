It is a few hours work per-part to get them converted to the new texture and shader layout, but before that can happen, I need to come up with a generic texture-switch-with-recoloring module  (all of the existing recolor work is baked into the ModelData system, which really only works for the ModularXXX type of parts that support model switching of some sort). \n\nProbably only a few hours more work to get the module created / adapted from existing code, but it was enough work all together that I wanted to hold off until I could see how the rest of the recoloring stuff was received and make sure there were no outstanding issues to sort out.\n\nSo perhaps in the next few months it could be a reality.  At that point it would also be possible to add recoloring support to most stock/other mods parts as well; would only need to create the textures/masks, and do a tiny bit of config work/patching on them  (nothing that I would be interested in doing personally, but certainly an option for some of the more ambitious KSP users)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-31T19:17:47Z","Content":"Oh joy, my dream of a pink shuttle will someday come true ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"jdub3350","CreatedById":150157,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-31T19:27:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 26 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E AAAwwwwwww   ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif \u0022:mad:\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The new spherical tanks look amazing, Mage!!!
