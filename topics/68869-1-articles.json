Some start a new savegame every version, which is quite often (thx Squad), others, like myself, like to continue playing one ad infinitum, in my case mostly because of the aspect of the savegame representing the history of my program, my time spent with the game. For this reason I also have debris set to unlimited an happily continue to collect more of it (nearly 300 atm), building a true space graveyard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, provided he was born in a rocket the first time you launched, how old is your oldest Jeb? Mine\u0027s a little over 80 years old in my current savegame. I\u0027ll probably have a great party in 100AJ before finally sending him off to the Sun to be cremated in the most spectacular coffin anyone\u0027s ever seen and start a new savegame then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federally","CreatedById":105086,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T05:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI deleted mine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get rid of all of the orange suits every time in my careers.
