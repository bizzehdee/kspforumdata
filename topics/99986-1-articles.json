I have around 10 mods including B9, Mechjeb, FAR, etc. I also have Active Texture Management, which is supposed to help. The game either crashes on black loading screen when going from the VAB to the Launchpad or just when working with a rocket in the VAB. I also had activity monitor running while playing and saw that my ram usage was around 2.20 GB and CPU usage was 160%! I dont even know how that is possible. The game usually crashes after around 15-20 minutes of starting the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The specs of my macbook are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.5 GHz Intel i7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16 GB of RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGT 750M Graphics Card\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a crash log that I uploaded here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ge.tt/99tKzfA2/v/0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ge.tt/99tKzfA2/v/0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be very grateful if someone could help me figure out why my game is crashing, cause at this point i have absolutely zero idea what could be causing this excessive crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks very much\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
