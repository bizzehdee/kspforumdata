It has not the cabability of transporting any cargo whatsoever and it\u0027s mere purpose is to show how the whole process of getting a plane into orbit works.\n\nThe difference to other guides is, i created a kOS Script that will establish a circular-ish (75/72) LKO. The spaceplane will have around 1k dV left after the insertion so you can try and fiddle with it.\n\nHere i provide the script for kOS as well as the craft file.\n\nMods used are kOS (obviously) and Kerbal Joint Reinforcement.\n\nSo have fun with it and happy flying.\n\n[**DOWNLOAD**](http://waveit.biz/SSTO_Guide.7z)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
