It has not the cabability of transporting any cargo whatsoever and it\u0027s mere purpose is to show how the whole process of getting a plane into orbit works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference to other guides is, i created a kOS Script that will establish a circular-ish (75/72) LKO. The spaceplane will have around 1k dV left after the insertion so you can try and fiddle with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere i provide the script for kOS as well as the craft file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used are kOS (obviously) and Kerbal Joint Reinforcement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo have fun with it and happy flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://waveit.biz/SSTO_Guide.7z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDOWNLOAD\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/nCHGh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
