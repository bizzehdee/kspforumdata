I personally don\u0027t believe parts should or even can be completely balanced in sandbox because the whole point of sandbox is that you can instantly access every part without any costs or drawbacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that some of the new engines probably should be higher in the tech tree and cost more science points but I don\u0027t see why their thrust and isp should be lowered. Progression in various aspects of the game including new and better parts is part of career and if we keep that in mind perhaps we can enjoy the game even more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T11:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDude...Before I posted that, I had never opened a part cfg before, never browsed the directories for anything.

I take offense to that. I believe that the new parts are vastly OP, but not because I want to be better than others. I believe that they\u0027re overpowered becuse they make other choices, such as the Mainsail, obsolete, which is the definition of overpowered - being so powerful that other features become nearly obsolete. And yet, you attribute to me a desire to be better than others?
