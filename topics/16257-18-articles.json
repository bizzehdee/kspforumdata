That will certainly be implemented in 0.3.5.3 and I still have my hopes set on making a simple flight computer built into RemoteTech. It wouldn\u0027t be nearly as fancy as MechJeb. Basically you\u0027d just be able to tell it to maintain certain headings and burn the engines at certain time durations (or until a certain delta V is attained). A simple landing autopilot would be the next task to set, and I have some ideas on how to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had thought that in earlier versions that MechJeb had failed when out of radio contact already? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put it on my main section and use the SURF function in ascent and PRO/RETRO and \u002B/-NORM in transit, basically as a better ASAS unit with Orbital and Phase Angle info thrown in. As for detached parts, landing and flying them by hand is easy enough and part of the fun. It\u0027s just automating the boring stuff in deep space that makes the game much better, plus trying to fly a 1000\u002B ton near 400 part ship into orbit while watching fuel, heading, throttle and destination gets pretty hairy and you miss all the cool stage separations and scenery. Most people would use the stock ASAS to hold headings anyway, which works but is just bad and flappy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would ditch MechJeb altogether if you put a simple flight computer into RemoteTech, all that other stuff I don\u0027t use unless I\u0027m messing around. Just the basic Smart A.S.S. functions and some flight data. But I have no idea about programming so it\u0027s easy to suggest stuff without knowing how much work and time it means.
