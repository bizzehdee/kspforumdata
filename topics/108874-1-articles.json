The ONLY thing I have done up to this point regarding Duna is send a probe there, which crashed because I didn\u0027t do the parachutes right. Before you know it, the KSP agency is assigning me contracts to take tourist on vacation to Duna and freaking LAND them there. Really?? That sounds about as bad of an idea as the real life \u0022Mars One\u0022 mission. Forget rovers, forget the historic first steps on Duna. Let\u0027s just send tourist there already. Not to mention, for whatever reason I am not allowed to unlock the MK2 command pod yet in the tech tree, so I can\u0027t even transport that many Kerbals into space at once!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know, I don\u0027t mind playing the game in a progressive manner, but I think the contracts need to better match where you are in the game. It doesn\u0027t make sense to ask me to take Kerbals to land on Duna when I haven\u0027t even done so with a regular kerbalnaut yet. Yes, you can decline the contracts, but still, some of them are completely illogical. Honestly, I don\u0027t think there should be ANY tourist missions until way later in the game, when you have a lot of experience and parts unlocked to do so. It seems ridiculous to be taking tourist to Duna so early.

A lot of that will be funded by other contracts of course - the money you get for getting your tourist there won\u0027t nearly cover the total costs of your Duna program.
