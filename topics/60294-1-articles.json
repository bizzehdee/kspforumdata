(Hell is likely freezing over as I type this.) However, it has a small problem...about 30km up, just before the switch from air to closed cycle, they explode from overheating. From about 20km up, they start to overheat, regardless of where I put the throttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/HKTRm1b\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/HKTRm1b\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy theory at present is that the presence of air intakes overlapping the engines must be causing it.
