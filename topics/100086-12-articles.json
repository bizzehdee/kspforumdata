I\u0027m not sure what I was doing wrong with trying to carry over the Mark1 Cockpit files from 0.90 to 1.0.5, but I was getting a plain white cockpit that wasn\u0027t working quite right.

I copied over only the parts for the old Mark1 Cockpit (I have enough problems with KSP crashing without adding dozens of old parts) and its internal space. In my old save game sfs file, I did a find \u0026amp; replace of all occurrences of Mark1Cockpit with Mark1Cockpit2, and now all my old ships have their working cockpits again. Huzzah!

This involved a lot of \u0022simulations\u0022 using the software that I use to simulate flight conditions in KSP...which is, of course, KSP itself.

You can\u0027t get me, Zombies!\u0022 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the big changes I found during testing was that the landing profile I had previously used on Duna in 0.90 was not going to work in 1.0.5. That procedure was: Drop in from orbit...wait for any signs of entry flames to disappear (usually there weren\u0027t any flames from low orbit)...then deploy the parachutes at about 5 km and let them do almost all of the braking...then settle the slowly-descending ship under its many parachutes onto the surface with a little rocket braking burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem in 1.0.5 was that the parachutes now get destroyed if they are deployed at high velocities. Some of my Duna ships have a lot of drag and relatively low mass, and the thin Dunan atmosphere can actually slow down those ships to safe speeds in time to deploy the parachutes (assuming a lowland landing site). But many of my Duna ships have a high ballistic coefficient because they are carrying a large mass of fuel, and those ships were still screaming in through the thin air at over 600 m/s when it was time to deploy the chutes...and that just wasn\u0027t going to work in 1.0.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other problem in 1.0.5 was the nerfing of the thrust and specific impulse ratings for many of the engines compared to 0.90 (especially the 48-7S engine). So I was concerned that some of my ships would no longer function as designed when used in 1.0.5. The Duna Landers, for example, come in with a full load of fuel (minus what gets used for the deorbit burn) because those lander/habitat/labs are supposed to be able to hop back to orbit, refuel, and land at different locations. So...were they still useful in 1.0.5?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gsS298P.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gsS298P.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappily, I had chosen to abandon the 48-7S engine (the engine I had been using extensively in my landers) in favor of the Mk-55 Thud engine back when I built the Duna Landers...specifically because I expected the Mk-55 to get less of a nerf when 1.0 hit. And as we see below, Nelemy was able to get the Duna Lander back to polar orbit with a lot of delta-V to spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hMLnAKo.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hMLnAKo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelemy: \u0022Dudes!

How much fuel would the old lander design have if it had landed in 1.0.5? This would require some testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelemy: \u0022See...I said I\u0027d let you up here eventually. Don\u0027t hit me, Dude.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nKurt: \u0022I\u0027m not going to hit you. But what have you done to us?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nNelemy: \u0022Dude...I got us safely to orbit.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nKurt: \u0022And how are we going to land again? Did you wait until the right time when we were under the orbital plane of one of the refueling stations?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nNelemy: \u0022Um...No...Dude, there wasn\u0027t time. There were Zombies!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nKurt: \u0022So we can\u0027t refuel to land again. Great job, Nelemy.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nNelemy: \u0022No, Dude, it\u0027s all right. All I need to do is press this button on this HyperEdit control panel, and the ship is instantly refueled!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nKurt: \u0022What? I\u0027ve never seen that control panel before...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with some renaming of old Quicksave files, and some additional F5 action, some landing tests were made. And, indeed, it turns out that even if targeted to a lowland landing site, the fuel-heavy Duna Lander comes in too fast, and its parachutes get stripped away by the supersonic airstream (this as the air is). But the Lander can land safely with just engine propulsion alone (see below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220KHikso.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0KHikso.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, that leaves the Lander with only 39.5% of its fuel remaining, which is far too little to fly back to orbit (Unless it happens to land at a location where a Refueling Station and Fuel Fido are available to refuel it). So let\u0027s try another landing profile:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PjxLMR7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PjxLMR7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI again targeted to a lowland site, I let the Lander come screaming in (we now get entry flames from a 90 km orbit in 1.0.5), letting the aerodynamic drag act as long as possible to slow the ship. But at 6,000 meters, the ship was still streaking along at almost 700 m/s, so I fired the two Thud engines at 100% throttle. As soon as the parachute icons in the staging display changed to the grey background color of \u0022safe to deploy,\u0022 I popped the chutes and cut the engines. The ship had slowed to safe-chute-deployment-speed at 1,600 meters (things were happening fast, so I wasn\u0027t as quick on the draw as I could have been in deploying the chutes and cutting the engines...see below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022D0raGps.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D0raGps.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut once the chutes were out, they very quickly slowed the ship and got it descending vertically at an altitude of about 900 meters (about 310 meters above the surface), and the touchdown after that required a little low-thrust engine braking (the lander drops at about 15 m/s under its six parachutes with no engines firing at this elevation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oTuTjrO.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oTuTjrO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe result of this landing profile (below) left the Lander with 69% of its fuel remaining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022N7xO2th.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N7xO2th.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut is that enough fuel for the Lander to return to orbit?

But replacement Landers could be improved by the inclusion of two modifications: 1) The addition of drogue parachutes that can be deployed at higher speeds to help slow the Lander sooner, saving more fuel during landing; and, 2) slightly more efficient engines (the Aerospike is superior to the Thud on 1.0.5 Duna).

So, the next shipments to Duna will include smaller Runabout landers to move the crew from base to base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut let\u0027s get our universe back to normal...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nQ5C4Sg.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nQ5C4Sg.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ChPTjQ1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ChPTjQ1.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHellou: \u0022Zzzz..zz*snort*..Huh?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nNelemy: \u0022Wow, Hellou-Dude...You must really be tired to have fallen asleep during supper!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nHellou: \u0022Um...Oh.

The Duna Fido rover, for example, was originally designed to be able to hop back to Duna orbit for refueling, then land again at a new location. Or, as Adly and Kelby had done, just hop the rover some distance across the surface to be refueled at a surface Refueling Station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, alas, in KSP 1.0.5, the nerfing of the 48-7S engine left the Duna Fido woefully underpowered. As shown below, it struggles to lift off from Duna. It is very slow to accelerate and push its very draggy frame through the Dunan atmosphere, and it falls far, far short of reaching orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022unl39zs.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/unl39zs.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NPo4ZrA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NPo4ZrA.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nQ5C4Sg.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nQ5C4Sg.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the Duna Fidos are going to be limited to surface operations from now on, and I\u0027ll have to live without the connivence of being able to hop out of a long, boring rover expedition. The rovers to be sent in the next shipment to Duna will be designed purely for surface operations once landed, and they will be positioned in interesting locations around the planet. The old Duna Fido that is still in orbit will also be useable -- it turns out that the high drag of the rover allows it to slow down to safe parachute deployment speed when dropped in from orbit to a lowland site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the Surface Refueling Stations that are still in orbit, the outlook is not as good. These stations have a very high ballistic coefficient (being mostly full tanks of propellants) and their now-weak 24-77 Twitch engines may not be able to slow them down enough to land safely. Replacements sent from Kerbin will implement drogue chutes and stronger engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Fuel Fidos that are still in orbit will have an easier time landing because of their draggy frames, and they can have their propellants removed to lighten them even more if needed.

Above that is the ISRU Lander complete with tanks, drills, converter, ore containers, and a cabin for an engineer to monitor the experimental systems.

The first thing I tested was my SSTO Crew Carrier 9e rocket, a vital piece of my space infrastructure because it carries my kerbals up and down from low Kerbin orbit. I ran into a weird bug where the ship would sometimes fly away from the center of the window (almost as if the CG point was shifting rearward beyond the bottom of the rocket). After removing various mods and reinstalling them a few at a time, the culprit that seemed to cause me several problems was the KURS Style Docking Cam mod...so I removed that and haven\u0027t had this problem reoccur.

Problem #1: The flag planted on the pyramid fell over.

The four wheels in the center are still clear, but the front and rear wheels are blocked:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X6WSRfu.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022X6WSRfu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not clear to me why this is happening. I thought that in KSP, different parts of your ship can\u0027t collide with each other (something I thought was implemented way back when to keep ships from exploding). So why are the wheels even checking for collisions with other parts of the same ship?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is particularly bad, because even though the Duna Fidos were no longer going to be useful in their previous \u0022hop to orbit\u0022 mode, I was still going to do some roving exploration while the replacement rovers were sent to Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUh oh... What about the replacement rovers? One of the payloads I launched last episode to be sent to Duna has three of them on board. Below you can see a copy of the Duna Fido 3c that I plopped out on the launch pad to check (since you apparently can\u0027t check for wheel blocking in the VAB)...and, alas, the front and rear wheels are blocked on the replacement rovers as well. Bugger. Well, if that doen\u0027t get fixed with some update soon, I\u0027m going to have to ask the judges for a do-over on that launch so I can replace the rovers waiting in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZJHl78z.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022ZJHl78z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh...But what about the other roving vehicles I have on Duna? So I hopped over to Duna Main Base to check out the equipment there. Below, the Duna Base rover (with Thompbles and Emilynn onboard) has unblocked wheels. Good. Also, a quick test drive showed that it actually handles better than before (it is somewhat top-heavy, so you had to be very careful stopping...but it does much better now). \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5SQxPUF.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00225SQxPUF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DunaDog roving wheels are unblocked...so I assume that the replacement DunaDogs will also be OK in that regard, since I didn\u0027t change anything in that area when I added the fuel cell power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/04NFhyc.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u002204NFhyc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Fuel Fido, alas, has one set of wheels blocked. Oddly, the corresponding set of wheels on the other end are NOT blocked, so I guess I didn\u0027t build this vehicle\u0027s wheels exactly the same in front and back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EX51aM3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022EX51aM3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Fuel Fido can still work with only six of its eight wheels unblocked, so these can still be used, if not as efficiently as before. But, sadly, there are a few more of these on the replacement payloads waiting in Kerbin orbit...so I may need a do-over there as well before I send them off to Duna. Happily, the Fuel Fido has MUCH less of a tendency to try to flip over when braking (I had to be very careful driving these in 0.90 because of that...it was important to slow down before trying to brake).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe payloads waiting in Kerbin orbit also contain a variation of the Fido meant for use on Ike (shown below), which happily has no blocked wheels. The wheels on the large mobile IRSU vehicle are also not blocked, so no need to replace either of those payloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vrO4Hwc.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022vrO4Hwc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:26px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReplacement Rovers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I needed to make some versions of the rovers to replace the ones waiting in orbit that have blocked wheels (assuming that this doesn\u0027t get fixed by an updated version of KSP soon). I also wanted to test out the new version 1.1 wheels, which have been completely redone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is the reworked version of the Duna Fido 3c, named the Duna Fido 3d. I just slid some of the structural plates inward or fore/aft to get maximum clearance from the wheels (which are still in the same locations to get the maximum wheelbase in the 6-meter-diameter stackable format).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pvX5T2Q.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022pvX5T2Q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to test out the rover to see how it handled with the new wheels. I was also worried about whether the RTGs (there is one RTG per wheel) were going to provide enough power. To test the rover, I drove a remote-controlled version out to the mountain peak West of KSC. How high up the mountain would the rover be able to climb?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/to34dmm.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022to34dmm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe drive across the grassland and rolling hills west of KSC went fine. The eight standard rover wheels (with default settings) handled well and reached speeds of around 25 m/s without drawing more energy than the RTGs could provide (so the batteries stayed near full charge). The rover could easily handle 2X Phys Warp, so the trip went quickly. I had tried 3X Phys Warp briefly, but that lead to violent jitteriness, spin outs, and blown tires. 4X lead to certain destruction. The SAS was also in use, with frequent taps of the F key to reset the SAS as the rover went up and down slopes to minimize the SAS fighting the incline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZUsXefx.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022ZUsXefx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I got to the foothills of Mount RoverDeath (oh, wait...is that foreshadowing too obvious?), the wheels began using more energy than the RTGs could supply, and the batteries drained fairly quickly...so I was going to have to pause and let the batteries recharge (it only took a couple minutes for the batteries to fully recharge when the rover was stationary).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qJ67hAz.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022qJ67hAz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI parked the rover at right angle to the slope for the recharging period...but it turned out that even with this moderate slope, the rover was sliding sideways downhill.

Ah! If you change Friction Control from \u0022Auto\u0022 to \u0022Override\u0022, then you can crank the Friction Control up from a value of 1 to a value of 5 (see below). Cool. I guess those wheels have lots of little gripper claw studs that can be extended with the flip of a switch. Maybe this would make the rover use more energy to cover the flatlands...but it stopped the sideways sliding on the hillside, so I went for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ElXm4fh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022ElXm4fh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow we see the rover (about 50 minutes into its mission...but less than that for me because of the 2X drive over, and the fact that \u0022seconds\u0022 take less than one second for my machine running the new 1.1 version...nice optimization improvement, Squad!). I could generally drive for several minutes (more if angling along the slope...less if straighter up slope), and then I\u0027d put on the brakes and let the RTGs recharge the batteries for a couple minutes (using time warp, so very quick for me).

I had to be careful to get the rover into a sideways position and put the brakes on BEFORE the batteries ran completely dry (otherwise the rover would start rolling backward, and it would be easy to wipe out if you let it get going too fast backward). All of the driving at this point is at fairly shallow angles to the slope. But I often drove my Bird Dogs on Laythe on the sides of these kinds of slopes, so I have the technique down pretty well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XIjDYmz.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022XIjDYmz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is a view back toward KSC from a point 2730 meters up the side of the mountain.

So I wanted to see what kind of range my Duna Fido could get using fuel cell power. Below is the test vehicle, Duna Fido 3fc. All of the RTGs were removed and a six-pack of fuel cells was added to the right side structure.

That\u0027s silly and ugly.

And for a lot of people who don\u0027t do a lot of rover driving, sticking on a couple extra Oscar-B tanks for a total range of around 290 km would probably be all the range they need out of a rover. But I like to do more epic drives, and having to mess with refueling rovers (as well as all the other ships) would just be too annoying. Unless, of course, Squad would give us handy refueling hoses.

I did use the ruggedized wheels on my rovers for very low gravity worlds where more traction was necessary. So I wanted to try out the ruggedized wheels in 1.1...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...therefore I built and tested the Duna Fido 3g (the \u0022g\u0022 is for \u0022grippier!\u0022) shown below. It\u0027s basically the same design but with eight ruggedized wheels, plus some extra RTGs (a total of 12 RTGs) because the grippier wheels are more power hungry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zQUZO93.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022zQUZO93.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI set the Traction Control to zero in honor of Geschosskopf, and set the Friction to 2.5 for extra grippy fun. Then I sent the rover off toward the ominous music playing from Mount RoverDeath to see what it could do. It was able to go considerably faster than the standard wheel version over the rolling lowlands (up to 45 m/s)...but it would slowly drain the batteries at that speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p5DgutJ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022p5DgutJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, the rover could not handle 2X Phys Warp without jittering and occasionally spinning out, so I had to keep it at a boring 1X warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe grippy rover could handle the slopes more head-on (at the expense of faster battery depletion, of course), and could maintain good speed up the foothills...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2Dph0xX.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00222Dph0xX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...but this speediness lead to me making the classic rover blunder (even more classic than \u0022Never get your rover involved in a land war in Asia)... which you can see coming up ahead of the rover in the picture below: The deadly \u0022going to fast into the V-trough\u0022 scenario...
