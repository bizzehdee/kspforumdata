These kids love playing it! But there\u0027s so many problems with it, and Kerbal Space Program is much better! When I asked these kids about Kerbal Space Program, some even thought that KSP was a \u0022ripoff\u0022 of Simple Rockets. KSP is actually linked inside of the SimpleRockets app, but many of them have never actually gone home and bought it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne student I talked to went home to play KSP for the first time, and they actually thought the LV-N didn\u0027t have enough thrust. They tried to put the LV-N on a huge 1.25m diameter rocket, and was puzzled as to why it never lifted off. This is because the largest thrust rocket in SimpleRockets looks like a nuclear thermal rocket. I explained to him that if the combustion chamber of a rocket engine is that big, it\u0027s probably a reactor and not a combustion chamber. I\u0027ve been told the word about this is starting to spread. SimpleRockets is something of great fun, for a mobile device anyway. And many KSP players would surely love a proper KSP to play on a tablet when their PC is unavailable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s my suggestion to you, dear SQUAD. After 1.0 of KSP is released, try to negotiate a purchase of SimpleRockets from Jundroo (Or purchase Jundroo entirely), and make Andrew Garrison, the creator of SimpleRockets, a SQUAD dev dedicated to SimpleKerbals. Think of what would be to gained from everyone\u0027s side! SQUAD would get money from purchases of SimpleKerbals, as would Andrew Garrison (Because he\u0027d be paid by SQUAD), the dev resources for the game would increase, the game would get Kerbals (and become more than just a game about rockets), The gameplay would improve, and more kids will be introduced to full KSP! And there\u0027s not really much of a downside; you wouldn\u0027t need to divert any dev resources because Andrew Garrison would continue to develop it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://jundroo.com/project/simplerockets/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://jundroo.com/project/simplerockets/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does everyone else think? Would you like to see such things take place? Do you think I\u0027m horridly and unrealistically optimistic?

With so few games of this genre out there, combining two of them under the Kerbal mantra might be a bit too limiting. Perhaps a better course of action would be a partnership in which KSP and SimpleRockets both give more attention to the other, and perhaps both make some minor changes for them to fit better together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T02:03:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Crimson Sunrise\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Crimson Sunrise\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESQUAD is not a game company, so even if the idea seemed that good, what would a marketing company do with a portable space game in the first place?\u003Cp\u003EPlus I think that SR is more of a casual game than what KSP is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD is functionally two companies.

Squad, they hit it big; KSP is extremely popular, especially for it\u0027s niche appeal to the rocket and science community. I have always said KSP is a GREAT tool for education and I think it should absolutely be taught to young children in grade school, especially those who are getting into elementary algebra and geometry. Compared to learning off a boring chalk board, KSP makes thing so interesting. I\u0027m almost 25 now, college educated, I\u0027ve studied astronomy, math, and some advanced courses on \u0022The Big Bang Universe\u0022. KSP has taught me more about orbital mechanics then anything college has!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom line, Squad should be reaching out and targeting even more people. SimpleRockets, personally I feel KSP is vastly superior to this cheap mobile knockoff. With that being said, I think Squad eventually needs to address the mobile gaming market. They are missing out on the phone and tablet experience big time, and as far as I know, there are zero plans to do something on those platforms. As far as school goes, sometimes I think KSP should offer an educational package with tutorials, mods, and a short booklet on KSP for beginners, and offer a mobile app to coincide. I think this game has so much potential to inspire and teach kids about basic math and rocketry. If we ever want to do great things besides the ISS and go to Mars, Jupiter, and beyond, we need people who are enthusiastic about space travel and are interested in becoming tomorrows leaders and interested in building and engineering real rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T12:33:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love SimpleRockets, it gives gameplay very similar to KSP on mobile devices.
