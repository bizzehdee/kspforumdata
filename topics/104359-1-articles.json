Today I had the idea to build a ship specifically for interplanetary transit. The idea was to make something with large crew and fuel capacity. It would be sent between planets, with stations that are already there to perform orbit-to-ground work, and vice-versa. After some time in the VAB, I launched Space Bus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/rTX18j\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8820/16996792080_c34f5d6c8d_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002216996792080_c34f5d6c8d_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/rTX18j\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Escreenshot26b\u003C/a\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/people/130941168@N06/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edizzle229\u003C/a\u003E, on Flickr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was surprisingly easy to get into orbit, which I thought would be the major hurdle. I\u0027ve yet to send it anywhere, but I can already predict some problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Every body needs a fuel station to keep the wheels on Space Bus going round and round. In addition, every fuel station needs to be refueled itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Very long burn times. Even with four LVNs, this thing doesn\u0027t get close to 1G of thrust. I fear that since a transfer burn would have to be performed over multiple passes, it might end up at a stage where it\u0027s at Kerbin-escape-velocity, and not enough time left to complete the burn in the right position. Slapping on some higher-thrust engines means sacrificing ISP, and even now it only has about 10 km/s Delta-V. Not sure how much the external tanks will add to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Going off of the last one, slowing into orbit around bodies. With such low thrust, is it even capable? That 10 km/s may sound like a lot, but I don\u0027t want to try aero-braking this thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread isn\u0027t so much about this particular craft as it is about the concept, the problems inherent in the concept, and hopefully, solutions.

Usually if I\u0027m playing with stock parts, I stick a couple of the biggest Kerbodyne tanks together and run three or four LV-Ns. I stick a clampotron Sr. on the front and this not only gets me to other planets and back again, but also serves as the orbital fuel tank for a planetary lander. I can tag Duna, come back up, cruise over to Ike and land there, and then go home again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big problem is the low, low TWR. Usually I build my landers such that I can fire their engines too, if I need extra thrust. But you can climb out of the gravity well in steps, too. Just don\u0027t try burning all at once from a very low orbit, because that causes problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobraking is no problem. That\u0027s probably not realistic, but then again this is KSP....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I am experimenting with the Near Future nuclear reactors, and that works much better! A couple of big reactors, a couple of big electric engines, some huge (but light) liquid hydrogen tanks, and I have a interplanetary mothership that has something like 30,000 m/s delta-v (with lander attached!) and still has better TWR than the LV-N versions did. The main drawback here (in career mode) is that each ship costs close to 2M to launch. So you need a lot of cash to build up a fleet of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-18T06:38:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2015 06:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T09:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love IPVs (Inter Planetary Vehicles)!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to see another person with some.
