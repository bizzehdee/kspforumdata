Not sure if this would even work in real life but if you had a spent rocket stage that was entering the atmosphere at around 3000m/s, if you included a bunch of drogue chutes that were set to deploy when the stage reached 90km-100km, would they reduce the ships speed enough before they got ripped off so that StageRecovery would allow a successful recovery?

There\u0027s a tiny reputation hit for it, and it causes contract failure. I believe a page or two back there was another report of it. The semi-good news is that I\u0027ve been working on getting around it, but it requires precalculating if a vessel is going to be destroyed. StageRecovery works through events and unfortunately there aren\u0027t many applicable events fired before the kerbals are killed (which is BS since there\u0027s an event like OnAboutToBeDestroyed that fires after the kerbals are dead but really shoulf be before then).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only event I\u0027ve found that works is when the vessel goes on rails (is unloaded). Unfortunately that means that StageRecovery nicely recovers the kerbals only if the vessel goes out of range while under 23km. If it\u0027s above 23km then it goes on rails it\u00A0isn\u0027t destroyed until it falls back down, but there\u0027s no event that works for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, its a really annoying problem that I haven\u0027t found a good solution to since Squad is eager to kill the kerbals. (Did you know, in flight the Kerbals aren\u0027t killed once, but twice! Yep, twice. In the Tracking Station they aren\u0027t killed at all when a vessel gets destroyed, until a scene change at least)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T21:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73338-magico13/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002273338\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73338-magico13/\u0022\u003E@magico13\u003C/a\u003E, I need your help on an issue that has been reported against the Tourism Contract Pack \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/102372-105-contract-pack-tourism-plus-v130-2015-10-09/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2308961\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. \u00A0The gist of the issue is that he recovered the tourist via stage recovery, but failed their contract (because I detected them as killed). \u00A0I skimmed the StageRecovery code and looks like the way it works is to run after the vessel is marked as destroyed and \u0022revive\u0022 Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, I\u0027m using the GameEvents.onCrewKilled event to detect Kerbal death for those types of contracts. \u00A0Is there a different event that I could look at instead that fires later (ie. after Stage Recover)? \u00A0Or should I perhaps just detect the event, wait a couple of second and only fail the contract if they are still showing up as dead after the delay?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T02:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119307\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0022\u003E@nightingale\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0That very problem was the discussion of the previous post.

StageRecovery sees the parts being destroyed and estimates the terminal velocity, but when it goes to calculate the distance from KSC it errors out.

If it\u0027s out of physics range (22.5km) but still above the atmospheric pressure cutoff (~23km on Kerbin, IDK what it is for Earth) then it just acts like it were on an airless world (aka: speed up as you get closer to the ground and don\u0027t slow down from drag). SR looks at the surface velocity at destruction, compares it to the DR velocity and comes up with a percent chance to be destroyed (0% if below the DR velocity, but\u00A0can be \u0026gt;100% at high speeds). Heat shields reduce that percentage by up to 100% based on how much material they have left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll have to tweak things a bit to find something you feel is reasonable. The default of 2km/s works for Stock since that\u0027s just under orbital velocity, which means you should be able to drop things from a low suborbital trajectory and have a low (but \u0026gt;0%) chance of destruction, but dropping them into the atmosphere at Munar return speeds are instant death. Dropping them down from orbital speeds gives around a 50-50 shot of destruction without heatshields, but is easy with heat shields.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think 7 or 8km/s is reasonable for SR with RO since the parts don\u0027t get to slow down before destruction. That should allow for suborbital but not orbital returns.
