Even though I\u0027ve been playing for a long, long time, I never got into making planes. The new aero made it fun and challenging. So my first entry here is nothing special, but I thought I\u0027d throw it up there for people to try out and let me know how it works for you. I\u0027m open to suggestions. I\u0027m currently working on an MK3 design that still needs tweaking and balancing before I release it...\n\nI give you, the Happy Rooster!\n\n[![uq7bL0Dh.png](http://i.imgur.com/uq7bL0Dh.png)](http://imgur.com/uq7bL0D)\n\n[![YXdWJbGh.png](http://i.imgur.com/YXdWJbGh.png)](http://imgur.com/YXdWJbG)\n\n[![cW7Lqc1h.png](http://i.imgur.com/cW7Lqc1h.png)](http://imgur.com/cW7Lqc1)\n\n[![NoeyiwTh.png](http://i.imgur.com/NoeyiwTh.png)](http://imgur.com/NoeyiwT)\n\n[![8n8e9D5h.png](http://i.imgur.com/8n8e9D5h.png)](http://imgur.com/8n8e9D5)\n\n[![qG69BZlh.png](http://i.imgur.com/qG69BZlh.png)](http://imgur.com/qG69BZl)\n\n[![5qkXjhGh.png](http://i.imgur.com/5qkXjhGh.png)](http://imgur.com/5qkXjhG)\n\n[![voY2thUh.png](http://i.imgur.com/voY2thUh.png)](http://imgur.com/voY2thU)\n\nAction Groups:\n\n1-Toggle NERVAs\n\n2-Toggle Jets\n\n3-Switch RAPIERS between Air Breathing and ClosedCycle\n\n4-Close ram air intakes\n\n5-Close in-line air intakes\n\n10-Retract under-wing airbrakes (Hit [0] after locking brakes so they don\u0027t break off on the ground)\n\nAscent profile is quite simple:\n\n-Enable SAS\n\n-Press [Z] for full throttle, then press [2] to activate jets\n\n-Pitch to 20 degrees, and stay at 20 the entire time.\n\n-at 5000m, press [1] to turn on NERVAS. Press again to turn them off once you hit over 400m/s\n\n-When RAPIERS max out in thrust and start getting weaker, activate NERVAs again with [1] (Should probably enable RCS at this point)\n\n-When RAPIER thrust goes below 170, hit [3] to switch to ClosedCycle\n\n-When Whiplash jets die, press [4] and [5] to close intakes\n\n-Burn until apoapsis is \u002B70km then cut all engines\n\n-Coast towards apo and circularize as normal (This should burn out the rest of your o2)\n\nThe above steps are the easy way. You can tweak it and do some manual pitch adjustments that will leave you with more dV in orbit, like higher pitch when switching RAPIERS.\n\nDescent is easy. \n\n-SAS and RCS on. \n\n-PE down to 25-35KM.\n\n-Airbrakes on.\n\n-Open air intakes with [4] and [5] (can leave RAPIERS in ClosedCycle since they\u0027re not needed to land)\n\n-Keep the nose pointed between high prograde and the horizon.\n\n-Deploy the angled tail fins (optional)\n\n-Slow to below 600m/s and turn off airbrakes.\n\n-Powered descent/coast to the surface and land at a speed below 140m/s.\n\n-To brake, press brake button and then [0] right away to raise the airbrake under the wings so it doesn\u0027t break.\n\n**[url=\u0022**[![voY2thUh.png](http://i.imgur.com/voY2thUh.png)](http://imgur.com/voY2thU)**\u0022]DOWNLOAD from Mediafire**\n\nHope you enjoyed, let me know what you think. The goal of my craft was good balance, easy takeoff and easy landing. How\u0027d I do?"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T16:27:30Z","Content":"I see there were some downloads but no comments here about it.
