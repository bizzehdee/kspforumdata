I\u0027m asking because I will use turbojet engines as main propulsion until the atmosphere gets unsuitable. Then, I would like to switch to rocket engines (one of the 215 kN ones, plus two LV-N\u0027s) for orbit insertion and manoeuvring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft\u0027s ultimate goal will be to dock with a space station in Kerbin Orbit, or a large interplanetary ship for Laythe, etc... missions.

They allow you to do it with a single keystroke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you\u0027re not familiar with them, in the VAB or SPH, there are two bright blue buttons in the top center of the screen. One allows you to adjust the parts in the vessel (and is active by default) and the other allows you to set up action groups. Click the action group button, choose the action group you want to modify (group 1, for instance) and then click on the part you\u0027d like to add to the action group. It will give you a list of options, and here you would probably want to choose Toggle Engine. Generally speaking, toggle is a better option than Activate or Shut Down because it gives you more options, and if you accidentally fat finger the key too early, for instance, you won\u0027t have to fool around with manually resetting everything or wind up having to scrub the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some quirks with symmetry. If you\u0027ve got two symmetrically placed engines, putting one of them in an action group will automatically include its twin. However, if you then remove the engine from the vessel and put it back on (like if you adjust the position of the wing that it is placed on), that will break the symmetry and only one of the two engines will be part of the action group. Unfortunately the interface doesn\u0027t show that this has happened, so you actually have to remove the engine from the action group and then put it back into the action group to get it working right. To make life more fun, occasionally the game will keep the symmetry and not remove the twin from the action group. In any case, it\u0027s easy enough to get around this, just set up your action groups as the last thing you do before leaving the SPH/VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor space planes I like to have an action group to toggle my jets, an action group to toggle my rockets, and a third to toggle my air intakes. Other people prefer a single action group that will simultaneously shut down jets and close intakes and activate rockets. The former allows more freedom - you can have rockets going at the same time you have jets going, for instance, in order to get the last bit of thrust from your jets, or you can shut your intakes but leave your jets active to drain excess liquid fuel and lighten the load on the rocket a bit. The latter is more convenient, especially if you\u0027re still shaky on piloting skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: I forgot to mention that if you do set up action group 1, you use it by pressing the 1 key on the keyboard by default. Action group 2 = 2, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-19T00:34:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2013 12:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jason Patterson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammar are my friend\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
