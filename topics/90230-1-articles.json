Ever since 0.25, there is a square on the back of the helmet and the whole suit seems like it isn\u0027t processing light properly. Is this a known problem and does anyone know how to fix it? It looks like maybe it\u0027s a normal map issue, but I\u0027m not a graphics artist and would not have a clue how to fix it. It happens with or without ATM, and either DX or OpenGL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for any help you could provide. Here is the link to the original post and download.
