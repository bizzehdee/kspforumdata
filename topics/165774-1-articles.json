Also a good reminder to always stick some fixed panels on every design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the one consistent thing with them is they all have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E, and the other candidate (that I think I installed about the same time this started happening, but I\u0027m not sure) is Ship Manifest. But I\u0027ve been looking through all their settings and can\u0027t see anywhere where I\u0027m telling it to manage solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTIA for any suggestions.

Have you tried gonging back to last saved game. I know it can be a hassle but reload a new Kerbal 1.3\u00A0 than reload do not include your last prest as usually there is something in there that is messed up Why I save a lot just load the last saved game this has cleared up many problems for me .
