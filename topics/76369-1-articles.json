To support any business case for \u0022cheap\u0022 launches, you are going to need to demonstrate first that there is demand for 500 launches per year instead of 50. There simply isn\u0027t. In fact, it\u0027s the opposite. The current market is saturated and the demand for GEO comsats is going to decrease because their latency makes them really only useful for broadcast, which is becoming a niche market. In a few years, the bulk of communication, including TV broadcast, will be through LTE and optical fiber links.

First of all Skylon. Here\u0027s a mashup of my previous arguments about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkylon\u0027s engine, airframe, TPS, and pretty much every other technology are unproven. In theory, with some very optimistic margins, it should be capable of SSTO with a payload, but that\u0027s only theory. In practice, not a single large aerospace projects has gone without cost, weight, or schedule overruns. Attempting to implement so many new ideas in a single project that relies on each one of them working flawlessly only multiplies the chances of that project to fail. Especially when you are a small organization with limited resources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Skylon\u0027s fuselage structure and outer skin is unique but it also doesn\u0027t use conventional construction techniques. Airliner fuselages are typically cylinders that are bolted together. The same tooling and transport jigs are used for all of the sections. It uses all sorts of exotic materials that nobody has much experience with. So even then manufacturing techniques and tooling need to be developed from scratch. It took years for Boeing to industrialize the 787 carbon-fibre fuselage, and it\u0027s still much more conventional than Skylon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Skylon\u0027s TPS uses a new mix of superthin carbon-ceramic material that has never been tested. On paper, this isn\u0027t enough, so it also uses active cooling by vaporizing LH2 on the wing edges. Again, this has never been done before and is purely theoretical. Nobody knows how feasible these new techniques are in the real-world or what happens if the vaporization system fails or underperforms. Until someone flies a tech demonstrator through reentry, it\u0027s a no-go. Reentry demonstrators are expensive things to do. For example, ESA\u0027s IXV program took 5 years and 150 million to design, and it is just a subscale model that will fly on a Vega rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- And of course, there is SABRE, on which the whole idea relies and that hasn\u0027t even been made into a subscale test bench demonstrator yet. They are decades away from making a flight-capable engine, let alone achieving the reliability and serviceability requirements that you need for flight operations. Yes, they have a prototype pre-cooler, which was the trickiest part to get working. Yet, how durable is it and how close is it a flight-ready component? Another comparison: It takes $1 billion and 10 years for P\u0026amp;W or GE to develop civilian jet engine. High performance military engines are typically more expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause none of the technology has been proven, nobody can tell what the actual capabilities will be, or even if it will be viable at all, because nobody has any experience in operating SABRE engines, in constructing an airframe like Skylon\u0027s, in commercially operating a reusable SSTO spaceplane, or even if the TPS is capable of withstanding the reentry constraints. We don\u0027t know how reliable it can be, what the service intervals or operation constraints will be, how much payload it can carry, how much it will cost to buy and fly, or if it can be economically viable. In the end, if the SABRE engines slightly underperform, or if the airframe ends up slightly heavier than planned, or if the TPS needs to be slightly thicker, then there goes your payload ratio and the viability of the project. That is a huge risk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkylon is bigger than an Airbus A380. Just to build a conventional heavy airliner requires a major airport with a reinforced runway, a production facility the size of a small city, and a supply chain involving hundreds of subcontractors. It took Boeing $32 billion and 10 years to develop the 787, which is just an airliner with fairly mature and well-understood technology, except for the carbon-fiber body. EADS spent $25 billion dollars to develop the A400M, which is just a conventional turboprop cargo plane. These are companies that have supply chains, armies of engineers, and they are working with reliable and proven technology. It takes years just to design stupid things like the landing gear or engine mounts... It takes more years to set up the logistics, to build or adapt a factory, to negociate supplier contracts, and so on. They need factories, test facilities, upgraded airport infrastructures, transportation, cranes, tooling...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are zero subcontractors who have any experience building something like a SABRE engine, a unique carbon composite airframe larger than an A380, a unique TPS, the avionics... Just developing the tooling, the jigs, the test fixtures, and the software is going to take years. Heck, it even takes years just to hire the workforce that you need to do all those things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkylon is bigger and heavier than an Airbus A380. There\u0027s only a limited number of airports in Europe that have the reinforced runways that could handle it plus manufacturing facilities for large aircraft. The Airbus plants in Hamburg or Toulouse, and maybe a couple of others. So if Airbus is not a partner, and not willing to move their current production lines to make place for Skylon (airliners are much more profitable) they need to build a new factory and/or a new airport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkylon runs on LH2. It need lots of it if you want a fast turnaround. There are zero airports that have massive LH2 production or storage facilities nearby. So they also need to build that, which might not be possible at any of the existing manufacturing sites at all due to all sorts of environmental, industrial or political problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, things like factories, airports, supply chains, or hydrogen plants don\u0027t get built over night. They require years of paperwork, planning, paperwork, money, paperwork, construction, more paperwork, and political lobbying at a very high scale. You\u0027re going to need a strong political support to get such a project off the ground, so you are going to have to convince local, national, and EU parliamentaries and government officials. This alone is a huge effort that is going to cost millions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are only some of the problems that they have to solve. There is no way a small R\u0026amp;D company can pull off such a large project. Even if there was a market for it, even if it was technically viable, and even if ESA, Airbus, and several European governments were on board, there\u0027s no way Skylon can fly any time soon. And that\u0027s an awful lot of \u0022ifs\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet REL estimates that Skylon will only cost $12 billion, and that each unit will be cheaper than a good old Airbus A330, despite everything in Skylon being new, unconventional, and made of exotic new materials, and despite the production numbers being much lower than those of a typical airliner. The cost estimates are simply not realistic, and therefore neither is their business model. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to the programs above, with all the groundbreaking technology and materials involved, I can\u0027t see it costing less than $30 billion to develop. If they optimistically find customers for 50 vehicles, it can\u0027t have a price tag of less than $1 billion per vehicle. Now, to cover the cost of a $1 billion dollar reusable spacecraft over a 10 year period, at SpaceX projected prices (~$50 million), if the cost of the vehicle is 50% of the operational cost (which is optimistic), you are going to need to fly each vehicle at least 40 times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s 40 launches x 50 vehicles / 10 years: 200 launches per year. If you cut the price of a launch to $10 million and miraculously managed to squeeze 200 flights out of an airframe, you\u0027re going to need 1000 launches per year to pay for the fleet. What sort of new market is going to suddenly appear that is capable of paying $10 million for a flight to LEO 20 times per week?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why Skylon will never fly: it requires an upfront investment in billions of dollars, with no promise of a future market and no promise of even technically working. Airliners and military aircraft projects have a market, with firm orders years before the first test flight and minimal risk. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere currently simply isn\u0027t a mass market for hundreds of Skylons with daily or weekly orbital launches, even at the cost of an airline ticket.

Will it be cheaper than land-based LTE towers? How big is the actual market in areas that don\u0027t have access to LTE? It will be interesting if Google succeeds, but they would need what, 20 to 30 launches, to build their constellation?

I would not even bother to explain the difference.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell if you are so well versed in the difference between testing and maintenance, then you would also know that maintenance involves testing. Complex systems like rockets or aircraft only work reliably if you perform routine maintenance. Routine maintenance requires testing because faults are often latent (meaning you don\u0027t know about them until you test for them). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommercial airliners are required to undergo \u0022checks\u0022 at regular intervals, where the aircraft comes in to the hangar and mechanics perform routine tests on the aircraft\u0027s systems and structure. These checks range from overnight hangar visits every couple of weeks to more extended hangar visits every year or so, to complete overhauls requiring a month or more every 6-8 years. And don\u0027t, for a second, believe that problems aren\u0027t discovered during those tests. Dispatch reliability and safety of modern airliners is very good because the aircraft are designed with built in redundancy, but I guarantee you that every aircraft you have ever flown on had at least one deferred maintenance item and many more latent maintenance problems. The significant additional cost of designing, building and maintaining those redundant systems is necessary to maintain dispatch reliability and safety of commercial airliners. Reusable rockets will only be more critical and expensive to maintain and test because they are operated in harsher environments and with thinner performance margins.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
