I assume that alarm timing tells you when you should be leaving (roughly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is then, that I don\u0027t know what the best technique for burning is. Let\u0027s use Moho as an example since it\u0027s a tricky one. My best understanding based on what I\u0027ve read and seen is that you want to burn prograde from a Kerbin orbit a while after Kerbol has come over the horizon from the ship\u0027s point of view. With a bit of fine tuning this does seem to get the best solar periapsis. I\u0027ve actually seen someone accomplish a Moho encounter by doing basically this and ONLY burning prograde, and I have no idea how he accomplished this black magic because I find at the very least you also need an ascending/descending node adjustment down the line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut even when I am able to line up my trajectory with Moho\u0027s orbit after an adjustment, and even though I\u0027ve left at the window that the alarm gave me, I find I\u0027m not able to get an encounter around the far end of the orbit (which I assume is where you\u0027re supposed to be looking since it\u0027s the area that would use the least \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E to get to). So instead I have to get there, burn retrograde to approximately line up with its orbit, and then shift inside or outside to eventually capture, but by that point I\u0027ve wasted a lot of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E and I know I\u0027m doing something wrong. It doesn\u0027t help that when you have to work with two maneuvers (a big burn from Kerbin to get the solar periapsis down, and then an adjustment burn for the ascending/descending angle much later) it becomes difficult to switch between the two to optimize since changing the prograde burn often shifts where the ascending/descending node will be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTLDR: What\u0027s the best method for burning to an interior planet like Moho when the alarm says a transfer window is available? Where am I going wrong with my method of burning prograde from Kerbin to get the solar periapsis down, and then matching the orbital angle at an ascending/descending node such as to attempt an encounter at the far end of its orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for reading!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-28T13:04:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or any other tool for Moho.

Due to the way Moho\u0027s orbit contrasts Kerbin\u0027s, the ideal time to leave requires precision down to the hour (or less), and then only for a very specific ejection angle. Even the precision required itself varies between different Moho windows, as there can be so many different possible constellations between the two orbits in terms of altitude, relative inclination and relative eccentricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Alarm Clock doesn\u0027t give that kind of precision IIRC. It tells you roughly what day the window begins on. Additionally, it has two different modes: a simulated and a precalculated mode. The two modes generally disagree on the exact day - and thus, either one or even both of them will have an error regarding Moho\u0027s tiny window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, if you leave on the correct day, you still should be able to get an intercept somehow. It may require a costly correction burn and a more expensive capture burn later-on, but it\u0027s not like the planet has suddenly teleported away. You just can\u0027t hit it with pure rograde/retrograde anymore. Use the radial directions in combination with prograde and retrograde to either slow or accelerate your travel time towards the destination. (Assuming, of course, you inclination is already corrected to the point where doing so doesn\u0027t cause you to miss the target in the normal/antinormal direction). It comes down to your understanding of orbital mechanics and your skill with the maneuver node editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
