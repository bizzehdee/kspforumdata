We all know the navball is collapsed by default when entering map view for the first time on a flight. If you bring it up, next time you enter map view on the same flight the navball will already be up. But for me, it\u0027s always collapsed each time I enter map view on the same flight even after bringing it up. I haven\u0027t played for a long time so I don\u0027t know if this is now normal behavior, or if I have a malfunctioning mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-27T02:30:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope that\u0027s normal. In settings, you can set the navball to be always up or always down in map mode. Sadly there is no \u0022remember the last setting and do that\u0022 mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
