I\u0027m new to the forums, but have had the game for a couple of months now. I just wanted to post here, my appreciation to the very small dev team of this gem of a game. I have been plugging this game on the Steam forums whenever possible without spamming. You can credit my purchase to KurtJMac of Youtube, whose videos prompted me to buy it. To those who haven\u0027t seen his KSP series, I\u0027d highly recommend looking into it is as well as Scott Manley\u0027s videos. I\u0027ve been having a literal blast with this game. I hope to become skilled enough one day to lose my training wheels (MechJeb) and explore the cosmos which has been greatly expanded in the latest patch. I thank you for this wonderful game and look forward to its future. It is truly the best 18 bucks I\u0027ve ever spent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-26T19:14:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2012 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Moeceefus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T19:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Moeceefus, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad you are having fun, also, manual flight is a decent skill to have, MechJeb does not always get things right \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moeceefus","CreatedById":52168,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T22:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you. So far, I\u0027m pretty good at getting into orbit and circularizing unassisted. I can also inject myself to to the Mun and Minmus. I generally only use MechJeb for landings. I have yet to try for the new planets and moons and I\u0027ve noticed MechJeb doesn\u0027t have the new stuff on its transfer list yet, or am I missing an update? My understanding of astrophysics is extremely limited, if any, and MechJeb helps me learn the angles and burn times to get to new places.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
