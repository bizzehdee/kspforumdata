Plant a flag a few metres at the foot of the runway.\n\n2. Fly a plane.\n\n3. Fly about 100km away from the flag. (unload the flag)\n\n4. Target the flag while flying.\n\n5. Come around and land back on the runway.\n\n6. Recover the plane.\n\n7. Viola, your flag is now 5km underground.\n\nThank you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T02:33:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 02:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rdivine**"}]}
