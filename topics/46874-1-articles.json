Will they just become non-functioning dummy parts without the plugin stuff or will they break and explode the universe if I take out the plugin components of the mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeblote","CreatedById":79303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T12:18:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECopy your saves folder, delete the plugin and see what happens?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PolecatEZ","CreatedById":58008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T16:26:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes you can do this, but also delete the call for the MOD in the config for the part just to be safe.

I\u0027ll try that and see what happens later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
