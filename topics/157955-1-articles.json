Half of its surface is always staring at Suthe while the other half is a large ice cap which perpetually stares into the outer solar system. On the day-night terminator, there are ice caps on the light side, so you may land there and establish a base with ease.

It does not have large moons but it has three asteroid moons within its rings. It is conveniently close to Kerbin so as long as you can reach the asteroids there, it would be relatively easy to plot large operations in the inner solar system.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E-\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ffd700;\u0022\u003EKerbin\u003C/span\u003E, a blue-green continental world.

In addition the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is situated on several islands above the equator, so plot missions carefully when launching!

It has relatively few clouds as its surface is cold, but not cold enough that the atmosphere will freeze onto its surface. Also, it has one moon, Risian, with no atmosphere and cracks lining its surface.

Moho, a large, hilly, and cratered world. Also in this belt is Gilly and its moon Kitt, both of which are asteroids. Finally, Dres, now a darkened rock with several craters of which are blackened.

It has two moons, Mun and Eve. The Mun is a dark grey and red planet. Above it is Eve, a green planet with few continents but a large ocean and is a planet which is expected to feature vast amounts of life on its surface on varying degrees from plants to large wild animals (of which isn\u0027t possible in KSP, but roleplay as you ease).

This is likely an ice belt, between these two planets. It is likely a large ice world could have developed given Trobus and Jool didn\u0027t, first. Vall has three moons, two of which are asteroids and the larger, Karthis, is a dwarf object with cracks dotting its surface.

The first moon is Kleas, a cratered ice moon with a special impression on its surface. The second moon is Rothian, a certainly unique pink-white-blue gas world. It is unknown what material lies in its atmosphere, or perhaps could life be present on it? Both of its moons are Ulston, an ice planet with a thick haze making the surface invisible (with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E), and Loade, a bright copper planet with an ice sheet covering its surface.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E-\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003EOuter Objects\u003C/span\u003E, these objects are anywhere from dwarf planet Eeloo and Minmus to comets such as Bop or Pol. None of these stock planets have been changed from their original forms but they\u0027re likely going to be dark in the future, so it\u0027d be a unique context nonetheless.
