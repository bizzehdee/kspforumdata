They\u0027re all stock parts and use no mods. On posting this, there are only two, but I hope to post more in the future!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is from a series in which I attempt to make some seaplanes that are both functional and look nice. After playing around with a few designs, I gain success in the \u0027Cormorant\u0027 design. After playing around with some weaponised versions, I decide to test the capabilities of my seaplane as a missile platform. This cinematic is of my Cormorant mk.1 CM running a short mission involving a target aircraft and a cruise missile. The target was an Aeris 3A, located on the Insular Airfield. The plan was to fly out, land on the surface of the water, just off the island and then use the Cormorant as a launch platform for the cruise missile. It all pretty much went as planned (other than the blooper at the end).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOCGaming also commented on this, which was very surprising!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_p4dWtHD4RA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second came from a series in which I construct a station capable of docking, fueling and firing space-to-ground missiles of different calibres and designs. The Bolt II is the only missile I\u0027ve actually tested so far, but I have a few more designs in the pipeline. This cinematic is of my Bolt II SGM running a short mission from the Zeus Orbital Station. The target was an unmanned test board, located on the KSC\u0027s airstrip. The plan was to launch the missile from orbit, re-enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and strike the tug. It essentially went as planned, though I would\u0027ve liked to have struck at a higher velocity.
