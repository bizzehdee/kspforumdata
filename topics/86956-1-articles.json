Stuff like mapping pitch/yaw to the joystick axis worked fine out of the box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut some controls are not recognized at all. When mapping the \u0022POV2\u0022 hat for example, I could map the upwards button (JoystickButton19), but none of the other directions. The throttle hat won\u0027t work at all. Adjusting these buttons in Saitek\u0027s own software doesn\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve read somewhere that KSP used to map only a limited number of buttons, but that seemed to be an old issue, and I don\u0027t see others complaining about issues with the X52 - so I\u0027m a bit confused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas as to what the problem may be?

Some few people seem to inexplicably have absolutely no problems with them, but for the most part there is often a large array of weird issues with joysticks. As far as we have been able to tell, there really is very little (if anything) that can be done about it, although some people have managed to cobble together a bit of a workaround via some programs which can remap joystick input into a virtual joystick (which KSP/Unity seems to read better for whatever reason).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hiasakite","CreatedById":125738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T10:56:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is poor - as on v0.23.5, I could set-up the HAT switches on my X52 for KSP - something has broken since then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully will be fixed:-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
