You can\u0027t just take other people\u0027s work and use it as your own. I know you probably only mean well but I suggest you take this down and rethink the way you approach modding. Learn modelling, make a simple parts pack, learn how to do things for yourself as far as you possibly can. Collaborations are great but what you are doing here is not collaboration, you are just taking other people\u0027s work and effectively claiming it as your own. \n\nPeople will respect you if you come to them with something you have made yourself and put some effort into. It gives your actions and what you say weight and meaning. Look at the way people like Beale and Porkjet approach things; they produce their own work with its own personality to it, and people look up to them because they bring something new and innovative to the table. What you have done here is to bring together a disparate collection of parts of varying looks and no distinct personality, none of which you have created yourself. There is nothing you can claim to be yours. Trust me, building a mod from the ground up and releasing it and seeing people comment on and enjoy work that you have made will bring much more satisfaction than collecting together assorted parts and releasing them as your own.\n\nI don\u0027t mean to cause any offense by this because I know that you don\u0027t mean any harm and just want to get into parts modding.

What you\u0027re doing *may* not be illegal, and *may* not be violating licesnses (I think...) but it is definitely in poor taste, and in very bad form here. The drama that was brought over to the Tantares thread really bummed me out frankly. You need to stop biting off more than you can chew, and be realistic about your capabilities. \n\n**@sumghai** is also correct. You shouldn\u0027t credit yourself for parts that you have yet to create... I mean... Why? \n\n**@sal\\_vager**, I know you\u0027re doing your job, just try to understand both sides here while you\u0027re playing referee here. Maybe delve into the history of the mod, and look at how it was initially conceived. Pay a visit to the dev thread for Bacon Labs, and also the Tantares release thread. It\u0027s not all bad, and I don\u0027t think anyone here is unfairly treating **@\\_Augustus\\_**.\n\n**@\\_Augustus\\_**, I\u0027m genuinely sorry you\u0027re having a tough time here. Can you *pleeeeeeaaaasee* just listen to what many of us have been saying to you? Being twelve years old doesn\u0027t give you a free pass to avoid critique. Frankly, what you\u0027re capable of at twelve is fairly impressive, and we want to encourage you, really, we do. *However,* you need to pick up on what we\u0027ve been telling you. Learn to model. Learn to texture. Stop relying on other people to do work for you. Be competent and skilled in your own right, and acquire the skills necessary to accomplish what you want to. If you keep kidding yourself about your abilities, you\u0027ll be met with critique and frustration at every turn.\n\nI\u0027ll gladly give Bacon Labs a download, play around with it a bit, and be sure to submit reports on any bugs I find to try to improve the mod.

No one complained when the mod was in development.\n\nI call foul on that, several people complained but since you only allow criticism if it shows you in a positive light you most likely reported all of the posts that had complaints and had them deleted as they were there and are now no longer there. The same thing seems to be happening here as literally as I was posting this some posts above mine disappeared by the time I hit \u0022post\u0022.\n\nI\u0027ve said it before and I\u0027ll say it again, you can\u0027t post something here and expect people to \u0022only give good feedback\u0022. If you refuse to listen to criticism both negative and positive you will never learn from your mistakes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T08:57:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 08:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by raidernick**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T08:59:58Z","Content":"\\_Augustus\\_ will be accepting all *constructive* feedback, whether critical or praising, and I will be helping him ensure his packs are legitimate before release.\n\nI have been in contact with both -ctn- and Eudae55, \\_Augustus\\_ has permission to use these parts from -ctn, and Eudae55\u0027s work is public domain.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T09:24:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 09:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"skbernard","CreatedById":67569,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T10:25:56Z","Content":"too much drama, no click..."},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T13:35:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E too much drama, no click...\n\n now now let\u0027s not dismiss shadows work because \\_Augustus\\_is acting controversial."},{"CreatedByName":"spacecookie","CreatedById":101953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:34:00Z","Content":"Hello, I won\u0027t enter in the debate as everything has been said.\n\nI\u0027m just asking if it is possible to have some more and bigger pictures of the stuff ? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:59:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hello, I won\u0027t enter in the debate as everything has been said.\n\u003E I\u0027m just asking if it is possible to have some more and bigger pictures of the stuff ? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nYou\u0027re kinda like a neutral party that walks in like \u0022Um... guys?\u0022\n\nOr like when your friends are arguing with their parents and you\u0027re just awkwardly sitting and petting their dog. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"spacecookie","CreatedById":101953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T16:19:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027re kinda like a neutral party that walks in like \u0022Um... guys?\u0022\n\u003E Or like when your friends are arguing with their parents and you\u0027re just awkwardly sitting and petting their dog. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThere is a better way to describe my attitude [http://replygif.net/i/187.gif](http://replygif.net/i/187.gif)\n\nI just want to see some more of shadows work.\n\n( Of course it\u0027s just a joke, I am not here to appreciate someone getting blamed.
