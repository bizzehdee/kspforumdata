I can only pull the throttle all the way up or down. If I put the physical throttle in middle possition, it tend to set the virtual throttle to 0% or 100%. I tried many different ways to fix the problem but the situation won\u0027t get better. Is it because Thrustmaster joystick does not fit with KSPor something\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your help huys :3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-23T00:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, and welcome to the forums!\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving your post to Technical Support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-23T03:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis kind of happens on my Logitech 3D extreme when in a rover.
