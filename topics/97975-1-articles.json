Is there a quicker way to select them than holding Alt and clicking each individually? With that method, if I accidentally click on object which isn\u0027t a fuel tank the option to transfer fuel disappears and I have to clear the selection and start again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merandix","CreatedById":135352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T10:27:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can select ALL fueltanks by clicking on the bars in the resources tab though... not that it helps much.

You can, however, transfer fuel at 1x - 4x physics warp. You must start the physics warp, then start transferring fuel. Changing the warp will cancel the fuel transfer. That\u0027s really the best way to do fuel transfer. If this is a frequent issue for you, I would recommend TAC fuel balancer, although I do not use it myself, I believe it does make fuel transfer easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
