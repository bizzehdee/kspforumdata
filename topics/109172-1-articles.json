It\u0027s exactly what I wanted them to think. After faking an \u0022Immediate Kraken Evacuation Alert\u0022 and sabotaging the communication system to make sure mission control could not interfere, I slammed myself into the receiver dish to disable the life monitoring systems of my EVA suit.

Kerbalkind reaching out to Duna to send crews to another planet for the first time and stuff, blah blah blah. The Ares I crew did their thing and came back heroes.

Research groups on Kerbin have been experimenting with directly growing snack-bearing plants for quite a while. A substantial portion of my time on this mission was assigned to experiments with the most successful specimen of these snack-splants.

There is quite some fuel left in the tanks, because our pilot Doodbald really nailed the landing. Unfortunately, I still have nowhere near the amount of fuel I need for my snack-planting endevour. Enter the DAV (or at least whats left of it). The heavy lower stage of the Duna Ascent Vehicle was left behind during the evacuation. It has two drills and a resource converter. The process takes a lot of time, but it will produce a steady stream of fuel for my plants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DAV is inactive right now (the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E was removed and buried after landing), but I think I should be able to hook it up to the Habs power systems. The solar panels are generating way more electricity than I currently need, so why not put that surplus power to use?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223cb1ojp.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3cb1ojp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as I plugged in the cable, the lights of the DAV flickered back on. Since all the fuel tanks from the DAV are now back in orbit, I rolled the fuel tank from the Dude to the DAV and connected it with a hose. It is quite late now, so I\u0027ll wait till tomorrow before flipping the switch on the drill and converter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225iB0WRH.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5iB0WRH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOh man, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is so much fun\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121262-The-Dunatian-%28The-Martian-Kerbal-style%29?p=2007359\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2007359\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ELink to next log entry\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-11T07:33:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2016 07:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SirJodelstein\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Erestore title\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T19:56:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally great, entertaining adaptation and well-staged images.

Did a whole lot of precision engineering (mostly hammer and wrench) and botanics (moving dirt and talking to plants). And maths to back it all up. On a foreign planet. Exactly all the nerdy fun stuff I\u0027ve been dreaming of since long before I joined the Space Academy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere do I start? The fuel plant. The drills are running and filling up the ore canisters, and the converter is chewing though it smoothly. Due to the dependency on solar energy and batteries, I can only leave them running during daylight. It takes about two Sols to fill up the FLT-200. After that, I roll the canister over to the hab, where I can empty it into a slightly larger container.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uNCYSQT.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uNCYSQT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside, the snacks are growing better than i expected. The plants from the testbed setup have grown and sprouted, and i took some of the seeds to replant them in the large plot. I have finished the large plot and added illumination and the engines from the Dude. Let\u0027s hope they grow as good as the originals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZGfL8M2.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZGfL8M2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy maths skills have told me that I only using 87% of the converted rocket fuel per Sol with this setup. If the current snack growth rate holds, there will be enough snacks to feed me indefinetely. Well, that is until the soil deterioates from intense overuse. So, maybe not indefinetly but at least for some years. I do not intend to stay here forever, so thats allright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I have leftover fuel to use for other experiments. About 65kg of rocket fuel per Sol, and no way to store huge amounts of it. I don\u0027t really know what to do with it at the moment. Completely unrelated to this fact, I made some slight modifications on one of the rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002244pv2lj.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/44pv2lj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeeehhh!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-11T07:34:27Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2016 07:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SirJodelstein\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Erestore title\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VASMIR","CreatedById":143455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T21:20:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you actually launch all of the components?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirJodelstein","CreatedById":62251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T21:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VASMIR\u0022 data-cite=\u0022VASMIR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid you actually launch all of the components?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I hyperedited them there.
