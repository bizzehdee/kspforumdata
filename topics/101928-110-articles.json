This game is not real world but in general case it\u0027s a poor excuse for breaking rules.\n\nWe can reasonable imagine a kerbal who has an advanced suite with \u0022pockets\u0022 (300L volume is a little too much but acceptable). As long as such kerbal can fit the pod\u0027s seat it\u0027s ok to assume no design changes are required to the pod. What you suggest *is* a design change to *every* stock pod. I\u0027d prefer not to affect the game that significantly. Those who really likes this approach can create own \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches and have pod inventory of any volume. Though, better way would be providing a specialized inventory part that can be added to the craft. It will increase the mass, change vessel balance, and require more fuel to fly. And this is why we like this game - it pretends to handle physics ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Scuwr","CreatedById":113028,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-02T08:47:19Z","Content":"So I seem to have found this bug (feature?) where \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E only lets me reattach a part on my ship with the parts previous attachment scheme.
