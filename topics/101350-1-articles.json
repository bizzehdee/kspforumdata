(For the moment)\n\nThere would be multiple tiers of the colony pack, This is just tier 1 that i mentioned.\n\nTo upgrade your colony you would just land a new colony ship within 1km of your colony and enter editor allowing you to place the new modules provided by the 2nd module.\n\nAny kerbal can enter your colony just by going in the hatch of a habitat (Duh)\n\nOn the map a colony would have a icon resembling a village for under 100 population (Tiers 1-2), A town for under 1000 (Tiers 3-4), A city for over 1000 (Tier 5),"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T02:57:46Z","Content":"I feel that SimCity-style colony building is getting too far away from the exploration-based gameplay of the core game, so I can\u0027t say I\u0027m fond of this at all."},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T03:07:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I feel that SimCity-style colony building is getting too far away from the exploration-based gameplay of the core game, so I can\u0027t say I\u0027m fond of this at all.\n\nI like the idea that colony\u0027s be immovable objects rather than ships, There isnt much to see on the current planets, so the challenge and reward is just getting to a planet and doing something cool on it."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T03:09:09Z","Content":"It should be tycoon style... if implemented."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T11:35:02Z","Content":"Great idea but something I\u0027d like to see done properly via an expansion or sequel.

(at the moment at least)\n\nbut where to draw the line...?\n\nWe (humans) have never built a colony on another planet. But we could. [Robert Zubrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zubrin) thinks we so. the price tag or blind stubborn ignorance seem to be the only things holding us back. \n\nultimately colonization of other celestial bodies is a major goal of space flight. we have had our sights set on mars for a while now. \n\nIn situ resource utilization is an integral component of this and it is set to be at least partially explored in game(off kerbin refueling in KSP v1.0). The other key part is in situ building. Setting up permanent habs ether underground or in inflatable domes.\n\n**simcity style duna colonies are beyond the scope of this game** but permanent or semi permanent base building is a key long term goal of space flight. \n\ncurrently KSP does not support base building as there is no need to do so in game. its just missing base building mechanic.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-06T13:09:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2015 01:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Capt Snuggler**"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T13:25:26Z","Content":"I think that this wold be a great addition.

I really like the idea of the OP, to have a *RTS-like* building game mechanism, as a *definitive and futuristic endgame goal.* \n\nMaybe just as a mod addition to KSP.\n\nA player establishes a \u0022temporary colony-hub\u0022, like with the MKS/OKS mod. After which you have to transport a lot of resources (and latter personnel) to said hub, which unlocks some *\u0027orbital-map-like-view-of-the-area*\u0027 around the hub feature. \n\nIn which one can define placement of **permanent** structures around that location. These 3d model structures should be like the KSC buildings, one model one texture. And do not need to be Hi-Res necessarily.\n\nBut as Capt Snuggles said, it is not the prime goals how KSP was setup and I think such a feature although being extremely cool for some folks, would be impossible to implement."},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T15:07:23Z","Content":"It already is possible to place base modules in KSP: use some form of propulsion to maneuver them to the location where you want them. \n\nWhat OP asks for is essentially easy mode base building."},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T15:27:39Z","Content":"Really, it sounds like it deserves it\u0027s own entire game (or just an entire game mode), rather than being stuck onto the stock game.
