All 3 issues were only present when SymmetricFlameout was installed, but were always present when it was installed.\n\n1. After starting a jet engine via staging, the right-click action Shutdown Engine and its companion Activate Engine are ignored. Prior to starting the jet engine via staging, they work and the resource window shows reasonable values for intake air demand same as after starting via staging.\n\n2. All of MechJeb\u0027s Intake Air values were 0 throughout operation.\n\n3. When [RealPlume - Stock Config](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129119) was installed (all 3 parts: SmokeScreen, RealPlume, and RealPlume - Stock Config), there were only sounds for starting and stopping a jet engine; there were no sounds for the jet nor the turbine and no visual effects at all. Without RealPlume - Stock Config, stock sound and visual effects are normal.\n\nI can provide logs if that would help.\n\nI understand this mod fixes a fundamental flaw in stock and it\u0027s not surprising that these sort of issues come up. Thanks for tackling this one and I hope you find this helpful.\n\nEDIT: Almost forgot the fourth thing I noticed: the 0.1.1 download contains a .version file saying it\u0027s 0.1.0.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-13T02:51:13Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2015 02:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jacke**"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T16:11:33Z","Content":"Question for you Crzyrndm.
