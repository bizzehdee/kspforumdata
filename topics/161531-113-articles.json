This means there is no physical barrier between the fuel and the propellant. The separation is maintained by a vortex. The advantage is that is allows very high core temperatures. The disadvantage, is that is suffers from buoyancy effects. Whenever the engine is under the influence of any acceleration, which includes gravity (=1G), the vortex will lose containment, reducing your power and making your lose uranium fuel. That\u0027s actually a lot worse than just losing power and expansive fuel, your are poisoning the atmosphere with deadly radiation! Fortunately for you I haven\u0027t implemented the effects yet, it would contaminate the entire launch side with deadly uranium dust particles, making all your engineers and scientist sick.
