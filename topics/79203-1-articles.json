And although the aerodynamic model is rather... simple... it does account for dihedral angling on the wings and the mounting of the wings in relationship to the CoL. It might not model it terribly accurately, but a dihedral high wing design will be more stable than an anhedral low wing one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: There are all sorts of threads detailing why the KSP drag model and aerodynamics aren\u0027t at all realistic, so you can hunt those up, but essentially, the atmosphere is entirely too thick, relative to the Earth\u0027s, and drag is calculated based on the mass of a craft. The shape plays no role in the calculations. So you end up with situations where adding a nosecone to a plane/rocket deceases it\u0027s efficiency because you\u0027re just adding more mass.

It also (somewhat) models the effect of wing height, sweep, wing loading and washout.

Use dihedral to create positive roll stability. Use empennage radius and wing sweep to create positive yaw stability. Do not attempt to use vertical CoL displacement for positive pitch stability, as that will create pitch excursions depending on airspeed. Instead, CoL should be level with CoG and a little behind to make it nose heavy.

At speeds below terminal, the wings generate more drag than the parasitic drag of the parts and all is normal, but at super-terminal speeds (is that a word??) the situation is reversed and the aircraft becomes highly unstable.
