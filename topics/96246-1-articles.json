Final version will be made using Arma II so better graphics, better movements, and better sounds!

A lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only gripe is that it feels a tad.. cheesy. The delivery was okay (Turn up the volume, since I couldn\u0027t hear him to save my life), but the writing felt like some old action movie you\u0027d expect to see and write off but go to see in theaters anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t say it\u0027s horrible though, it\u0027s certainly something I want to see. And soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that it\u0027s amazing. I play a lot of Arma (2 without any DLCs, moving onto 3 after an editor glitch made the Arma 2 editor a pain to work with) so I can definitely appreciate the work gone into making this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
