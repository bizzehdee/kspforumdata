Reputation is only useful for gaining more money or science, therefore both default to money, which, with a cleared tech tree, no longer provides progress to a clear objective anymore. Future tech just making it easier to get more money means that all future technology is is just a mint. I think there needs to be more for science to do in an upgrading or maintenance capacity so as to not become worthless at the end of the tech tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-09T00:46:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like this as a simple way to address the problem of the tech tree ending and the finite usefulness of one of career mode\u0027s three main currencies.
