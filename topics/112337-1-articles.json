I have attached a kickback to each of the radial boars via a TT70 radial decoupler. When the the Kickbacks run out of fuel, I stage them off. The problem is that the 4 Twin boars also separate from the girder segment, even though there is no staging device. They continue to burn, and the stage menu shows their fuel status, even though they are no longer attached, but mechjeb does not report their fuel any more.\n\nIs this a bug or what?"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T02:50:52Z","Content":"Did you try attaching more struts?
