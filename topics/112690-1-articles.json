It goes through the usual 30-60 second loadbar, and just as the \u0022loading\u0022 orbits in the right lower corner show up, the mem usage jumps from 2.5 GB to 3.2GB\u002B and windows takes over and says it\u0027s stopped working.\n\nThe only thing I\u0027ve changed recently is installing Dmagic\u0027s modlets, tempgagekiller and portraits, and i\u0027ve played the game one session since then (which ended in the VAB freezing out since i accidentally clicked on a part heavy radial assembly and was trying to ctrl\u002Bz my oops)\n\nAny of this ringing any bells?"}]}
