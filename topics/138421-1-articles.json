I spent about an hour in sandbox looking at all the parts and seeing how they interact as well as reading the wiki on github (UKS is insane!). During this fiddling period, I wanted to use a bunch of the resource drills to see which raw materials were required to manufacture things like chemicals/polymers, etc, and to see how much storage I\u0027d need for each type. The plan of action was to take a bunch of the big (5.0m) rectangular freight containers, designate a bunch of different resource types and slap all the drills to the side of it. Not wanting to run out of power, I thought I\u0027d take the chance to try out one of the nuclear reactors offered by the mod. I attached the largest one (coz bigger is better, right?) and then fired up all the drills. Much to my dismay, they ran for only a few seconds before draining all of the electric charge from my command pod. I checked to see if the reactor needed to be started by right clicking on it, but all it said was that it had 450 units of Enriched Uranium and space for 450 units of depleted fuel. I reverted to the VAB to see if I could activate the part through an action group, but no actions were available for the part. I then read the part\u0027s description which listed storage specs and thermo specs but had nothing about the reactor producing electric charge. Also worth noting is that the KSP loading screen will occasionally have a popup that says \u0022incompatible mods detected,\u0022 which is odd, because ckan (I\u0027m lazy) registered them all as compatible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll mods installed:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommunity Resource Pack\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtraplanetary Launchpads\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirespitter Core\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Attachment System\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Inventory System\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModule Manager\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUSI Core\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUSI Kolonization Core\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUSI Kolonization System (MKS/OKS)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUSI Tools\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
