I made various changes and was pretty confident that the kerbal should survive because, if he did get ejected, it should be in a direction away from the vessels, so I \u0022asked for a volunteer\u0022 to test it in LKO. Jeb wanted the job but I wasn\u0027t that confident so I gave it to some random kerb I can\u0027t remember the name of now and when he docked, sure enough, he still got thrown out of the seat and he did survive, but he somehow managed to achieve an orbital velocity of over 100 km/s so he was definitely lost beyond return...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T12:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaythe mission.

At the start of the flight, Orkin had piloted it above the clouds, but as he approached the mountains he began a decent below the clouds. Moments after breaking through the bottom of the cloud deck, Orkin discovered just how close he was already to the mountains, and next thing I knew Orkin and the prototype spaceplane had formed a brand new crater in the side of a mountain. As a pilot in real-life, I felt extra dumb for descending through the clouds into a mountain range, and forced myself to not revert the flight, and accept Orkin\u0027s death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole spaceplane program had tons of comical disintegrations due to aircraft going out of control and crashing.

Thankfully I set up the spaceplane\u0027s cockpit with a decoupler and a couple of parachutes to act as a way to eject. Luckily this system worked surprisingly well, and Orkin was the only Kerbal to die in that program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crimsonraziel","CreatedById":71203,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T08:41:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a debris taking its turns over Kerbin\u0027s in somewhat excentric orbit.
