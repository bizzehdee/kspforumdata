When I say something is \u003Cstrong\u003Eretired\u003C/strong\u003E, that means that I am removing it from my catalog and have no intention of reintroducing it later on. If I remove something from the catalog but plan on bringing it back in later on after some reworking, I will refer to it as \u003Cstrong\u003Epulled\u003C/strong\u003E. Ok? Good, let\u0027s begin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start us off, the sad news. Due to an incident whereupon the properties of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere suddenly and inexplicably changed, things were very briefly thrown into chaos. Fortunately, very few of our products were affected, but a few were. First of all, the A-2 Inverse and the B-2 StormBreaker are both being retired from the catalog. The A-2 is being retired because of severe stability issues when turning at low altitudes. The B-2 is being retired because of several issues, mostly that, before the incident the B-2 was already very prone to having bombs explode inside the bomb bay and the incident only worsened the problem. Sad to see these two go, but we have to let them go. Also, for the mean-time, we will also be pulling the C-1 SkyLifter and the CS-1 Kalvin. The former will be discussed near the end and the latter is experiencing severe issues with the launcher due to the aforementioned incident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up, several aircraft currently in the catalog are going to be replaced with newer version. Some of these newer versions are simply the old versions with some of the new parts added on, and some of them are complete and total overhauls, starting from the ground up. So, these new versions are the A-1B, the B-1B, the B-3B Configurations 1 and 2, the F-1B, the F-2B, the F-3B, and the OR-1B. The A-1B is a complete overhaul of the A-1A, but the most important change is a significant increase to it\u0027s offensive armament. If you want to see how much ordinance you can carry on an aircraft, look no further. Most everything else is simply new parts and small tweaks. However, I really want to draw some attention to the B-3B for just a moment. The original B-3A SkyFortress was a complete and utter monstrosity of an aircraft. At 646 parts, it was a constant contest to see which would crash first; the aircraft or the game. The B-3B is a completely different animal. The Configuration 1, with the B-3A\u0027s original payload of 180 Mk.82 500lb bombs, now comes in at only 554 parts, a 92-part reduction. And the Configuration 2 goes even further. With a payload of 48 Mk.20 Cluster Bombs the part count is further reduced to 412, a whopping 234-part reduction from the B-3A. How \u0027bout them apples?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, the good stuff. In the next update, we will be bringing in several new and exciting aircraft for all your military needs. First up, we have a new ground attack aircraft, the A-3 Venom. While the A-1 ThunderHammer is slow and methodical, the A-3 Venom is fast, albeit not as heavily armed. Secondly, we have two brand new transport aircraft, the C-2 Executive and the C-3 SkyBus. The C-2 Executive is just what the name implies. It is a small VIP transport that is meant to transport personnel from base to base in small jumps. The C-3 SkyBus is a large transport aircraft that was originally meant to be sold to airlines, but recent events shifted the focus of the project. It is capable of carrying 48 passengers for very long uninterrupted periods. Next, we have the E-1 SkyEye and the E-2 Growler. The E-1 SkyEye is an Airborne Warning and Command System (AWACS) and the E-2 is a dedicated Electronic Warfare Aircraft for jamming/intercepting/disrupting enemy communications and radar. Then we have two new recon aircraft, the OR-3 Gemini, a long range observation aircraft and by far the most unusual aircraft we\u0027ve ever produced as it has 2 cockpits and 3 fuselages, and the OR-4 StarBlazer, a high-speed, high altitude spyplane that travels at speeds in excess of Mach 3. We\u0027ll also be adding in a true flying-wing style stealth bomber, the B-4 DarkStriker. And finally, we have two brand new fighter aircraft, the F/A-4 Excalibur and the F-5 Mustang (both pictured above). The F/A-4 is a multi-role fighter that is equipped to handle both air and ground targets, and the F-5 Mustang is a high-performance air superiority fighter with a mean streak. We hope that, when introduced, they come to serve as a backbone for your military forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you may have noticed that I have not talked about our most well-known products. Well then, those will be updated soon enough.
