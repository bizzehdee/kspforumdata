Ordinary parts connects like a tree, which means that you cannot make a connected triangle for stability. Then one or two landing legs mounted at the end. Each leg can hold a surprisingly high load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-12T18:39:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are landing somewhere steep with stock legs, I find the best thing to do is make the legs on each\u00A0side be individually retractable. Generally, that means that you need to place them on your vessel without using symmetry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
