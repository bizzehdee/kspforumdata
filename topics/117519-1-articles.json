Multiple children can be attached to one parent, but you can\u0027t have multiple parents of one child. The \u0022ultimate\u0022 node is the root part, which is the first one you create when you\u0027re in the editor.\n\nThe fact that it models craft as trees means that closed loops are simply impossible. The only way to kind-of-sort-of get around this is to follow Red Iron Crown\u0027s advice-- a strut can connect any two parts, and docking ports can dock however they like (not subject to the tree restriction), though of course then you have the disadvantage of not having a truly solid connection."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T16:35:49Z","Content":"Note:\n\nDocking ports won\u0027t actually connect until you load the craft. This can cause issues from either misalignment of the force of gravity. A strut is often your best choice unless you are assembling in orbit.\n\nRelevant terms to search for are \u0022torus\u0022 and \u0022habitation ring\u0022. Ring segments are a common feature of stations, so look at some of those."}]}
