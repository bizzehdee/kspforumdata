If the lander is irregular, put it inside a fairing. I\u0027m picturing lots of legs, side tanks, and heat shields for an Eve lander and that drag will make it hard to control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Add more control surfaces on the bottom stages. Not just the fins, but the ones that actually steer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Use engines with lots of gimbal to help hold position when the nose starts to slip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf none of these work, try flying straight up longer and doing a less aggressive gravity turn. I had one very heavy lifter that was so unstable the only way I could avoid flipping was to go straight upwards to 20,000 meters, and then ever so gently tilt 5 degrees and fly prograde. Once it cleared the the atmosphere, I would turn it horizontal and burn until I got an orbit. This will burn more fuel, but you can always strap on more boosters to compensate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-27T00:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the first stage works, but the second stage flips, that means several things. The first thing it means is that \u0022atmospherics is keeping\u00A0your rocket stable\u0022.

You have to count on vacuum-type thingies for retaining control. Which means \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and gimbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFairings are the typical answer --\u00A0but they can be clunky, and if you are playing career you may not have them. In this game, fairings are actually a really silly answer to the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good answer, as Grogs said, is to launch straight up. It really really helps with your stabilty, and the fuel cost of \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E making a gravity turn is a lot lower than people make it out to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_Danger","CreatedById":159757,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-27T00:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0or Verniers\u00A0to provide control.
