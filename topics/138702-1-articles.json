Problem is I got bored quickly, until I found mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe issue I\u0027m having is it\u0027s shifted the balance from too few toys to drowning in them. To keep things simple I\u0027ve stuck with KAS/KIS, Scansat (on EZ-mode, my playtime is pretty limited) and finally went for the USI ecosystem as it\u0027s well supported and has an LS system (also sexy kontainers). Now I\u0027ve mapped a few moons and planets I\u0027m aiming to establish a Mun/Minmus mining op (manned) to support an orbital LFO base for a later base on Duna, I\u0027m just not sure how to build up to that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyone with a similar mod structure have any tips?

It\u0027s a very complex mod that\u0027s meant to build up from a few introductory modules to a big, interconnected system. If you go into sandbox mode and try to build the high-end system from scratch without ever having gone through the process of incrementally upgrading an initially small base, you will indeed have trouble understanding what the heck is going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T23:13:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027d like to keep the exact same \u0022gameplay\u0022 mods but have a new place to go, a nice way to extend your play is to tinker with the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo mods in particular stand out to me as \u0022best in breed\u0022:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOuter Planets Mod (a.k.a.
