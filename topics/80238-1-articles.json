And by moderately successful I mean they don\u0027t fall to bits or explode on physics load. However. Getting it off the runway is another matter entirely. I have a few problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, I don\u0027t know what the heck is the deal with my engine. I\u0027m using the basic jet engine with B9 air intakes. My normal takeoff config is to keep on the brakes, stick the jets to full throttle and wait for them to reach peak thrust. When the jets begin to defeat the brakes, I come off the brakes and start rolling. However, as soon as I do, my thrust drops and so too does my acceleration. Even if I get airborne it still drops gradually. At some stage this usually ends in an explosion of some description. Usually in a botched takeoff abort attempt at the end of the runway. How do I stop my thrust from suddenly dropping? Is it something to do with Ferram Aerospace? Do I need \u003Cstrong\u003Eeven more\u003C/strong\u003E intakes? Or is it something else entirely?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I find that my aircraft very rarely fly in a straight line. I think it may be to do with my wing placement. I usually find that my aircraft violently pitch up or pitch down with no control input. Are my wings off? Again, I\u0027m using Ferram Aerospace and also B9 Aerospace parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T12:08:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe violent pitching is usually a sign that your CoM and CoL aren\u0027t in the right relative positions. You want the CoL just a hair behind the CoM. But remember that the CoM will change during flight as you burn fuel, unless you carefully built the plane so this doesn\u0027t happen.

You really want the Turbojet or RAPIER to get to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m puzzled by the reported loss of thrust. Do you have the right-click menu open and are actually seeing thrust decrease there despite the throttle remaining at full? This might have something to do with FAR\u0027s aerodynamics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut OTOH it could be B9. B9 hasn\u0027t had an official update in a long time, since 0.22 at the latest, so in its natural state it doesn\u0027t really work well in 0.24 (and with the 0.24 version of FAR). There are some patches other folks have made for it since then but they\u0027re hard to find sometimes and I can\u0027t vouch for them. I would seriously research this issue before using B9.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agifem","CreatedById":115777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T12:09:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout the throttle : I\u0027m lacking an explanation. Maybe a little more intake will help, but i think any small plane can fly with a single intake. Maybe you are reaching terminal velocity at takeoff (about 100 m/s at sea level), and your single small engine fails to fight the heavy mass of your plane. Someone more knowledgable might help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the handling : Activate SAS, it\u0027s really not an option. If that\u0027s not enough, check your center of mass (CoM) and center of lift (CoL). They should be close to each other, with the CoM a little more to the front if you want the plane to be more stable at high speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the brakes : Even if jet engines take a moment to start, holding the brakes has never been necessary for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout Ferram : No idea what that mod does.

The most baffling thing is that this happens only when the brakes are let off and the craft begins rolling. Until then thrust still rises! It could be FAR or it could be B9 intakes. I\u0027m using community fixes on the B9 parts as there hasn\u0027t been an official release since 0.22. The cockpits, gear and wings seem to work fine, but it could be the intakes. I\u0027m no coding genius.
