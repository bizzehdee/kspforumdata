Preferably stock-alike and with IVA. I know that the stock space shuttle-like pod is a 4-crew pod, but I\u0027m looking for something like a capsule to put on a rocket. I searched the forum, but only found one such mod.\n\nI like the look of [Lithobrake Exploration Technologies\u0027s](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130517-1-0-4-WIP-Alpha-Lithobrake-Exploration-Technologies-0-2-%282015-08-03%29) pod, but I\u0027m wondering what else is out there.
