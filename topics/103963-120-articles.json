I\u0027ve tried tweaking every value I can see and I\u0027ve also had a small look at making my own atmosphere, but I couldn\u0027t seem to be able to make the changes I wanted. Is there a way to get back that old shading? \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nWhat exactly is this \u0022old shading\u0022 you\u0027re talking about?

Is it possible to fix?

Removed scatterer, and no problems. Any solution to this?\n\u003E \n\nAh yes, I haven\u0027t got around to attempt to fix this. This is causes by gas giants, just disable jool from the planetsList file and everything will be back to normal.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 1/14/2016 at 11:33 AM, Sigma88 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/) I have a question for you, is it possible to change the settings of scatterer using Module Manager?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have a rescale mod and a couple of recolor mods that I would like to make compatible with scatterer, if that\u0027s even possible\n\u003E \n\nIt\u0027s not possible right now.

At least under dx11. Very nasty looking bug. I guess you\u0027re drawing ocean in the same layer as the craft or with same properties?  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, atmosphere effects start 5 pixels above the horizon. Looks really weird.   \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E It may just seem to me, or is the scatterer \u0022fog\u0022 not drawn over its ocean?  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E You can see all the bugs here, right bottom for flag and left for horizon.\n\u003E \n\nFor the 5 pixels above the horizon, there\u0027s a setting in the UI, it\u0027s called experimental view offset or seomthing like that, play with it. For the flag, I will fix it later. The fog is indeed drawn over the ocean though, you can toggle postprocessing on and off and see how it is.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 1/13/2016 at 2:14 AM, Noblejms said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am having a problem with this mod (it is nonetheless fantastic though, can\u0027t play without it now!). When flying up, I can see horizontal thin black lines at the edge of the horizon.  It\u0027s like a thin border.  Digging through old posts here, people seem to refer to it as the \u0022antialising problem\u0022.  The thing is that there are too many different feedbacks on this problem.  Some say it can\u0027t be fixed, some say to enable DirectX 11, some say to use stock anti-aliasing, and some say enable Nvidia anti-aliasing and disable stock anti-aliasing.  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What is the most updated solution to the think black line caused by anti-aliasing?  Thank you guys!\n\u003E \n\nThere are multiple causes for this, in some video modes it may go away over terrain but still remains on the edge between ocean and horizon. Doesn\u0027t really have a fix for now that won\u0027t cause other problems. Though in the future I\u0027m planning to build the scattering effects directly in the terrain shader, and other than some other new effects this should allow, it should fix the black lines on the edges."},{"CreatedByName":"MrMeeb","CreatedById":84238,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-16T12:01:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 minutes ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What exactly is this \u0022old shading\u0022 you\u0027re talking about?
