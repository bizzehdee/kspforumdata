Moar is generally better. Which one is \u0022best\u0022 is a matter of debate; as a rule, you can\u0027t go wrong with RAM Intakes or the old-style Radial intakes; two radials are roughly equivalent to a RAM. Put them towards the back of your craft if you want good dynamic stability (they tend to have high drag ratings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- About 1.15 units of lift per tonne of takeoff weight (~2.3 tonnes per Delta Wing). A craft-wide lift:mass ratio of 1:1 is easier to remember and provides more lift than you should need in most cases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasic Jets do suck as main ascent engines; where they excel is low-speed, low-altitude flight where they have insane specific impulse values. They\u0027re particularly useful in VTOL applications and at those low altitudes the Circular Intake will provide sufficient air for their operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make a reasonable guess as to how much LF and oxidizer you\u0027ll need based on the engine selection you make - 40 units times the maximum takeoff weight (in tonnes) your engine selection is capable of, and 25 units times max take off weight in oxidizer. That\u0027s assuming you\u0027re going with RAPIER engines - in truth, if you\u0027ve got a decent TWR on the runway (say, somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.2 or higher) and a high intake:engine ratio your jet engines should be capable of reaching orbital velocity on their own and you shouldn\u0027t need that much delta-V to circularize. Enough fuel for 400 m/s or so of rocket thrust for circularization is generally a safe assumption given the recommended ascent profiles, though I myself have been able to get a spaceplane up to orbit with just over 50 m/s of delta-V before (that was with a pair of turbojets that had serious intake spam going on - 0.09 intake area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old fuel rule used to be one Mk1 fuselage per engine. Nowadays there\u0027s not much reason to not use the Mk2 tank - it provides four times as much fuel with a slightly better mass:fuel ratio as compared to 4 Mk1 fuselages and it provides a not inconsequential amount of lift. The amount of oxidizer provided in a Mk1-2 adapter is generally more than sufficient for most orbital ops. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general you want to keep your ascent profile shallow; a climb rate of no greater than 100 m/s is what you want and the lower you can get it during that period where your jets have maximum thrust, the better. As a rule, if your surface velocity is rising rapidly, you\u0027re ascending too quickly; if it\u0027s barely budging, you\u0027re not ascending fast enough.
