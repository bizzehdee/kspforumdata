But you could look into this thread to see if it helps, I haven\u0027t tried it in 1.4.1 to see if it works yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1634785982\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139128-12x13-memgraph-1103-with-stutter-reduction/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022background-color:#fcfcfc;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.1);color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nI was\u00A0reading\u00A0that\u00A0unity garbage is also generated by your FPS. So you could try capping it in the system configuration in KSP. With mine uncapped, I can have FPS well into the hundreds but makes it pause every so often.\u00A0 You\u00A0could also be\u00A0getting null reference errors and other mod conflicts which can cause issues, but no log provided so can\u0027t check. You can see them with Alt-F12 debug in game menu and output to log.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nIn my experience I\u00A0found some parts from mods can cause this issue to occur more often, but it is hard to pin down since it depends on system config, mods, versions, ship builds and other issues. You can use the above mod to at least see the garbage collection occurring and play around with FPS cap, mods and other items too work on reducing the stutter. No guarantees on a solid fix that I know of though. If you put up a log, people may check it over for issues.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe log location has changed, you can find it as shown below on windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nC:\\Users\\Unsername\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Squad\\Kerbal Space Program\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
