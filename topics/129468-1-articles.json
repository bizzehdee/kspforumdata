They got frightened quickly, and ran away. A few times, an Albatross 2 mating call was heard (engines revving), and the calls were usually responded to by a Ravenspear Mk2 aero-spike engine. No calls from Albatross 1\u0027s were ever recorded, and it is extremely hard to locate any of the aforementioned species on Kerbin, as they may be near extinction.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.92;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:26pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb style=\u0022font-weight:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;color:#272a34;background-color:#fbfbfb;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003EOTHER GUY: \u201CThe last Albatross 1 was piloted to extinction by Jeb\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.92;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:26pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb style=\u0022font-weight:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;color:#272a34;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003EME: \u201CYes, Jebediah Kerman did manage to find, capture and kill an Albatross 1, speculated as the last in existence. It was realized that Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Incorporated was a business kept aloft by poaching- mostly in the areas of the Ravenspear Mk2 (due to it\u0027s high-end aerospike). Jebediah Kerman was later captured, fired from the Kerbal Space Center, and incarcerated until execution. The Kerbal Space Center later failed because of that loss, and closed down permanently\u201D.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.92;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:26pt;\u0022\u003E\nMakes me wonder, what if we get someone to make a career mode in which the player uses science and skill\u00A0to find the traces of the near extinct Albatross 1, 2 and Ravenspear Mk2 species? Perhaps, in the end of the career, the player will have to incarcerate one of the species, bringing it to a \u0022zoo\u0022 (or somethin\u0027).
