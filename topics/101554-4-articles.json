They are initially docked, and then I undock. After that it\u0027s from the ports trying to dock, but being blocked by parts of the ship. They get close enough to attract, but can\u0027t dock. Something about how it calculates the physics makes the active ship pull the inactive ship to it, where it gently collides, causing acceleration. Once the clamps are a certain distance apart, they continue to provide acceleration. I\u0027m thinking it isn\u0027t calculating the same pull on the active vs inactive halfs of the ship.\n\nI think if I hit the ramp more carefully, I could keep the clamp forces attracting between the two halves. With any luck, it continue to provide acceleration during the jump.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSecond attempt. Using trim instead of SAS to try to accelerate. **35.7m/s** prior to hitting the ramp.
