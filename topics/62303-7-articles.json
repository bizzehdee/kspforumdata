So i\u0027m not entirely sure what goes wrong in your code, as it seems to do the same thing. I did eventually come up with a completely different way of handling additional stars. Since there should only be one star active at anytime anyway, instead of creating new sun and flare components and adding them to the stars I simply do a calculation to see which is currently the closest star and set Sun.instance.sun to the celestialbody of that closest sun. Works like a charm and saves a lot of hassel with handling the different parameters. As for my mod, it is currently capable of instantiating new Stars (got it to work by spitting through Krag\u0027s PF:CE code), moving the standard planets to one of those stars, modifying the standard Sun and handling the Starlight. Let me know if you\u0027re interested in any of my code. As for your friend\u0027s modified instantiated Eve, that sounds cool. I\u0027ve only instantiated minmus and the sun so far, and only messed with their basic parameters, haven\u0027t gotten around to start messing with the PQS attributes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eps.
