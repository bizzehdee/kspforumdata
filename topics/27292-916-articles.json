Pulled a bunch of unnecessary parts off of my rocket, namely the 120 or so retro-oriented Sepatron motors that I was using to deorbit my first and second stages after separation. Pulled all the science stuff off of my first lander (from my most recent post, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/27292-what-did-you-do-in-ksp-today/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2457610\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E), added some Sepatrons to the lander for a probably unnecessary boost back into orbit, and trimmed a lot of struts. The biggest change I made, however, was attaching a buggy to the top of the lander. I put pressure, seismic, atmospheric, thermometer, mystery goo, and surface scanning experiments on the buggy, so I had some science to do while I drove around. Initially, I wanted to build a little ground station, and install the seismometer the way it\u0027s supposed to be installed, but that ended up not being a practical solution, because I wanted to do the other experiments multiple times in different biomes\u00A0(this is sandbox, so I was merely roleplaying with the science), for a proper sampling of the Dunar surface.\u00A0I tested the buggy\u0027s chutes-only descent on Kerbin, and then added Moar\u00A0Chutes\u2122 for Duna\u0027s atmo, but it still ended up looking something like a 20-25m/s descent fully deployed. More on that later.\u00A0Part count is down to ~445 for the entire rocket, and delta-V is up to ~8500m/s. Found out the hard way that once I undock\u00A0from my transfer vehicle in Duna orbit, it disappears from my map because there weren\u0027t any control units.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also burned straight into a Duna encounter, skipping LKO entirely. Probably pretty inefficient. I also didn\u0027t bother matching my Kerbolar orbit to Duna\u0027s, so I ended up coming at Duna at an angle\u00A0on my way back towards Kerbol. Funny thing is, I actually got to Duna with my second stage, and didn\u0027t even use my nukes until it was time for an orbital insertion. Ended up using about half of my ~2800m/s getting my Duna periapsis down to 30km. Then, it was a waiting game, as I had already used way more fuel than I\u0027d planned on the intercept, I resigned to multiple aerocapture passes. Took probably 7 or 8 passes before my apoapsis came down from 15000km to 100km, but at that point, my periapsis dropped to 19km, so I had do do some correction burns to bring my periapsis back to a safe altitude, and then fixed my apoapsis so my transfer vehicle wouldn\u0027t aerocapture while I was planetside.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen came the hard part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInitially, I had planned on putting Valentina in the Buggy\u0027s command seat so that on descent, I could switch to her and deploy the chutes, and monitor the buggy\u0027s descent velocity (you can see her helmet in a few of the screenshots, before I came to my senses). After my first aerocapture however, I realized that Valentina was probably going to combust if she was exposed on the descent. I toyed with the idea of EVAing during descent, and trying to get her into the command seat after the deceleration down to descent speed, but again, I quickly came to my senses. Also I didn\u0027t have any ladders, so it would\u0027ve been a total action-movie move trying to RCS her way to the command seat while rapidly descending toward the Dunar (?) surface\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can see in the screens that on my first descent attempt, I decoupled the buggy pretty high up, did a quick burn with my lander to get some separation so the buggy wouldn\u0027t drop right on top of my lander. This was when I found out that I needed at least one more pair of drogues, as the front wheels were destroyed on touchdown. I brought Bill and a drill along for such an occasion, unfortunately, I wasn\u0027t expecting the glitch that made my rover hop, flip, and explode, when I tried to repair the wheels. Anybody else have that problem? Somebody should make a Buggy Jack as an EVA item! Anyway, I ended up having to revert back to descent, and try about 50 times to get the buggy to land without breaking the front wheels, or anything on my lander. It was an extremely tedious, and delicate maneuver. In the end, I broke one of my lander\u0027s solar panels, but that was it. It was time to have some fun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nExcept not, because wheel physics. Ended up skating a lot, and at around 20m/s, the rover would fishtail, hop into the air, tumble a few times, and then explode. I had planned on driving to the big canyon about 1000km away, and then to the north pole, but at that point (it was around 2AM) I didn\u0027t have the patience for the trek. I also realized it\u0027d be mean to leave Bill behind twiddling his... whatevers... while Valentina zipped around in a sweet buggy, so I called it a night.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI touched down with about 99.98% of my lander\u0027s fuel, so I know it can get back to orbit. I\u0027m gonna go add an extra seat to the buggy, and figure out a better buggy deployment method. Oh, and read up on how to do a more efficient Duna encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/8zgzg/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Puggonaut","CreatedById":212145,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-15T18:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222452156\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002227292\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457694276\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022140980\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Proteus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/03/2016 at 11:04 AM, Proteus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni was derping with jump beacons mod and finally got it to work on 1.0.5,than i managed to put epl/oks station in the orbit of thahmo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngot some fresh rocket part supplies to the station and build a funky space plane...need to bring more engineers to the station,so far i got 9 only and 2 pilots for the \u0022run ways\u0022.\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i65.tinypic.com/eg3v7.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eg3v7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://i65.tinypic.com/eg3v7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i66.tinypic.com/1z4hc0j.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00221z4hc0j.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://i66.tinypic.com/1z4hc0j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003Ei really like neidon without a doubt my favorite gas giant\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i67.tinypic.com/23m0c95.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002223m0c95.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://i67.tinypic.com/23m0c95.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i65.tinypic.com/23v1ais.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002223v1ais.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://i65.tinypic.com/23v1ais.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003Ethatmo landing on this bird,was \u0022fun\u0022\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i63.tinypic.com/1zq6btc.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00221zq6btc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://i63.tinypic.com/1zq6btc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003Eafter 5-6\u00A0failed landing attempts i realized that this is not the most ideal lander for thathmo because of its \u0022aggressive\u0022 terrain that filled with slopes....but than the most derpy and amazing thing happen to me that can only happen in ksp,i hit the ground with 5ms,trying to do fancy landing and aim for my best,the lander hit the ground flipped a lil bit and i managed perfectly land with out any problems.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0only in ksp!\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i65.tinypic.com/2w7k3ll.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00222w7k3ll.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://i65.tinypic.com/2w7k3ll.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i68.tinypic.com/snjbpd.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022snjbpd.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://i68.tinypic.com/snjbpd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003Eso far away from mother kerbin!
