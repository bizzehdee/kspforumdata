Ha, well without encroaching on what you currently have, I could offer GIS if you wish.\n\nEffectively you are building one into the game, by adding the place names physically (an idea which I love, as you can easily mechjeb yourself to a feature!). However, if you want alternatives I can provide these. \n\nI\\\u0027m interested to know what method of gridding/interpolation quikgrid uses. I\\\u0027ve used nat-neighbour for mine - it doesn\\\u0027t really matter much as the spatial resolution is so low, its just a query as I have never seen that program before! \n\n@Togfox\n\nYeah they have a pretty steep learning curve, but are incredibly useful, and generally massive time savers. \n\nI would keep the data in a geodatabase, which I could export to CSV in any header format you wish. \n\nTo be honest, discovering and naming these places isn\\\u0027t really my cup of tea. I just saw the remote sensing that you guys have managed to achieve, and figured I might be able to help/offer skills. However, you seem to already have done/are doing much of it! \n\nThe elevation maps seem to provide targets for further exploration, and I can offer terrain analysis of any that are produced. This could be slope angle maps (maybe useful for identifying possible landing/base sites), Aspect Ratio Maps (for quantitatively defining mountainous regions), Volumetrics, Potential Hydrology.... etc. \n\nIn the case of defining mountainous regions, it would be a simple process to define what classifies as a mountain based upon a global relative aspect ratio, and then auto-generate a map of the mountainous areas. This could then be explored in kerpson (kerbal person lol!) to confirm if the areas are indeed what the computer says. \n\nJust an idea for ya, and as I say its a quick 5-10 min job for me. I simply set up a workflow with the parameters we decide and bam its done. \n\nI had a really crazy/stupid idea of running a hydrological analysis on Kerbin, and producing a prediction map of rivers.
