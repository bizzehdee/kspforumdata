Comprised of two \u0022empty\u0022 truss segments, two radiator and electrical trusses, and the construction bot needed to install them, the Si-3 was an order of magnitude smaller than the Si-2.

(It was \u0022Cost cutting, ja?\u0022 according to Wernher.) Given it was to direct rendezvous with Kelgee Station this wasn\u0027t expected to be an issue, but was still noted for inclusion in the next round of \u0022don\u0027t do this\u0022 posters for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.

This served two ends: the orbital stage of the Cantata includes \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, which would come in handy during the installation of the new trusses, and the extra fuel was needed at the station for the upcoming \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E hunt. The one downside being the orbital stage would likely become a permanent piece of debris in a station-intercepting orbit.

That gave Rondous a bit more time to prepare the remote control system for the heavy installation steps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first step after rendezvous was to drop the two empty trusses at the zenith of the station. Following that, the station\u0027s construction bot Gerty (voiced by none other than Kevin Spacey) moved to the aft key node, where it would receive the radiator trusses.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(At some point in this dance Gerty relocated the former science pod to the port docking arm.

Various sets of (invisible) coolant hoses ran the length of the trusses, one end to be attached to the core and its various cooling systems, the other end to assist with cooling the RTGs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerty was more than up to the challenge of placing the two segments into place. The sun set following the installation of the second truss, and so construction was suspended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160215_ksp0139_si-dsh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160215_ksp0139_si-dsh.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWork resumed when the Sun was back on the proper side of Kerbin. The entire port solar truss assembly had to be removed to relocate the two solar array trusses for the Silicon Deep-Space Habitat. This was in part due to the need for the inner two solar arrays to stay retracted, and part due to slightly bad planning. (Because life would\u0027ve been easier had the two solar array trusses been moved first.) Once the port truss assembly was clear, the Si-3 moved in to install its two \u0022empty\u0022 trusses. The port truss assembly was then painstakingly reinstalled by Gerty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160215_ksp0146_si-dsh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160215_ksp0146_si-dsh.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160215_ksp0149_si-dsh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160215_ksp0149_si-dsh.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfterwards the two outer solar truss sections of the port solar truss were disconnected and installed onto the Si-DSH. The Si-3, now devoid of purpose, was docked to an open port on the port docking arm.

That includes all three computer cores, telemetry systems, life support recycling, and basic short-range communications systems. Should the crew keep a data link open to one of the Neon Heavies for the entire trip, the EC consumption would only go up by 10-20%.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick back-o\u0027-the-envelope check of the electrical performance of the four large solar arrays indicated they _should_ produce in the neighborhood of 0.9 EC/s at peak operating semi-major axis for the mission.

This long process involved removing two strut plates from the Silicon 2\u0027s tug, retrieving six more strut plates from the two trunks, and then attaching the strut plates to the Hab and the truss assemblies where needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the strut plates in place and bolted down, Rondous could then run the strut cables between them and tighten everything down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(His actual first task was to remove two of the solar panels from the temporary drive section of the Si-DSH / future tug and rotate them 180 degrees, but attempting to do so only resulted in Bad Things, so that plan was scrapped.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160215_ksp0176_si-dsh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160215_ksp0176_si-dsh.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160215_ksp0181_si-dsh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160215_ksp0181_si-dsh.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext Rondous had the heart warming job of installing the two RTGs on the solar truss assemblies. Really these could have gone anywhere provided they were within reach of the cooling system\u0027s hoses. Nobody was quite sure why RTGs, designed to use their heat efficiently to excite electrons and thus provide current flow, would need an additional cooling aid, but several instances of overheating and random explosions had been theorized, and Wernher didn\u0027t want to take any chances.

Her transmitter was a bit on the weak side, in the 5 to 10 Watt range, so her \u0022Queen of the Airwaves\u0022 show could only really be heard by the few folks living along the equator, but a team of enterprising kerbals had set up repeaters so that others could tune in from various other locales.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo RTGs at Baile Speir, and little in the way of hospitality, so R\u0026amp;G set off for their next Thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160219_ksp0220_n-tc-12.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160219_ksp0220_n-tc-12.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160219_ksp0229_n-tc-12.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022590\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160219_ksp0229_n-tc-12.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRondous took his logbook with him this time when he EVA\u0027d. \u0022Similar in design to the previous \u0027new\u0027 station, Piquemetami 2 appears to have been evacuated in a hurry.\u0022 The name of this station had been easy enough to come by - it was printed on everything. Even the towels in the hab\u0027s showers (showers? wash rooms? drowning chambers?) had the name embroidered on them. Piquemetami 2. Such a strange name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe bounced along the station\u0027s lone corridor, which ran from the 4-kerbal habitat at one end to the lab at the other. Experiments were floating loose and damaged in the lab, small blobs of potentially dangerous fluid gave Rondous a bit of pause. Two experiment craft were docked with the station, one supposedly having returned from one of the moons, if the logs were to be believed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strangeness behind the empty station was perhaps explained by the three damaged solar arrays, though why such a small loss of power would cause a crew to abandon station was something unfathomable to Rondous. As with other such finds, there was still a craft docked. This time it at least had something resembling a heat shield protruding from the edges. Still, how did the crew escape?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecording of the flight logs had stopped abruptly some years past. Exactly how many years would be a matter for debate, and more precisely determined once the\u00A0ground crews had a chance to evaluate the data. Still, as with Piquemetami 1, everything looked new. Very new. And as before, he opened up the communications to Kerbin, made sure things were ship-shape, then started back towards his own ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again, there were no RTGs to be found.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160219_ksp0232_n-tc-12.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160219_ksp0232_n-tc-12.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey arrived at their next target in the dark.

I dropped my snacks! Can\u0027t breathe....\u0022 The water from his suit bottle shot past him as it sought escape from the pressures of existence. Rondous gasped for air and hurriedly put his EVA helmet back on, wasting no time in making for the exit. (Perhaps it was a bad idea to take his helmet off before checking the atmosphere? The other stations with their perfect air had made him a bit complacent.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160219_ksp0239_n-tc-12.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160219_ksp0239_n-tc-12.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the rush his suit had bleed off all of its oxygen, leaving him with nothing to breathe during his very rapid trip back to the Nitrogen. His suit had trapped some air in it, but that was all in the lower body. His eyes were stinging as he made it back into the N-TC-12\u0027s orbital module. Gletrix had already helmeted up and was preparing to jump out and grab him, which thankfully wasn\u0027t needed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe did manage to catch the name of the ship - \u0022Lore of the Adventure\u0022, though it had nothing in the way of communications equipment and was powered solely by two small solar panels on its side. Somehow. Rondous was tempted to steal one of their antennas and place it on the small station, but there was no way the small panel could provide enough energy to keep it broadcasting. He wasn\u0027t even sure there was a flight computer on board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving lost a days worth of food, Gletrix and Rondous considered aborting the mission then and there. They were on the exact opposite side of the planet from Kelgee Station, and catching up to Baile Speir would require an orbit that was somewhat inside the atmosphere. A quick check of the orbital map showed another target nearby, so they decided to press on with their two days worth of supplies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir next target turned out to be something gigantic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160219_ksp0244_n-tc-12.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160219_ksp0244_n-tc-12.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was tumbling slightly, so Gletrix was nervous about bringing the ship in too close. Obviously a station of some sort, it resembled nothing else they had encountered to date. A long spindle with fuel and solar arrays at one end and four spokes at the other. At the end of two of these spokes were two craft that didn\u0027t appear to be atmospheric craft of any sort.

None of the airlocks\u00A0had a way in from the outside - no handles, no latches, nothing. He moved from window to window, hoping to see someone, anyone on the inside that could let him in.
