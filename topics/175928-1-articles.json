Reverting to previous kopernicus didn\u0027t fix it, and after removing and replacing mods one by one again, I found the issue to be with SVE and OPM. The game would work fine if I included all mods except the SVE\u00A0folder. Same if I included all (including kopernicus) but the OPM folder.\u00A0However, with just SVE, OPM, and their dependencies, I get the same kopernicus error and I can\u0027t figure out why or how to fix it.
