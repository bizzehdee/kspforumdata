I started using it after the first Falcon X Jumbo so its not like I need it. But I realized that I knew almost every trick to \u0022clip\u0022 with out the no-clip option. Most users have parts clipping even if they dont know it and even if they hate clipping. Squad made clipping harder in 0.19 or something, dont remember the version but before that it was super easy clipping any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost tricks still works with some tweaks but why fiddle with that when you cn use no-clip and save 4 hours of frustration? I only have rules that part should have there own space like engines or intakes etc. Very little overlap allowed. But every one has there own rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKissSh0t, have you tried 4 jet engines as I suggested? I think you could get airborne with as little as 4, 6 at the most. There is a fine balance between adding more fuel and more engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you can climb at 45 degrees from the runway at 50m/s or more you should have enough jets. Make sure you have enough lift to. Remember jets pick up power higher up and also if you cant run them at full trust where they are needed, at 32km altitude the less efficient they are since there trust to wight ratio is poorer compared to fewer once working at max trust. You want to be able to run all of them at full power at 32-33km no throttling down until you get to your target speed and start climbing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm pretty sure 4-6 engines can get that bird to 2000m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne turbojet can hull 16-17 tons from the runway and hit 2000m/s at 33km altitude so thats a good estimate on max take off wight. Every tone less then that will give a huge performance boost but that boost is not needed if you cant do anything with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember if your going to other planets, jets are dead wight so less is more as they say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there is a point where two few jets will burn more fuel in tonnage then adding two more jets instead or more fuel. But you will easily notice this. You want to climb at 100m/s max and no lower then 20m/s the first 32km. After that when going for space vertical speed is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther then that your craft looks good and promising.

Oh, and most KSP players I know consider intake spam using a lot of intakes for a single engine, doesn\u0027t matter where or how they are placed, so a 6-1 intake/jet ratio is \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E going to be intake spam for purists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if I and the rest of us are cheating, then I am afraid you are doing so too. Doesn\u0027t matter if you put the intakes so each is selectable (which I do mostly out of convienience in setting action groups), or if you put them all in the same attachment point. You don\u0027t save weight, you don\u0027t save drag, you get the same gameplay as if every one of them was in its own individual strut. Hardly what \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E consider cheating. And you still have working air intakes submerged in rocket fuel without taking any volume, BTW. Just in case you feel proud or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a final note. Being able to clip parts is all about more options. It is risky, and inexperienced KSP player will encounter a lot of problems until they learn what works and what doesn\u0027t (have you found out what happens when you clip a shielded docking port on a strut and try docking? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). So it only makes sense the programmers try to make a building UI that doesn\u0027t let you break the game (as much as they can, of course). But once you know the rules, all it really does is expand the options you have when putting parts together. And for me, more option is always good, it enriches my gaming experience, and you are always free to not use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

It is a stupefyingly beautiful design in real life, and is one that I felt would lend it\u0027s self well to an SSTO conversion in this game. I\u0027ve finally managed something I\u0027m happy with. It isn\u0027t a nuts and bolts recreation of the Valkyrie in SSTO form, as that would essentially be impossible with stock parts (ooh la la, those curves!), but it is one that I hope maintains the \u0022flavor\u0022 of the original.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZSLpkCF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZSLpkCF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a fully capable SSTO with Docking ability, and has enough guts in the upper atmosphere to make the burn up to orbital apoapsis nice and short.
