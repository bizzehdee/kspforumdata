Small question when I want to post something I get a notification a moderator has to approve it, is this normal or did I miss something at the rules?\n\nIt is normal. The first three posts from a new user have to be approved by a moderator, this cuts down heavily on the spam that makes it to the forum (we kill dozens of spambots weekly). One more post and you\u0027ll be unrestricted in your posting.\n\nWelcome aboard!"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T20:39:23Z","Content":"\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_vIKG11198Q?start=448\u0026feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nWelcome aboard!\n\nSmallFatFetus"}]}
