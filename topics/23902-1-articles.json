G unless remapped will activate the landing legs that is used for support during loading or unloading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere also seems to be a delay of 30-40 sec before key number 9 works so you might have to hammer it at the start of a new mission but later it should work fine. I have that problem on all crafts where I map landing gears to an action key for some reason. There are also drogue parachutes that can be used by stage once more but for some reason they seem to act as if deployed so you might have to go EVA and repack them before reaching the target body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey can be cut with Key 1, I ran out of action keys so I did it that way so there on the same key as jet engine pare one. They can be manually activated safely if one is high enough also if staging wont work properly, do not seem to work if repacked and new stage is created.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we have the \u0022Falcon IX\u0022. its pure crew transport and can go to Duna at least so much I have tested. have not tested Laythe but in theory I think it might be possible due to the oxygen atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no accent profile for this craft but as fare as I recall it has no engines or intakes directly on the fuel tanks and that allows air intake to reach 0.01 no mater if all engines are running or not so its a lot simpler to know when flame out will happen. But the Falcon VIIIB is very similar so view that video if you need help on the ascent profile.

Its similar to the later Falcon IX but has less fuel of its own and uses the lift capacity for cargo. Its a good LKO craft that can be used to build space stations and it can hull 36T to 500km orbit at least from what I recall with a proper accent profile. There is also the Falcon VIII and it has less ISP sens it uses two LV-30 plus two LV-N instead for 4x LV-N but its faster at climbing and should be good for at least 350km LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck my Video for ascent profile but be aware that the Falcon VIIIB Cargo Transporter needs longer time to get up in orbit then the Falcon VIII Cargo Transport in the video but I would recommend the Falcon VIII Cargo Transport as a practice craft and the go over to the Falcon VIIIB Cargo Transport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are som pictures and the video is of the first version that has less range then the later B version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/DzT0X6lFdNk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/DzT0X6lFdNk\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img21/2059/screenshot197n.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot197n.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img823/1233/screenshot153k.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot153k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img51/7613/screenshot172c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot172c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is the \u0022Falcon VIB\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was built specifically for Laythe and back with out refueling.

A decent PC is recommended and reentry effects should be set to off if the light show is not to important to you or else sett it to the lowest it will render reentry effects at, that will save time reentering sens thats is pretty laggy on the bigger SSTO spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on craft I have probably 20-60 fps with most settings on the highest and 1920x1080 and about 0.5x real time during flight but its perfectly playable on my i7 and GTX570 under wine and linux. Any decent intel Core i5 or later AMD CPU should do and a decent graphic card like a GTX560 or better I would say for the bigger crafts that are 800 parts or more for a good experience. I do run wine still sens the linux client is slower for me so it might run a lot smoother for windows users then me so its hard for me to say how demanding this thing will be in specific cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the download file and it will be updated with new SSTO spaceplanes as they are developed and tested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPleas dont post the link any ware else.

Refueling means you need at least one more craft and make another trip just to refuel the first one. Also if that means using rockets or drooping fuel tanks the howl point of a SSTO spaceplane is lost. Makes very little sens to me. Refueling and then docking is a way to extend the range of the limits of your current designs. If that can be overcome thats preferable. As it seems now with the Jumbo transport I can go almost anywhere with on tank of fuel so fine RCS control and docking is less important but its there if needed and any user can make changes to the craft. Some extra RCS thrusters are not gonna screw it up. IF you want to stay some where with any of my craft you can. No one is forcing you to return. And if you want to you can, no refueling required. And if you want to refuel for some reason you can. Almost all have docking ports and all RCS thrusters needed. if not its easy enough to add. Sens there mostly cargo hullers any way that usually means the user has to outfit it with a payload any way so I usually make small modifications that fits the mission any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had two space stations in orbit and used those for refueling but as range got better on my crafts I stop using them last year.

Do real crafts like blackbird have problems flying at 85000 feet at mach3.2? Do the Skylon concept use more then one intake per engine? No I didnt think so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal problem is not enough air intake its the speed of the intake that needs regulation, thats why high speed crafts like blackbird or the proposed Skylon uses a nosecone for the engines to limit the speed of the incoming air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso at such speeds at Mach 5.5 that the skylon tops out on in theory on traditional jet propulsion the problem is still not the amount of air but the heat that is generated by the friction. 1000C intake air at mach 5.5. thats why they dont use jets at those speeds because no one has cooled such hot air fast enough and reliably until recently. The heat exchanger for the skylon has been ground tested to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the way I see it intakes in KSP are unrealistic and nerfed and also make player think this is how it works. What we need is intakes for different functions. Turbofan intakes for low speed, Max Mach1 and high fuel efficiency and trust. For high speed crafts up to Mach 3 wee need intakes that are a bit less efficient in terms of fuel use (to balance the game play) but is capable of controlling air intake speeds and allow for Mach 3-3.5 and over that the engine should overheat and be destroyed. To go past Mach 3 we would need heat exchangers like the skylon. It would be like 1ton part and be able to cool air to stop the engine from overheating up to say mach 6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd no I dont like intake abuse for the fact that its due to badly conceived intakes in KSP. Devs should fix them to reflect reality a bit more and that would add to the game play to sens most use ramair intakes any way for most stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil then its intake abuse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Peekie30","CreatedById":63795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T14:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI crashed the X Jumbo... it was beautiful\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exothermos","CreatedById":41827,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T19:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to post to tell you that I think your designs are brilliant.

Past mach 3 the air would get so hot most jets would melt any way. Theres a reason the SR-71 blackbird was built the way it was. Also the second problem would be supersonic airspeeds of the intake air. A real intakes job is also to slow that to subsonic. The howl Ramair idea seems kind of dumb to me. Just look at the SR-71 blackbird with its variable nose cone and from what I can tell the Saber engine on the Skylon will use something similar. Also to solve the hot air problem the Saber engine would incorporate an intecooler and that is under testing IRL and that would help cool the 1000C hot air at mach 5.5. Becuse thats how hot air gets due to friction etc at those speeds and that would ruin a modern jet engine. So I would rater see that engines where limited in speed due to temperature and limited to altitude. Not to intake air thats a factor of both speed and altitude like it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would rater see a new intake with a Fan for efficient subsonic flights and a new Nosecone intake for high speed high altitude flights but that is less efficient in fuel at low speed and altitude. Some intermediate intake to of more traditional design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intecooler part s already in the game, tough not that good looking its there but have zero use atm. The faster you fly the hotter en engine should get until it fails. The intecooler should allow for higher speeds before that happens, say mach 5-6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be 1-1.5 tons to as a penalty. For high flying crafts there might be the option for a second part that is an extra compressor stage for the jet or maybe a howl new jet that is a bit longer like the LN-1 nerva that would offer higher compression ratio and I think that would make sens for high flying crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my Idea of a intercoolec jet engine with a more realistically working intake (airospike is a substitute for the intake here) that would be more limited by altitude then speed so you would not have to spam the intakes and also spaming would not help. Many engines might share intakes and that would have negative consequences but once an engine is saturated altitude will limit it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also added the intercooler that would be useful for SSTO spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/497/t8zq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022t8zq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
