The satellite (it will be the first one ever in orbit.) not only that but you\u0027ll win a 100 K$ bet (your boss doesn\u0027t really have 100 K$) if you do it with only liquid engines. If you fail you get fired if you win you will be loved by your boss. ( Not really much but hey its better than getting fired) To win this challenge you have to make it to 40K meters and orbit around the Kerth till you reach a stable orbit (less than 20 ms up or down try to keep it near the zero) then let the satellite go (it doesn\u0027t haft to stay in orbit I know that it wont work that way). Also try to land on land (get it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) the Kerbinians don\u0027t know how to swim... To win send in a video please. Also a note whoever can get into a stable orbit at 40,000 m (you can go all the way to 45,500 m you can only release the satellite when in range) a bonus to whoever can land on the landing pad (minus 1min 30sec) Also you can only land at the same place as the space center landing on it will grant you a prize which is 5 minutes taken away from the clock. If you do not own FRAPS or any recording software then I will need some pictures first one of the ship with at least 1 satellite second of it in orbit and or releasing the satellite and last of the flight results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods you\u0027ll need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaturn V parts pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESunday Punches Parts Pack 9.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESIDR parts (use the satellite)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso here is the first part of my run in HD 8)! \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBXkjpaiWfY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBXkjpaiWfY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shade","CreatedById":5654,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-16T00:00:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I haven\u0027t got the several hours needed to go around Kerbin three times so this probably won\u0027t count as a success, but this rocket will nonetheless do the trick - And with stock parts only, at that, discounting the satellite itself:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img638.imageshack.us/img638/2206/stocksattelitelauncher.png\u0022 alt=\u0022stocksattelitelauncher.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had two satellites and couldn\u0027t remember which came from where, so just picked the heavier of them for this (not that there was much difference between them).

No not at all you can go to 45,500 M im say stable orbit is considered that gauge being close to the zero not at the 100 you need to keep it at less than 10.
