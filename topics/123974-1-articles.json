There were some, Regex and Klgraham included who felt career mode was disjointed and grindy enough to prevent them from using it. While I disagreed with their broader assessment, I do have to agree that at the moment the fun process of building rockets and gaining rewards and earning new parts is missing something. I\u0027ve played a good deal in stock career and found that at least for the amount of time I can reasonably set aside for KSP (probably 6-8h/wk) I generally have to set reward settings rather generously to progress without feeling like Im bogging down. While there are many aspects of the game that are obviously incomplete, experience and building tiers for instance, I\u0027ve grown to feel the most established but lagging component to the game is the Science system. Squad made a nice pass on the Tech tree, which was great and helped, but I think didn\u0027t address the fundamental issue. I don\u0027t personally have a problem with the general concept of experiments producing points which then can be spent on a tech tree. It\u0027s simple enough to understand and broad enough to accommodate most play-styles. One problem, I think, is that the actual act of planning and conducting experiments isn\u0027t actually very exciting. Another deeper problem is that for many players the Tech Tree is the objective of the game, so once its complete the reward structure ends and they feel like the game is over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few reasons for this, which I thought we could consider as we offer ideas on how to improve the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) KSP is a rather unique game, wherein not only craft but play-styles are near infinite. This means that any science system has to be flexible enough to let people play the way they want to play and still set clear rules and incentives for progression. Additionally players start careers with varying levels of experience, so any successful science system needs to not only serve as a tool for introducing new parts and concepts to first time players, but remain fun and challenging for veterans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) KSP isn\u0027t a game with a \u0022win\u0022 condition. Its a creative building game with costs and incentives, much like Simcity. This means that the scaling of the tech-tree and the meaning of science points once its complete is more difficult to gauge than in most games. When stretched thin the game becomes a grind, and when condensed things become too easy and players max out quickly and no longer know what to do. Strategies were implemented in part to deal with this, allowing players to exchange mountains of excess science for funds for instance, but once a player has a maxed out tech tree and a million bazzillion funds they are essentially playing sandbox. That seems an odd end-game reward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) And this is important, KSP is at its heart an indie game that bats way above its weight. Its incredible what they\u0027ve achieved, but Squad is a small company and development time is desperately precious. What I think would is most helpful is sussing out the precise issues causing problems and finding succinct corrections that would address them. I laud people\u0027s ambitious ideas, but let\u0027s try to think realistically about what changes really could be made to improve the system and the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have my own ideas, but I\u0027m interested to hear what others think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T02:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think we need another game mode that has funds without science.

Minigames could become very tedious; the challenge of executing the experiment should really be in-game. For instance, instead of a point reading the barometer could be a part that can be started and stays active, requiring a small amount of charge while running. The more of the air column it passes through while active the more it pays out. This means it could be run on a launch or during a landing, but could also be attached to drop probes and parachuted into different biomes. The seismometer could be run as part of an impactor experiment: once on the surface it detects impacts within a certain radius that would be visible from orbit in the UI. If another object is slammed into or near the circle the seismometer pays science depending upon how much the sensing radius overlaps with the impact radius. Experiments like these, while more difficult to execute, should pay out much higher than they currently do, requiring less repetition.

Its a bit dense though, Im worried it doesn\u0027t really alleviate the grind many players are experiencing.

I think this is important not just as means of basic information discovery, but also in extending the need for science after the the tech tree is complete. For instance completing a barometric scan of a planets air column could unlock trajectory and aerobreak predictions, and gravoli detectors could unlock topographic overlays and accurate distance to surface information. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn most instances its not that things are overcomplicated, its that they\u0027re complicated in the wrong ways.
