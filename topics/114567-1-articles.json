Personally I haven\u0027t used the Admin building once so I don\u0027t know if that would make any difference.\n\nThose six without deadlines are key contracts I suppose, when you do those more different choices will become available.\n\nGreets,\n\nJan"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWolf83","CreatedById":141199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T18:31:42Z","Content":"Good Answer"},{"CreatedByName":"JDCollie","CreatedById":103176,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T18:39:22Z","Content":"Contracts can be influenced by strategies indirectly, in that most contracts are offered based upon minimum reputation requirements and some strategies influence the amount of reputation you gain, but as to how often offered contracts refresh and what influences the number offered at a given time, I have no idea (and would love to know too ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) )\n\nI don\u0027t know if \u0022key\u0022 contracts count toward the maximum number of offered contracts (if there is such a maximum), but obviously it isn\u0027t much of a problem if you\u0027ve upgraded your Admin building completely. You can simply accept and ignore all of them. Still, I hope key do not count toward that, because that could be a problem earlier if you somehow end up contract bottlenecked. :\\"},{"CreatedByName":"tranenturm","CreatedById":143304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T19:02:29Z","Content":"It\u0027s unclear to me where you are in the contract pipeline. I\u0027ve only advanced partway through career, but I can tell from my own experience that more \u0022key\u0022 contracts become available as you complete previous ones. For instance, you start with the speed, distance, altitude and orbiting contracts. Once those are out, or nearly so, I\u0027ve been seeing different style contracts pop up first for Mun, then for Minimus, then for Kerbol and Duna (system). The first contracts for an area seem to be flyby related, and seem to end with Flag missions. The game tracks certain things. For instance if you do all one way probes (or cruelly send Kerbals one way) the game eventually gives you contracts to that body requesting a return type mission. Also, if you do return right away, you won\u0027t see that mission appear. \n\nAs for admin, I\u0027ve gone through to Mun and Minums landings both using and not using the Admin and haven\u0027t noticed anything (other than the resource conversions)."},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel Kola","CreatedById":147216,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T04:43:25Z","Content":"Contracts are terrible, illogical and game-breaking.
