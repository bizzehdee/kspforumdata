Those screenshots are somewhat ruined by having a flashing engine visible through the ship, as well as by the cursor sitting in the way. I would suggest that those two things toggle along with the rest of the UI when F2 is pressed."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:59:46Z","Content":"The way DRE does it is better."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T02:27:44Z","Content":"THere\u0027s a lot of things F2 needs to toggle but currently doesn\u0027t."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T12:28:45Z","Content":"Your cursor shows up in screenshots?

I\u0027ll have to see if there\u0027s a setting to make it ignore it, although as it\u0027s just something that\u0027s drawn on the KSP window, that might be difficult."},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T13:53:26Z","Content":"Have you tried using F10?
