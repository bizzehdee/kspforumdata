Nothing exploded from the heat, but I did a late deploy of the chutes (I think below 100m) while at 4x physics warp and....something happened.

Should I be going 2-3k? I rarely rely on parachutes on Duna to actually get all the way down, but I do tend to rely on them scrubbing a few hundred m/s of velocity as well as letting me float slowish to within a few dozen meters of the surface and then turn the engines back on.
