The site has been designed with that in mind and as such the only PII (personally identifiable information) that KerbalX stores about each user (those who sign\u00A0up)\u00A0is their username and email address.\u00A0\u00A0It has always been stated (in the terms) that at no point would your email address ever be shared with a 3rd party.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour \u0022right to be forgotten\u0022 has also always been present. I\u0027ve always believed that if a user creates something, that user must be able to delete it too and that has been built into the structure of the site from your User object (which stores your account settings, username, email) and every object you create (Craft, Comments, Hangars, ModPacks etc) is owned\u00A0by your User object and inherits that right to delete it. Deleting your account (deleting your User object) deletes all your associated objects;\u00A0it utterly nukes you from the site.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut what about backups? This is my first point of confusion and one I can\u0027t find any relevant information/guidelines.\u00A0 The database is backed up every day and backups are retained for a month. If you delete your account, your data is instantly removed from the site, but it will remain in the backups (and fyi, I am the only person with access to those).\u00A0\u00A0So....I\u0027m not sure what is required in this aspect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour craft are your craft. Yes, I do sometimes joke that I own the largest collection of KSP craft in the known universe, but they are your craft. I own the database that contains them, I am the curator, but you have the right to change and/or remove them whenever you want;\u00A0they are your intellectual property and you retain all rights over them.\u00A0 The only right I reserve is the right to delete a craft if it goes against the rules of the site.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne thing I might need to state is that in cases of craft that throw a bug/edge case situation or are an example of something new (ie use a partless mod which I\u0027ve not supported yet) then I will use that craft as an example test case in my local development environment. A handful (4-5) craft have ended up as part of the site\u0027s automated test suite as they represented a particular feature that I didn\u0027t have in my own craft, but most of the craft in the test suite are my own.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow here\u0027s a edge case thing. What if you are\u00A0really stupid and put your credit card information (or some other personal bit of data) into a craft\u0027s description and upload it.\u00A0 I may not know that you\u0027d done that (although I do try to review most craft, I can\u0027t check them all), but now it\u0027s in my site\u0027s database and I\u0027m facilitating it being shared.\u00A0\u00A0Would that level of user stupid put me at fault?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGoogle Analytics\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 KerbalX uses GA and it\u00A0has been tool that has enabled me to understand how you use the site, what pages take the most traffic and most importantly enabled me to see current traffic levels,\u00A0which has let me adjust the time of day\u00A0that I release updates\u00A0so as not to update the site when traffic is high\u00A0(and to know when I need to panic due to the site getting overloaded!)\u00A0Over the last week I\u0027ve been going over my google analytics settings trying to understand the details and switching off anything that wasn\u0027t absolutely necessary or that could be considered PII.\u00A0 I\u0027ve never used any of the of google advertising features (which is where the majority of PII could be found) but I did have user demographics enabled. That is now switched off.\u00A0 Remarketing, Ad reporting features, are also off.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnder data sharing;\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nGoogle Products and Services\u0022 (which would \u0022Share Google Analytics data with Google to help improve Google\u0027s products and services\u0022) is switched off,\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAccount Specialists (which would \u0022Give Google marketing specialists and your Google sales specialists access to your Google Analytics data and account so they can find ways to improve your configuration and analysis\u0022) is switched off.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBenchmarking (\u0022Contribute anonymous data to an aggregate data set to enable features like benchmarking and publications that can help you understand data trends.

If users could choose not to allow GA that would really detract from my ability to fine tune the site, so I hope that isn\u0027t necessary.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe consent to cookies things has always bugged me, it\u0027s like having to confirm that you\u0027re ok with each car you get into having and engine.\u00A0of course a website uses cookies, and html, javascript, css and everything else that makes a website a website. So yes, I\u0027ve been a bit lax about cookie consent in the past (it is mentioned in the terms), but I\u0027ll rectify that and add an annoying cookie consent banner. sigh.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, everyone talks about cookies which you can pack a max of 4kb of data into. No one mentions \u0022HTML-5 web storage\u0022, which enables a site to write upto 5mb into the browser\u0027s data storage. I guess because\u00A0unlike\u00A0cookies it isn\u0027t included as part of each request (and probably because rule makers don\u0027t have a clue about it). KerbalX uses\u00A0web-storage to speed up loading\u00A0when you go back to a search/list page. You might have noticed that if you click on a craft on the main page and then hit the back button you jump back to the main page very quickly and also retain the same scroll position as you had before. That\u0027s because the content of the main page you were looking at before you clicked on a craft gets cached in your browsers web-storage and then reloaded directly from there, rather than requesting it from the server again. schneeky, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s something that GDPR requires any action for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, that\u0027s me being as transparent about data usage as I can be and the privacy policy that I\u0027m creating will reflect the key points from here.\u00A0 I am still somewhat unsure if I need to have an \u0022I consent\u0022 checkbox for the use of your PII (which again, is just your email and username which are required to let you login) or if just stating what it\u0027s used for on the sign up page is sufficient.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSorry for the bit of a brain dump here (just writing this has helped me colate the key aspects), but I\u0027d\u00A0appreciate any thoughts you guys have about this and if you think there\u0027s anything\u00A0I need to be doing.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-26T04:46:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@katataeochi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing you have gone above and beyond prior to the new rules, and that your current privacy policy\u00A0may already exceed the new rules.
