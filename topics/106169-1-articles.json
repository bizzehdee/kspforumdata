I\u0027m in Career 1.0,and I have a few of the early bits of the Tech tree unlocked,and I am able to get to (and land!) on the Mun,I just can\u0027t get back to Kerbin! The reason for this you ask? Low fuel! No matter what I do,I always run out of fuel by the time I land on the Mun! ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) So all I ask for are some tips on making a semi-early fuel efficient rocket,capable of going to the Mun and Back ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n(Also,I lost Jeb today in the ocean ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif))"},{"CreatedByName":"lance0625","CreatedById":139939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:17:22Z","Content":"more boosters!"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:24:34Z","Content":"Two words: Asparagus Staging"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearlessjames118","CreatedById":44818,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:28:23Z","Content":"To the moar boosters,I lost Jeb,I can\u0027t make boosters without him!\n\nTo the asparagus staging,I\u0027m not sure what the really is,but I\u0027ll look into it!

I usually park it at an orbit of 500k, complete with docking ring. I dock with it long enough to transfer fuel to the Munar/Minimus lander, then on the way in, I transfer excess fuel and RCS back to it. \n\nYou can also do what NASA did - save weight on your craft by only building stages strong enough to accomplish certain goals. 1st stage has just enough fuel to make it to 80K for orbital insertion; stage 2 had enough fuel for orbital escape and to create enough velocity to achieve insertion into the lunar gravity well (extremely weak, but there). The third stage, the command module, had enough fuel for lunar orbital insertion and lunar orbital escape, AND had enough fuel to achieve insertion into Earth\u0027s gravity well, which extends further out than the lunar gravity well (remember that there is no atmospheric resistance in space and burn times are just to achieve certain speeds rather than a continual burn). Once Earth orbit was achieved, all remaining fuel was used to slow the craft and position for reentry before jettisoning. \n\nHope that description helps..."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:33:11Z","Content":"Kerbal Engineer Redux.
