Also, updating the nvidia gpu doesn\u0027t mean you have updated the Intel integrated chip. 2 different GPU\u0027s with 2 different drivers.\n\nAlso, after looking at output log, I think you may need to verify game cache with steam, or delete and uninstall the game, then reinstall.

For example: Main Menu is frozen (but not crashed) I click \u0022start game\u0022 nothing happens. I go outside KSP and press anything anywhere (so that KSP is not active anymore) and I go back to KSP the Button was finally pressed. The game is only frozen when it is Active.\n\nI force OpenGL and PopupWindowmode.\n\nEDIT:\n\nIf I dont force the popup window it works if i have the launcher settings set to non Fullscreen.
