It could be somewhat like action groups, but it would need events too, as well as possibly some other functions such as delays and Boolean logic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give an example, I could maybe configure the vessel so that if it gets low on electric charge, it would open the solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe if both my altitude was below 1000 AND my vertical velocity was below -30 then it would deploy parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the latter would require some sensor components, such as a barometer. Notice in the latter it would also use a feature to require two or more conditions to be met.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe if I\u0027m running low on fuel it could re-adjust the thrust limiter on my rocket motors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think such a feature could be variably useful, but it could have its benefits. (Although I am slowly convincing myself it could be more useful than just handy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really know how you should implement this, either with a real script interface in-game or with a GUI interface, but whichever you decide is a good idea would be good enough for me. (Assuming this idea is actually considered.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sure this would be easy to mod, so I\u0027m not really certain why I wanted it for the un-modded version. Maybe because I dislike the messy interfaces of most of the existing mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TaranisElsu","CreatedById":57742,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T21:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot stock, but there are some mods that do what you want (not sure if you are already aware of them):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EkOS - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68089-0-25-kOS-Scriptable-Autopilot-System-v0-14-2-2014-10-08\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68089-0-25-kOS-Scriptable-Autopilot-System-v0-14-2-2014-10-08\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESmart Parts - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64227-0-24-1-27-July-Smart-Parts-V2-0-New-API-and-new-KM-folder-structure\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64227-0-24-1-27-July-Smart-Parts-V2-0-New-API-and-new-KM-folder-structure\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use kOS and really like it a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not tried Smart Parts yet, but it looks like it has some neat functionality.
