I\u0027m using module fuel tanks, so I can turn the big 3.75 m wide fuel tanks into pure liquid fuel, and I\u0027ll only use the nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I ask the forums, how the hell do I do this? without cheating (using hyper edit or infinite fuel) of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T17:48:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EISRU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMine that thing down to the bone as a fuel depot and send the husk out of the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither that or just attach a drill\u002BISRU and plenty of electrical power and let the engine burn whatever is produced until it leaves the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo need to have much fuel by the time you have docked with the asteroid, just be able to make fuel out of it(and at the same time reduce the mass you need to push)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gtmattz","CreatedById":15075,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T17:52:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Terwin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Terwin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EISRU\u003Cp\u003EMine that thing down to the bone as a fuel depot and send the husk out of the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I was reading the contract this is what came to my mind as well.

Once contact with the class E is achieved, I\u0027d move it into solar orbit, orient prograde to the sun, and start burning while mining more LF. The sun\u0027s power, combined with atomic energy, will keep the ISRU and drills working even as far out as Eeloo while the delta wings radiate enough heat to allow for as long a burn as necessary under maximum thrust and the struts allow the use of physics warp to have to stare at it for only a fourth of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I\u0027m definitely a brute force person in KSP and I\u0027ve never intercepted an asteroid before.
