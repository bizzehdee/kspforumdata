If you want to make the current config work and you have MRCSFX, you can adjust it to change the ModuleRCS to ModuleRCSFX (i.e. add @name = ModuleRCSFX to each ModuleRCS node) and set the ModuleEngineConfigs to type = ModuleRCSFX (instead of ModuleRCS).

Reason I ask is I\u0027m currently running into an issue whereby any KW SRBs I use (stock behavior: minimum 50% thrust; throttleable [in the VAB] from 50% to 100%) are showing the stock behavior DV readouts (i.e. they\u0027re still working off the stock scale of 50% to 100%). I won\u0027t go into my preference of stock over this change but not having to swap to the launch pad then back to the VAB to get the correct readings is rather tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrection Last: MJ2 is functioning (when MJ2 is functioning); engineer is not.
