It\u0027s head draggy.\n\nMass at the front of your rocket is good; it promotes stability. You want your centre of mass as high as possible.\n\nDrag at the front of your rocket is bad; it promotes instability. You want your centre of drag as low as possible.\n\nSo: skinnier, more streamlined payload if possible. Much bigger fins at the base of the rocket as well. And gimbal is your friend; strapping a quartet of radial engines around the base of your core rocket would provide a lot of control authority. It\u0027s what the Vernier engines (e.g. Thuds) are designed for."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T13:47:48Z","Content":"Head heavy is actually good, but head draggy is bad. It\u0027s really hard to see what your rocket looks like after the SRBs leave from the pic you posted, plus you are not showing staging. Can you post one where they and the launch stabilizers are removed or dropped? \n\nMeanwhile, here are some general tips:\n\nSpinning out of control essentially comes down to a contest between drag and control. When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and control surfaces.\n\nAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach 1 (340 m/s). So you should stay pointed as prograde as possible at speeds around 290-400 m/s.\n\nOn a rocket control fins should be as low and outside as possible. If you are using control fins on more than one stage, the CoL needs to stay below the CoM at all times, even as the tanks empty.\n\nEdit: some ninja action!"},{"CreatedByName":"mbartelsm","CreatedById":78723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T13:50:04Z","Content":"the problem is not the weight of the head per se, but the amount of drag it generates, imagine shooting an arrow with the fins at the head, it will just turn around. My suggestion would be using fuel tanks with a bigger radius and shorter length, if you don\u0027t have those available yet then work with a more horizontal rocket (shorter tanks, more asparagus stages)\n\nBeen ninja\u0027d"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T13:56:06Z","Content":"Hm. There\u0027s some very strange symmetry your using with that craft. Why are the SRBs not symmetric? And then there\u0027s something strange with your fins at the rear. They too don\u0027t appear to be symmetric as well. I see one sticking out the right side, but not the other. So that can\u0027t help. \n\nI\u0027m not sure if KER is showing sea level thrust in that readout, but 2.0 is too much for the first stage. Try 1.6 at the max.\n\nAnd another issue is your rocket isn\u0027t heavy up top enough. You say \u0022too head heavy\u0022 well that\u0027s exactly what rockets need to be. You want your thrust to be as far away from the CoM as possible. And I can see that your CoM is already really low. Are those srbs doing all the work of the first stage with a mid air firing of the second? If so your CoM probably isn\u0027t moving much and the rocket is too light up top to be controllable. \n\nWhat\u0027s in that fairing? CoM should be much higher with a payload that size. So for starters fix your symmetry. Then work on what some of the others have said. Your rocket does have a good bit of drag up top, but honestly that is doable with what you got.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T14:00:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 02:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T15:45:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hm.

They too don\u0027t appear to be symmetric as well. I see one sticking out the right side, but not the other. So that can\u0027t help.\n\nThe SRBs and also the fins are actually symmetric. Not per SRB but as a whole. Those 4 SRBs create a centered CoM in the core stage. I jettison them all at once. So I don\u0027t loose the centered CoM.\n\nSame for the fins. Each SRB has only one, but each one has a different orientation. So all 4 again give a symmetrical air control flow. (at least I hope this last sentence makes sense...)\n\nIn the fairing holds a mobile processing lab, a schience Jr module and some smaller parts. Mass of the payload is 5.7 t total.\n\nMy control systems are:\n\n4 delta wings with attached elvons at the core stage.\n\n4 controlled fins at the outer LFB boosters (1 in each direction)\n\n4 controlled fins at the SRB boosters (1 in each direction)\n\n2x SAS between the center tank and the orbiter stage.\n\n4x RCS thruster in the orbiter stage\n\nThe outer LFBs are asparagus-style connected to the center tank.\n\nStaging is:\n\n1. Detach stability enhancer and fire all 9 boosters. (I go 60% for the LFBs and 100% for the SRBs in this stage)\n\n2. When SRBs are burned out (@ about 12 km), they are jettisoned and the 5 LFBs are set to 100% power.\n\n3. When outer LFBs are burned out, I jettison them. The core stage is remaining.\n\nRest is in-orbit action.\n\nThe current behaviour is this:\n\nStart with active SAS -\u003E all good\n\nAt about 230 m/s the body begins to wobble a bit. SAS can compensate. (If I use the MechJeb autopilot instead of manual flight, the body begins to wobble like mad at this speed. IRL it would rip apart.)\n\nWhen I jettison the SRBs at about 12 km, the whole thing flips. After one flip, I can get it under control and steer it to orbit. But this flip is still a total no go... ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nRest of the flight is without problems.\n\nOK. So I actually need to get that CoM up and maybe change the layout of my booster stages to get that thing stable.\n\nI\u0027ve probably seen every video of Scott Manley twice. But it seems like rocket science is in fact erm....rocket science. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T16:24:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cairol**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geredis","CreatedById":31070,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T15:46:20Z","Content":"Mokotoid - looking at it, it seems that it\u0027s a 4-4 rocket - 4 outer boosters (the \u0027missing\u0027 fourth can be seen vaguely on the far side through the structural supports - the tail fin and engine nozzle gives it away), 4 secondary engines up on the radially on the main column that seems to only exist to support the payload node and a stack of control modules like SAS or probe cores that seem to serve primarily as anchors for the radial inner ring of rockets.\n\nLooking though at the way his fins are aligned I think that might be a big part of the problem as well.

That\u0027s a bit odd, isn\u0027t it?\n\nBecause my payload is not even close to beeing aerodynamic.\n\n![YteFsiq.png](http://i.imgur.com/YteFsiq.png)"}]}
