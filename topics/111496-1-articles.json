It\u0027s really hard to see what your rocket looks like after the SRBs leave from the pic you posted, plus you are not showing staging. Can you post one where they and the launch stabilizers are removed or dropped? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, here are some general tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpinning out of control essentially comes down to a contest between drag and control. When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach 1 (340 m/s). So you should stay pointed as prograde as possible at speeds around 290-400 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a rocket control fins should be as low and outside as possible. If you are using control fins on more than one stage, the CoL needs to stay below the CoM at all times, even as the tanks empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: some ninja action!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mbartelsm","CreatedById":78723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T13:50:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe problem is not the weight of the head per se, but the amount of drag it generates, imagine shooting an arrow with the fins at the head, it will just turn around.
