Some plaster came loose from the ceiling, bits and pieces fell everywhere and a small dust cloud enjoyd it\u0027s existence until suddenly eaten by a much larger, beige colored cloud. Val turned their ALRM1-SE Amphiphile Omega onto the concrete, a bit too fast so she stepped on the brake. A few loud bangs were heard ... not from the Omega, but from crumbling concrete shooting away from under the massive wheels. She stopped the engine. For a minute or so nothing happened, except waiting for the giant dust cloud to settle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBud stood in the door, flabbergasted and coughing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oIjRHAo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oIjRHAo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J7jPmwv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J7jPmwv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S0gwVsT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S0gwVsT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Welcome to Happy Gas!
