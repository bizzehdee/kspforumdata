Specify path to KSP.exe and press \u0022Run KSP\u0022. All patches will be done in memory, nothing will be changed in game folder (except written backups). Note that tool doesn\u0027t depends of game code and so can work with any version of game while file names remains the same. Tool can be also started with **/run** command line key to skip GUI and start game immediately.\n\nBacked up quicksave or persistent file can be restored simply with Alt-F9.\n\nPrevious versions of craft files saved as *craftname*\\_*timestamp*.bak. You should manually rename them to *craftname*.craft to restore.\n\n**Limitations**:\n\n- Windows only (tested under Windows XP 32-bit and Windows 7 64-bit).\n- 32-bit version of game only.\n\n**License (to match rules)**:\n\n[http://pastebin.com/qiKSBb1R](http://pastebin.com/qiKSBb1R)\n\nYou can download tool [here](http://home.redsh.su/download/kspmt.zip) ([mirror](https://yadi.sk/d/o2eXUE-Th9meq)).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-06T16:20:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2016 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by redsh**\n  \nFixed domain"},{"CreatedByName":"ShuttlePilot","CreatedById":209278,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-05T05:27:16Z","Content":"Great programme!"},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-05T17:54:34Z","Content":"Bit of a necro there.
