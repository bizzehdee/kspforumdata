All they need is the ground truth device (Don\u0027t remember the name. The one you use on the ground), a probe core (I like the ones that can hold pro/retrograde, makes landing a breeze), and enough dV and TWR to land and return to orbit, say, twice on their target world. That way, you never have to worry about if you\u0027re running out of gas and if necessary they can even probably get to to the fuel base or even orbit to refuel. The probe should also be nimble and comfortable on slopes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I just send them into good areas, find a nice flat spot (by hopping around with their plentiful fuel) with good ore (known because of the ground truthing) and then I have a marker that I *KNOW* is a great spot. Send the drilling rig down there and land right next to the probe on that wonderfully flat and prodigiously oreified ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T14:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is good advice for prospecting, but I do think the OP\u0027s idea has merit in a number of situations.
