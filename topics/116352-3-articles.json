Each \u0022series\u0022 of games would be 5 or 7 rounds (depending on what is decided upon), and each round would be a single face-off. It is kind of like how Stanley Cup playoff hockey works.\n\u003E \n\u003E So no, there would only ever be 4 planes spawned at once.

You\u0027ll only face either 4 or 8 opponents max out of 16 or 32, there\u0027s a long wait for everybody to be ready and a complexity to run the whole thing between a number of people in a reasonable time. We could have \u0022winner stays on\u0022, the first entry fights the second, winner fights the third and so on. A badge/rank/hall of fame for how many wins in a row an entry achieved before it was knocked off the top by a better one.\n\nIt can start sooner, run longer, more flexible, and you only need to worry about getting the next fight done. Just one of who\u0027s available and able to record to say \u0022I\u0027ll do the next 1/2/few now\u0022 and the organiser say \u0022do it\u0022 and it\u0027ll be done and on to the next. It can go on for as long as there\u0027s new entries and could allow some epic winning streaks, you could also re-enter new designs only when your current entry is defeated.\n\nEither way we need to get a launch procedure set in stone, hyperedit can only set a location, not point the craft in a certain direction? And if you activate the craft engine/autopilot one after the other the one you turned on first always gets up sooner and turns to fight first, that\u0027s why I was experimenting with the Smart Parts radio, they all launch at the same moment, no arguing.\n\nI also got some info from Bahamotd about the AI scan interval/defensive that I\u0027m prepared to share ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Set a longer scan interval and save some missiles for later since it doesn\u0027t affect defensive capabilities at all? Or just two large guns and a load of flares with a high turn rate since there\u0027s no defence against bullets?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks! I didn\u0027t know about this contest, sounds interesting. The flares and defensive maneuvers are a separate coroutine that runs independently of the guard cycle, so it won\u0027t be affected. For ai pilots, the scan interval determines finding/choosing targets, and how often to shoot, but if it finds a vessel and its not pointing at it, it will remember the target, turn towards it, wait till it has a good firing solution, then fire and reset the cycle at that point. (Eventually I want to make the firing and scanning independent from each other as well.. but for now, thats how it works)"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T22:53:07Z","Content":"If this is a contest, sign me up!\n\n![kGD10Mc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kGD10Mc.jpg)\n\n**MiG-31 Foxhound**\n\n**Designer: Zekes**\n\n**Status:****COMPLETED**\n\n**Cost:** **$99,322.00** \n\n**The Big Brother of the MiG-25 - one of the fastest and heaviest armed interceptors in the world.**\n\n**Max Speed is 1230m/s** **(NOTE: Heating should not be a problem, I recommend turning the heat UI off or the game crashes from it)**\n\n**Max Altitude is 23,000m level flight**\n\n**Press \u00224\u0022 for flaps toggle, \u0022G\u0022 for gear.**\n\n***Download:*** [http://www./download/fy...k/Mig-31.craft](http://www./download/fyddbn8wvg2a2xk/Mig-31.craft)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T22:57:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If this is a contest, sign me up!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/kGD10Mc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kGD10Mc.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E **MiG-31 Foxhound**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Designer: Zekes**\n\u003E \n\u003E **Status:****COMPLETED**\n\u003E \n\u003E **Cost:** **$99,322.00** \n\u003E \n\u003E **The Big Brother of the MiG-25 - one of the fastest and heaviest armed interceptors in the world.**\n\u003E \n\u003E **Max Speed is 1230m/s** **(NOTE: Heating should not be a problem, I recommend turning the heat UI off or the game crashes from it)**\n\u003E \n\u003E **Max Altitude is 23,000m level flight**\n\u003E \n\u003E **Press \u00224\u0022 for flaps toggle, \u0022G\u0022 for gear.**\n\u003E \n\u003E ***Download:*** [http://www./download/fy...k/Mig-31.craft](http://www./download/fyddbn8wvg2a2xk/Mig-31.craft)\n\nOh, no!

This balances the advantage of having a turreted gun by making the aircraft weigh more and perform worse. I\u0027m also thinking about only allowing engineers to operate the gun, so the extra pilot advantage also gets nerfed.\n\nThat is a great idea! Can I clip cockpits?"},{"CreatedByName":"ZLM-Master","CreatedById":185115,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T16:43:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s likely you\u0027ll need to tweak the weaponry of the fighter to fit air-to-air purposes, but otherwise should be fine, though the extra parts added for looks (e.g. the second cockpit) will hamper performance, and the helicopter won\u0027t work - BD Armory can\u0027t fly helicopters (unless you\u0027re very clever and can design one that does).\n\nYep , i build it firstly for multi-role purpose \u0026 most weapon on it are useless in dogfight . My stock Rafale got only 60 parts .\n\nThe BD-Armory aroud 80 . I\u0027ll entry a \u0022Contest Edition\u0022 to fit with your rules with this plane base .

( Like go straight onto the ground or flying backward !) The main issue with copter is the main rotor , one hit there \u0026 it\u0022s finish for you !
