The further you go, the bigger a ship you need. But, what if you could refuel mid flight, all along a journey. Suddenly, ship size would decrease drastically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApologies if someone already thought of something like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea is, to put refuelling platforms on small moons, which would then fly up to meet spacecraft, to refuel them in the moon\u0027s orbit.\u00A0For example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want to send a lander to Moho. You deliver it into Kerbin orbit, where a nuclear tug is waiting for it at a refuelling space station also in Kerbin orbit. This one is special becuase it receives it\u0027s fuel directly from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, you fly to Minmus, where a refuelling rig flies into orbit, filled with\u00A0mined fuel from Minmus, and feeds the fuel to the tug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, you set a course for Eve. Once in Eve orbit, another refuelling rig, this time from Gilly, comes to greet and refuel you in Eve orbit (as it\u0027s easier to do this than intercept Gilly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, it\u0027s off to Moho, and your lander lands, does whatever it needs to, then it\u0027s back along the refuel highway with the tug to be delivered back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, in my mind, this could get you as far as Moho, using Gilly, or as far as Dres, using Ike. Jool/Eeloo become the problem, in my mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee, with the way orbits work and what each specific moon is like, I don\u0027t really know how a refuelling station, as a pathway on to Eeloo or maybe just another Jool moon and back, would be able to work, and I need your help. Granted, you could just build a bigger spacecraft that can work from Ike, but the idea is to not need big spacecraft in the first place, or at least not as big as usual .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo thoughts, ideas, suggestions. Am I a madman? A genius? I really just need feedback to know if I\u0027m on to something, and to see if you can help me overcome hurdles in my plan. I leave the projects fate, in your hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I\u0027ve started to realize this idea isn\u0027t really best as highway, but as a hub with everything in it, fuelled from nearby, with tugs bringing new stuff or new kerbals in, able to refuel for the return journey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, still don\u0027t know the best set up for the one in Jool, which would serve all 5 moons at this point\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-22T11:56:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2019 11:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded original edit back from dupe thread.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-21T23:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI experimented with refueling stations in orbit around all the planets and moons.

Your ship could indeed be smaller, but perhaps not as much as you might think. Much of the energy required for interplanetary transfers is just the energy spent accelerating out of your starting planet\u0027s gravity well. In the case of Kerbin, this would be 1km/s. This plus a bit gets you to Minmus orbit. Now you\u0027re currently at 1.3km/s. Getting from there to a Duna transfer can be another 400m/s. Getting into a low Ike orbit is about another 400m/s. Getting from there to a Dres transfer is 1200m/s. Dres is weird. Because it\u0027s so small, you need to match velocities with it pretty closely and end up with expensive capture burns. Plus, Dres\u0027s orbit is so inclined that you need a lot of Delta-V to match inclinations... Sometimes around 1km/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot counting plane changes, it\u0027s another 2.3 kilometers per second to get into an elliptical Jool orbit. From there, transfers to the moons range from 1 to 2 kilometers per second of Delta-V, assuming you don\u0027t use gravity assists, which are really easy in the Jool system. In fact, you can practically get anywhere for almost free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you use the refueling route, the most Delta-V you will need on a single trip is from Dres to elliptical around Jool, at 2.3 kilometers per second plus the plane change, plus getting to whatever moon you want. To be fair, though, Dres is weird, and all things considered, Ike\u00A0to elliptical Jool orbit is cheaper, at 2 kilometers per second or lower, assuming optimal trajectories are found..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver your whole trip, including refueling, you would probably be expending 5.6km/s of Delta-V minimum, maybe up to 8 maximum unless you do something crazy, but you will only need 2 at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, going directly from Low Kerbin Orbit to an elliptical Jool orbit costs about 2.2km/s minus inclination changes, which are usually under 300m/s. Even if you skip Dres, your ship sizes would end up about the same - 2km/s vs 2.2km/s (excluding plane changes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs saving 200m/s worth all the time spent waiting for transfer windows, the time spent doing rendezvous and docking, and the mass spent on docking equipment? I\u0027m not sure. If you are doing it for fun, then go ahead, I think it\u0027s a cool idea, but if you\u0027re looking for maximum time efficiency, I wouldn\u0027t bother, as the performance hit going directly from Kerbin to Jool is minimal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same should hold true for going inwards to Moho, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR: From an efficiency standpoint it\u0027s slightly better than taking a direct route, but your craft won\u0027t end up that much bigger than if you had taken the direct route. If you stop at Dres, which is a bit out of the way, your craft may actually need to be bigger than going directly.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Socraticat","CreatedById":176118,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-22T00:50:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022065420430fefce7d7c47e6566e2382dc3a91e93a\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022375\u0022 src=\u0022https://serving.photos.photobox.com/065420430fefce7d7c47e6566e2382dc3a91e93a9160a26d72518cbbddc4cb87fc44a8e7.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022500\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00229997461347f801d98b7e052dbdcf6b14acb329e7\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022282\u0022 src=\u0022https://serving.photos.photobox.com/9997461347f801d98b7e052dbdcf6b14acb329e7fc68b01e6c592225b897d0b4e33d7e02.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022500\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002268374886daf966ef0a2b9e25879dcd49ac2a7826\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022500\u0022 src=\u0022https://serving.photos.photobox.com/68374886daf966ef0a2b9e25879dcd49ac2a7826e1334c75b9112224cafc8e67ce4517e3.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022282\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it is that strange of an idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Peabody","CreatedById":173591,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-22T00:58:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223565436\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183013\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221553211606\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022169759\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022M_Rat13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, M_Rat13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, we all know how difficult traversing the Kerbol system can be.
