I loved the spoiler on the thing and thought I would make something similar in KSP. It\u0027s got the looks and is an SSTO, so I\u0027m happy.\n\nHere\u0027s the full album:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Please pardon my derp. My internet kind of sucks right now and it would be painful to upload all this stuff all over again.**\n\nAnd it\u0027s pretty simple to fly:\n\n-Action group 1 toggles engines.\n\n-Action group 2 switches between Air and Closed Cycle, also toggles intakes.\n\n-The cargo bay is opened manually\n\n**1.** The plane doesn\u0027t climb very well with only 2 RAPIERs, so you need to get some speed first.\n\n**2.** At about 1200m/s you should start a steady 30-45 degree climb.\n\n**3.** Once the speed starts to drop switch to LF/O mode with action group 2.\n\n**4.** Keep going, watch your dV and Apo height. 70km should be enough.\n\n**5.** At Apo circuralize with RCS and SAS activated (The plane has some CoT/CoM issues. Still need to figure that one out.)\n\n**6.** During reentry, for better pitch authority you may want to enable pitch control on the canards.\n\n**The payload it can carry is something yet to be determined.**\n\nDownload:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/wbpp5ltusngxgab/Superbird%20MkII.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wbpp5ltusngxgab/Superbird%20MkII.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T17:09:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 05:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"Space.exe","CreatedById":132688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T15:12:06Z","Content":"I really like the back end of the plane looks very mean! ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T19:38:07Z","Content":"\\*claps\\*\n\nThis is actually really cool.

Now it\u0027s able to carry a whole FL-T400 tank: [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/FL-T400_Fuel_Tank.](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/FL-T400_Fuel_Tank.) That\u0027s an equivalent of a science probe having about 3km/s of dV.\n\nIf anyone is still interested in this just let me know and I\u0027ll update the OP with the MKIII version of the craft."}]}
