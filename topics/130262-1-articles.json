Yes, I know that there are mods like mechjeb that does this, but Ideally I would like to set my rover up so that it\u00A0can drive on its own while I do other things in the meantime, including timewarp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that following the terrain during timewarp will be a challenge/impossible due to the destruction of things moving across the surface with the on-rails system, but is it possible to emulate auto-roving\u00A0by simply teleporting the rover an appropriate distance and placing it on the terrain? I\u0027d love the ability to have my rover drive between biomes on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-19T10:00:22Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2016 10:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FungusForge","CreatedById":148313,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T11:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129363-105autorove-autonomous-rovermovement-in-the-background/\u0022\u003EDoop!\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
