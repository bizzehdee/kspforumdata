I\u0027ve tried shutting down the engines and intakes. One time, I was on grass between two hills and it would literally just keep going back and forth between the two hills like it was a skatepark haha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve recreated planes multiple times and this always seems to happen. I just want to be able to fly a plane, land, and then EVA, but can\u0027t get the plane to stop.
