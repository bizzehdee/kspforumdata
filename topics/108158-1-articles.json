I\u0027ve tried shutting down the engines and intakes. One time, I was on grass between two hills and it would literally just keep going back and forth between the two hills like it was a skatepark haha.\n\nI\u0027ve recreated planes multiple times and this always seems to happen. I just want to be able to fly a plane, land, and then EVA, but can\u0027t get the plane to stop. Thanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T07:01:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 07:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T04:47:49Z","Content":"Pressing \u0027B\u0027 should activate the brakes, and clicking the brakes button next to the altimeter should set them on permanently (until disengaged). \n\nIf this doesn\u0027t help, then I suspect it\u0027s a bug; please try the support forum."},{"CreatedByName":"Jadis","CreatedById":17957,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T04:53:54Z","Content":"Thank you!!
