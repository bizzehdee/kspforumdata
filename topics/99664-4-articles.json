I\u0027ve read that in the 737 full braking requires 40\u002B pounds of pressure on the brake pedals (although I may be confusing that with pulling back on the stick when at full AoA).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In small prop planes, steering is pretty much always linked (but not rigidly so there is still some play) to the rudder pedals (so similar to KSP), but those land at maybe 40-90 knots, so over-steer isn\u0027t too bad. In the typical modern jets, the nosewheel steering is linked to the rudder at lower speeds for a small amount (maybe a few degrees turning). In some jets I\u0027ve read that you can disconnect the nose wheel steering from the rudder pedals completely. In either case, for the first part of the landing the speed is high enough that the rudder itself can provide quite a bit of steering power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In KSP, all brake applications are FULL brake applications. When brakes are applied, they create a force below the CoM towards the rear, which makes the plane want to rotate nose down. The nose gear, if you need to steer it, is also full application (if using the keyboard in non-fine control). This is why some wheel mods have speed compensated steering. I think the stock rover wheels have steer limiting, but I\u0027m not sure if the landing gear do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ivcCq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Probably started with stock Aero and got used to it, by now they know how stock behaves, what is possible and what not and how planes have to be flown in stock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot here comes from the fear of having to go through the learning curve again, they have mastered one curve already (for stock) and don\u0027t want to lose all their Atmo capabilities and have to relearn all the things they want to do. Which is understandable, nobody wants to do work just to be able to do the same things they were already capable of before. Thus, would\u0027ve squad made this change earlier less people would\u0027ve been affected and a proper aero model would\u0027ve been there earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe people saying crazy constructions aren\u0027t possible in FAR are just wrong as we all know. You can build crazy things that fly, they are just different. There is even a challenge where someone takes your beloved stock plane and makes it FAR-flyable for free as a challenge. I can link it if I\u0027ll find it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of this fear comes from steering and not constructing I think. Which isn\u0027t that hard once you\u0027ve understood it. It says already a lot that I can fly and land all my FAR planes just with the Keyboard. Try that with FSX or Xplane. For those who really want to understand how to fly, try the ones I just mentioned. Or IL-2 Sturmovik, or Birds of Prey, or even the flight model of the ARMA series. Once you can fly a plane there, flying with FAR is as easy as it could be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd construction really is basically the same in FAR as in stock for the basic flight rules (without part clipping and hided wings) just look into the 101 Airplane guide here on the Forums somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T17:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of this fear comes from steering and not constructing I think.

It took me tens of attempts before I could land semi-decently DCS. You don\u0027t have the same game aids and simplified aerodynamics and end up having to pay attention to a LOT more things. And then there\u0027s the counter-intuitive concept of using your throttle to control sink rate and pitch to control speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding in KSP stock aero is a complete joke after playing these flight sims. By the way, DCS World is free and comes with the SU-25T. If you\u0027re struggling in KSP \u002B FAR, I recommend installing DCS World and building your skillset there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure flying IRL is another huge step up from flight sims, but civilian flight school is costly. Haven\u0027t gotten around to it yet, but it\u0027s on my bucket list! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T18:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think (trigger word for a personal opinion coming up) :\u003Cp\u003EMost of the problems come from the existence of stock aero model in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EIf they can get the verticle flight dynamics fixed that\u0027s enough for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
