The same is true with the little solar panel instead of the RTG. \u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to have a count down for the clock that appears after launch, instead of just the current time and the finish time. Having the display disappear after the vessel has finished building, or some way of minimizing the gui to a small button would be nice. The current time and finish time have a very large amount of decimals visible.

Same thing with the GUI, it needs lots of work and I hate making GUIs without a GUI maker =P I\u0027ll go ahead and change things/add a countdown until the build is ready, it does make more sense to have that lol.

If there was some sort of queue where you could have ships building and can swap them around in the queue and cancel them then that would be nice. Then when one finishes you get a popup saying it\u0027s finished with the options of launching or storing it. My thoughts are that there\u0027d be an extra button in the VAB/SPH for adding the current craft to the build list (with the time required to build), and the launch button would go into \u0022simulation\u0022 mode (since you probably can\u0027t easily override the fact that the launch button puts it on the pad).
