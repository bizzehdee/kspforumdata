Where does that go, I have seen source in a few mods but usually it just says DELETE THIS!, should I just delete the source BAK and lib folders, or put them in the main KSP directory? I tried extracting the master folders for Regolith and Karbonite directly into the gameplay folder of the KSP directory like most mods will require (I know the odd one likes to be extracted a sub-directory higher or lower for some reason, but this is the first time I have seen folders and files that I have absolutely no clue where to put.) I also tried looking at the other USI mods to see how they are installed but it seems they only include a gamedata folder and all automatically go neatly into a USI folder in the gameplay directory.
