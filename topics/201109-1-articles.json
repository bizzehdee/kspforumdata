If you want to land your boosters back on the launchpad/runway, this is your best bet.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStage Recovery does it all in the background instead- with sufficient parachutes, or a control point and sufficient fuel, it can simulate the landings and automatically recover the dropped stages for you. If you just want to recover dropped stages anywhere they fall, this is probably a better option than FMRS and is heavily configurable to choose how much value is returned and even add a chance that your stages will burn up on re-entry; it also recovers crew and science from vessels.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKSTS lets\u00A0you record any given launch, including returning boosters, then simply re-use that recording to put your payloads into orbit according to the payload mass and final orbit of the recording for the same cost in funds to build the rocket. It also allows \u2018transport\u2019 launches that can carry crew or transfer resources to and from existing vessels in orbit, or \u2018construct\u2019 missions where you can create\u00A0an entirely new vessel in the editor then have KSTS build it\u00A0in space using an existing space station as an orbital dock- very handy if you want to build a massive spaceship but can\u2019t think of a way to launch it, plus you can build it with the fuel tanks empty then fuel it up later, either with further flights from Kerbin or with fuel mined from elsewhere.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zach1","CreatedById":209697,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-19T09:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStage Recovery sounds like exactly what I am looking for thank you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
