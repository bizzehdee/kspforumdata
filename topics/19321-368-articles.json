I have tried to recreate some of my crafts from V0.90. I have created plane with similar shape and wing span as in KSP 0.90 as close as posible. In 0.90 at 0.35 mach and 0 km plane was stable and capable to lift off with 2-3 AoA degree. In KSP 1.0 stability graph shows that plane can\u0027t take off. For level flight at 0.35 mach (or 120 m/s) at sea level, needed AoA can\u0027t be calculated. Despite this on test flight craft behave very close as it was in V0.90, starting to take off effortless at 100-110 m/s, close as it was designed for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know if it is of any help, but based on my previous designes, it seems that I need to put 0.20 mach higher speed in stability graph to get closer results. Even with higher speed than I actualy need, stability graph is qrong within 10-15 AoA degree when comes to calculating level flight. It is only based on previous expirience with building crafts with FAR, so numbers are roughly estimated, take it with grain of salt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amankd","CreatedById":135588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei read the responce about how getting accurate ground effect wouod be very hard unless you could figure out how to treat the wings differently but would it not be possible to create a basic mod that is a rough simulation based on altitude to terrain? it would be far from perfect but it would allow for the creation of WIG craft, with maby a slider for control depending on the size and wing area of the craft? i dont know how it would work but it is just a possibility on how to get the possibility, if not total accuracy of wig craft, just an idea but i would love if it could work, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S is there any way to take the dimentions displayed in the editor and provide them a rough approximation of scraft size? or maby taking into account wing area if it could be calculated?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarheel1999","CreatedById":123965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022amankd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022amankd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei read the responce about how getting accurate ground effect wouod be very hard unless you could figure out how to treat the wings differently but would it not be possible to create a basic mod that is a rough simulation based on altitude to terrain? it would be far from perfect but it would allow for the creation of WIG craft, with maby a slider for control depending on the size and wing area of the craft? i dont know how it would work but it is just a possibility on how to get the possibility, if not total accuracy of wig craft, just an idea but i would love if it could work, \u003Cp\u003EP.S is there any way to take the dimentions displayed in the editor and provide them a rough approximation of scraft size? or maby taking into account wing area if it could be calculated?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC Ferram has stated in the past that ground effect was computationally intensive and provided a negligible benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amankd","CreatedById":135588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:38:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tarheel1999\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tarheel1999\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIIRC Ferram has stated in the past that ground effect was computationally intensive and provided a negligible benefit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe benifit in this gase is the possibilityof WIG craft, for which i have a certain passion, from what he said before accurate calculation is very difficult, but i am looking for approximate simulation, somthing that will make wig craft work, similarly to how the old aero model was made so that aircraft would work, somthing that will increase lift and decrease drag as you near the ground\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@delta534: \u003C/strong\u003EIf it\u0027s not visible when the part loads, it won\u0027t be voxelized.
