Barring any major bug fixes, DSEV is in good shape and ready to go on autopilot for a bit- but nowhere near as long as before! My plan going forward is to switch between DSEV and MOLE every couple of weeks so I can make progress on both- and fix bugs in MCM as they crop up. Next up for DSEV will be some revisions to the fuel tanks. Those pesky balloon tanks will be phased out in favor of the new multipurpose storage tanks. I\u0027m also looking into creating LiquidFuel only tanks for those who don\u0027t use Near Future Propulsion (which I highly recommend, it is awesome). I think the most expedient method will be to make stock tanks able to switch between LFO and liquid fuel. I think PorkJet\u0027s Atomic Rockets does this already, so DSEV\u0027s LiquidFuel modifiers will step aside if Atomic Rockets is installed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T15:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Angel-125/DSEV/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGet the latest here\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E0.3.13: Broken Wings (\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/nKhN1t_7PEY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/nKhN1t_7PEY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Truncated the Large Graphene Radiator to 3 segments instead of 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: With the smaller radiator size, you\u0027ll need 14 radiators instead of 10 to cool the Supernova at full thrust.
