If you just use \u0027H\u0027 and \u0027N\u0027 at this point to thrust forwards and backwards, still controlling direction by pointing the ship, you won\u0027t have to worry about which directional keys to use for the lateral RCS thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you arrive about 100m away you should be moving only about 1m/s and can just come to a stop with \u0027N\u0027. At this point select the chase camera view, enable the docking port alignment indicator, ensure the correct docking port on the target is chosen as the target, select the correct docking port on your ship and select \u0022control from here\u0022, then do the final approach using the docking port alignment indicator. I suggest getting the alignment correct first (WASDQE to rotate, using either RCS or reaction wheels if they are strong enough) then move over to the port (IJKLHN to translate using RCS) and dock!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Higgs","CreatedById":121852,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T02:03:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll these suggestions are good.

Most people new to docking don\u0027t understand what\u0027s important from the ship standpoint, so they\u0027ve already made things difficult before they even get off the pad. Make sure:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Your ship is small. Practice with something under ten tons. It\u0027s tempting to try to jump right to orange tanks. Don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Both the docking ship and the target have active SAS. It\u0027s really difficult to dock with something that\u0027s rotating. You can do it, but that\u0027s really part of the advanced class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You have 4 RCS thruster blocks arrayed symmetrically around your ship\u0027s CoM. The idea is you want to point your ship in the right direction and then translate to where you need to be without changing your ship\u0027s heading. If you don\u0027t have enough thruster blocks or you didn\u0027t put them in the right place your ship\u0027s heading will change as you try to translate, which makes everything much harder than it needs to be. Make sure your CoM doesn\u0027t change as your fuel stores are depleted, or failing that make sure the thruster blocks are positioned around the CoM the ship will have when you\u0027re ready to dock (hope the rest of the flight went as you planned).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Your ship is \u0022tight\u0022. When you translate the nav ball shouldn\u0027t sway back and forth as you rotate or translate. This means lots of struts and a preference for short, squat ships over long skinny ones. Avoid attaching parts with docking ports as that creates a flexible joint that will cause your stack to bend. If it\u0027s necessary use girders and struts to keep the joint from flexing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to take your ship to the pad, turn off the gravity, and translate back and forth without your heading changing at all. Ideally you can do this both with 100% fuel and also when your tanks are bone dry. If your course sways back and forth before settling out, figure out what\u0027s flexing and shore it up. If your heading changes either you put the thruster blocks in the wrong place or your CoM is moving as you use up your fuel. The latter case may require substantial rethinking of your design\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have lots of experience you can dock with (slowly) rotating objects and dock ships that sway back and forth as you try to move them.

You should first boost either towards or away from your target (i.e. towards the pink circle to close distance faster, towards the pink tripod to close slower) until you are closing at around maybe 3-4m/s. You also want to roughly line up your prograde/retrograde vectors, i.e. the yellow open and crossed circles respectively, with the target and anti-target vectors (The pink circle and tripod thingie). The thing to remember here is that the prograde vector will move towards wherever you\u0027re pointing when you boost and the retrograde vector will move away. The maximum movement is when you\u0027re pointing at a 90 degree angle to each vector, so what you want to do is point as far away from the prograde vector as you can while still seeing everything on the navball, in a position that puts the target vector directly between the two. You can also approximate this procedure using the maneuver node, by dragging things around until the orbits match perfectly and then executing the burn. Once you\u0027re 500m away and closing at that speed, right click on your docking port and select \u0022control from here\u0022 if you have not already done so. Then line up your ship on the pink circle and switch to the other ship (just hit right or left bracket when within 2km) . Do \u0022control from here\u0022 on the docking port for that ship, then set your first ship as target and again line up on the pink circle. Now you should have you two docking ports pointed right at one another and be around 300m apart. Go back to the first ship and turn on the RCS. Your yellow prograde vector marker should be very nearly aligned with the pink circle. If it is not, use the IJKL RCS translate keys to move it so that it is. You will have to keep making this adjustment repeatedly as you close the distance. Once you get within 200m or so, use the forward-back translation keys to cut your relative velocity to 2m/s or less. Remember you can always time-warp if it\u0027s going too slowly. Keep pushing the yellow circle on top of the pink circle with the RCS translate keys as you close the distance. Once you get to less than 50m separation, slow down to 0.5m/with the forward/back RCS keys and then switch back to ship number 2. Make sure that ship is still pointed directly at ship number one and switch back again. At 20m or so, slow down to 0.1-0.2m/s and just let the two ships glide together. As long as everything stays lined up, you should dock successfully. If you make contact at an odd angle, wait for the bounce and translate forward just a tad to stop your recoil. You should than come to rest with the two docking ports in contact. If you then disengage your SAS, your ship should gradually swing around to the right angle and dock. Practice practice practice. Also, I have found that using a Nintendo controller for this is VERY helpful.
