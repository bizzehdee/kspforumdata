Im not that good with rockets but I decided to release this early for people that can launch this to duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have my weasel rover with a habitation module that drops down. (remember to extend the ladder to get into the hab first) The rover drop decoupler doesn\u0027t look good but I dont know ho else to get it down. The lander has 412 parts. I also have the skeleton available if anyone wants that to make the mav lander. I am working on the mav but havent found a version I like yet. Enjoy!
