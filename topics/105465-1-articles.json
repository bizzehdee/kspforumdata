I thought that I could use primary/secondary for this, but there\u0027s no way to swtich between the two modes. If I try to set the axes to be different for docking vs staging (and just plan on using docking for spaceplanes) it doesn\u0027t save the setting, meaning I have to quit back to the main menu and reconfigure my joystick if I\u0027m switching from rockets to planes (or use software that will remap for me) just as before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
