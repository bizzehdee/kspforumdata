Considering my piloting, I don\u0027t think you\u0027d want to see me flying anything. And yes, I did get the name Rifter not only from the fact that this thing has an FTL drive, but also from the Minmatar frigate of the same name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoi the soi sauce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor two centuries, kerbalkind had advanced, particularly in the fields of flash-cloning and space travel. Their space program had gone from an upstart founded by amateurs for the thrill of adventure to an internationally-recognized entity that routinely flew manned missions into deep space. During the time of the beginning of the space program, work had begun on \u0022biological replication,\u0022 as cloning was called in scientific papers, but it was still all theory and politics. Now, some kerbs had achieved immortality (that is to say, the ones in the space program). However, since the dawn of kerbal space travel methods of leaving the Kerbol system were deemed too expensive or illogical, but not this one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis method was sound, as was the science behind it. Created by a kerb named Markuz Al-Kerbiyir, the drive was powered by exotic forms of matter and could theoretically accelerate a craft to ten times the speed of light. Nobody except the brightest scientists in the Kerbal Space Program actually knew what these forms were, so they were essentially classified; a good thing for the main sponsor country, Arkavtia. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor two decades, the scientists of the KSP slaved away on research for the Al-Kerbiyir Drive, or simply the Alkerb Drive, and by the eighteenth year of research funding for the project had nearly dried up. Then a young scientist named Manley accumulated eighty grams of the main power source of the Alkerb Drive in a canister. He was hailed as the greatest mind of his generation and Arkavtia raised the funding for the project by fifty million kerbits. By the twentieth year, a prototype mounted on a probe had flown to Eeloo, and another had boosted the manned Ethereal Solitude Research Station into high Kerbol orbit. By the twenty-first year, the first Alkerb Drive had been constructed and a mission had been planned: the \u003Cem\u003ERifter\u003C/em\u003E, a triumph of kerbal engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction of the ship took five years, the final planning two. But it was finally done, twenty-eight years after Alkerb Drive research began. The crew was selected from the bravest and brightest doctors, commanders, pilots, scientists and engineers the KSP had. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECrew List for Rifter Spacecraft\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman (mission commander, badass, Bill and Bob\u0027s brother, Scott, Kurt and Anna\u0027s cousin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman (pilot, FTL Drive controller, Bob and Jeb\u0027s brother, Kurt, Scott and Anna\u0027s cousin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob Kerman (pilot, sublight engine controller, Jeb and Bill\u0027s brother, Kurt, Scott and Anna\u0027s cousin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott Kerman-Manley (scientist, exotic matter specialist, telescope operator)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt James Kerman (scientist, probe operator, sapientologist, Jeb, Bill, and Bob\u0027s cousin, brother of Anna)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinda Dobrev (engineer, power control)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFritz William Lundferd (scientist, anomalous artifact specialist)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnna Kerman (cousin of Jeb, Bill, Bob, and Scott, sister of Kurt, scientist, antimatter and theoretical physics specialist)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJennifer Cerenkov (engineer, radiation shielding and radiation specialist)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENigel Burkefield (doctor, flight surgeon general)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBethany Kerbland (doctor, burn and disease specialist, psychologist)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAngelika Vykus (engineer, FTL Drive maintenance)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese twelve kerbs would embark on the longest journey any kerbal had ever been on, all aboard the Rifter. The date of their boarding was Dezvrya 8th, 2215, a date which no kerbal would ever forget. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ladies and gents, welcome back to space.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman said the first words to the new crew of the \u003Cem\u003ERifter\u003C/em\u003E as their Panthalassa orbital transport drifted toward the freshly-minted FTL ship. The \u003Cem\u003ERifter\u003C/em\u003E had inside it the most advanced technology that kerbalkind had to offer, including an advanced AI, named Keitan; two ring-shaped Alkerb Drives mounted on the rear; seven nuclear engines, arranged in a ring around the Alkerb Drives; four nuclear reactors; a research module; two Kantele manned landers; and three missile/gatling gun turrets. There was also a full suite of computers and an entertainment module to keep the crew sane during their two-year-long voyage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Load up. All crew, get to your stations.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineers scrambled to their monitors, the scientists to the research module, and the pilots to the bridge. Jeb pulled himself into the commander\u0027s seat in the cupola window module and strapped himself in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Prepare for trial run. Set target at Duna and rotate.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger, Jeb.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003ERifter\u003C/em\u003E slowly turned itself toward Duna\u0027s current position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fire Alkerb Drive engines.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Firing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the crew felt a sudden jolt as their vessel shot away from Kerbin and toward the red planet. A blue-purple trail emanated from the Alkerb Drives as they fired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We are away. Bill, what\u0027s our ETA to Duna?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s... I don\u0027t believe this! ETA is two hours and thirty-seven minutes!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Impressive. Alright, Angelika, get right on maintenance of the drives. We don\u0027t want them to fail while we\u0027re in the middle of nowhere.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Aye, sir.

The crew was patting each other on the back for a successful first run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Woohoo! Sea trials are done, let\u0027s get out of here!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We need more fuel, Fritz. If we don\u0027t fuel up then we\u0027ll go shooting past our target.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Anna, you\u0027re a downer.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the celebrations concluded and the fuel was piped in, the FTL ship undocked from the station and set its target to its real destination: the Sigma Rendarra system, 20 light-years away. As the ship would be traveling at 10\u003Cem\u003Ec\u003C/em\u003E, this would take a mere two years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We are away from the Velde Metalworks station.
