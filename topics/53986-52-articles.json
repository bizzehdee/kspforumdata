Similar for pods, I\u0027d say; Mercury/Vostok equivalents would be 200-500km, Gemini is clearly a thousand or two. Beyond that you probably should be adding external antennas (c.f. the 4x high gain array on the Apollo CSM). I don\u0027t actually use KAS so I have no idea, sorry...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe: TAC, you might want to check with ANWRocketMan who is editing density and consumption stats for TACLS; that way the amount of resources you\u0027re adding will jibe with the life support duration you desire. 1-person pods generally have between a day and a week of life support (IIRC the max-duration Vostok flight was about a week), larger pods 2-3 weeks, but variable (something like TKS, which was really a mini space station, could probably have been provisioned for a month plus, whereas a ferry capsule like a notional \u0022Apollo Block III\u0022 for Skylab servicing would have only a couple days).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I meant by that check is: the wildcard config you posted applied to all pods, whether or not other patches had already modified them. What I suggested was adding a check in that wildcard config (i.e. the @PART[*]HAS... line) that checks for things that would only be present if RO has already patched the part. For example, if you apply to all pods that don\u0027t already have ModuleSPU (!HAS:@MODULE[ModuleSPU] or whatever) that might be a good check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPosting now; I\u0027ll check your files in a bit when I get back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T22:20:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will keep testing/editing, perhaps the idea of default comms/KAS storage for every pod is just interfering with what settings pods have by default, i will attempt to stick with 1MM/1000KM (like the reflectron) as the default addition, i will experiment with KAS storage settings (somewhere between 10 to 20 units per crewman feels about right) I think i have worked out probe default power usage @ rate = 0.0111111 (thats 11 watts?) with 2680 max power (24 hours supply i think) and RT2 settings with 3km Passive antenna (like the AIES probes from RT@ RO file).

I really, really do not want to start over. I really do enjoy playing with this modpack (except with all the terrain bugs). I would also like to know when larger parts might come out? The largest parts we have right now are only 3.75m in diameter. If we want to really get anywhere, we need much larger parts. I think a good suggestion to the realistic fuels mod would be to have only 1 fuel tank part (for normal fuels, anyway. not pressurized) whose diameter AND height can be altered.

Also, as Aazard says, if you installed all required mods you should already have bigger parts. Heck, the MK1-2 pod is made four meters (if it\u0027s not, something\u0027s not installed right). Use the required Stretchy to make whatever size tanks you want, and follow the OP and use one of the two engine packs to get appropriately-sized engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
