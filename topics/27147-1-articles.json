Tough luck, unless you contribute to this magnificent future you so desire!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you believe me if I said you could aid medical science without lifting a finger? (of course, you have to lift your finger a few times in order to click the mouse during setup... but after setup you\u0027re good to live finger-lifting-free)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, there are a ton of things that can go wrong in a human body. Scientists are amazing creatures that understand things you never though the human race needed to know. One such case is the proteins in your body, which tend to do this thing called \u0022Folding\u0022. I have no idea what that means, but some scientists seem to think this \u0022folding\u0022 of proteins is a thing we need to understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey say they can possibly find cures for these diseases:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Alzheimer\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Cancer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Huntington\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Parkinson\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what can you do to aid them? Simple! Download a legit tool to your pc. Install it. Run it. Scientists can now borrow a little bit of your computers free time (when you sleep, watch youtube etc). The best thing about this, is the simplicity! So simple, and for a good cause. You don\u0027t pay any money for it, you only invest some of your computers idle-time into your future health.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been folding for a while now, and racked up a respectable 350K points. (many many more to come, trust me!) You actually get points for folding, and are ranked against other folders. Though this is just for fun, since points don\u0027t matter. That\u0027s right, the points are just like deodorant to a cab driver. (/whose line quote)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough talk, start folding right now, and create a healthier future for yourself and your family!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFolding@home official website is found at this adress:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://folding.stanford.edu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://folding.stanford.edu\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and just to be clear, I\u0027m posting this to initiate a possible team.
