The game will switch you to 1x timewarp as soon as you get below 70 km, even before you touch the atmosphere. And below that you can only use physics timewarp which goes up to 4x. So is the challenge about getting as close as possible to these 70 km?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cyberklad","CreatedById":74011,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T21:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s10.postimg.org/imm7gl5t5/ksp43.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp43.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I guess that is as close as anyone can get.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
