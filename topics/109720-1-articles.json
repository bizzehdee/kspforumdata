If you want to tweak the LV-N to encourage other engines, you\u0027ve thought of some interesting ideas. I\u0027m a big fan of increasing the cost of using the engine using various mechanisms. The monetary cost is an obvious place to start. I also like the idea of making the LV-N bigger and heavier that way it\u0027s still useful for large interplanetary ships - their \u0022proper\u0022 domain?? - but not so good an option to slap on any old inter-munar transport or lander.\n\nUntil reading this thread I was miffed at their cowling - how if you clustered several together they could knock each other off when they were activated - but really that\u0027s just another cost to using a powerful engine, I get it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E An alternate way to model the NTR\u0027s cooldown thrust phase would be to subtract a certain amount of fuel everytime the NERV\u0027s thrust is cut to zero. The amount subtracted would depend on the integrated throttle setting from the previous n seconds...So if the player does a proper tailoff of the burn, the hit would be small. And if the cutoff is sudden, the hit would be larger. But this method would not cause players to overshoot their maneuver nodes.\n\u003E Or, an alternate way of modeling this would be to simply decrease the Isp by a bit to represent the efficiency loss during the cooldown phase.\n\nIf you were trying to be stingy couldn\u0027t you deactivate all your fuel tanks to prevent the LV-N from stealing fuel at spool-down? I prefer the idea of a variable ISP depending on throttle. In Manley\u0027s Interstellar videos there was an engine where the ISP dropped the higher the throttle. Generally speaking the LV-N is using an energy source to heat fuel so maybe it works the same way - this seems like a reasonable mechanic to complicate the LV-N\u0027s use without making them incomprehensible. (Chime in if you know how they work and this is completely wrong)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T17:51:43Z","Content":"So I decided to finally create an account here to share my thoughts (Well, technically mine and parts of an acquaintance of mines) of LV-N balancing.\n\nAll numbers are brainstorming only and can be changed as needed.\n\n- LV-N will use nuclear fuel, let\u0027s call it \u0022Fissle\u0022 for now.\n- LV-N will only use Fissle when reactor is on, which is when the throttle is up or when activated manually.\n- Reactor will have 6 months of combined on time fissile material.\n- Reactor will have a, let\u0027s say, 2 minute warm up time before the engine is able to produce ANY thrust.

(though, a little more thrust could be nice, say 65 or maybe even 70 kn ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n\nBecause the Nerva isn\u0027t so heavy after all. Please consider the following wallpaper (all tanks are 100% fuel). I\u0027ve put the stats into each picture, but just to be sure: except for the first, each of the following designs carries the equivalent of ***six nukes***, including 300kg of extra weight per engine as stand-in for structural parts and heatsinks. I\u0027ve come up with that 6x number mostly because it suits my own needs, but I\u0027ve done some browsing of Jool-5 and Eve Rocks submissions and a lot of vessels have either six or twelve nukes; there\u0027s also a few that have four, eight, or ten, but the six-or-twelves are a clear majority. So maybe that number isn\u0027t that bad after all.\n\n![nerva_comparison.jpg](http://ksp.schnobs.de/stuff/nerva_comparison.jpg)\n\nOne might argue that I\u0027m going over the top, that a Nerva that only ever makes sense in the company of the biggest tanks in the game is too much. You may even be right. But the current Nerva is just too damn small: the first vessel just doesn\u0027t warrant the use of nukes (IMO, all IMO -- can\u0027t stress this enough). Making the Nerva more powerful at the same TWR would rule out the small stuff, and would greatly improve the part count on the vessels that really need it.\n\nPlease also note how even the totally overpowered, 5m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 tug still has a better fuel economy than a Skipper or Rhino. So much for the Nerva being \u0022too heavy already\u0022 or forcing you to a crawling speed. The TWR isn\u0027t that bad in the context of the other engines we\u0027re having.\n\n**@SkyWalker**: I\u0027d actually quite happy if the high-powered, heavy Nerva remained a small diameter part. It reminds me of this:\n\n![XQG006Fl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XQG006Fl.jpg)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just to add, the real nerva had 333.6 Kn of thrust, 850 isp, weighed 34 metric tons when empty, and was about 10 m wide and 40 something m long. So maybe moar thrust for our tiny scaled down nerva wouldn\u0027t be unrealistic.\n\nCommon mistake: you\u0027re quoting the numbers for an entire Nerva-driven rocket stage, including a hydrogen tank the size of the space shuttle\u0027s. The bare-bone engine would have been more like 7t. \n\n\u003E Spooling? could be fun [...] Totally agree ---\u003E It could also NOT BE fun to a lot of players.\n\nI think it would be quite palatable. One can easily learn how to deal with it, even mittengrabbers like myself will get \u0022good enough\u0022 results. While mildly annoying, it makes a lot more sense than the current heat thing, and is easier to cope with, too.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So I decided to finally create an account here to share my thoughts [...]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - LV-N will use nuclear fuel, let\u0027s call it \u0022Fissle\u0022 for now.\n\u003E - LV-N will only use Fissle when reactor is on, which is when the throttle is up or when activated manually.\n\u003E - Reactor will have 6 months of combined on time fissile material.\n\u003E - Reactor will have a, let\u0027s say, 2 minute warm up time before the engine is able to produce ANY thrust.

One might even call it \u0022Hydrogen\u0022 and make it a lot less dense than fuel... I think that, too, would be a lot easier to sell than the half-empty tanks we have now, even if it was objectively just as bad or even worse. I\u0027ll add that to the OP if you don\u0027t mind.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E NOTE: The only thing worse than overheating is a space engine that spools. I get that smaller precision engines are supposed to be used, but in reality we will overshoot the target by 200 m/s and then waste 1k m/s of tug fuel correcting.\n\nIf your vessels makes 5m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 (that\u0027s TWR 0.5, which would be a lot for a nuclear vessel) and takes ten seconds to spool down, you will overshoot by ~25m/s. Even with very little skill, you should be able to bring this to within 5m/s. The remainder can be coped with using smaller engines, like a single LV-909 / 48-7S, or maybe even RCS and monopropellant.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Radioactive effects.\n\u003E \n\u003E [...] add green glow to the radioactive area or parts that suffered radioactive exposure, make Kerbals turn permanently brown or make their heads glow green when in longer (30s?) contact with radioactive areas,[...]\n\nThis would be quite an addition to the game... and while it sounds quite interesting at first, it would probably be an even worse gameplay mechanic than heat.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n**@ALL:**\n\nThanks for the good discussion so far, and for not derailing the thread over politics.
