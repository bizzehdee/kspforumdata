pre-set \u0027fuel-types\u0027 will still exist to add proper-ratios of various propellants, and you\u0027ll still be able to further customize the contents of the tank without disturbing that pre-set ratio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, I will not be differentiating engines with different fuel ratios.\u00A0 If you really want that experience, go ahead and use RealFuels.\u00A0 This is simply so that I don\u0027t have to make a million different patches and resource-switch setups for every resource-enabled part for various mod setups (and deal with conflicts/etc).\u00A0 With this new system any resource that could potentially be used will be available (perhaps with some user-customizable limitations).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill also be including some pre-configured \u0027tank types\u0027 for a few use-cases; these types will determine the dry mass of the tank for the portion that is filled by a particular fuel or resource;\u00A0 so the final dry-mass for a tank will be determined by the types and ratios of resources it has (and if configured for zero-boil-off or not).\u00A0 Tank resource-type switching will be made available full-time while in flight for most tanks; however it will need availability of certain resources in order to do the swapping.\u00A0 As the tank dry mass may change, and conservation of mass is a real thing, that extra mass has to come from or go to somewhere; this will use \u0027RocketParts\u0027 or \u0027SpareParts\u0027 or some other resource to be consumed or produced when the tank type is swapped and dry mass is changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yet more fun times:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso working on a custom wheel-collider implementation.\u00A0 I just cannot live with the setup of the Unity/PhysX wheel collider (e.g. rigid-body oriented;

merely having the jointed rigidbodies causes the problem (a single rigidbody works fine with WC\u0027s; but add a joint and a second body and watch things get flung into the air, regardless of if that second rigidbody has any appreciable mass, settings on the wheel colliders... or anything... merely its presence causes the problem).\u00A0 Even if all of the WC\u0027s are on the \u0027main\u0027 rigid-body, merely adding a second jointed RB to the first will cause it to freak out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T16:53:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI often wonder why the Squad team went with Unity to begin with?
