Will see about taking some time to re-add these in the near future\n\nIf you are aware of any other mounts that are missing for specific engines, please let me know;  all lower-stage engines should have all lower-stage mounts; all upper-stage engines should have all upper-stage mounts."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T17:51:02Z","Content":"General Development Update:\n\n1.1 dev branch is shaping up nicely.  Slowly chipping away at the list of TODO stuff;  mostly what is left is texture cleanup (engine emissives) and landing leg/gear type stuff.\n\nSo if/when they fix the fairing and procedural drag-cube bugs there should be a quite usable SSTU release available shortly after.  Not perfect, but usable.\n\nNow...on to the \u0027more bad news\u0027.... apparently U5 wheel colliders... suck.  I have other words for it...but they would quickly get me banned from the forum.\n\nApparently they now auto-orient themselves to the rigidbody they are attached to.  This might be all fine-and-good for some simple vehicle setups, but it absolutely breaks any sort of multi-leg landing leg setup, and also breaks the landing-gear integrated-into-wings (e.g. SC-E wings and fuselage) -- this is because KSP expects a certain orientation for the aero-parts (e.g. y\u002B = forward) while the U5 wheel colliders expect the standard Unity z\u002B = forward setup.  So I have to rotate the landing gear model to work with the wing... and as such the wheel-colliders are now rotated 90\u0027 off from what they should be (e.g. instead of pointing towards the ground they point towards the rear of the craft... and as such do not function).  This is a UNITY problem, and not a KSP problem;  absolutely nothing that I or SQUAD can do about it.\n\nSo... Series-E parts are likely going to be pulled from distribution for the time being until I can fix/rework them.  Thanks Unity... really love what you did there (....................................).  Who at Unity really thought that these new wheel colliders were acceptable?

Mostly need to add a part config file for it, adjust some masses / COMs, alter a few colliders, setup attach nodes, add an animation module to the wings to animate the gear doors (and somehow link it to the gears action/button).\n\nWith the changes to Unity WC\u0027s and the limitations to KSP aero part setups, this is the -only- way it will be able to work;  the two orientation setups are mutually exclusive.  Not a huge fan so far....\n\nHave a WIP implementation of the gear being separate parts that are attached through attach nodes, adding 3 to the total part count for the craft.

There is simply no way that I can create a \u0027FuelType\u0027 for every potential combination of resources that a player may want (e.g. supplies\u002Bmonopropellant?  ec\u002Bsupplies?, x\u002By\u002Bz?), so I am moving to a system similar to ModularFuelTanks and RealFuels.  You\u0027ll push a button to pull open a GUI for the tank, where you will be able to select any number of propellants in any quantity or ratio; pre-set \u0027fuel-types\u0027 will still exist to add proper-ratios of various propellants, and you\u0027ll still be able to further customize the contents of the tank without disturbing that pre-set ratio.\n\nNo, I will not be differentiating engines with different fuel ratios.  If you really want that experience, go ahead and use RealFuels.  This is simply so that I don\u0027t have to make a million different patches and resource-switch setups for every resource-enabled part for various mod setups (and deal with conflicts/etc).  With this new system any resource that could potentially be used will be available (perhaps with some user-customizable limitations).\n\nWill also be including some pre-configured \u0027tank types\u0027 for a few use-cases; these types will determine the dry mass of the tank for the portion that is filled by a particular fuel or resource;  so the final dry-mass for a tank will be determined by the types and ratios of resources it has (and if configured for zero-boil-off or not).  Tank resource-type switching will be made available full-time while in flight for most tanks; however it will need availability of certain resources in order to do the swapping.  As the tank dry mass may change, and conservation of mass is a real thing, that extra mass has to come from or go to somewhere; this will use \u0027RocketParts\u0027 or \u0027SpareParts\u0027 or some other resource to be consumed or produced when the tank type is swapped and dry mass is changed.\n\nAnd yet more fun times:  \n\nAlso working on a custom wheel-collider implementation.  I just cannot live with the setup of the Unity/PhysX wheel collider (e.g. rigid-body oriented; breaks terribly on jointed rigidbodies; no way to rotate it off-axis), so I will be \u0027rolling my own\u0027 as it were.  So far in about two hours work I already have something that works more consistently and with fewer issues than the Unity wheel collider.  Kind of sad when a simple and naive hacked together implementation works better than the \u0027professional\u0027 system (though likely less perfomant than native C/C\u002B\u002Bcode).  Nowhere near finished, but at least its not freaking out ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  Is using a single ray-cast and basic AddForceAtPosition calls currently, will refine this to handle proper angular momentum @ reference point, friction curves, motor input, steering... all the fun stuff.

From my experiences in playing around with them though, the problems are not-solvable.  Any time you have multiple rigidbodies joined by wheel-colliders.... the WC\u0027s freak out and cause terrible oscillations, bouncing, jumping.... pretty much all the problems you are seeing in game can be replicated in the Unity-Editor with a very simple test case.  There is no combination of spring/damper/mass/WC-mass that will fix it; merely having the jointed rigidbodies causes the problem (a single rigidbody works fine with WC\u0027s; but add a joint and a second body and watch things get flung into the air, regardless of if that second rigidbody has any appreciable mass, settings on the wheel colliders... or anything... merely its presence causes the problem).  Even if all of the WC\u0027s are on the \u0027main\u0027 rigid-body, merely adding a second jointed RB to the first will cause it to freak out."},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T16:53:19Z","Content":"I often wonder why the Squad team went with Unity to begin with?

What\u0027s the big pay off for using a game engine that\u0027s so restrictive and hard to implement the things you desire your game to do? With my limited experience with the old Unity way of making mods, it just seems like there\u0027s a lot of work involved just to make things. Now, it\u0027s even harder to make things, albeit it would probably take some getting used to. I\u0027m no expert with coding (I barely remember how to code in COBOL, much less learn C#), but there had to be an easier way to make this game more user friendly on the user and developer fronts. I guess I will never understand.\n\u003E \n\nWell.. the investment to make your -own- game engine is non trivial, and you end up spending a lot of time solving simple problems that have already been dealt with by others.  I\u0027ve gone down this road before, and it is... not easy.  I would expect a 3-5 year development cycle for a decently realized game engine... and that is just the back-end of things.  You still need to build the game on top of it.  Unity handles all the graphics end of things, audio, input handling, tons of other stuff that I haven\u0027t played with much.\n\nThe problems come from when the game-engine implements (or assumes) things that.... don\u0027t work... for the game that is being designed on it.  Which is where KSP is currently at regarding wheel-colliders (? opinionated statement... no hard evidence of it, merely speculation and observation).\n\nFor many game engines for a professional setup you have source/compile availability and can customize the engine to fix these shortcomings.  I\u0027m not sure if that is the case with Unity or not... but Unity is also using a third-party physics library (PhysX), so even if SQUAD does have source/compile access to the UnityEngine, they still would not be able to fix the PhysX end of things without source and compile access for that as well (ohh.. and you also need to -know how- to fix the stuff; physics simulations are... not easy... to setup properly for generic use cases, generally lots of PhD\u0027s involved in writing the original code).\n\nAnyhow... as Claw stated; probably a conversation best left for other threads."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T18:00:21Z","Content":"Thanks Claw!

Suppose I should probably start working on getting that system functional (is currently in the concept dev and figuring out GUI stuff phase)?\n\nNotable stuff that likely -won\u0027t- be available in the initial releases:\n\n- LanderCore pods; need the new resource system setup, and a generic model-switch setup for their ascent tanks\n- Series-E parts; if available at all they won\u0027t have landing gear.  Also need to rework the colliders for the wings... which means I need to re-set up the Unity files for them... re-rig, re-export...etc...\n\nEngines, MFT-fuel tanks, SRBs, decouplers, fairings, and Series-A/B/C parts are all in and working.  Even made an MFT fuel tank out of the LC-FUEL models.  So the majority of stuff is working well (in so far as I\u0027ve tested it anyway)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T21:00:50Z","Content":"Work at your own pace, mage.

At this point I\u0027m just getting the GUI layout stuff figured out, have not yet started working on the resource calculation or part updating end of things.\n\n![QVtcW6e.png](http://i.imgur.com/QVtcW6e.png)\n\nYes it is going to be very similar to the RealFuels / MFT GUI setup.  Will certainly have some differences in a few areas, and I\u0027m still not sure exactly how it will all be handled for the user-customization end.\n\nI\u0027ve even considered just making RF or MFT a dependency.... but MFT doesn\u0027t handle non-stock resources very well, and RF comes with too much \u0027extra stuff\u0027 that I don\u0027t want to have to build support for (ModuleEngineConfigs, all the ullage/throttling/engine-start stuff); nor do I like depending upon code that is out of my control if at all avoidable.\n\nWhen done this new resource-switch setup will be tightly integrated into the existing modular parts, giving me a single central management point for all part that could need any form of resource-switching.  Will have an easy/simple external API for updating the part volume; this same API will be how my own modules will interface with it to update the resources for geometry/model changes.  This will allow for adding dedicated \u0027storage space\u0027 to many existing parts to represent their internal cargo capacity; such as CMs may have an amount of volume reserved for MP and another set of volume that is available for adding supplies or \\*gasp\\* extra KIS storage (yes I will be figuring out a way to enable KIS storage to be seen as a resource type if it is installed).\n\nWill have options to limit the resources available for specific parts (at the module-config level) to enable differentiation between different container storage types (e.g. \u0027dry\u0027 and \u0027wet).\n\nThe \u0027Container Type\u0027 options at the top of the GUI will switch between different modifiers for dry mass, available volume, crash tolerance, heat tolerance, boil-off speed, and anti-boil-off EC consumption.  The \u0027standard\u0027 type will be as-per current configs for tankage mass ratio and tankage volume loss (utilization in RF).  The light-weight type will have less crash tolerance and heat tolerance than the defaults specified in the part config, but will have a better dry/wet ratio; other container types will have alternate settings appropriate for their setup.\n\nThe \u0027Fuel Type\u0027 buttons will basically pre-set the sliders and values in the resource list for a specific fuel mix... these are just convenience functions that replace the Real-Fuels \u0027configure for attached engine\u0027 function.  You can even press multiple fuel-type buttons if you want more than one fuel type in a tank; it will setup the ratios for each selected fuel type with an even split by volume (as long as there are no conflicts; e.g. pressing the Hydrolox and LqdHydrogen buttons together would do no good).  For example if you pressed the \u0027Hydrolox\u0027 and \u0027Hypergolic\u0027 fuel type buttons, 50% of the tank volume would be dedicated to proper hydrolox fuel mix, and the remaining 50% would be dedicated to the hypergolic fuel mix; if you then pressed the \u0027MonoPropellant\u0027 button, the split would be 33%, 33%, 33%.. and so on and so on.  And of course you could then custom tailor these presets by adjusting the sliders or through the manual value-input boxes.\n\nSo... anyhow... let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback on what I\u0027ve posted so far; still fairly early in the concept development stage, so now is the time to be thinking on the feature-set and general functionality of it."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T01:53:32Z","Content":"since you\u0027re going for a RF/MFT-alike, what about an auto-fill button in the right click menu? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  \n\nalso, will you support adding EC and RCS fuel to the tank (and using volume from the tanks) and then filling the remainder available volume with fuel for the engines? like for example, using the GUI one can pick 2k EC, 1k NTO, 1k MMH and the remainder of Hydrolox for a RL-10  \n\njust like how RF works but without the realism part ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)"}]}
