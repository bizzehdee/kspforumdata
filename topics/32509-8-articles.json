first AKS warship with a fully armored bridge, something the kerbals serving in the AKS Alliance have been complaining about.\u00A0 Took the idea i used when i made the shadow-I class frigate where i used girders as windows that could block most smaller weapons fire effectively, and basically modified it and placed it in such a way that the bridge is at least semi protected while offering a restricted but still decent view to the front and up (the way its done you cant see jack to the sides).\u00A0 Given the hull itself is ONLY 123 parts, and that this thing (from my limited initial testing) holds up rather well against anything including some competitive missiles like the popper, script\u0027s asm, and my tripedo-S, as well as the usual ibeam barrages, im very happy with the result in every way (although it doesnt have wings for appearance since i cant really afford the parts until 1.1).\u00A0 Current loadout is 6 HSG weapons system compatible hardpoints, and 2 aux 0.6m hardpoints at the rear (might remove those since they are kinda useless).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ufzoPUG.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

yourself.\u00A0 At 20km engage the nuke, and keep going up at ~10-20deg off prograde and let the rapier kick in automatically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(the above is the hardest part to get right since it takes alot of trial/error to get the optimal ascent profile.\u00A0 If you fly too shallow you will fry, if you go too steep ejection angle you will not be able to get into orbit since the nuke will not get you to orbital velocity before you drop back and your ejection velocity will be too low.\u00A0 My suggestion is to quicksave at ~10km and try various ejection profiles until you get it right)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*when the rapier dies you HAVE to have a AP of at least 45km or else you are gonne either fail to reach orbit entirely or you will be burning way more fuel then needed.\u00A0 You can alter your angle off prograde here as needed but try to gain as much horizontal velocity while reaching a AP of 45-50km on the rapier\u0027s fuel supply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*burn teh nuke at ~20deg above prograde on the nuke until your AP reaches 70km, then just prograde it until you are at the desired final AP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*circularize as you would any other very low TWR craft (that means start the burn early before you pass the AP as the nuke has lousy TWR)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*find the 1st hostile target and like shoot at it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*return to minmus to rearm and refuel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*repeat the last 2 steps as needed until killed by hostile forces\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOhh, and im by no means the best SSTO designer, i just used to be completely obsesses with SSTA concept (single stage to anywhere) so most of my SSTOs had incredible ranges and as always carry actual weaponry.\u00A0 that said, to achieve what ive achieved i had to use patented AKS fuel compression technology, and matter phasing tech as well since i use xenon tanks to fit 660 LF, and then take said tanks and cram, them into each other until ive achieved the desired amount of fuel fully internal to the onboard drone bay.\u00A0 So yeah, im not the best, but my SSTOs actually look cool (dont get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with looks of other people\u0027s craft, but i just really like ultra compact stuff myself, so for me the AKS craft look pretty cool), carry weapons, and well landing issues aside (never ever try to land one of my SSTOs full of fuel, it does not work at all), arent that unpleasant to pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish I had the patience to wait for 1.1, but I have
