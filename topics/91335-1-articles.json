It was about 10 minutes from the first picture of them both near each other to them both docked. And, this was the most fun I\u0027ve had in KSP in a long time. Mainly because due to technical problems, I had to do everything manually. Very manually. I didn\u0027t get to use docking mode, I couldn\u0027t set the other station\u0027s docking port as a target, I couldn\u0027t control from my own docking port. And technically I could have done these things, but they didn\u0027t help. It was raw skill out there and it. was. awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be posting more as the station is expanded upon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-26T22:03:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2014 10:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Itsjustrocketscience\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
