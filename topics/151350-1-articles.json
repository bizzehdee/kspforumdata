He listened to the response from the other side. His mind churned with sleep, the active flight plans, and why Gene would still be at the office. \u201CGene, do you know what time it is?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis wife rolled over and muttered something indistinct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHang on, Gene. I\u2019m changing phones.\u201D Set the handset down on the nightstand and left the room. Two voices came tinny and indistinct through the handset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe came back into the bedroom and placed the handset back in the cradle. He looked into the mirror over the dresser and ran his hands through his hair. He exhaled slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry dear,\u201D he said as dressed in the dark room. \u201DI\u2019ve got to go into the center.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay,\u201D she said sleepily. \u201CBring back a loaf of bread and a carton of milk.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd a stick of butter,\u201D he said as he closed the bedroom door.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMmm, right,\u201D she said to the empty room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDirec walked into the briefing room. The tables had been pushed into the center of the room. They were covered in papers. The chalkboard was covered in calculations and diagrams. Some were half erased, others were over written by others.\u00A0 The cool night air from outside mixed with the smell of coffee and pizza. He shook his head to clear memories of university and being a young engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene, Gus, Linus, Jebediah, and Valentina were standing around a table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust like school,\u201D Direc said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t know about you,\u201D Linus said. \u201CBut, my projects were harder, but slightly less\u2026 exciting though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDirec walked over to the table. \u201COkay,\u201D Direc said. \u201CI\u2019ve got the overview. Now the details.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbout 7 hours ago, a ship owned by Experimental Engineering Group\u200E experienced catastrophic structural failure.\u201D Gene said. \u201CThe lone occupant is unharmed, and the situation is currently stable. Around that time we received notification of the incident through our monitoring network. Six hours ago, we made informal inquiries to Exp Eng. At that time they were assessing the situation and their deployable assets. Two hours ago, again through informal channels we were notified that they intend to formally request assistance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDirec looked at them. They had been working on this for more than two hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay,\u201D Direc said. \u201CSo, what do your friends over there say?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene looked around the table awkwardly.\u00A0It was still a small community, despite the large number of\u00A0organizations launching.\u00A0But, talking to competitors outside of formal channels\u00A0could create problems. \u201CThe capsule is patched. But they figure there\u2019s still a small leak somewhere. He\u2019s got about a day of air left if they can\u2019t find it; longer if they do. The orbit is mean 170 km, delta 20, inclination 10. He was about to square it up when something blew out. They\u2019ll pick apart the telemetry later. But, they want him home first.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDirec nodded. \u201CWhat\u2019s our plan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe have an O-Basket launching in two days. If we strip out the third seat and comforts, downsize the support, fill all the tanks to max, and time the launch right we can do it. Once the two ships rendezvous, their pilot EVAs to the\u00A0OB and climbs in. They\u0027ll\u00A0do a braking burn at AP and return to the surface.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere\u2019s a \u2018but\u2019 isn\u2019t there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere\u2019s no margins,\u201D Linus said. \u201DOne pass, that\u2019s it. We\u2019ll have just\u00A0enough delta V at the top to get it low enough to start aerobraking. We\u2019ll have no control over where they come down. We spend too much of it at rendezvous,\u00A0launch, or the rendezvous burn, neither of them come home.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA lot of reasons to say no,\u201D Direc said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSir,\u201D Valentina said. \u201CIf it was one of us up there you\u2019d chance it with less.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, I would.\u201D Direc said. \u201CBut, it isn\u2019t.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah looked down from having stared at the ceiling through most of the conversation. \u201COn the brown side it\u2019s us, them, and others,\u201D he said. \u201CIn the blue it\u2019s us and them.\u201D He shook his head as if clearing a memory. \u201CUp there, up in the black, looking down, there is no them, no other, just us.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe phone on the wall rang. Gene walked over and answered it. \u201CDirector,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u2019s the chairman.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-15T14:51:37Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2017 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by steuben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
