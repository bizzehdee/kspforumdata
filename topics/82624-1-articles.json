I have a basic understanding of the dynamics of the game but that\u0027s probably not saying much. I\u0027ve run 3 missions to the Mun so far and one to Minmus, all with returns to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to build a small space station over Kerbin and send it off to orbit the Mun. This will act as an orbital science station, that\u0027s the theory anyway. The problem is I really don\u0027t know how to go about it. I\u0027ve got a few pieces stuck together so far but I\u0027m questioning if it\u0027ll even work in the end. Perhaps you guys could look it over before I waste my time on a failed project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe middle of the station is a Mobile Processing Lab. There\u0027s a power generating module on the bottom, and up top we have an engine with a fuel tank. The back side of the Processing Lab has another docking port which I\u0027ll attach a small Munar probe, this will be used to travel between the station and the Munar surface. There\u0027s 4 additional docking ports on the engine that I\u0027ll have to attach some sort of communication equipment to later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does the Processing Lab work? Would I send the probe down to collect samples, then back up to the Processing Lab, which then processes the data and sends it back to Kerbin via Radio? I probably should have figured this out before I started building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo am I on the right track, or leading to an inevitable failure? This is my first attempt at a station, I have no idea what I\u0027m doing. Also, I was expecting to see an option to transfer fuel from my 2 tanks on the solar panel section, to the tank with the engine. How would I go about doing that? The tank with the engine is nearly out of fuel, the other 2 are full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s170.photobucket.com/user/mrgribble/media/screenshot14_zps718c70bb.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u266/mrgribble/screenshot14_zps718c70bb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot14_zps718c70bb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-23T18:39:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2014 06:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wulfonce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiaK","CreatedById":80590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T18:46:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eright click on the transfer target (the one that will be receiving the fuel), then press Alt while right clicking the transfer volunteer tank ( where the fuel is coming from). next, click the \u0027in\u0027 buttons on the target\u0027s menu, and the flow until you press stop or the tank is full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wulfonce","CreatedById":119450,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T18:51:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZodiaK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZodiaK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eright click on the transfer target (the one that will be receiving the fuel), then press Alt while right clicking the transfer volunteer tank ( where the fuel is coming from). next, click the \u0027in\u0027 buttons on the target\u0027s menu, and the flow until you press stop or the tank is full.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh! thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T18:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, a lot of questions.
