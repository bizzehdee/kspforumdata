On my install I scanned the GameData for the biggest folders and went over part textures in each of them. Many parts made by Squad and modders have overly big and detailed textures for parts as small as Telus Mobility Enhancer, plus some parts don\u0027t really need normal maps. The rule of thumb was: No small part should have texture sizes over 1200Kb (which is 1024x1024px), so I downsized most of the textures to 512px and even 256px in some cases, and deleted many normal maps. In total my 100\u002B modded GameDada folder now weights only 610Mb, Squad folder included.
