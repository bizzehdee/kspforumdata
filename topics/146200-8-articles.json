It\u0027s getting to be so ridiculous that I\u00A0just want Squad to come out with an apology, and issue refunds to those of us who want them. I am sure that would be\u00A0embarrassing for them, and they don\u0027t want to do that. They would rather keep our money and tell us to wait, but what is an acceptable amount of time for us to wait? About 2 weeks\u00A0was the acceptable amount of time for us to wait for a fix on console.

Bugs are one thing, but game breaking bugs like not being able to progress in\u00A0the game going unfixed\u00A02 months after release is a whole other issue. I have personally never experienced any game being this bad. It needed\u00A0to get sorted out quickly, like a month and a half ago,\u00A0and there needs to be some honesty and transparency coming out of both Squad and FT. Having this as our\u00A0first impression of Squad and KSP isn\u0027t a good one. The game is not in early access on console and we did not pre-order the game to play it at some unspecified point in the future.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T03:44:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBRUTAL dev notes.\u00A0 The curruption appears to go far beyond the save data.\u00A0 They\u0027re so excited about PC1.2 it seems like they have forgotten all about their console customers.\u00A0 Are there not enough of us for SQUAD to care?\u00A0 At first I was fascinated by all this console update drama.\u00A0 Now I am losing my patience and approaching mortification.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndyChilly","CreatedById":167367,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T11:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222755512\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146200\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221473824681\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168314\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DOCTOR DEMENTAL\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, DOCTOR DEMENTAL said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBRUTAL dev notes.\u00A0 The curruption appears to go far beyond the save data.\u00A0 They\u0027re so excited about PC1.2 it seems like they have forgotten all about their console customers.\u00A0 Are there not enough of us for SQUAD to care?\u00A0 At first I was fascinated by all this console update drama.\u00A0 Now I am losing my patience and approaching mortification.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust read through, its almost like they are ignoring the problem.
