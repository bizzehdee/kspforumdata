However to keep this going for a huge number of real vehicles, 1.875m parts are needed. Soyuz, Atlas, Falcon 9, Shuttle SRBs, and Antares all fit into this rough zone. It fills a nice sweet spot between minimalist satellite launchers and heavy lifters, and I suspect that these parts would become very heavily used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI addition the current SRBs used for the shuttle are very underpowered due to their 1.25m size, meaning that the Vector has to be incredibly powerful to make up for it. The RL space shuttle gets over 70% of its thrust from its two boosters, while the KSP shuttle only gets around 40% of its thrust from them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John JACK","CreatedById":161340,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T01:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.25, 2.5 and 3.75 parts have ratios 1:2 and 1:1.5 in diameter.

Gap between \u0022size 1\u0022 and \u0022size 2\u0022 already looks bigger.\u003Cbr\u003E\nVolume, meaning mass and capacity, is proportional to linear size \u003Cem\u003Ecubed\u003C/em\u003E. 1:9 and 3.375 ratios. In game largest 2.5 m tank has \u003Cstrong\u003E8 times\u003C/strong\u003E more fuel than largest 1.25 m tank, and largest 3.75 m tank is just 2.25 times more than largest 2.5 m one.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd rigidity, meaning amount of force to bend something for a given deformation, is proportional to linear size \u003Cem\u003Efourth power\u003C/em\u003E.

But there should be at least some balance, to ensure usefulness of any part, not just one Twitch or LV-909 for every size. Engines of different sizes have different stats and are not just scaled for a reason. Tanks, batteries and wings in stock are actually scaled, but for simplycity only.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso different stats in different sizes is realistic. You can not scale nature, and for example engine bell of twice size will not provide same ISP with quad thrust. Smaller structural parts are relatively more strong but bigger parts are more rigid. Not even mention fourth dimension, like gimbal rates or spool-up times. They use clusters of smaller parts instead one big all the time, from laptop batteries to Merlin engines. One big engine IRL may have better ISP, but be heavier and less reliable because greater mechanical stresses. And of course bigger engines cost much more, even big enough machines to make parts are very rare and in high demand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTweakScale may be okay as a mod, to allow people do whatever they want for their own goals and funs.

Once upon a time, there were only three sizes: \u0022normal\u0022 1.25 m, \u0022tiny\u0022 0.625 m (half size) and \u0022big\u0022 2.5 m (twice size). But then Squad added \u0022huge\u0022 parts, and not double size again (5 m) but just one-and-half of previous. That set a precedent of sizes being closer. Next was Mk2 size, that is wider than 1.25 m Mk1 and lighter than 2.5 m. So why not do the same again and incorporate a \u0022size 1\u00BD\u0022, even just nominally? Or stock some mod with that parts and community will do as always.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
