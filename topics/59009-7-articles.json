The stock asteroid sample seems to ignore the regular situation multiplier so it always gives 50 or so science, which makes this a really impractical way to build up too much science, but also prevents asteroids from further throwing off the career mode balance too much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy parts don\u0027t do that though. A full set of science reports for a class E asteroid can return around 1000 science. Getting that much science for every class E asteroid you manage to rendezvous with would make the science points balloon even further out of control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like the idea of setting up some kind of diminishing returns for each asteroid class, so maybe you could get results from four or five asteroids before you ran out (but keeping the same overall total amount of science for each class). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven better would be assigning a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_spectral_types\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Espectral type\u003C/a\u003E for each asteroid and basing the diminishing returns and science reports off of that instead of just size.

It would be easy to set up a different method of collecting stock asteroid samples (with a robotic collector for example), but altering the stock EVA experiment would be more difficult.

So it would basically work as it does now, just with an additional layer of diminishing returns: an experiment in biome 1 gives 100% of the standard return, biome 2 gives 80%, biome 3 gives 65%, etc... (maybe taking into account the total number of biomes per planet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething similar should be easily possible with asteroids. The asteroid class would be treated like an individual planet and the unique asteroid ID number would be treated like the biomes for each class. That would essentially work exactly as you described.
