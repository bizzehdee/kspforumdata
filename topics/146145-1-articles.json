Along the way he lost his grip and I wasn\u0027t able to tell him to grab back on in time as I had the bay menu open. I hit LB\u002B Long B to switch on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E but nothing is happening. I have mono-propellant in the capsule which is all I thought you needed to turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, is there some upgrade I\u0027m missing or is this a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrDave","CreatedById":64401,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-18T23:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think X toggles \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on EVA. Unless you mean your craft? Should work if it is still manned or you have a probe core. Did you know, you can click on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator on the navball to activate it in cursor mode when flying a craft? I can\u0027t remember trying it, but maybe it works in EVA too?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erikinthebakery","CreatedById":166663,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-19T01:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMrDave is correct, X activates \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E during an EVA. Also, sometimes (err...well...very frequently) Kerbals can hit their headfs too hard and not be able to do anything until they have landed and you\u0027ve told them to get up (by moving with the left stick)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drakau","CreatedById":166647,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-19T11:56:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, it\u0027s an odd one. I did try using the pointer to click the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E button but that wasn\u0027t having it. I didn\u0027t realise it swapped over to X when EVAing though. I\u0027m betting it\u0027s the headbang/ragdoll thing, cos he did seem to fire off at a few metres per second when it happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
