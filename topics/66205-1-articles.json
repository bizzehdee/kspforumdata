Thought I\u0027d change that tonight. Prior to today, I had maxed out my tech tree with a few scattered probes. But today I decided to remove all mods and start a new career from scratch. My first career mode was started in .22, so I was able to tech easily. So, knowing that I\u0027d have to work a bit more for those delicious science points, I got down to work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple stuff first, sub-orbital launch for science, then an orbital launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoved up to a manned Mun encounter/orbit with a return to Kerbin. Which was promptly followed by a landing and return. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen to Minmus. Went straight for a landing and return on the first shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecided to hit the Mun and Minmus several times each with landers and then return them to Kerbin for more science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I built a Duna lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve attempted to land on Duna several times in my Kerbal life, the first time my lander slammed into the surface after realizing I had no chutes. The second attempt ended in failure when my lander failed to make it back into orbit after running out of fuel. But eventually, I found my way around. I\u0027ve been there several times now and safely returned. But never in vanilla. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonight, Jeb, Bill, and Bob all made it from Kerbin, to Duna, and safely home again. All in one shot, without forgetting anything important, and 100% mod free. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T07:21:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA Duna mission is a pretty big job.
