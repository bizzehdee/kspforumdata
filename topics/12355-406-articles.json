Turn it OFF afterwards, and it zeros the throttle, so there is still some connection there that is working. While en-route to orbit, if you manually take care of the throttles, it will still change the craft\u0027s course as normal, so that works. The messages at the bottom of the Ascent box still update and swap according to the proper events, IE, once I have the apoapsis where I want it, it updates from \u0027Gravity Turn\u0027 to \u0027Coasting to Edge of Atmosphere\u0027. So again, that portion is seemingly still working. All other aspects I\u0027ve tested of MJ still function as I expect, though I\u0027ve not had reason to do rendezvous or docking evolutions yet. \u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no coder, but to me, it would seem that something was either accidentally edited in the throttle control area, or the full version of Kerbal changed something somewhere so that the previous code is no longer reliable. It\u0027s still a great mod, and I can still use it for a great many things, but at least on my end, there\u0027s something definitely hinky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor future reference, I figured this out.

I also noticed that when this happens, the slideout drawer for mechjeb has a lot fewer windows available (But the autopilot and maneuver planner were still available through blizzty\u0027s toolbar).

But back in build 438, they were available at the start, when they shouldn\u0027t have been.
