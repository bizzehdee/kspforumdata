You\u0027d be better off with a quality 400w or 450w PSU. People tend to recommend oversized PSUs partly because \u0022you might want SLI one day. The thing is in SLI will suck 60% of the time - every time. For example if you bought a gtx 460 two years ago and want to add another one because of the new battlefield - you\u0027ll be stuck with the 1gb version and that will fail pretty hard.
