The previous mathematicians have been promoted to administrators who are now in charge of hiring mathematicians using the same tried and true method that got them promoted. So, basically I\u0027ve started experimenting with the Delta-V equation. I had done it once long ago just to have done it, but it took some more guesswork to figure out what order to be plugging in the numbers again. Also, after the Windows 10 update I can\u0027t find the the \u0022ln\u0022 function on the stock calculator, but I just used google\u0027s calculator instead. Anyway, I am reasonably confident that I did it correctly and the CM has enough to transit to the Mun, establish orbit, and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis morning I finished up my attempt at building an Apollo style mission. I had done one once long ago where the lander launched already docked to the top of the CM. This is the first one I\u0027ve built where I have to dock them together after the launch and before the Munar transit. However, unlike the actual Apollo missions, I don\u0027t plan on leaving a landing stage on the Munar surface. I have built it in the hopes that it can be used for multiple landings to get Science! I don\u0027t think it has enough fuel on board the lander to do it more than twice (and even that is extremely iffy especially given my agency\u0027s history with fuel planning). Either way, there are docking ports so I may send up a refueler. I\u0027m not sure if it is cheaper/easier to send up a refueler or if it will be cheaper to return the CM and send up a duplicate craft. I still have research to do in that regard. I set my custom settings too easy since this was my first \u0022career\u0022 mode since 1.0 launched, so it probably doesn\u0027t matter much. Anyway, since my space agency is built on the concept of \u0022Launch first, answer difficult questions later,\u0022 I have that ship in orbit already. The launch stage performed well, so I am keeping the leftovers around to start the Munar transit. I\u0027ll take care of the space junk at a later time. I have a cheap ship designed for that purpose. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t have time today to do the rest of that mission so the Original Three (is there some name that the forums like to refer to the collective of Bill, Bob, and Jeb?) will have to wait in orbit for a day or so.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-16T18:11:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2015 06:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gods315Pawn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T18:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gods315Pawn\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gods315Pawn\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy second one safely made it, but by the time I had gotten a second rescue craft to reach the Mun Isaalla\u0027s position had been engulfed in darkness.

The previous mathematicians have been promoted to administrators who are now in charge of hiring mathematicians using the same tried and true method that got them promoted. So, basically I\u0027ve started experimenting with the Delta-V equation. I had done it once long ago just to have done it, but it took some more guesswork to figure out what order to be plugging in the numbers again. Also, after the Windows 10 update I can\u0027t find the the \u0022ln\u0022 function on the stock calculator, but I just used google\u0027s calculator instead. Anyway, I am reasonably confident that I did it correctly and the CM has enough to transit to the Mun, establish orbit, and return.\u003Cp\u003EThis morning I finished up my attempt at building an Apollo style mission. I had done one once long ago where the lander launched already docked to the top of the CM. This is the first one I\u0027ve built where I have to dock them together after the launch and before the Munar transit. However, unlike the actual Apollo missions, I don\u0027t plan on leaving a landing stage on the Munar surface. I have built it in the hopes that it can be used for multiple landings to get Science! I don\u0027t think it has enough fuel on board the lander to do it more than twice (and even that is extremely iffy especially given my agency\u0027s history with fuel planning). Either way, there are docking ports so I may send up a refueler. I\u0027m not sure if it is cheaper/easier to send up a refueler or if it will be cheaper to return the CM and send up a duplicate craft. I still have research to do in that regard. I set my custom settings too easy since this was my first \u0022career\u0022 mode since 1.0 launched, so it probably doesn\u0027t matter much. Anyway, since my space agency is built on the concept of \u0022Launch first, answer difficult questions later,\u0022 I have that ship in orbit already. The launch stage performed well, so I am keeping the leftovers around to start the Munar transit. I\u0027ll take care of the space junk at a later time. I have a cheap ship designed for that purpose. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t have time today to do the rest of that mission so the Original Three (is there some name that the forums like to refer to the collective of Bill, Bob, and Jeb?) will have to wait in orbit for a day or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re called Orangesuits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I tried to record for ScratchTube (like youtube but on the scratch programming site and it\u0027s just me talking, not actual video).

I scrapped the spaceplane idea and I\u0027m just going to put a command pod with a mk1 lander can w/ tourist on top of a big booster with some fleas attached to it or a flea second stage to go suborbital or something. maybe just a lf second stage with a wee bit of fuel.

That\u0027s why it takes me so long to build a good rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I fixed *everything* and took off again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...At least it\u0027s only four nuclear engines which don\u0027t work this time...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i445.photobucket.com/albums/qq176/Vermil_01/screenshot2606_1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot2606_1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mat2ch","CreatedById":139755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T21:51:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was a pretty long day, ehm, decade at my Space Center...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI visited Moho, Dres and Eeloo today. I\u0027m not sure what was the toughest one. I always had to bring \u0026gt;2500 m/s dV for an orbit around them. Am I doing it wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was to finish all the \u0022Explore X\u0022 contracts that were left, since I\u0027ve never been there before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now I\u0027m a bit depressed, since that\u0027s it. Sure I can visit the Mohole but not with the stock engines. The transfers took long. For Eeloo over two years in game. And timewarp is not fast enough to make it a pleasent ride, you actually can feel how long it takes to get there. This made me think a bit about human space exploration. Space is big, really, really big. And empty as well. Either you can travel very fast or you\u0027re going to be years and years stuck in a tiny capsule with not much to do to get to other planets. New Horizons took around 9 years to reach Pluto and it was a fly by mission, not the kind you you would do if you want to get to an orbit. So, if we going to explore space, we need much faster ways to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI, for myself, will now use Hyperedit to get into orbits or use a Alcubiere drive mod... it\u0027s a game after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, btw: Are there any other non-procederal missions after I visited Eeloo and is there a list somewhere?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
