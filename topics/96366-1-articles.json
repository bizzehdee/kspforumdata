Built a B2 spirit yesterday, which is a miserable job, considering you only have triangles and rectangles to make it. Anyways, it is finished, with a mass of 12.4 t, and with an excellent TWR of 3.6. Problem is, when I put it on the runway to fly it, I can\u0027t get it to speed up much more that 1 or 2 m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r4N9KCK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r4N9KCK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NpONcOq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NpONcOq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gdi0yJm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gdi0yJm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENOTE: THE MECHJEB MODULE IS ONLY THERE FOR TWR AND DELTA V STATS.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E I\u0027m not \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E bad with spaceplanes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. What do you guys think? Is it the flat exhaust ports that are causing the problem? I think the landing gear are aligned properly. I really hope it isn\u0027t those ports. Those took so much work. That B2 bomber is so hard to model in KSP.
