The US space shuttle(s) were upgraded numerous time without changing \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emuch in their design or shape at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically my idea was to create optional upgrades that allow you to improve certain parts or other things like Kerbal EVA fuel efficiency or increase the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example when you finally figured out to develop mainsail engines with the power of a small nation who says you can\u0027t use your new knowledge to make a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebetter jet-pack? if Eva jet-packs are supposed to use common mono-fuel soon then you\u0027d also be able to accommodate for higher fuel consumption till efficiency \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis improved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if you develop improved batteries you could upgrade your command modules with a higher energy storage etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPs: Don\u0027t fireball me for the examples , they are just that, examples ;3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not talking about unrealistically huge upgrades or stuff like that, but it would allow a new layer of customization and depth :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it would be hard as a mod. But what could work is some kind of script that takes the bonuses from an upgrade and applies it on top of the original \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.CFG files attributes and uses the increased value for the part , things like a different fuel could be shown by adding an alternate animation that is used \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einstead of the original exhaust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not very knowledgeable about how Kerbal caches part data.
