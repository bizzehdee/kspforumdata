I answered a bit in chat but it got a bit confused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTACLS - too much detail for detail\u0027s sake. There\u0027s no point having kerbals need Food, Water, and Oxygen when you can just pack the same duration\u0027s supply of all three - the resources might as well be called \u0022Sn\u0022, \u0022ac\u0022, and \u0022ks\u0022. If they actually had some distinct functionality that might be a different matter. TACLS also just has too-low numbers; a kerbal needs roughly 0.4kg supply per Kerbin day, so (unless I have made some hilarious arithmetic error) this means a Mk I Command Pod and kerbal needs the pod\u0027s weight again in supplies for a five (kerbal) year mission. This is not a hard requirement to satisfy so TACLS becomes another annoying thing to forget but not a serious issue that needs planning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUSILS I use now. I appreciate the way it\u0027s simple for short missions and complex for long ones - with other LS mods if a month\u0027s mission wants a 10kg tank of supplies, a ten-month mission wants a 100kg tank of supplies and you\u0027re just doing the same thing with bigger numbers. Partly this is because of the range of recycler and agroponics options (albeit most of them do come down to saying, well, this recycler weighs X kg and saves Y g consumption every day so it breaks even in this much time) but mostly because of the habitation mechanic which, while it can be gamed very easily, if you don\u0027t game it does really add a new mechanic to worry about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUSILS does have the arguable downside that it pulls you into the orbit of the rest of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E mod constellation, but apart from the enormous horde of WOLF parts cluttering up the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, I can live with that.

Everything was going smoothly until one day I completed a contract where I had to rescue a Kerbal stuck a utility module (provided by stock alike station parts) in low Kerben orbit. There was a minor bug that made the utility module spawn without life support so the stranded Kerbal without was instantly turned into a tourist. Since I only needed to rescue them, this was fine. But once I completed the mission, I pressed the recovery button, and I was met with a message saying the recovery has been requested. I thought this was a part of the mod, so I tried to go back to the space center, but that button didn\u2019t work either. In fact, every button no longer worked. I terminated the game and loaded it back up. It put me back in the Space Center but once again, none of the buttons worked. I could only enter the research building and that was it, I couldn\u2019t even exit the building. I tried opening the console to see if there was an explanation there but due to my lack of programing knowledge, I didn\u2019t really understand anything. When KSP is in this broken state, and I try to press the quit to main menu button I get the error in the console \u201Cobject reference not set to an instance of object\u201D. I know everything I just described is IFILS\u2019s fault since everything goes back to normal when I remove it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought all those issues might have been due to how long I have had that career save for. Seeing how I need to return to college soon where my only way to game is a steam deck, I decided to start a new career mode save on my steam deck. Due to my lack of understanding of how Linux works I couldn\u2019t figure out how to install \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and just copied my mod files from my window desktop to my steam deck. Everything was going fine on this new save. I did have a minor bug where sometimes when a kerbal goes on EVA it causes the craft to spin faster and faster until it gets torn to pieces. But one day I asked Valentina to go on an EVA. Before I could let go of the craft to prevent the spinning glitch, she gets flung off the craft and disappears. I get informed that she became a tourist due to a lack of life support and I\u2019m back to where I was in the last paragraph all the buttons no longer work and when I press quit to main menu, the console says, \u201Cobject reference not set to an instance of object\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point my basic understanding of this glitch is that when I create a new save, a timer starts. Once the timer hits zero all my buttons will break, which I will find out the next time I try to exit the game. Knowing this, I have started a science mode save on my steam deck and everything has been fine so far. The only bug I ran into is that when I try to take Valentina on an EVA, she instantly becomes a tourist because she doesn\u2019t take any life support with her. I took Jeb out for an EVA (on the same mission) and he did not have this problem. Also, later in the mission Val\u2019s parachute and EVA pack disappeared from her inventory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m assuming this is just a \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;\u0022\u003Eseries\u003C/span\u003E of terrible bugs that will get fixed in the future, but can anyone tell me how to mitigate them or even why they are happening in the first place?
