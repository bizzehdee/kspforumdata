This will be more fun since we will have to find the item, and there is something to find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) instead of telling us to do a temperature scan at X location, and awarding 4 science for doing so, why not have the contract scan the science logs (before the contract is spawned), find an experiment that hasnt been done in X location/biome, and tell us to do it? We will then earn science from doing the science, and not from completing the contract. Plus, it is a good way to ensure we get every ounce of science, without having to manually scan the science archives ourselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T02:14:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 02:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
