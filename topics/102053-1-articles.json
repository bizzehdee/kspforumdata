Saxxy here. Ever since watching the movie \u0022Interstellar,\u0022 I am becoming an increasing addict over the epic sci-fi film, which is why, I am going to make a KSP-analogous story of Interstellar.\n\nHere is the preview plot that I put down for a future story:\n\nIn the Kerbal year 2077, around thirty years after the Kraken had invaded Earth, invasive Micro-organism from the Kraken had already polluted Kerbin\u0027s lakes and waters, and that they are slowly eating away the Nitrogen and Oxygen in the atmosphere on a scale unforeseen throughout the centuries. In a desperate attempt to save Kerbal kind, a group of explorers set off for a foreign solar system, and in this mission, the fate of Kerbalkind is on a string.\n\nI am planning to base this story off the KSP Endurance mod and the Working Multiple Star Systems Mod. The links are listed below:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99841-WIP-Endurance-(from-Interstellar)-0-3-1-Ranger!-IVAs!-Nearly-done-now](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99841-WIP-Endurance-%28from-Interstellar%29-0-3-1-Ranger!-IVAs!-Nearly-done-now)\n\n[http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/226201-working-multiple-star-systems](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/226201-working-multiple-star-systems)\n\nDoes anyone else have any suggestions for this proposed story? Once I have formulated a proper story, this page will be replaced."}]}
