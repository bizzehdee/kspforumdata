Saxxy here. Ever since watching the movie \u0022Interstellar,\u0022 I am becoming an increasing addict over the epic sci-fi film, which is why, I am going to make a KSP-analogous story of Interstellar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the preview plot that I put down for a future story:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Kerbal year 2077, around thirty years after the Kraken had invaded Earth, invasive Micro-organism from the Kraken had already polluted Kerbin\u0027s lakes and waters, and that they are slowly eating away the Nitrogen and Oxygen in the atmosphere on a scale unforeseen throughout the centuries. In a desperate attempt to save Kerbal kind, a group of explorers set off for a foreign solar system, and in this mission, the fate of Kerbalkind is on a string.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am planning to base this story off the KSP Endurance mod and the Working Multiple Star Systems Mod.
