Tripod gear puts the feet too far apart, and too close to your centerline, making you prone to tipping over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECancelling lateral translation just before landing takes some doing, but I\u0027ve found a technique that works for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to zero out your lateral speed before you get to 1-2km above the munar surface. You\u0027ll still have some, but it won\u0027t become apparent until your sink rate gets lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClose to hover speed, any remaining horizontal speed will have an alarmingly pronounced effect on your velocity vector. Additionally, it\u0027s hard to perfectly center your nose on the zenith dot of the ball, so simple hover-thrusting is going to introduce some lateral component too. The trick is in knowing how to deal with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here you are: slowing to a touchdown with your shadow in view, and your VV (velocity vector) is drifting away from the zenith dot. How do you control it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really have a name for it, but I will dub it the \u0022Finger/Marble Maneuver\u0022. Think of that VV as a marble. Think of which direction you\u0027d have to reach your finger to pull that marble back onto the center of the ball. Mentally draw a line out from the center through that marble, and tilt your thrust vector very gently in that direction. It\u0027s not necessary to tilt all the way onto the VV marker, just a few degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch as the VV slowly begins to return to the center, as the new thrust vector slowly eats away at it. If it begins to wiggle around to another heading, adjust the angle of your thrust vector. Use small motions and don\u0027t overcorrect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t think you can get the VV centered by touchdown, reorient your ship to pure vertical and thrust enough to climb a bit. This will give you more time to cancel out your lateral drift with this method. But wait until you\u0027re descending again to resume finger/marble-ing, as everything would be reversed while climbing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found having an ASAS locked while my ship is pure vertical to be very handy. While it is still engaged, I can tilt my thrust vector a couple of degrees, but when I release the rotation key the ship returns to vertical, like a spring. This makes the finger/marble method a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps. I\u0027m planning to make a tutorial video on this very thing, but I can\u0027t resist a cry for help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS Also realize that even a tiny amount of lateral speed is going to appear huge when you are in a perfect hover. Don\u0027t let that freak you out, it\u0027s just math going nonlinear. More important is how much slip you have at around 1-4m/sec.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to see an example of this method in practice, I refer you to this point in my mun landing video, at 19m44s: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/5wlhz7s4J78?t=19m44s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/5wlhz7s4J78?t=19m44s\u003C/a\u003E I do a big finger/marble maneuver at 20m10s to assume pure vertical flight, and a bunch of wiggling just before touchdown to cancel the last of my lateral drift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I should mention I generally don\u0027t use RCS for landing, though it could be very handy.
