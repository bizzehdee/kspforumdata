It\u0027s actually much more stable than OPM 1.6.5 is on 1.0\u002B and only misses a few features that make it not shiny enough for a true release. Wal has a bug that makes its terrain black (Kopernicus devs are trying to fix it) and Ovok is temporary not as supersmooth as it usually is (a fix is also in the works). All-in-all I recommend getting this beta when it comes out and replacing 1.6.5 with it. That version barely works on 1.0 (kind of regret calling it compatible), while the 1.7 beta does work. Other major features you can expect in the beta (and thus in the release version 1.7 too):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Dropped Kittopia and DDSLoader. The latter was made obsolete with 1.0 and the former is no longer necessary due to the awesomeness of the new Kopernicus devs. Less third party mods means more stability and also lead to the next item on the list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-All the bugs in Known Bugs are solved. This includes the recovery values being off on Kerbin, the contract disappearance bug and the translucent border obscuring rings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A moon for Wal called Tal (more info spread among the pages of this thread)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Added FinalFrontier ribbons to the Urlum moons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Added biomes and science blurbs to the Urlum moons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from the things mentioned above, OPM\u0027s planets and moons are moving very close to stock-like quality in terms of gameplay stability.
