I have had the CTD that occurs after playing for several hours, but no other issues until today. Now, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m having a game breaking issue that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not even sure how to begin to troubleshoot. Hope some of you have some suggestions\n\nThis afternoon I started having a strange visual bug. In the VAB and SPH parts started puffing smoke effects as if they were engines constantly shifting from full throttle to off and back. If it is an engine part, then they have full throttle animation with exhaust graphics. Additionally, all staging displays disappeared. Shifting to the Launchpad caused the problem to cease and staging could be adjusted. But reverting to the VAB renewed the issue.\n\nIn the debug menu I get this exception whenever I add a part:\n\n[Exception]: XmlException: Document element did not appear. file:///C:/Users/Ed/Desktop/KSP 1.03/Kerbal Space Program/GameData/TweakScale/plugins/PluginData/Scale/config.xml Line 1, position 1.\n\nAnyone have any ideas?\n\nCurrent System:\n\nWindows 8.1\n\ni7 3.4 GHz 3770 CPU\n\n12 Gb RAM\n\nGeForce GT630\n\nMods in use (All up to date):\n\nChatterer\n\nAggressive Texture Compression\n\nCrowd Sourced Science\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator\n\nFinal Frontier\n\nMechJeb\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement\n\nModule Manager\n\nScanSat\n\nTweakScale\n\nUniversal Storage\n\nKIS \u0026 KAS (Latest Version but not updated to 1.04)\n\nLink to screenshot below:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/xbi8vy8llcxr792/VAB%20screenshot.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xbi8vy8llcxr792/VAB%20screenshot.png?dl=0)\n\nGoblin\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T23:14:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by scipiosgoblin**\n  \nSolution found"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T22:36:10Z","Content":"I would suspect a problem with TweakScale.
