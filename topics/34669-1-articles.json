I keep my m/s to ~175, @10k I execute my first turn to about 45 degrees, when my apo is ~100k I make my second turn and burn until I have a nicely circularized orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all of this I usually end up with about 10-20% fuel remaining in my last stage, usually with a weaker engine (to get a good fuel/thrust ratio), and an imperfect orbit to boot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny bright ideas from more experienced heads?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CCKinnison","CreatedById":71439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T06:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake the second turn earlier...

You\u0027ll see that getting to orbit with 20% of your original fuel really isn\u0027t bad. But if you want to go farther, there are several things you can do. 1) Add fuel. This is the worst method, since it also increases mass and therefore reduces efficiency. It may take you farther, or it may actually reduce your range. 2) Reduce the mass of that ship so that the same fuel takes you farther. This is a much better choice, as it can ONLY increase efficiency and range. However, you eventually reach a limit beyond which you\u0027d have to sacrifice mission-critical parts.
