Move the pilot over to the pod being rescued so the SAS can be used and with excessive SAS it should be ok if you don\u0027t get the pod exactly center on. Sometime like that should work.\n\nNo heat shield is not a problem. while you are in a high Kerbin orbit (having just left Minmus\u0027s SOI) adjust your orbit to set the Pe to about 32km (you\u0027ll probably need to do a couple trial runs to find the right Pe) and you should be ok without a heat-shield.

This includes when you dock with another pod, whether with a docking port or the klaw. Each command pod defaults to priority \u002210\u0022 and if the user has not changed any of the command pods to a higher priority, it \u0022arbitrarily\u0022 chooses which pod will take control. This is likely why, after docking with the \u0022debris\u0022 which happened to also be a command pod, the debris became the control point. Of course your engine thrust is not aligned with the orientation of the command pod in the klaw and the result is what you experienced.\n\nRight-click on the original command pod (the rescue ship) and set the control priority to something higher than 10 and you should at least have control of the vessel as you did before attaching to the stranded vessel.\n\nAs far placing items in a cargo bay to recover them, I have no experience, so I can\u0027t be of any help with that part of your problem... sorry!\n\nGood luck!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-27T15:11:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2021 03:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Wobbly Av8r**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-27T18:05:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 15 hours ago, JoshuaKSP said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I safely put in inside an MK3 cargo bay, but when I leave orbit, the debris (crew room) stays behind???\n\u003E \n\nWhen you warp each craft is put \u0027on rails\u0027 in it\u0027s orbit, and physics interaction are not calculated.
